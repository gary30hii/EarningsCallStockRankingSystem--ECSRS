In the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong momentum in our Residential business, and year-over-year improvement in Commercial and Refrigeration. Overall, for the company, revenue was up 3% and held a new fourth quarter high of $914 million. GAAP operating income was a $139 million compared to a $192 million in the prior year quarter that included $93 million net gain from insurance recoveries. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $2.91 compared to $2.92 in the prior year quarter that included $93 million of insurance benefit I mentioned in a $39 million pre-tax pension settlement. In addition, to record fourth quarter revenue, the company set new fourth quarter highs for total segment profit and margin and adjusted EPS from continuing operations. As reported, total segment profit was a fourth quarter record a $139 million up 5% from the prior year quarter that included $25 million of insurance recovery. Total segment margin was a fourth quarter record 15.2% up 10 basis points. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations rose 18% to fourth quarter record of $2.89. From an operating perspective, excluding the $25 million of insurance benefit in the prior year quarter, total segment profit was up 29% and segment margin expanded 300 basis points. Looking at our business segments for the fourth quarter. Residential set new fourth quarter records for revenue, profit and margin. Residential revenue was up 11% on double-digit growth in both replacement and new construction business. Residential indoor air quality revenue was up more than 30% in the quarter. Segment profit rose 18% and segment margin expanded a 130 basis points to 20.9%. From an operational perspective, adjusting for the $25 million of insurance benefit in the prior year quarter, residential profit rose 58% and margin expanded 630 basis points. In Commercial, fourth quarter revenue was down 13% and profit was down 11%. Segment margin expanded 40 basis points to a fourth quarter record 19.4%. We continue to see year-over-year improvement in business in both replacement and new construction as well as in national accounts in the regional and local business. Commercial equipment revenue overall was down mid-teens in the quarter, within this, replacement revenue was down low single-digits in constant currency, with plan replacement down high single-digits and emergency replacement up low double-digits. New construction revenue was down mid-20s percentage. Breaking out revenue another way, regional and local business revenue was down low double-digits. National accounts equipment revenue was down mid-teens. On the service side, Lennox National Accounts Service revenue was down high single-digits. Some highlights to mention for Commercial. Our team added six new national account equipment customers in the quarter to bring the total to 32 for the year. As small today, we're seeing fast indoor air quality revenue growth led by our new building better air initiative. And in the first quarter, we're on track with the launch of our new Model L Rooftop unit as we continue to lead the field in energy efficiency. The Model L features variable speed technology and an all-new advanced control system. We're seeing high customer interest in this industry leading product for 2021. Overall, Commercial backlog is up double-digits. In Refrigeration, for the fourth quarter revenue was up 7% as reported, and up 3% at constant currency. North America revenue was up low single-digits. Europe Refrigeration revenue was up mid-single-digits as reported and low single-digits at constant currency. Europe HVAC revenue was up mid-teens as reported and up high single-digits at constant currency. Refrigeration segment profit declined 28% and margin contracted to 360 basis points to 7.5% on the timing of expenses in the quarter and unfavorable mix of the strong growth in Europe HVAC. Currently, Refrigeration backlog is up double-digits led by North America and we're seeing strong order flow. We expect segment margin to be up year-over-year starting in the first quarter and be up for the full year in 2021. For the company overall in 2021, we are reiterating guidance. We expect revenue growth of 48% this year and GAAP and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $10.55 to $11.15 for the full year. While there's an economic and market uncertainty, momentum continues for the company we're well positioned for year of strong growth and profitability. Given the outlook and the company's strong balance sheet and cash generation, we are restarting our stock purchase program in 2021 and plan to buy back 400 million this year. I'll now turn it over to Joe.\nJoe Reitmeier: Thank you, Todd. And good morning, everyone. Let me start with a quick summary of our full year 2020 for the company, and then the financial details on the business segments for the quarter and full year. Overall, for the company, revenue for 2020 was $3.63 billion down 5% on a GAAP basis and down 4% on adjusted basis, excluding the impact from the divestitures in the prior year. Foreign Exchange was neutral to revenue. GAAP operating income was $479 million compared to $657 million in the prior year. That included a $179 million net gain from insurance recoveries. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $9.26 compared to $10.38 in the prior year; that included the $179 million insurance benefit and $99 million in pre-tax pension settlements. Total adjusted segment profit for the full year was $507 million compared to $610 million in the prior year. That included a $99 million of insurance recovery. Total adjusted segment margin was 13.9% for the year, compared to 16.2% in the prior year with the insurance benefit. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $9.94 compared to $11.19 in the prior year with the insurance benefit and pension settlements. From an operational perspective, excluding the $99 million of insurance benefit in the prior year. Total segment profit was down 1% and total segment margin was up 40 basis points. Now turning to the business segments for the quarter and the year. In the fourth quarter, revenue from residential heating and cooling was a fourth quarter record $553 million up 11%. Volume was up 10%, price was up 1% and mix was flat with foreign exchange neutral to revenue. Residential profit was a fourth quarter record $116 million up 18%. Segment margin was a fourth quarter record 20.9% up 130 basis points. And as Todd mentioned, operationally profit was up 58% and margin expanded 630 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price, lower material and other product costs, higher factory productivity and lower SG&A. Partial offsets included $25 million of non-recurring insurance proceeds in the prior quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher tariff rate distribution and warranty. For the full year, Residential segment revenue was a record $2.36 billion up 3%. Volume was up 2%. Combined price and mix was up 1% with both up. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Residential profit was $429 million down 8% from the prior year that had the $99 million from insurance recovery. Segment margin was 18.1% down 220 basis points as reported. Operationally, excluding the insurance recovery in the prior year, segment profit was up 17% and margin expanded 210 basis points. Now turning to our commercial heating and cooling business.

Segment margin was 7.5% down 360 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, unfavorable mix, higher distribution, warranty and other product costs and the timing of SG&A expenses. Partial offsets included higher volume, favorable price and lower material costs. For the full year, Refrigeration revenue was $472 million down 12%. Volume was down 14%. Price was up 1% and mix was flat. Foreign exchange had a favorable 1% impact. Segment profit was $33 million down 47% and segment profit margin was 7% down 470 basis points. Regarding special items in the fourth quarter, the company had net after tax gain of $800,000 that included a net gain of $3.4 million from insurance recoveries related to damage at the company's manufacturing facility in Iowa, a benefit of $2.3 million related to environmental liabilities, a benefit of $1.5 million for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. For charges, we had $2.7 million for asbestos-related litigation, $1.5 million for special product quality adjustments, $1.4 million for personal protective equipment and facility deep cleaning expenses incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a net charge of $800,000 in total for various other items. Now, looking at special items for the full year, the company had net after tax charges of $26 million, and they included a charge of $8.5 million for other tax items, $8.4 million for restructuring activities, $6.2 million for personal protective equipment and facility deep cleaning expenses incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, $4.2 million for asbestos-related litigation, a net loss of $2.3 million related to damage the company's manufacturing facility in Iowa, a net charge of $600,000 in total for various other items, and a benefit of $4.2 million for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. Corporate expenses were $30 million in the fourth quarter and $92 million for the full year. Overall, SG&A was $143 million for the fourth quarter or 15.7% of revenue down from 16.3% in the prior quarter. For 2020, overall, SG&A was $556 million or 15.3% of revenue down from 15.4% on an adjusted basis in the prior year. For 2020, the company had cash from operations of $612 million compared to $396 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were approximately $78 million for the full year compared to $106 million in the prior year. And proceeds for damaged property and disposal of property were $1 million, compared to $81 million in the prior year. Free cash flow was $535 million for the year compared to $371 million in the prior year. In 2020, the company paid $118 million in dividends and repurchased $100 million of company stock. Total debt was $981 million at the end of the fourth quarter. And we ended the year with a debt-to-EBIT ratio of 1.7. And cash and cash equivalents were $124 million at the end of the year. Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I'll review our outlook for 2021. Our underlying market assumptions for the year remain the same. We expect industry to see mid-single-digit shipments growth in Residential, Commercial Unitary and Refrigeration markets in North America. The company's guidance for 2021 remains the same as we presented at the December Investment Community meeting. Our guidance for 2021 revenue growth is 4% to 8% with neutral foreign exchange impact. We still expect GAAP and adjusted EPS from continuing operations in a range of $10.55 to $11.15 with about half of the earnings in the first half of the year and half in the second half of the year. Let me now run through other key points on our guidance assumptions and the puts and takes for 2021, all of which are unchanged. We expect the benefit of $50 million in price for the year. We expect the benefit of $25 million from sourcing and engineering lead cost reductions and a $20 million benefit from factory productivity. We are guiding for residential mix being neutral and we think that foreign exchange will be neutral as well. For the headwinds in 2021, we expect a $30 million headwind from commodities. Freight is expected to be a $5 million headwind, we will be at a more normal run rate with distribution investments this year with 30 new Lennox stores planned. Tariffs are expected to be a $5 million headwind, we are planning for SG&A to be up approximately 7% for the year or headwind of about $45 million. Within SG&A, we'll be making investments in R&D and IT for continued innovation in leadership and products, control, e-commerce, factory automation, and productivity. A few other guidance points, corporate expenses are targeted at $90 million. Net interest in pension expense is expected to be approximately $35 million. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% on an adjusted basis for the full year. We are planning capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million this year, about $30 million of which are for the third plant at our campus in Mexico. We expect construction to be completed by the end of 2021 and have the plant fully operational by mid-2022, we expect nearly $10 million in annual savings from the third plant. Free cash flow is targeted $325 million, as we reinflate working capital to support strong growth. And over the long term, we expect free cash flow to approximate net income on average. And finally, we expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between $37 million to $38 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase $400 million of stock this year. And with that, John, let's now go to Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Morning Jeff.\nJeff Hammond: Hey, Todd, good to see the execution was much better than your football team.\nTodd Bluedorn: I think, we're both watching other people's teams this weekend.\nJeff Hammond: Yes, yes. Just I want to understand on resi margins, just the strength there. I mean, it was considerably higher, and just what were the big drivers, and if there was any real impact, as you kind of produce more to kind of restock and if that continues into 1Q?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yeah, I mean, I read your pre note, yes, the short answer is there was some benefit from absorption as we continue to produce in fourth quarter for the demand rolling into 2021. But even more important than that, as the drivers of the margin were the aggressive SG&A costs that the team took out early in the year, we haven't added back a lot of them. And so, we had great SG&A leverage. Also, we had very strong quarter material costs, and just in the factories themselves, even above absorption some of the productivity initiatives really kicked in second half of the year and we saw the benefits so, absorption helped. And it will help as you suggest as we roll in the next year. But there was benefits across, there was strong performance across the board and resi.\nJeff Hammond: Okay, and then maybe switching over to commercial can you just did book-to-bill - was book-to-bill positive in 4Q? Did you see order acceleration? When do you think that backlog starts to flow out in sales growth? Thanks.\nTodd Bluedorn: We're seeing sales growth in first quarter so far. I mean, it's starting to accelerate in first quarter. Orders have taken a bit of a pause during the first three weeks in January, which I think is normal as you go into a new year. That's not unusual for us. And I think there's a little bit of uncertainty out there in the commercial marketplace. But we're set up for a nice quarter in Q1 and the backlogs starting to build for second quarter and balance of the year.\nJeff Hammond: Okay, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe, hey, just the first question on the incremental margins. So just wanted to sort of check on your conviction and being able to get that 30% incremental for the year across the company. At any segment color you provide I suppose, particularly in refrigeration, how should we think about operating leverage there this year?\nTodd Bluedorn: The good news for anyone who's ever worked in a large corporation, the good news after having a tough year is the next year you have great comps. And I think that's true in our Refrigeration business, so I think we'll have positive news in Refrigeration. Overall, for the corporation, we guided 30% incrementals. We're still feeling pretty good about that. We're going to have price of $50 million that'll offset the commodity headwind of $30 million, freight and tariff headwind each of $5 million to $40 million of costs, and those three buckets offset with price, and the MCR and additional volume. So, as we talked about in December, we feel pretty good about the 30% incremental.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you. And then, maybe just following up on the commercial side. If you could just give any color around sort of different verticals, that you're seeing, any update as well on the sort of competitive landscape in commercial, and how quickly we can expect revenue to turn positive? Is it Q2 or perhaps earlier, in terms of year-on-year?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yeah, I understand. I'm not going to answer that last part. We said we have double-digit backlog going into the year, where we saw the pickup in order rates in fourth quarter where and planned replacement as large national account customers got more comfortable on placing orders. And I also think some of them had capital at the end of the year that they didn't spend because of uncertainty earlier in the year. And so, we had - we didn't deliver those units, but we booked those business and that will flow into the first half of this year. Emergency replacement was up in fourth quarter, so that continues to flow. I think the area that's weakest right now, quite frankly, continues weak is commercial new construction, given the uncertainty that still exists around the recovery from COVID.\nJulian Mitchell: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, John.\nJohn Walsh: Question around your opportunity as you see it in the K-12 vertical. We're starting to hear people talk about some of these executive actions that President Biden took, trying to get students and teachers back into schools healthily and quickly in his first 100 days. Are you seeing any of that in your commercial business?\nTodd Bluedorn: The schools tend to move relatively slow. So, from the time they're sort of a mandate on top until the time you see the revenue flow through the business takes time. We have a very strong K Through12 program, if you will. We have dedicated salespeople just for that vertical, our indoor air quality product serves that market, our high efficiency product serves that market. So, we're in lots of dialogues with people, but I don't think there's been a light switch turned on that market.\nJohn Walsh: Got you. And then, I guess, maybe not necessarily surprising. A bunch of the detailed items in the guidance walk didn't change. But I guess I'm a little bit surprised on the commodity costs, still in line with the December outlook, given the move in steel, maybe you could just remind us, I know you have a hedging program on copper, I thought you bought a little bit more spot steel, but maybe can you just help us understand that a little bit better?\nTodd Bluedorn: Well, I'll give you the specific answer and then I'll directly answer the broader question of why then change it narrowly. We buy steel a couple different ways. We have some fixed contracts. We have some contracts that are tied to scrap. And then majority of it is we buy from the mills based on CRU pricing the prior quarter. When you - so when we're quote unquote predicting copper and aluminum, we have a large hedge already in our books. And so, we have a pretty good view what we're going to have. For steel, we have to sort of predict what's going to happen. Now as the answer, in December, we were depending I guess what side of the trade you were on, we are either bearish or bullish but we assumed steel was going to go up and we rolled that into our guide. And so, it's plus or minus commodities is still a $30 million headwind.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Good morning. Thanks, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hi, Gautam. How are you?\nGautam Khanna: Doing well, thank you, I was curious, just can you speak to any changes in the competitive dynamics, we'd heard that Daikin's Goodman facility was, there was some COVID outbreaks and then you saw kind of the big channel refill in resi in Q4. I'm just curious, like, any sort of things to think about year-over-year as we kind of comp the weirdness of 2020 in resi competitively?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yeah, I mean, I think the most important thing is what I spent a ton of time talking about in December, which is, the broader your - the larger your independent distribution network is the more our belief is that you pulled volume from 2021 and to 2020, and that distributors not only were reloading for inventory that was down, but sort of the scarcity mindset was taking over and they were trying to make sure they had lots of inventory in case OEMs ran into production issues. And so our sense is people with independent distribution have inflated sales numbers in fourth quarter and that will bleed off as you go through the year compared to us, which is, we delivered in resi up 11% overall. And that we think in fact we know in our Lennox business, which is 80% of our residential, we see demand when the customers buying the unit to a vast large degree. So, I think that's the one thing to model for. And as we talked about with us narrowly, that sort of the timing of EPS or earnings is a little bit different to normal, that we expect about half of our EPS to come in first half and about half of the EPS in second half, which is a little different weighting that what we've had in the past.\nGautam Khanna: That's helpful. And Todd, maybe I know you used to work at Carrier. I'm just curious, have you seen any change in their behavior competitively now that it's an independent company? Anything you can speak to just based on [Indiscernible]\nTodd Bluedorn: No, I think the short answer is no, Carrier has always been a very good competitor and they publicly different things happen and they say different things on the earnings call, but on the ground, it's the same tried and true sales force and strong dealer network. And they've always had good product. And they haven't changed their pricing strategy, they haven't changed, I don't think how they buy components and commodities or sourcing strategies. And they haven't changed their distribution strategy. So, from where we sit, it's very similar to what we have seen in past.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning, Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: So the commentary around the first half versus second half, what is definitely helpful. But, Todd, anything you want to say about calibrating expectations for 1Q based on what you guys have seen like into January?\nTodd Bluedorn: I'll answer the question obliquely. In Residential, we continue to see strong momentum. And in Commercial and Refrigeration as I talked about, backlogs are up double-digits as we ended the year. And so, we're hitting first quarter at a pretty stiff pace, we'll see how the balance of the quarter goes. But we feel pretty good as we start the year.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay, got it. Thanks. And then on the seasonality of free cash flow, how do we think about the quarters in 2021 relative to what you normally see just thinking about how the cadence of working capital used could look throughout the year?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think it'll be more of a normal year where we'll sort of peak and working capital early and then burn it off second half of the year where 2020 was abnormal, that we never sort of reloaded on working capital second half. And so, we outperformed on free cash flow. I think it'll be more of a traditional year. And, again, just to connect some of the dots, so I'll take your question and expand on areas that I want to talk about. Maybe Nicole you didn't directly asked, but I would just sort of underline the free cash flow of $535 million in 2020, which is a record. We're guiding for 325 next year. Over the two-year period, it's about 110% of net income. So, 2020, 2021 over the two-year period, 110% of our adjusted net income which is a pretty strong performance in cash flow over a couple year period.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. And thanks for expanding. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: And we'll go to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. We had a pretty thorough vetting in '21 back in December. So, this is not for me. But I'm curious the 10% growth in residential during 4Q, how does that look by brands, Allied versus Lennox brands?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yeah. Overall, we're up 11%. Our Lennox was up high single digits, and our Allied grew mid-20s. And so, what we saw in our business is what we've been saying others are seeing, which is our independent distribution business. Allied grew much stronger than our Lennox business, but not because they're winning share just, we have distributors who are reloading and quite frankly, with a scarcity mindset trying to pull some volume in.\nNigel Coe: Okay. The [ph] Hardy data, I mean, I'm not sure how accurate that actually is. But the Hardy data showed big pickup in sugar shipments in December. And I'm curious if you saw the same pattern in the announcements with in terms of the sell through to the dealers. It makes sense from the weather perspective I was just curious what you saw?\nTodd Bluedorn: No, I mean, we didn't - I mean, just from a weather perspective, it wasn't so cold in January this year versus last year - December this year versus last year. We saw some pickup in December, but not near the Hardy data. Again, I think you're right that the Hardy data in any given month is suspect. I think directionally over a 12 month rolling data sort of gives you the right area for the number but I think in any given month, it could be a little misleading.\nNigel Coe: Thank you.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, good morning. Can you just maybe clarify the margin kind of color on resi, I think to Julian's question. You mentioned refrigeration will be good. I just didn't catch what you said on resi specifically.\nTodd Bluedorn: I reframed the question. I'm not sure he asked me a question on residential margins.\nSteve Tusa: Sorry, I thought he asked about residential margins. So, you had said overall guide 30% incrementals and positive - but refrigeration would be pretty positive. So, what's kind of the - what's the resi kind of view?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yeah, I think on the round they're all plus or minus 30. So, from a resi view 30, commercial 30. And refrigeration that was could probably be a little bit higher. But that's such a small part of our business, the other two will drive it then what we do on corporate expenses.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And then just lastly, kind of looking out over the next couple of years. I know there's another efficiency regulation coming in. Is there any kind of change to your approach on product development beyond '22? Do you see the industry shifting more towards these kind of hybrid ductless products with the inverters in them beyond that with this new step up in cost on this efficiency regulation? And are you guys - what are you doing to kind of address that vertical that kind of hybrid ductless inverter-based product vertical?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yeah, I mean, the hybrid ductless, again, we can develop whatever product we want. But 80% of the product is replacement. And the ducts are already in the home. And so, the lowest cost solution for the 80% that's add on or replacement is our ducted systems. We are coming out with a 28 seri unit in first quarter that we talked about. We think we have as good or better variable speed technology with our compression partners. And so, we think we're playing right in the sweet spot, which is to have the lowest cost point to have the highest efficiency in the marketplace. And we think with our compression technology, our coil strategy and our Mexican Assembly Facility we're able to do that.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And when you look out to the next couple years, I mean, do you expect prebuy in '22 what's kind of your - what's your latest and greatest on kind of the multiyear view?\nTodd Bluedorn: I don't think there'll be a prebuy in any meaningful way. Again, it always comes down to the fine tuning of the actual details how it's implemented. But the last time we did this, which was a more normal way to do it. You had sort of months to prepare and get it correct. And you don't have this huge step function change, like we did back in, that the industry had back in 2006, 2007. So, I think there may be a bit of prebuy, but not like there's been in the past.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. So, there won't be that much of a change in competitive landscape coming away from this in your mind?\nTodd Bluedorn: No, and again, it's - when we went from 10 to 13, or the industry, I wasn't here, but we went from 10 to 13, that had been the first major jump in a while that really screwed up the premium competitors in retrospect, and a big one it's was Goodman, because all of a sudden differentiation got collapsed. One, I think everybody's understood that and so one of the reasons we come out with 28 seri in 2021 is to prepare to sort of have the high end stretched out for when we have to make the transition. And then the other is, it's a much smaller bite when you're going from 14 to 15, that's as much difference than going from 10 to 13 as a percentage, obviously. So, you just don't have this huge cost shock to the system and sigh shock to the system with the big units back in 2006, 2007. So, I view it as sort of, not quite home [ph], but pretty close to home. And then the other thing that's on the horizon residential regulatory wise is changing refrigerants to lower greenhouse gas emissions. And with the current administration it looks like it's going to be national rather than just a few states. And again, we'll be prepared for that as I think the rest of the industry will.\nSteve Tusa: But that California reg was pushed, right? More or less?\nTodd Bluedorn: California reg was pushed. But it looks like it's going to the Biden administration, our best understanding is it will drive it as a national implementation just not card.\nSteve Tusa: Wow. Okay, got it. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning.\nJoe Ritchie: Maybe just starting off on refrigeration margins, I know you mentioned there was a mix issues in the quarter and some step up in SG&A. Can you guys just maybe parse that out a little further and help quantify some of the impacts this quarter?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yeah, I mean, the two, I gave you were sort of the - are the two rattled off are the two big drivers. It was the fact that we were up in HVAC in Europe and down in our North America refrigeration business had a significant impact on the margins. And then, the other piece was just the timing of costs. And getting to the accounting sort of accrual adjustments and sort of year-over-year differences and fourth quarter took a hit compared to fourth quarter last year. As I think, I mentioned in the script, we expect to have margins up in Q1 in refrigeration and for them to be up full year.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. As you maybe take a look at your backlog in refrigeration and it sounds to me like there's going to be a mixed benefit then in 2021. Are you seeing the North America PCO business growing well versus in Europe at this point?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, cool. And then just - my one final question going back to commercial for a second. On planned replacement, I'm just curious. It seemed like you saw an uptick there in the quarter. I'm just curious, I guess in terms of like getting on-premise access for your services, like, how did things compared today with coronavirus cases surging versus what we saw maybe earlier in 2020?\nTodd Bluedorn: Can you - you broke up a little bit right in here. Can you ask question one more time?\nJoe Ritchie: Sure. No problem. Sorry about that. So, the question is really just around getting on premise access to do your plans replacements today versus what you saw in that?\nTodd Bluedorn: We have no issue. We're able to get on the job site, do what we need to do. Our guys are matched up and commercial customers have no issue in them.\nJoe Ritchie: All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And with no further questions in queue, I'll turn it over to you Mr. Bluedorn for any closing comments.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks to everyone. To wrap up, as I mentioned in Q&A and during the script, momentum continues in first quarter and 2021 is off to a nice start. Lennox team is executing well to capitalize on market growth and share gains. We look forward to a year of strong growth and profitability. Thanks again for everyone for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Todd. And good morning, everyone. Let me start with a quick summary of our full year 2020 for the company, and then the financial details on the business segments for the quarter and full year. Overall, for the company, revenue for 2020 was $3.63 billion down 5% on a GAAP basis and down 4% on adjusted basis, excluding the impact from the divestitures in the prior year. Foreign Exchange was neutral to revenue. GAAP operating income was $479 million compared to $657 million in the prior year. That included a $179 million net gain from insurance recoveries. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $9.26 compared to $10.38 in the prior year; that included the $179 million insurance benefit and $99 million in pre-tax pension settlements. Total adjusted segment profit for the full year was $507 million compared to $610 million in the prior year. That included a $99 million of insurance recovery. Total adjusted segment margin was 13.9% for the year, compared to 16.2% in the prior year with the insurance benefit. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $9.94 compared to $11.19 in the prior year with the insurance benefit and pension settlements. From an operational perspective, excluding the $99 million of insurance benefit in the prior year. Total segment profit was down 1% and total segment margin was up 40 basis points. Now turning to the business segments for the quarter and the year. In the fourth quarter, revenue from residential heating and cooling was a fourth quarter record $553 million up 11%. Volume was up 10%, price was up 1% and mix was flat with foreign exchange neutral to revenue. Residential profit was a fourth quarter record $116 million up 18%. Segment margin was a fourth quarter record 20.9% up 130 basis points. And as Todd mentioned, operationally profit was up 58% and margin expanded 630 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price, lower material and other product costs, higher factory productivity and lower SG&A. Partial offsets included $25 million of non-recurring insurance proceeds in the prior quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher tariff rate distribution and warranty. For the full year, Residential segment revenue was a record $2.36 billion up 3%. Volume was up 2%. Combined price and mix was up 1% with both up. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Residential profit was $429 million down 8% from the prior year that had the $99 million from insurance recovery. Segment margin was 18.1% down 220 basis points as reported. Operationally, excluding the insurance recovery in the prior year, segment profit was up 17% and margin expanded 210 basis points. Now turning to our commercial heating and cooling business. In the fourth quarter, commercial revenue was $226 million down 13%. Volume was down 8%. Price was flat and mix was down 5%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Commercial segment profit was $44 million down 11%. Segment margin was a fourth quarter record 19.4% up 40 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, lower volume, unfavorable mix and higher freight distribution and SG&A. Partial offsets included lower material and other product costs, higher factory productivity, lower warranty and tariff exclusions and refunds due to exclusions. For the full year, Commercial revenue was $801 million down 15%. Volume was down 14%. Price was flat and mix was down 1%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Segment profit was $137 million down 17%. Segment margin was 17.1% down 40 basis points. In Refrigeration, revenue was $135 million up 7%. Volume was up 3%. Price was up 1% and mix was down 1% and foreign exchange had a favorable 4% impact on revenue. Refrigeration segment profit was $10 million in the fourth quarter down 28%. Segment margin was 7.5% down 360 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, unfavorable mix, higher distribution, warranty and other product costs and the timing of SG&A expenses. Partial offsets included higher volume, favorable price and lower material costs. For the full year, Refrigeration revenue was $472 million down 12%. Volume was down 14%. Price was up 1% and mix was flat. Foreign exchange had a favorable 1% impact. Segment profit was $33 million down 47% and segment profit margin was 7% down 470 basis points. Regarding special items in the fourth quarter, the company had net after tax gain of $800,000 that included a net gain of $3.4 million from insurance recoveries related to damage at the company's manufacturing facility in Iowa, a benefit of $2.3 million related to environmental liabilities, a benefit of $1.5 million for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. For charges, we had $2.7 million for asbestos-related litigation, $1.5 million for special product quality adjustments, $1.4 million for personal protective equipment and facility deep cleaning expenses incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a net charge of $800,000 in total for various other items. Now, looking at special items for the full year, the company had net after tax charges of $26 million, and they included a charge of $8.5 million for other tax items, $8.4 million for restructuring activities, $6.2 million for personal protective equipment and facility deep cleaning expenses incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, $4.2 million for asbestos-related litigation, a net loss of $2.3 million related to damage the company's manufacturing facility in Iowa, a net charge of $600,000 in total for various other items, and a benefit of $4.2 million for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. Corporate expenses were $30 million in the fourth quarter and $92 million for the full year. Overall, SG&A was $143 million for the fourth quarter or 15.7% of revenue down from 16.3% in the prior quarter. For 2020, overall, SG&A was $556 million or 15.3% of revenue down from 15.4% on an adjusted basis in the prior year. For 2020, the company had cash from operations of $612 million compared to $396 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were approximately $78 million for the full year compared to $106 million in the prior year. And proceeds for damaged property and disposal of property were $1 million, compared to $81 million in the prior year. Free cash flow was $535 million for the year compared to $371 million in the prior year. In 2020, the company paid $118 million in dividends and repurchased $100 million of company stock. Total debt was $981 million at the end of the fourth quarter. And we ended the year with a debt-to-EBIT ratio of 1.7. And cash and cash equivalents were $124 million at the end of the year. Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I'll review our outlook for 2021. Our underlying market assumptions for the year remain the same. We expect industry to see mid-single-digit shipments growth in Residential, Commercial Unitary and Refrigeration markets in North America. The company's guidance for 2021 remains the same as we presented at the December Investment Community meeting. Our guidance for 2021 revenue growth is 4% to 8% with neutral foreign exchange impact. We still expect GAAP and adjusted EPS from continuing operations in a range of $10.55 to $11.15 with about half of the earnings in the first half of the year and half in the second half of the year. Let me now run through other key points on our guidance assumptions and the puts and takes for 2021, all of which are unchanged. We expect the benefit of $50 million in price for the year. We expect the benefit of $25 million from sourcing and engineering lead cost reductions and a $20 million benefit from factory productivity. We are guiding for residential mix being neutral and we think that foreign exchange will be neutral as well. For the headwinds in 2021, we expect a $30 million headwind from commodities. Freight is expected to be a $5 million headwind, we will be at a more normal run rate with distribution investments this year with 30 new Lennox stores planned. Tariffs are expected to be a $5 million headwind, we are planning for SG&A to be up approximately 7% for the year or headwind of about $45 million. Within SG&A, we'll be making investments in R&D and IT for continued innovation in leadership and products, control, e-commerce, factory automation, and productivity. A few other guidance points, corporate expenses are targeted at $90 million. Net interest in pension expense is expected to be approximately $35 million. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% on an adjusted basis for the full year. We are planning capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million this year, about $30 million of which are for the third plant at our campus in Mexico. We expect construction to be completed by the end of 2021 and have the plant fully operational by mid-2022, we expect nearly $10 million in annual savings from the third plant. Free cash flow is targeted $325 million, as we reinflate working capital to support strong growth. And over the long term, we expect free cash flow to approximate net income on average. And finally, we expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between $37 million to $38 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase $400 million of stock this year. And with that, John, let's now go to Q&A."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. In the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong momentum in our Residential business, and year-over-year improvement in Commercial and Refrigeration. Overall, for the company, revenue was up 3% and held a new fourth quarter high of $914 million. GAAP operating income was a $139 million compared to a $192 million in the prior year quarter that included $93 million net gain from insurance recoveries. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $2.91 compared to $2.92 in the prior year quarter that included $93 million of insurance benefit I mentioned in a $39 million pre-tax pension settlement. In addition, to record fourth quarter revenue, the company set new fourth quarter highs for total segment profit and margin and adjusted EPS from continuing operations. As reported, total segment profit was a fourth quarter record a $139 million up 5% from the prior year quarter that included $25 million of insurance recovery. Total segment margin was a fourth quarter record 15.2% up 10 basis points. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations rose 18% to fourth quarter record of $2.89. From an operating perspective, excluding the $25 million of insurance benefit in the prior year quarter, total segment profit was up 29% and segment margin expanded 300 basis points. Looking at our business segments for the fourth quarter. Residential set new fourth quarter records for revenue, profit and margin. Residential revenue was up 11% on double-digit growth in both replacement and new construction business. Residential indoor air quality revenue was up more than 30% in the quarter. Segment profit rose 18% and segment margin expanded a 130 basis points to 20.9%. From an operational perspective, adjusting for the $25 million of insurance benefit in the prior year quarter, residential profit rose 58% and margin expanded 630 basis points. In Commercial, fourth quarter revenue was down 13% and profit was down 11%. Segment margin expanded 40 basis points to a fourth quarter record 19.4%. We continue to see year-over-year improvement in business in both replacement and new construction as well as in national accounts in the regional and local business. Commercial equipment revenue overall was down mid-teens in the quarter, within this, replacement revenue was down low single-digits in constant currency, with plan replacement down high single-digits and emergency replacement up low double-digits. New construction revenue was down mid-20s percentage. Breaking out revenue another way, regional and local business revenue was down low double-digits. National accounts equipment revenue was down mid-teens. On the service side, Lennox National Accounts Service revenue was down high single-digits. Some highlights to mention for Commercial. Our team added six new national account equipment customers in the quarter to bring the total to 32 for the year. As small today, we're seeing fast indoor air quality revenue growth led by our new building better air initiative. And in the first quarter, we're on track with the launch of our new Model L Rooftop unit as we continue to lead the field in energy efficiency. The Model L features variable speed technology and an all-new advanced control system. We're seeing high customer interest in this industry leading product for 2021. Overall, Commercial backlog is up double-digits. In Refrigeration, for the fourth quarter revenue was up 7% as reported, and up 3% at constant currency. North America revenue was up low single-digits. Europe Refrigeration revenue was up mid-single-digits as reported and low single-digits at constant currency. Europe HVAC revenue was up mid-teens as reported and up high single-digits at constant currency. Refrigeration segment profit declined 28% and margin contracted to 360 basis points to 7.5% on the timing of expenses in the quarter and unfavorable mix of the strong growth in Europe HVAC. Currently, Refrigeration backlog is up double-digits led by North America and we're seeing strong order flow. We expect segment margin to be up year-over-year starting in the first quarter and be up for the full year in 2021. For the company overall in 2021, we are reiterating guidance. We expect revenue growth of 48% this year and GAAP and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $10.55 to $11.15 for the full year. While there's an economic and market uncertainty, momentum continues for the company we're well positioned for year of strong growth and profitability. Given the outlook and the company's strong balance sheet and cash generation, we are restarting our stock purchase program in 2021 and plan to buy back 400 million this year. I'll now turn it over to Joe. Morning Jeff. I think, we're both watching other people's teams this weekend. Yeah, I mean, I read your pre note, yes, the short answer is there was some benefit from absorption as we continue to produce in fourth quarter for the demand rolling into 2021. But even more important than that, as the drivers of the margin were the aggressive SG&A costs that the team took out early in the year, we haven't added back a lot of them. And so, we had great SG&A leverage. Also, we had very strong quarter material costs, and just in the factories themselves, even above absorption some of the productivity initiatives really kicked in second half of the year and we saw the benefits so, absorption helped. And it will help as you suggest as we roll in the next year. But there was benefits across, there was strong performance across the board and resi. We're seeing sales growth in first quarter so far. I mean, it's starting to accelerate in first quarter. Orders have taken a bit of a pause during the first three weeks in January, which I think is normal as you go into a new year. That's not unusual for us. And I think there's a little bit of uncertainty out there in the commercial marketplace. But we're set up for a nice quarter in Q1 and the backlogs starting to build for second quarter and balance of the year. The good news for anyone who's ever worked in a large corporation, the good news after having a tough year is the next year you have great comps. And I think that's true in our Refrigeration business, so I think we'll have positive news in Refrigeration. Overall, for the corporation, we guided 30% incrementals. We're still feeling pretty good about that. We're going to have price of $50 million that'll offset the commodity headwind of $30 million, freight and tariff headwind each of $5 million to $40 million of costs, and those three buckets offset with price, and the MCR and additional volume. So, as we talked about in December, we feel pretty good about the 30% incremental. Yeah, I understand. I'm not going to answer that last part. We said we have double-digit backlog going into the year, where we saw the pickup in order rates in fourth quarter where and planned replacement as large national account customers got more comfortable on placing orders. And I also think some of them had capital at the end of the year that they didn't spend because of uncertainty earlier in the year. And so, we had - we didn't deliver those units, but we booked those business and that will flow into the first half of this year. Emergency replacement was up in fourth quarter, so that continues to flow. I think the area that's weakest right now, quite frankly, continues weak is commercial new construction, given the uncertainty that still exists around the recovery from COVID. Hey, John. The schools tend to move relatively slow. So, from the time they're sort of a mandate on top until the time you see the revenue flow through the business takes time. We have a very strong K Through12 program, if you will. We have dedicated salespeople just for that vertical, our indoor air quality product serves that market, our high efficiency product serves that market. So, we're in lots of dialogues with people, but I don't think there's been a light switch turned on that market. Well, I'll give you the specific answer and then I'll directly answer the broader question of why then change it narrowly. We buy steel a couple different ways. We have some fixed contracts. We have some contracts that are tied to scrap. And then majority of it is we buy from the mills based on CRU pricing the prior quarter. When you - so when we're quote unquote predicting copper and aluminum, we have a large hedge already in our books. And so, we have a pretty good view what we're going to have. For steel, we have to sort of predict what's going to happen. Now as the answer, in December, we were depending I guess what side of the trade you were on, we are either bearish or bullish but we assumed steel was going to go up and we rolled that into our guide. And so, it's plus or minus commodities is still a $30 million headwind. Thanks. Hi, Gautam. How are you? Yeah, I mean, I think the most important thing is what I spent a ton of time talking about in December, which is, the broader your - the larger your independent distribution network is the more our belief is that you pulled volume from 2021 and to 2020, and that distributors not only were reloading for inventory that was down, but sort of the scarcity mindset was taking over and they were trying to make sure they had lots of inventory in case OEMs ran into production issues. And so our sense is people with independent distribution have inflated sales numbers in fourth quarter and that will bleed off as you go through the year compared to us, which is, we delivered in resi up 11% overall. And that we think in fact we know in our Lennox business, which is 80% of our residential, we see demand when the customers buying the unit to a vast large degree. So, I think that's the one thing to model for. And as we talked about with us narrowly, that sort of the timing of EPS or earnings is a little bit different to normal, that we expect about half of our EPS to come in first half and about half of the EPS in second half, which is a little different weighting that what we've had in the past. No, I think the short answer is no, Carrier has always been a very good competitor and they publicly different things happen and they say different things on the earnings call, but on the ground, it's the same tried and true sales force and strong dealer network. And they've always had good product. And they haven't changed their pricing strategy, they haven't changed, I don't think how they buy components and commodities or sourcing strategies. And they haven't changed their distribution strategy. So, from where we sit, it's very similar to what we have seen in past. Good morning, Nicole. I'll answer the question obliquely. In Residential, we continue to see strong momentum. And in Commercial and Refrigeration as I talked about, backlogs are up double-digits as we ended the year. And so, we're hitting first quarter at a pretty stiff pace, we'll see how the balance of the quarter goes. But we feel pretty good as we start the year. I think it'll be more of a normal year where we'll sort of peak and working capital early and then burn it off second half of the year where 2020 was abnormal, that we never sort of reloaded on working capital second half. And so, we outperformed on free cash flow. I think it'll be more of a traditional year. And, again, just to connect some of the dots, so I'll take your question and expand on areas that I want to talk about. Maybe Nicole you didn't directly asked, but I would just sort of underline the free cash flow of $535 million in 2020, which is a record. We're guiding for 325 next year. Over the two-year period, it's about 110% of net income. So, 2020, 2021 over the two-year period, 110% of our adjusted net income which is a pretty strong performance in cash flow over a couple year period. Yeah. Overall, we're up 11%. Our Lennox was up high single digits, and our Allied grew mid-20s. And so, what we saw in our business is what we've been saying others are seeing, which is our independent distribution business. Allied grew much stronger than our Lennox business, but not because they're winning share just, we have distributors who are reloading and quite frankly, with a scarcity mindset trying to pull some volume in. No, I mean, we didn't - I mean, just from a weather perspective, it wasn't so cold in January this year versus last year - December this year versus last year. We saw some pickup in December, but not near the Hardy data. Again, I think you're right that the Hardy data in any given month is suspect. I think directionally over a 12 month rolling data sort of gives you the right area for the number but I think in any given month, it could be a little misleading. I reframed the question. I'm not sure he asked me a question on residential margins. Yeah, I think on the round they're all plus or minus 30. So, from a resi view 30, commercial 30. And refrigeration that was could probably be a little bit higher. But that's such a small part of our business, the other two will drive it then what we do on corporate expenses. Yeah, I mean, the hybrid ductless, again, we can develop whatever product we want. But 80% of the product is replacement. And the ducts are already in the home. And so, the lowest cost solution for the 80% that's add on or replacement is our ducted systems. We are coming out with a 28 seri unit in first quarter that we talked about. We think we have as good or better variable speed technology with our compression partners. And so, we think we're playing right in the sweet spot, which is to have the lowest cost point to have the highest efficiency in the marketplace. And we think with our compression technology, our coil strategy and our Mexican Assembly Facility we're able to do that. I don't think there'll be a prebuy in any meaningful way. Again, it always comes down to the fine tuning of the actual details how it's implemented. But the last time we did this, which was a more normal way to do it. You had sort of months to prepare and get it correct. And you don't have this huge step function change, like we did back in, that the industry had back in 2006, 2007. So, I think there may be a bit of prebuy, but not like there's been in the past. No, and again, it's - when we went from 10 to 13, or the industry, I wasn't here, but we went from 10 to 13, that had been the first major jump in a while that really screwed up the premium competitors in retrospect, and a big one it's was Goodman, because all of a sudden differentiation got collapsed. One, I think everybody's understood that and so one of the reasons we come out with 28 seri in 2021 is to prepare to sort of have the high end stretched out for when we have to make the transition. And then the other is, it's a much smaller bite when you're going from 14 to 15, that's as much difference than going from 10 to 13 as a percentage, obviously. So, you just don't have this huge cost shock to the system and sigh shock to the system with the big units back in 2006, 2007. So, I view it as sort of, not quite home [ph], but pretty close to home. And then the other thing that's on the horizon residential regulatory wise is changing refrigerants to lower greenhouse gas emissions. And with the current administration it looks like it's going to be national rather than just a few states. And again, we'll be prepared for that as I think the rest of the industry will. California reg was pushed. But it looks like it's going to the Biden administration, our best understanding is it will drive it as a national implementation just not card. Good morning. Yeah, I mean, the two, I gave you were sort of the - are the two rattled off are the two big drivers. It was the fact that we were up in HVAC in Europe and down in our North America refrigeration business had a significant impact on the margins. And then, the other piece was just the timing of costs. And getting to the accounting sort of accrual adjustments and sort of year-over-year differences and fourth quarter took a hit compared to fourth quarter last year. As I think, I mentioned in the script, we expect to have margins up in Q1 in refrigeration and for them to be up full year. Yes. Can you - you broke up a little bit right in here. Can you ask question one more time? We have no issue. We're able to get on the job site, do what we need to do. Our guys are matched up and commercial customers have no issue in them. Thanks to everyone. To wrap up, as I mentioned in Q&A and during the script, momentum continues in first quarter and 2021 is off to a nice start. Lennox team is executing well to capitalize on market growth and share gains. We look forward to a year of strong growth and profitability. Thanks again for everyone for joining us today."

Before I turn the call over to Todd, I would like to announce the date of our Annual Investment Committee Meeting. The event will be held the morning of Wednesday, December 16. The format will be virtual this year. Please mark your calendars, invitations and more details will follow. Now, let me turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Todd Bluedorn.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Let me start with a quick overview on the third quarter that continues to be impacted by COVID-19 pandemic and then discuss our updated 2020 outlook. For the year, we are raising guidance for revenue, earnings and free cash flow driven by the continued strength in our residential business. Overall for the company in the third quarter, revenue was up 2% to $1.06 billion, the third quarter record. GAAP operating income was up 7% to a third quarter record of $167 million. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was up 16% to new high for any quarter of $3.42. Total adjusted segment profit was a third quarter record of $177 million, up 1% from the prior year quarter that included $16 million of insurance benefit. From an operational perspective, excluding the insurance benefit, total adjusted segment profit was up 11%. Total adjusted segment margin for the third quarter was 16.7% compared to 17% in the prior year quarter. From an operational perspective, excluding the insurance benefit in the third quarter last year, total adjusted segment margin was up 130 basis points. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up 6% to $3.53, a third quarter record. On our residential segment in the third quarter, revenue was up 13% to a new high for any quarter of $722 million. Revenue from replacement business is up low double-digits. Revenue from new construction was up mid-teens. Residential segment profit set a new record \u2013 excuse me, set a new third quarter record at $153 million, up 21%. Segment margin expanded about 140 basis points to a third quarter record of 21.2%. On an operational basis, excluding the insurance benefit in the prior year quarter, segment profit rose 38% and segment margin expanded 390 basis points. Our residential business benefited from continued strong market conditions and favorable hot weather in July and August. Consumers continue to replace units more than repair with equipment growth rate running multiples ahead of the parts growth rate. September turned significantly cooler, which continues to \u2013 which has continued to-date in October as contractors work towards winter and furnaces. Strength in the residential market continues and the team is executing well as it continues to take advantage of market opportunities to gain share. Turning to our commercial-facing businesses, they continue to be more heavily impacted from the pandemic than residential as expected. In the commercial business segment, revenue and profit were down 18%. Segment margin expanded 10 basis points to 18.7%. National account equipment revenue was down nearly 30% and regional and local revenue was down mid-teens. Breaking down revenue another way, replacement was down high-teens and new construction was down high 20s. On the service side, Linux national accounts service revenue was down low double-digits. VRF revenue was down low double-digits. While overall commercial equipment revenue was down 20% in the third quarter, we continue to see signs of relative improvement in the business with commercial equipment backlog currently down mid-teens year-over-year and order rates reflecting gradual improvement as well. Our commercial team continues to win new business decision for future growth. Commercial won 11 new national count customers in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 26. In addition, our commercial group has launched an initiative called Building Better Air that is focused on improving indoor air quality of commercial spaces. This initiative combines our innovative product line and industry leading building services to provide comprehensive IAQ solutions to commercial customers. We are helping business and building owners evaluate for HVAC systems recommend that comprehensive indoor air quality solution tailored to the building and identify a maintenance plan to ensure ongoing indoor air quality effectiveness. Turning to our Refrigeration business segment, revenue was down 14% at constant currency. North America was down high-teens and Europe was down high single-digits. Segment profit was down 34% and segment margin contracts at 350 basis points to 10.4%. Refrigeration profitability was impacted by negative mix with Europe down less than the U.S. in the quarter as well as factory inefficiencies due to COVID-19. As in the commercial business, we are seeing signs in Refrigeration of relative year-over-year improvement from the third quarter with backlog up and order rates reflecting strong improvement. A quick update on SG&A cost savings this year. Earlier this year, we enacted a $115 million SG&A savings program. Due to the improved performance of our end-markets and our strong operational performance, we have restored compensation and volume related SG&A costs. Several examples of what I am talking about are reinstituting pay for the temporary salary reduction, increase sales commissions and paying performance-based compensation. We are now planning for $65 million of SG&A savings this year, with 45% coming from discretionary spending, 40% from headcount reduction and the remaining 15% from paying incentives that return in 2021. To wrap up with our updated guidance on 2020, we are raising revenue, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Revenue is now expected to be down 5% to 9% for the full year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be $9.05 to $9.65 and free cash flow is expected to be approximately $425 million. We continue to face highly uncertain economic conditions in the fourth quarter and remain cautious on the potential impact from the pandemic heading into the winter season, but Lennox has a seasoned team, experience in managing through downturns, while continuing to invest in advanced accounting for the future. We look forward to closing 2020 strong with momentum into 2021. Now, over to Joe.\nJoe Reitmeier: Thank you, Todd and good morning everyone. I will provide some additional comments and financial details on business segments for the quarter starting with residential heating and cooling. In the third quarter, revenue from residential heating and cooling was a record $722 million, up 13%. Volume was up 11% and price and mix combined was up 2% and foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Residential profit was a third quarter record of $153 million, up 21% as reported over the prior quarter that included $16 million of insurance benefit. Segment margin was a third quarter record of 21.2%, which was up 140 basis points as reported over the prior quarter with the insurance benefit. Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price, lower material and other product cost, higher factory productivity and lower distribution and freight costs. Partial offsets included the year-over-year difference in insurance benefit, higher selling and incentive expenses and tariffs. Turning to our commercial heating and cooling business, commercial revenue was $208 million, down 18%. Volume was down 16%. Price and mix combined was down 2% and price flat and mix down. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Commercial segment profit was $39 million, down 18%. Segment margin ticked up 10 basis points to 18.7%. Segment profit was primarily impacted by lower volume driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable mix. Partial offsets included lower material cost, higher factory productivity, lower distribution cost and lower SG&A expense. In Refrigeration, third quarter revenue was $125 million, down 12%. Volume was down 16%, price and mix combined was up 2% and foreign exchange had a favorable 2% impact on revenue. Refrigeration segment profit was $13 million, down 34%. Segment margin was 10.4%, down 350 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by lower volume and lower factory efficiency due to the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable mix. Partial offsets included favorable price, lower material costs, lower SF&A expense and favorable foreign exchange. Regarding special items in the third quarter, the company had net after-tax charges totaling $4.4 million that included a $3.6 million loss from natural disasters net of insurance recoveries related to an August 2020 high-wind damage at the company\u2019s manufacturing facility in Iowa, $2.2 million for personal protective equipment and facility deep cleaning expenses incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a net charge of $1.4 million for various other items, and a benefit of $2.8 million for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. Corporate expenses were $28 million in third quarter compared to $18 million in the prior year quarter as the company\u2019s financial results in the third quarter triggered incentive compensation true-ups for performance year-to-date. Overall, SG&A was $152 million, up 6% from the prior year quarter. And for the first 9 months, SG&A is down 7%. In the third quarter, the company generated $440 million dollars of cash from operations compared to $236 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $12 million compared to approximately $25 million in the prior year quarter and free cash flow was $428 million in the quarter compared to $211 million in the prior year quarter. The company paid approximately $30 million in dividends in the quarter. Total debt was $1.01 billion at the end of the third quarter and we ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.8. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $59 million at the end of September. Now, before I turn it over to Q&A, I will review our current market assumptions and guidance points for 2020. For the industry overall, we now expect North American residential HVAC shipments to be roughly flat this year. We now expect both commercial unitary shipments and refrigeration shipments to be down approximately 20% for the industry this year. Looking at the company\u2019s performance year-to-date and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are raising our 2020 revenue guidance from a decline of 10% to 15% to a decline of 5% to 9% for the year. We are raising our guidance for GAAP EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.31 to $8.11 to a new range of $8.35 to $8.95 for the year. We are raising our guidance for adjusted EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.90 to $8.70 to a new range of $9.05 to $9.65 for the year. Looking at the various puts and takes in our financial guidance for 2020 that we are updating commodities are not expected to be a $25 million benefit for the year compared to prior guidance of a $20 million benefit. We now expect a $25 million benefit from sourcing and engineering lead cost reductions compared to prior guidance of a $20 million benefit. Residential mix is expected to be a headwind of approximately $10 million for the full year as new construction has outperformed replacement business year-to-date. Earlier expectations were for new construction to slow and mix to be flat. We now expect corporate expense of approximately $90 million compared to prior guidance of $75 million primarily due to higher compensation expense related to the company\u2019s performance. We now expect interest and pension expense of approximately $35 million compared to prior guidance of $40 million. We now expect an effective tax rate for the full year on an adjusted basis of 19% to 20% compared to the prior range of 21% to 22% due to the timing of certain tax benefits this year. And for 2021, we expect the effective tax rate to be back in the 21% to 22% range. Capital expenditures are now expected to be $100 million for this year from prior guidance of $120 million on the timing of some spending between 2020 and 2021. And our guidance for free cash flow is now approximately $425 million from the prior guidance of $340 million for the year. For our guidance points that are remaining the same, price is still expected to be a $25 million benefit for the year. Residential factory productivity is still expected to be a $10 million headwind. We still expect tariffs to be neutral and we continue to expect freight to be a $10 million benefit. The weighted average diluted share count for the full year is still expected to be between 38 million to 39 million shares and our stock repurchase plans remain on hold after repurchasing $100 million of stock in the first quarter for the $400 million that was planned going into the year. Now, with that, let\u2019s go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And I will first go to line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Maybe just a first question on the top line, the guidance at the midpoint and even the high-end implies sort of step down in Q4 sequentially that\u2019s much worse than normal. Is that just because of the uncertainty in the environment or is there anything sort of specific that you are calling out? And maybe related to that, just wondered on your latest assessments of the health of the resi market entering next year, I heard you say this year you are looking at a flattish market now, any thoughts on sort of fundamentals into next year?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. On the first point, it\u2019s a combination both of uncertainty in the fourth quarter, but also we had such a strong third quarter if you are looking at it sequentially, year-over-year, I mean, it\u2019s a record third quarter for us. Our residential revenue was up 13% driven by hot weather so that helped. And so I think that\u2019s part of it. In terms of looking into 2021, on markets, we continue to remain bullish on the residential markets. There is lots of moving pieces, but we called \u2013 we are calling for the market to be flat this year. And I think that\u2019s an important perspective remember, I understand that some folks are wondering, did demand get pulled in to something from 2021 get pulled into the strong third quarter? Two points, I would make one overall, the market is going to be flat year-over-year in the middle of the pandemic. Second is just the behavior of a residential homeowner, even when there is not a pandemic, no one wants anyone into their house to replace the unit unless they have to and there is a catastrophic failure, they replace the unit. And especially in a pandemic, no one wants people coming into their houses and spending 2 or 3 days replacing the unit. So, these are being replaced when they break and they are not being repaired like they were during the financial crisis, but there has to be a proximate cause for them coming in and that\u2019s not pulling forward demand. No one is sort of saying let\u2019s replace it now rather than next summer. They are replacing it now when it breaks and they have no choice. And so we remain confident as we have talked before that we think there is another couple of years of this mid single-digit growth and for it to be flat in the middle of the pandemic shows the resiliency of this market. And so we remain confident in the resi market for 2021.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you. And then my second question just on the margin outlook perhaps clarify exactly, how much of that $65 million in the savings could reverse or come back into the P&L next year? And what are you thinking for sort of residential operating leverage as you look out now that the revenue line has returned to growth again?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think the way I think about it is our new guide on the SG&A, take out $65 million. And then when you look at that $65 million, only 15% of it now is paying incentives, because so much came back into the P&L this year. So, the 15% that\u2019s paying incentives that will bounce back next year. So, that\u2019s whatever the math is, $7 million, $7.5 million, the balance of it, the 45% that\u2019s discretion and 40% is headcount, we control those. And it depends on how the market is performing and the investments that we want to make in the business. But our sort of goal of having 30% incremental margins is plus or minus what our target will be for next year. So, previously, our guide was $115 million with a lot more tied to paying incentives, I think that risk is now off the table for next year. It comes with it bouncing back on us in a meaningful way.\nJulian Mitchell: Great, thank you.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: Hey, good morning, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hi, Ryan.\nRyan Merkel: Hey, good morning. Can you just dive into some of the commercial end-market performance to give us a little more detail?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think we have caught it up somewhat out on the call. We have seen national accounts sell more than our local and regional business and that\u2019s what we would have expected just the way the market behaves that the planned replacement gets deferred as people sort through things. And so our planned replacement was down mid 20s versus a year ago, but in Q2 it was down over 40%. So the trend line on playing replacements going the right direction. And when you look at our order and backlog playing replacement as many companies are getting more comfortable in the current environment and some of our large customers are people like Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, BestBuy, who are doing pretty well, are getting more comfortable spending. Emergency replacement was down 10%ish in the quarter after being down 35% in the second quarter, so again heading the right direction. And then new construction is the one that goes the other way, because new construction of things that were in flights continue to be built, but that new business starts to go down and we saw that down near 30% in third quarter after only being down mid-teens in second quarter. And then as we mentioned on the call the order, excuse me, the backlog is down mid-teens and so the backlog is heading in the right direction. But when we think about the full year, we still think the markets will be down 20%, the one silver lining in all that is the comp gets a lot easier next year. And so when we think about 2021 sort of which the way the world looks now that we would expect that the commercial market, commercial unitary market would be up after such a hard hit 2020. And when you look back on history of the commercial unitary market whether it\u2019s the 911 downturn or the financial crisis downturn, goes down hard comes back quickly.\nRyan Merkel: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, you mentioned commercial IAQ initiatives, can you just talk about how big that business is today and then what is your outlook for the coming quarters?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, I mean, we tend not to quantify the market. And again, I think you heard in a way I talked about it, we think about it as a facilitator to win the equipment business. And our Build Better Air initiative is leveraging off our store capabilities in indoor air quality and our relationships with the building owner. And we are an industry leader in indoor air quality in both residential and commercial markets as we have talked about indoor air quality as air purification, like builders and UV lights, ventilation and circulation and humidity control. Our residential pure air equipment is the best in the industry, as noted by consumer reports and then we talked about building better air and our advantages and our opportunities there.\nRyan Merkel: Great, thanks, Todd.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys.\nJoe Reitmeier: Hi, Jeff.\nTodd Bluedorn: I just want to point out before your actual question that so many things changing in 2020, I personally have great comfort that the Pittsburgh Cleveland remains consistent over the decades.\nJeff Hammond: I knew that was coming.\nTodd Bluedorn: Okay, go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. Can you just talk about your distribution based business versus direct sales in the quarter and then just talk about how you think inventories are in your channel and at independent and maybe speak to how the channel is thinking about furnace distribution build versus maybe how they managed the cooling side?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. The performances of the businesses were relatively consistent. They were both up plus or minus 13%. So, there wasn\u2019t one that outperformed the other. And then I read to note and I thought you raised valid questions around the AHRI numbers versus the HARDI numbers one being sell out, one being sell in and we take great comfort that our Lennox business performs very similar to our allied business, i.e., the sell-through or the sellout of our Lennox business directly to dealers to sell, the 13%, 14%, whatever the exact number was that and so that\u2019s a good sign for our Lennox business. Our allied business also did well. I think the direct question \u2013 answer to your question is inventories that are low right now, which is normal coming out of such a hot summer. And then what happens is there is [indiscernible] of short memories or however you want to phrase that of dealers. And so they had trouble getting cooling product in the summer, which many did because our competitors had trouble delivering. Then they want to make sure their bars are full with furnaces and so we see that right now as people are loading up on furnaces.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. And then just on refrigeration, I think you said backlog was up maybe what\u2019s differentiating the order trend there? And then I think you mentioned COVID disruption there, what\u2019s unique about the facilities there versus the other businesses?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, we got it both in our European business and in our Tifton, Georgia business. If you look at Tifton, Georgia on a map, it was in one of the hardest hit areas for COVID in the country. And so that has some impact on our businesses and so absenteeism and then actually, having had the factories shutdown for a bit in both locations impacted our productivity. When you look at the backlog of commercial, as you know we are more exposed to retail there than we are in refrigeration and that\u2019s been a softer spot and then also in refrigeration, cold storage is one of our largest verticals and that\u2019s been relatively strong given that people are building up a cold chain to support different consumer buying habits and buying food at home and also maybe a bit of preparing for the vaccine. And so we have seen strength in cold storage and that\u2019s helped us.\nJeff Hammond: Okay, thanks for the color.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: And next go to the line for Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, good morning.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, Todd. Maybe just commenting a little bit on the resi HVAC monthly trend, obviously, you guys have told us what July was up I am just curious how the rest of the quarter went? And then as you are switching over to furnace, I am just curious whether you think there are any issues that may occur, just given how strong HVAC has been just from a manufacturing perspective, I am just wondering if there is any kind of like picking the Python type problem as you try to deliver on furnace sales?\nTodd Bluedorn: The trend line during the months July and August were up mid-teens as I talked about on the second quarter earnings call we saw in July and then September was up significantly, but up more low double-digits, high single-digits as sort of got away from hot summer selling season. We are positioned as well or better than anyone in the industry to meet both cooling demand and furnace demand. So, we think we are in good shape. I think some of our competitors may have issues. And again, I think it gets more pronounced as if you have independent distributors trying to get large orders from you all at once and maybe our competitors are seeing some of that, but we think we are in good position as well or better than anyone in the industry to meet the upcoming furnaces.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, great. And then my one follow-on as you think about 2021 and I know it\u2019s probably a little too early, but I am just trying to think about how to think about the price costs dynamics in resi, you saw copper is up a lot, but you mentioned getting good price mix this quarter on the resi is back. So, any comments on just the dynamics heading into 2021 just given the increase we have seen in commodity costs?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. I will broaden the question and just sort of talk a little bit about 2021 more broadly, obviously lots of moving pieces. There is always uncertainty in October when you are thinking about the following year, but maybe as much now as ever. And I talked a little bit about the end-markets earlier I repeat that we walk out or almost out 2020 with a clear understanding of the resiliency of the residential market and again it\u2019s demand that\u2019s being caused by the home failing and remodel all that we think there is another couple of years of that. So, we think mid single-digits next year for residential and new constructions remains strong. For commercial and refrigeration, as I talked earlier, more uncertainty there, but after being down 25% \u2013 20% this year, we would expect some rebound in 2021. Directly to your question is we do expect some commodity headwind for next year, but I would also just mention, we have always historically said commodities that matter most to us are steel, copper, aluminum in that order. With all the work we have done on moving to aluminum and our heat exchangers across our business, it\u2019s now steel, aluminum and copper that\u2019s most important to us. And so while copper still matters, it matters significantly less than it did 4 or 5 years ago and aluminum I think is behaving more, nicely if you will, sound like the President with that terminology, but has behaved better. And so we expect some commodity headwind, we expect some freight headwind at the current point of time although that still has to be shaken out. And then if we talk about, we would expect a little bit of compensation bounce back given the takeout a reduction this year. But as always, we are going to be announcing a price increase here shortly. And we expect to get price next year just like we do every year. We are going to benefit from sourcing and engineering cost reductions. We talked about raising that number from $20 million to $25 million this year. And so that\u2019s order of magnitude that we have done for the last decade $20 million to $30 million depending on the year. Factory productivity after not really having much of any factory productivity issue, because of all the disruptions because of COVID, we will get back on track there. And then as always, our target of 0.5 point of market share gain. So I know I haven\u2019t quantified a lot of those, but it\u2019s to send a signal that we think the setup for next year will be not dissimilar to the setup of prior years, where we have markets saw share gain, priced offset commodities and then continued productivity and material costs and factory productivity.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning\nJohn Walsh: Maybe just a finer question on that commodity discussion we just had there, you took commodities and the sourcings combined up $10 million relative to where we were in Q3. Just how much of that falls through in Q4 versus how much has been realized kind of the year-to-date?\nTodd Bluedorn: I am not sure to be honest with you, John. Maybe we can sort of guide that I think that the commodities, I think people are scrambling diligently to sort of find, I think the commodities can\u2019t tamper down as we go through the year, where the material cost reduction starts, continues to increase as we go through the year. So, if I had to guess I would say commodities are around $20 million, $22 million year-to-date and then MCR, I think the raise is just confidence that we will continue to execute for the balance of the year.\nJohn Walsh: Great, thank you for that. And then just I guess maybe you talked a little bit about 2021 just kind of to two questions on my mind. I mean, you just talked about your normal kind of market share gains. But as I understand it, one of your competitors, right, had factory disruption and so they might have not been able to fulfill orders and that arguably comes back online next year. So, does that make it harder to get that kind of normal market share gain that Lennox has been getting? And then maybe just on this replacement pull-forward question, I guess it depends on how you think we look from a work-from-home benefit next year, but wouldn\u2019t because we were sheltering we would see more breakage this summer that needed replacement arguably that pulled from \u201821 into \u201822 or is that just not the right way to think about it? We would just like to get your perspective there.\nTodd Bluedorn: I will answer the second question first and not as you, John, have heard others talk about that. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it works. And what I mean by that is I don\u2019t think people set their thermostats to 85 when they go to work and then when they come home, they set it to 68. That I think the majority of people don\u2019t even set their thermostats on a timer, it just sort of remains constant over time. And then I think people raise it, maybe to 78, 80 when they are gone and then 75 when they get back. So I don\u2019t \u2013 in terms of usage that doesn\u2019t drive a spike up where units all of a sudden have huge acceleration of use of breakage. And so I just step back and say the market is flat year-over-year in 2020, that doesn\u2019t show pull forward to me, it\u2019s flat and a hot summer. So, the market is flat and hot summer that doesn\u2019t show pull forward to me that shows people were hesitant to spend money unless they had to, but when the unit breaks, they replace the unit rather than repaired it. I don\u2019t think there is \u2013 I don\u2019t think anything was pulled forward, because people were at home. Remind me what the first question was?\nJohn Walsh: Just on the ability to kind of get your normal market share gains, I mean, I know its end of April right?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, one give me personal privilege to just sort of observe that when we lost because of tornado everyone assumed we would never get it back and now that we have taken it from others, there is an assumption that maybe we won\u2019t be able to hang on to it. I think a couple of things. I think haven\u2019t been on the other end of it, we were cognizant the constrained supply environment to supply the dealers who we thought we had the best chance of keeping business to sellers. We weren\u2019t selling arms to anybody. We were selling arms to our units to those dealers who we thought we had. We are already sort of in the conversations with and converting over and those are the ones we sold to. So, we may \u2013 we are not hang-on to all that we get, but we are going to hang on to a lot of it, a whole lot of it. And then we are also on the attack to gain more share. So, I remain confident that we will \u2013 we are gaining significant share this year and I am confident we will gain share.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you. That\u2019s really helpful color.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes.\nOperator: And next from the one line of Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nDeepa Raghavan: Hi. Good morning all.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning, Deepa.\nDeepa Raghavan: Todd, can you provide your thoughts on when you think you can resume share buybacks? Looks like you are starting to loosen up on some of the variable costs and getting comfortable given your strong cash outlook. So, will it be normal for us to assume buybacks return in 2021?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. I will be more direct put it in your model. We are not going to start it up here in fourth quarter getting some of the uncertainty, but when we give the December guide for 2021, we will be back to a more normal stock repurchase program for 2021.\nDeepa Raghavan: Great, thanks. Can you \u2013 how do we think about normal volume-driven leverage in 2021? I mean, you have \u2013 you are going to have all these costs in and out rollbacks more seems like more headwinds. I don\u2019t know if price gets that much more incrementally better. So, should I think about your volume-driven leverage to be slightly below trend or should all those dynamics not impact just given that you probably should be able to price for them or take costs elsewhere?\nTodd Bluedorn: Our variable gross margin is around 40%. So volume drops through it sort of a normal 40% either direction and then obviously in a year, where we are spending SG&A and doing other things then the incrementals, goes down. And so that, that\u2019s how we end up with the 30% incremental that we are making investments into business building out distribution, driving productivity, but the third normal volume leverage is about 40%.\nDeepa Raghavan: Got it. Thank you very much, Todd.\nOperator: And next, we will go to Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Hey, thanks. Good morning and great results.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: I had a couple of questions. First, I was wondering if you could maybe frame the magnitude of the pricing opportunity for resi. You mentioned you are going to announce some price increases, just should \u201821 be a better net realization year than normal, any framework for that?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, I mean I am going with hope what we will announce will be what we always announce publicly for the second quarter what the final number is going to be. So, we will announce price, but yes, I do think there is when we expect the market to be up after having been constrained the year before. That sort of leads you to believe you can get price in the marketplace as we spoke about when we are having challenge meeting demand as we did \u2013 as the whole industry did in 2020 wasn\u2019t really the right time to raise price dynamically the middle of a season. When we go into next year, we will be looking to raise price and for a couple of reasons. One, we talked about commodities. COVID has added cost to our cost structure. We talked a little bit about what happened in our refrigeration margins because of it, but quite frankly, it\u2019s impacting the entire business both on the SG&A side and we think we have to do to manage suppliers and manage our own business, absenteeism in our factories and then we think rate is going to be up. So, those are all reasons on why we are going to need to pass price on and I think our \u2013 in fact, I know our competitors see the same for us.\nGautam Khanna: Thanks. That makes sense. And also could you just expand upon the IAQ opportunity level of engagement with customers does it drive like a much bigger revenue cycle, anything you can talk about that?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, I mean \u2013 I maybe \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the right phrase is, maybe more clear-eyed on IAQ. I don\u2019t think its billions and billions and billions of dollars of opportunity at least in unitary, where we play and in residential. I think if you are showing $5,000 residential units, your indoor air quality component is $400 or $500. On commercial, it\u2019s maybe less of a percentage. So, I don\u2019t think it drives the overall ticket. I think what happens is you have to have knowledge and expertise in it for those customers who want it and you want to steer customers who wanted to be able to handle their questions. And so, commercial customers have Build Better Air, sit down with them, talk about what we have and we have everything, and then put it in place and then use our NAS, our national account service to measure and monitor the compliance. In our residential business, it\u2019s our PureAir S, which has both passive filters and active UV lights that allows us to clean air and then also it\u2019s digitized, so those part of our iComfort controller. You can measure and monitor what\u2019s going on. And so I think it\u2019s being an expert in the area that allows you to win the jobs and convert dealers and that\u2019s where we are focused on.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you very much, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: And next, we\u2019ll go to Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNicole DeBlase : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning, Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: We covered a lot of ground here. But I guess on the free cash flow guidance, it doesn\u2019t really embed a whole lot of free cash flow in the four quarter. I am getting to something a little bit more than $30 million. So, just thoughts on \u2013 I am guessing that working capital is kind of the biggest swing factor there. So, any thoughts that you have about what we should expect for 4Q?\nTodd Bluedorn: That\u2019s the answer. I know the sequence of the quarter is different this year. By the way, they are going to be different next year and we will talk about that in December. But we are typically at this point in time driving down production levels and burning off inventory. But given the hot summer selling season and given that we expected the markets to be down, while we saw summer selling season was a burn off of inventory, burn off of receivables, payables and then what we see in Q4 is on a year-over-year basis the inflation of inventory and working capital. And so that\u2019s why you see \u2013 we typically have the big cash quarter, fourth quarter. This year, we had the big cash quarter in third quarter.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay, totally makes sense. Got it. And then just one more on refrigeration, so I think you characterized you quantified a bit of what\u2019s going on with order and backlog within commercial, could you just provide some detail around what you are seeing in refrigeration, Todd?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, I mean, our backlog is up year-over-year, right now where we stand, and the order rates on a 3, 6, 9-week basis are all up in refrigeration. So, the trend lines are good. I think it\u2019s both. In our North America business, there is distribution business where we sell through \u2013 about half of its distribution business we sell through large refrigeration wholesalers and that has bounced back from being down significantly in second quarter. And then the other business is project business or our cold storage. And that, as I mentioned earlier, has been relatively strong. Our Europe business has been strong. But we are a little, obviously, a little over-concerned about COVID and lockdowns in France and Spain and what the trend line is there. But again, on \u2013 for the last 3 or 4 months, our business in Europe are at the order rates and also trending the right direction.\nNicole DeBlase: And what \u2013 have you actually seen any slowdown in Europe or is that just reading the headlines and being concerned about what could materialize?\nTodd Bluedorn: We are starting to see things slow down.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. Okay, thanks. I will pass it on.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: And we will go to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Obviously, residential margins were exceptionally strong ex the prior year insurance benefit. I am just curious, can you \u2013 you think if volumes remain sort of high-single digit, low-double digits in the 4Q and maybe even \u201821, you can maintain above 40% incremental margins? And then within your commentary on the margins, I think you mentioned sourcing commodities actually now more the benefit than you expected last quarter. Is that mainly volume-related? And then, I am just surprised that freight isn\u2019t turning into a \u2013 it\u2019s more of a headwind. Can you just maybe just address what you are seeing on freight utilization?\nTodd Bluedorn: Freight remains tailwind this year, and part of that we were aggressive on \u2013 we are managing freight like we have managed over the last year or two, we have invested in Freight management like we did in NCR 15 years ago. And so, we have a pretty sophisticated team. We now have the tools to measure it. And so, I think part of it\u2019s just productivity on our side, regardless of what\u2019s happening with the overall rate, and we expect to be a tailwind this year and a bit of a headwind next year. In terms of residential margins, I think you sort of see a peak out in the current environment, where we had volume, we had done aggressive SG&A cost reduction and we had invested in stores because of the tornado. I think on an ongoing basis, since residentials 60% of our business, we talk about 30% incrementals. I think that\u2019s plus or minus what you should think about residential. I don\u2019t think it remains 40%, because we are investing in SG&A. We are investing in stores and we will start to back up in 2021. And so, we will have the investment headwind, if you will, that feeds the engine on an ongoing basis. And then was there another question? Did I miss anything?\nNigel Coe: I think actually you covered that one. Just wanted to touch back on the buyback comments, you mentioned \u201821 would be obviously a more normal year on buybacks. I think normal for you, Todd, would be 350 to 400 would be sort of the run rate. Is there any catch-up from the \u201820 air pocket on buybacks, or are we back to the $350 million, $400 million?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think the way to think about it is and you can run the model on your own, right, is we don\u2019t want debt-to-EBITDA to go above 2, that\u2019s sort of our peg point. And so, we will invest in the business with CapEx, we will do acquisitions, but we don\u2019t. And then what\u2019s left, we will pay dividends and share buyback. And so, I think you model all of that and I think we start to peg what we do. I don\u2019t think this year we will do $600 million or $700 million, if that\u2019s a direct question. But there maybe we do a little bit more, but it\u2019s all going to come down to that formula.\nNigel Coe: Okay, thanks a lot.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Our final question will be from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, how is it going?\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, Steve. Good.\nSteve Tusa: On tax rate, what\u2019s kind of the go forward you guys \u2013 is this kind of 19% to 20% the right number, and have you guys kind of evaluated? Does that kind of revert if there is \u2013 I know you like to talk politics, if that \u2013 if there is a blue wave or buy-in, does that revert to a certain level, maybe not back to where it was, but what\u2019s kind of the long-term view on the tax rate?\nTodd Bluedorn: As Joe mentioned in the script, we \u2013 for \u201821, we think tax rate is going to be 20% to 21%, so it goes back to more normal rate as we got it this year. We had some discrete items this year that allowed us to take it down. But 20%, 21% is what we are seeing next year. And then beyond that, who knows. But we will react whatever is done and we will adjust accordingly.\nSteve Tusa: Just going back to this kind of resi cycle discussion, so are you saying this year was kind of ended up being a normal year despite the pandemic, so there wasn\u2019t really a push or pull in and out of this year? And I know you guys had had that housing echo boom chart out there, we are kind of a couple of years into that chart. So, are we still thinking that that\u2019s the swing factor in this cycle? I mean, housing peaked in 5, 16-year useful life. I mean, is that still the way to think about it that \u201821 from an echo boom perspective is kind of a peak year or is there something that happened this year that kind of changes that profile?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think I would answer 2020 this year is we had a warm summer, and we also had a pandemic. And I think broadly they offset each other and we have flat market. So, I think if we didn\u2019t have a pandemic the market would have been up more. And I think if we hadn\u2019t had a hot summer, the market would have been down. And I think \u2013 we think the right comment is, when you look at the AHRI numbers, I am doing this from memory, but through August it\u2019s down about 3%. We think from a year-to-date basis, that\u2019s close to flat when it all shakes out.\nSteve Tusa: Right.\nTodd Bluedorn: So, that\u2019s our call. In terms of the market going forward, yes, I think we have been pretty consistent. I know we disagree, Steve, I know that. But we \u2013 when we model it and look at it, we still think we have another couple of years a mid single-digit growth, everything else maybe more. And if it\u2019s a hot summer, maybe better; cold summer will do worst.\nSteve Tusa: Is that echo boom analysis still in play or is there something else driving it?\nTodd Bluedorn: No, it\u2019s still in play.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then one last\u2026\nTodd Bluedorn: I don\u2019t think the pandemic pulled anything forward. If people are sort of saying there is another couple of years but it all got pulled in this year, I would say \u2013 no way, because it\u2019s flat market. Hot summer doesn\u2019t make any sense.\nSteve Tusa: Right, absolutely. And then just one last one on free cash flow, you have bounced around a bit here in the last couple of years, what is kind of the normalized conversion rate for you guys? And again, just to reaffirm, that\u2019s on a GAAP basis when you talk about conversion, right?\nTodd Bluedorn: It is. I read a note, it said 90%. I think if you look at a longer horizon, it\u2019s closer to a 100%, and that\u2019s our number, 100%. And this year we are having strong cash flow and that\u2019s obviously because \u2013 one, we performed EBIT wise, but obviously if you deflate working capital, you generate cash net. So, we did. And so, in the years where we were inflated working capital, we have more headwind in years where we were building Mexico, we have headwind and then tornado, so lots of moving pieces. But over a longer perspective, it\u2019s a business that will generate 100% of net income.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, I think [indiscernible] was talking about adjusted, to be clear, so that would be more close to 100% if it\u2019s on a GAAP basis, so just to be clear on that one. Alright, cool. Thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate it.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks. Thanks, everyone. To wrap up, the residential market remained strong entering the fourth quarter and commercial and refrigeration markets continued to improve. The Lennox team is executing well and taking advantage of market opportunities and share gains. We look forward to closing 2020 strong with momentum into 2021. And again, thanks everyone for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Todd and good morning everyone. I will provide some additional comments and financial details on business segments for the quarter starting with residential heating and cooling. In the third quarter, revenue from residential heating and cooling was a record $722 million, up 13%. Volume was up 11% and price and mix combined was up 2% and foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Residential profit was a third quarter record of $153 million, up 21% as reported over the prior quarter that included $16 million of insurance benefit. Segment margin was a third quarter record of 21.2%, which was up 140 basis points as reported over the prior quarter with the insurance benefit. Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price, lower material and other product cost, higher factory productivity and lower distribution and freight costs. Partial offsets included the year-over-year difference in insurance benefit, higher selling and incentive expenses and tariffs. Turning to our commercial heating and cooling business, commercial revenue was $208 million, down 18%. Volume was down 16%. Price and mix combined was down 2% and price flat and mix down. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Commercial segment profit was $39 million, down 18%. Segment margin ticked up 10 basis points to 18.7%. Segment profit was primarily impacted by lower volume driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable mix. Partial offsets included lower material cost, higher factory productivity, lower distribution cost and lower SG&A expense. In Refrigeration, third quarter revenue was $125 million, down 12%. Volume was down 16%, price and mix combined was up 2% and foreign exchange had a favorable 2% impact on revenue. Refrigeration segment profit was $13 million, down 34%. Segment margin was 10.4%, down 350 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by lower volume and lower factory efficiency due to the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable mix. Partial offsets included favorable price, lower material costs, lower SF&A expense and favorable foreign exchange. Regarding special items in the third quarter, the company had net after-tax charges totaling $4.4 million that included a $3.6 million loss from natural disasters net of insurance recoveries related to an August 2020 high-wind damage at the company's manufacturing facility in Iowa, $2.2 million for personal protective equipment and facility deep cleaning expenses incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a net charge of $1.4 million for various other items, and a benefit of $2.8 million for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. Corporate expenses were $28 million in third quarter compared to $18 million in the prior year quarter as the company's financial results in the third quarter triggered incentive compensation true-ups for performance year-to-date. Overall, SG&A was $152 million, up 6% from the prior year quarter. And for the first 9 months, SG&A is down 7%. In the third quarter, the company generated $440 million dollars of cash from operations compared to $236 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $12 million compared to approximately $25 million in the prior year quarter and free cash flow was $428 million in the quarter compared to $211 million in the prior year quarter. The company paid approximately $30 million in dividends in the quarter. Total debt was $1.01 billion at the end of the third quarter and we ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.8. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $59 million at the end of September. Now, before I turn it over to Q&A, I will review our current market assumptions and guidance points for 2020. For the industry overall, we now expect North American residential HVAC shipments to be roughly flat this year. We now expect both commercial unitary shipments and refrigeration shipments to be down approximately 20% for the industry this year. Looking at the company's performance year-to-date and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are raising our 2020 revenue guidance from a decline of 10% to 15% to a decline of 5% to 9% for the year. We are raising our guidance for GAAP EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.31 to $8.11 to a new range of $8.35 to $8.95 for the year. We are raising our guidance for adjusted EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.90 to $8.70 to a new range of $9.05 to $9.65 for the year. Looking at the various puts and takes in our financial guidance for 2020 that we are updating commodities are not expected to be a $25 million benefit for the year compared to prior guidance of a $20 million benefit. We now expect a $25 million benefit from sourcing and engineering lead cost reductions compared to prior guidance of a $20 million benefit. Residential mix is expected to be a headwind of approximately $10 million for the full year as new construction has outperformed replacement business year-to-date. Earlier expectations were for new construction to slow and mix to be flat. We now expect corporate expense of approximately $90 million compared to prior guidance of $75 million primarily due to higher compensation expense related to the company's performance. We now expect interest and pension expense of approximately $35 million compared to prior guidance of $40 million. We now expect an effective tax rate for the full year on an adjusted basis of 19% to 20% compared to the prior range of 21% to 22% due to the timing of certain tax benefits this year. And for 2021, we expect the effective tax rate to be back in the 21% to 22% range. Capital expenditures are now expected to be $100 million for this year from prior guidance of $120 million on the timing of some spending between 2020 and 2021. And our guidance for free cash flow is now approximately $425 million from the prior guidance of $340 million for the year. For our guidance points that are remaining the same, price is still expected to be a $25 million benefit for the year. Residential factory productivity is still expected to be a $10 million headwind. We still expect tariffs to be neutral and we continue to expect freight to be a $10 million benefit. The weighted average diluted share count for the full year is still expected to be between 38 million to 39 million shares and our stock repurchase plans remain on hold after repurchasing $100 million of stock in the first quarter for the $400 million that was planned going into the year. Now, with that, let's go to Q&A. Hi, Jeff."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Let me start with a quick overview on the third quarter that continues to be impacted by COVID-19 pandemic and then discuss our updated 2020 outlook. For the year, we are raising guidance for revenue, earnings and free cash flow driven by the continued strength in our residential business. Overall for the company in the third quarter, revenue was up 2% to $1.06 billion, the third quarter record. GAAP operating income was up 7% to a third quarter record of $167 million. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was up 16% to new high for any quarter of $3.42. Total adjusted segment profit was a third quarter record of $177 million, up 1% from the prior year quarter that included $16 million of insurance benefit. From an operational perspective, excluding the insurance benefit, total adjusted segment profit was up 11%. Total adjusted segment margin for the third quarter was 16.7% compared to 17% in the prior year quarter. From an operational perspective, excluding the insurance benefit in the third quarter last year, total adjusted segment margin was up 130 basis points. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up 6% to $3.53, a third quarter record. On our residential segment in the third quarter, revenue was up 13% to a new high for any quarter of $722 million. Revenue from replacement business is up low double-digits. Revenue from new construction was up mid-teens. Residential segment profit set a new record \u2013 excuse me, set a new third quarter record at $153 million, up 21%. Segment margin expanded about 140 basis points to a third quarter record of 21.2%. On an operational basis, excluding the insurance benefit in the prior year quarter, segment profit rose 38% and segment margin expanded 390 basis points. Our residential business benefited from continued strong market conditions and favorable hot weather in July and August. Consumers continue to replace units more than repair with equipment growth rate running multiples ahead of the parts growth rate. September turned significantly cooler, which continues to \u2013 which has continued to-date in October as contractors work towards winter and furnaces. Strength in the residential market continues and the team is executing well as it continues to take advantage of market opportunities to gain share. Turning to our commercial-facing businesses, they continue to be more heavily impacted from the pandemic than residential as expected. In the commercial business segment, revenue and profit were down 18%. Segment margin expanded 10 basis points to 18.7%. National account equipment revenue was down nearly 30% and regional and local revenue was down mid-teens. Breaking down revenue another way, replacement was down high-teens and new construction was down high 20s. On the service side, Linux national accounts service revenue was down low double-digits. VRF revenue was down low double-digits. While overall commercial equipment revenue was down 20% in the third quarter, we continue to see signs of relative improvement in the business with commercial equipment backlog currently down mid-teens year-over-year and order rates reflecting gradual improvement as well. Our commercial team continues to win new business decision for future growth. Commercial won 11 new national count customers in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 26. In addition, our commercial group has launched an initiative called Building Better Air that is focused on improving indoor air quality of commercial spaces. This initiative combines our innovative product line and industry leading building services to provide comprehensive IAQ solutions to commercial customers. We are helping business and building owners evaluate for HVAC systems recommend that comprehensive indoor air quality solution tailored to the building and identify a maintenance plan to ensure ongoing indoor air quality effectiveness. Turning to our Refrigeration business segment, revenue was down 14% at constant currency. North America was down high-teens and Europe was down high single-digits. Segment profit was down 34% and segment margin contracts at 350 basis points to 10.4%. Refrigeration profitability was impacted by negative mix with Europe down less than the U.S. in the quarter as well as factory inefficiencies due to COVID-19. As in the commercial business, we are seeing signs in Refrigeration of relative year-over-year improvement from the third quarter with backlog up and order rates reflecting strong improvement. A quick update on SG&A cost savings this year. Earlier this year, we enacted a $115 million SG&A savings program. Due to the improved performance of our end-markets and our strong operational performance, we have restored compensation and volume related SG&A costs. Several examples of what I am talking about are reinstituting pay for the temporary salary reduction, increase sales commissions and paying performance-based compensation. We are now planning for $65 million of SG&A savings this year, with 45% coming from discretionary spending, 40% from headcount reduction and the remaining 15% from paying incentives that return in 2021. To wrap up with our updated guidance on 2020, we are raising revenue, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Revenue is now expected to be down 5% to 9% for the full year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be $9.05 to $9.65 and free cash flow is expected to be approximately $425 million. We continue to face highly uncertain economic conditions in the fourth quarter and remain cautious on the potential impact from the pandemic heading into the winter season, but Lennox has a seasoned team, experience in managing through downturns, while continuing to invest in advanced accounting for the future. We look forward to closing 2020 strong with momentum into 2021. Now, over to Joe. Hey, Julian. Yes. On the first point, it's a combination both of uncertainty in the fourth quarter, but also we had such a strong third quarter if you are looking at it sequentially, year-over-year, I mean, it's a record third quarter for us. Our residential revenue was up 13% driven by hot weather so that helped. And so I think that's part of it. In terms of looking into 2021, on markets, we continue to remain bullish on the residential markets. There is lots of moving pieces, but we called \u2013 we are calling for the market to be flat this year. And I think that's an important perspective remember, I understand that some folks are wondering, did demand get pulled in to something from 2021 get pulled into the strong third quarter? Two points, I would make one overall, the market is going to be flat year-over-year in the middle of the pandemic. Second is just the behavior of a residential homeowner, even when there is not a pandemic, no one wants anyone into their house to replace the unit unless they have to and there is a catastrophic failure, they replace the unit. And especially in a pandemic, no one wants people coming into their houses and spending 2 or 3 days replacing the unit. So, these are being replaced when they break and they are not being repaired like they were during the financial crisis, but there has to be a proximate cause for them coming in and that's not pulling forward demand. No one is sort of saying let's replace it now rather than next summer. They are replacing it now when it breaks and they have no choice. And so we remain confident as we have talked before that we think there is another couple of years of this mid single-digit growth and for it to be flat in the middle of the pandemic shows the resiliency of this market. And so we remain confident in the resi market for 2021. I think the way I think about it is our new guide on the SG&A, take out $65 million. And then when you look at that $65 million, only 15% of it now is paying incentives, because so much came back into the P&L this year. So, the 15% that's paying incentives that will bounce back next year. So, that's whatever the math is, $7 million, $7.5 million, the balance of it, the 45% that's discretion and 40% is headcount, we control those. And it depends on how the market is performing and the investments that we want to make in the business. But our sort of goal of having 30% incremental margins is plus or minus what our target will be for next year. So, previously, our guide was $115 million with a lot more tied to paying incentives, I think that risk is now off the table for next year. It comes with it bouncing back on us in a meaningful way. Thank you. Hi, Ryan. I think we have caught it up somewhat out on the call. We have seen national accounts sell more than our local and regional business and that's what we would have expected just the way the market behaves that the planned replacement gets deferred as people sort through things. And so our planned replacement was down mid 20s versus a year ago, but in Q2 it was down over 40%. So the trend line on playing replacements going the right direction. And when you look at our order and backlog playing replacement as many companies are getting more comfortable in the current environment and some of our large customers are people like Home Depot, Lowe's, BestBuy, who are doing pretty well, are getting more comfortable spending. Emergency replacement was down 10%ish in the quarter after being down 35% in the second quarter, so again heading the right direction. And then new construction is the one that goes the other way, because new construction of things that were in flights continue to be built, but that new business starts to go down and we saw that down near 30% in third quarter after only being down mid-teens in second quarter. And then as we mentioned on the call the order, excuse me, the backlog is down mid-teens and so the backlog is heading in the right direction. But when we think about the full year, we still think the markets will be down 20%, the one silver lining in all that is the comp gets a lot easier next year. And so when we think about 2021 sort of which the way the world looks now that we would expect that the commercial market, commercial unitary market would be up after such a hard hit 2020. And when you look back on history of the commercial unitary market whether it's the 911 downturn or the financial crisis downturn, goes down hard comes back quickly. Yes, I mean, we tend not to quantify the market. And again, I think you heard in a way I talked about it, we think about it as a facilitator to win the equipment business. And our Build Better Air initiative is leveraging off our store capabilities in indoor air quality and our relationships with the building owner. And we are an industry leader in indoor air quality in both residential and commercial markets as we have talked about indoor air quality as air purification, like builders and UV lights, ventilation and circulation and humidity control. Our residential pure air equipment is the best in the industry, as noted by consumer reports and then we talked about building better air and our advantages and our opportunities there. Thanks. I just want to point out before your actual question that so many things changing in 2020, I personally have great comfort that the Pittsburgh Cleveland remains consistent over the decades. Okay, go ahead. Yes. The performances of the businesses were relatively consistent. They were both up plus or minus 13%. So, there wasn't one that outperformed the other. And then I read to note and I thought you raised valid questions around the AHRI numbers versus the HARDI numbers one being sell out, one being sell in and we take great comfort that our Lennox business performs very similar to our allied business, i.e., the sell-through or the sellout of our Lennox business directly to dealers to sell, the 13%, 14%, whatever the exact number was that and so that's a good sign for our Lennox business. Our allied business also did well. I think the direct question \u2013 answer to your question is inventories that are low right now, which is normal coming out of such a hot summer. And then what happens is there is [indiscernible] of short memories or however you want to phrase that of dealers. And so they had trouble getting cooling product in the summer, which many did because our competitors had trouble delivering. Then they want to make sure their bars are full with furnaces and so we see that right now as people are loading up on furnaces. Yes, we got it both in our European business and in our Tifton, Georgia business. If you look at Tifton, Georgia on a map, it was in one of the hardest hit areas for COVID in the country. And so that has some impact on our businesses and so absenteeism and then actually, having had the factories shutdown for a bit in both locations impacted our productivity. When you look at the backlog of commercial, as you know we are more exposed to retail there than we are in refrigeration and that's been a softer spot and then also in refrigeration, cold storage is one of our largest verticals and that's been relatively strong given that people are building up a cold chain to support different consumer buying habits and buying food at home and also maybe a bit of preparing for the vaccine. And so we have seen strength in cold storage and that's helped us. Thanks. Hey, good morning. The trend line during the months July and August were up mid-teens as I talked about on the second quarter earnings call we saw in July and then September was up significantly, but up more low double-digits, high single-digits as sort of got away from hot summer selling season. We are positioned as well or better than anyone in the industry to meet both cooling demand and furnace demand. So, we think we are in good shape. I think some of our competitors may have issues. And again, I think it gets more pronounced as if you have independent distributors trying to get large orders from you all at once and maybe our competitors are seeing some of that, but we think we are in good position as well or better than anyone in the industry to meet the upcoming furnaces. Yes. I will broaden the question and just sort of talk a little bit about 2021 more broadly, obviously lots of moving pieces. There is always uncertainty in October when you are thinking about the following year, but maybe as much now as ever. And I talked a little bit about the end-markets earlier I repeat that we walk out or almost out 2020 with a clear understanding of the resiliency of the residential market and again it's demand that's being caused by the home failing and remodel all that we think there is another couple of years of that. So, we think mid single-digits next year for residential and new constructions remains strong. For commercial and refrigeration, as I talked earlier, more uncertainty there, but after being down 25% \u2013 20% this year, we would expect some rebound in 2021. Directly to your question is we do expect some commodity headwind for next year, but I would also just mention, we have always historically said commodities that matter most to us are steel, copper, aluminum in that order. With all the work we have done on moving to aluminum and our heat exchangers across our business, it's now steel, aluminum and copper that's most important to us. And so while copper still matters, it matters significantly less than it did 4 or 5 years ago and aluminum I think is behaving more, nicely if you will, sound like the President with that terminology, but has behaved better. And so we expect some commodity headwind, we expect some freight headwind at the current point of time although that still has to be shaken out. And then if we talk about, we would expect a little bit of compensation bounce back given the takeout a reduction this year. But as always, we are going to be announcing a price increase here shortly. And we expect to get price next year just like we do every year. We are going to benefit from sourcing and engineering cost reductions. We talked about raising that number from $20 million to $25 million this year. And so that's order of magnitude that we have done for the last decade $20 million to $30 million depending on the year. Factory productivity after not really having much of any factory productivity issue, because of all the disruptions because of COVID, we will get back on track there. And then as always, our target of 0.5 point of market share gain. So I know I haven't quantified a lot of those, but it's to send a signal that we think the setup for next year will be not dissimilar to the setup of prior years, where we have markets saw share gain, priced offset commodities and then continued productivity and material costs and factory productivity. Good morning I am not sure to be honest with you, John. Maybe we can sort of guide that I think that the commodities, I think people are scrambling diligently to sort of find, I think the commodities can't tamper down as we go through the year, where the material cost reduction starts, continues to increase as we go through the year. So, if I had to guess I would say commodities are around $20 million, $22 million year-to-date and then MCR, I think the raise is just confidence that we will continue to execute for the balance of the year. I will answer the second question first and not as you, John, have heard others talk about that. I don't think that's how it works. And what I mean by that is I don't think people set their thermostats to 85 when they go to work and then when they come home, they set it to 68. That I think the majority of people don't even set their thermostats on a timer, it just sort of remains constant over time. And then I think people raise it, maybe to 78, 80 when they are gone and then 75 when they get back. So I don't \u2013 in terms of usage that doesn't drive a spike up where units all of a sudden have huge acceleration of use of breakage. And so I just step back and say the market is flat year-over-year in 2020, that doesn't show pull forward to me, it's flat and a hot summer. So, the market is flat and hot summer that doesn't show pull forward to me that shows people were hesitant to spend money unless they had to, but when the unit breaks, they replace the unit rather than repaired it. I don't think there is \u2013 I don't think anything was pulled forward, because people were at home. Remind me what the first question was? Yes, one give me personal privilege to just sort of observe that when we lost because of tornado everyone assumed we would never get it back and now that we have taken it from others, there is an assumption that maybe we won't be able to hang on to it. I think a couple of things. I think haven't been on the other end of it, we were cognizant the constrained supply environment to supply the dealers who we thought we had the best chance of keeping business to sellers. We weren't selling arms to anybody. We were selling arms to our units to those dealers who we thought we had. We are already sort of in the conversations with and converting over and those are the ones we sold to. So, we may \u2013 we are not hang-on to all that we get, but we are going to hang on to a lot of it, a whole lot of it. And then we are also on the attack to gain more share. So, I remain confident that we will \u2013 we are gaining significant share this year and I am confident we will gain share. Yes. Good morning, Deepa. Yes. I will be more direct put it in your model. We are not going to start it up here in fourth quarter getting some of the uncertainty, but when we give the December guide for 2021, we will be back to a more normal stock repurchase program for 2021. Our variable gross margin is around 40%. So volume drops through it sort of a normal 40% either direction and then obviously in a year, where we are spending SG&A and doing other things then the incrementals, goes down. And so that, that's how we end up with the 30% incremental that we are making investments into business building out distribution, driving productivity, but the third normal volume leverage is about 40%. Thanks, Gautam. Yes, I mean I am going with hope what we will announce will be what we always announce publicly for the second quarter what the final number is going to be. So, we will announce price, but yes, I do think there is when we expect the market to be up after having been constrained the year before. That sort of leads you to believe you can get price in the marketplace as we spoke about when we are having challenge meeting demand as we did \u2013 as the whole industry did in 2020 wasn't really the right time to raise price dynamically the middle of a season. When we go into next year, we will be looking to raise price and for a couple of reasons. One, we talked about commodities. COVID has added cost to our cost structure. We talked a little bit about what happened in our refrigeration margins because of it, but quite frankly, it's impacting the entire business both on the SG&A side and we think we have to do to manage suppliers and manage our own business, absenteeism in our factories and then we think rate is going to be up. So, those are all reasons on why we are going to need to pass price on and I think our \u2013 in fact, I know our competitors see the same for us. Yes, I mean \u2013 I maybe \u2013 I don't know what the right phrase is, maybe more clear-eyed on IAQ. I don't think its billions and billions and billions of dollars of opportunity at least in unitary, where we play and in residential. I think if you are showing $5,000 residential units, your indoor air quality component is $400 or $500. On commercial, it's maybe less of a percentage. So, I don't think it drives the overall ticket. I think what happens is you have to have knowledge and expertise in it for those customers who want it and you want to steer customers who wanted to be able to handle their questions. And so, commercial customers have Build Better Air, sit down with them, talk about what we have and we have everything, and then put it in place and then use our NAS, our national account service to measure and monitor the compliance. In our residential business, it's our PureAir S, which has both passive filters and active UV lights that allows us to clean air and then also it's digitized, so those part of our iComfort controller. You can measure and monitor what's going on. And so I think it's being an expert in the area that allows you to win the jobs and convert dealers and that's where we are focused on. Thanks. Good morning, Nicole. That's the answer. I know the sequence of the quarter is different this year. By the way, they are going to be different next year and we will talk about that in December. But we are typically at this point in time driving down production levels and burning off inventory. But given the hot summer selling season and given that we expected the markets to be down, while we saw summer selling season was a burn off of inventory, burn off of receivables, payables and then what we see in Q4 is on a year-over-year basis the inflation of inventory and working capital. And so that's why you see \u2013 we typically have the big cash quarter, fourth quarter. This year, we had the big cash quarter in third quarter. Yes, I mean, our backlog is up year-over-year, right now where we stand, and the order rates on a 3, 6, 9-week basis are all up in refrigeration. So, the trend lines are good. I think it's both. In our North America business, there is distribution business where we sell through \u2013 about half of its distribution business we sell through large refrigeration wholesalers and that has bounced back from being down significantly in second quarter. And then the other business is project business or our cold storage. And that, as I mentioned earlier, has been relatively strong. Our Europe business has been strong. But we are a little, obviously, a little over-concerned about COVID and lockdowns in France and Spain and what the trend line is there. But again, on \u2013 for the last 3 or 4 months, our business in Europe are at the order rates and also trending the right direction. We are starting to see things slow down. Thanks. Freight remains tailwind this year, and part of that we were aggressive on \u2013 we are managing freight like we have managed over the last year or two, we have invested in Freight management like we did in NCR 15 years ago. And so, we have a pretty sophisticated team. We now have the tools to measure it. And so, I think part of it's just productivity on our side, regardless of what's happening with the overall rate, and we expect to be a tailwind this year and a bit of a headwind next year. In terms of residential margins, I think you sort of see a peak out in the current environment, where we had volume, we had done aggressive SG&A cost reduction and we had invested in stores because of the tornado. I think on an ongoing basis, since residentials 60% of our business, we talk about 30% incrementals. I think that's plus or minus what you should think about residential. I don't think it remains 40%, because we are investing in SG&A. We are investing in stores and we will start to back up in 2021. And so, we will have the investment headwind, if you will, that feeds the engine on an ongoing basis. And then was there another question? Did I miss anything? I think the way to think about it is and you can run the model on your own, right, is we don't want debt-to-EBITDA to go above 2, that's sort of our peg point. And so, we will invest in the business with CapEx, we will do acquisitions, but we don't. And then what's left, we will pay dividends and share buyback. And so, I think you model all of that and I think we start to peg what we do. I don't think this year we will do $600 million or $700 million, if that's a direct question. But there maybe we do a little bit more, but it's all going to come down to that formula. Thanks. Hey, Steve. Good. As Joe mentioned in the script, we \u2013 for \u201821, we think tax rate is going to be 20% to 21%, so it goes back to more normal rate as we got it this year. We had some discrete items this year that allowed us to take it down. But 20%, 21% is what we are seeing next year. And then beyond that, who knows. But we will react whatever is done and we will adjust accordingly. I think I would answer 2020 this year is we had a warm summer, and we also had a pandemic. And I think broadly they offset each other and we have flat market. So, I think if we didn't have a pandemic the market would have been up more. And I think if we hadn't had a hot summer, the market would have been down. And I think \u2013 we think the right comment is, when you look at the AHRI numbers, I am doing this from memory, but through August it's down about 3%. We think from a year-to-date basis, that's close to flat when it all shakes out. So, that's our call. In terms of the market going forward, yes, I think we have been pretty consistent. I know we disagree, Steve, I know that. But we \u2013 when we model it and look at it, we still think we have another couple of years a mid single-digit growth, everything else maybe more. And if it's a hot summer, maybe better; cold summer will do worst. No, it's still in play. I don't think the pandemic pulled anything forward. If people are sort of saying there is another couple of years but it all got pulled in this year, I would say \u2013 no way, because it's flat market. Hot summer doesn't make any sense. It is. I read a note, it said 90%. I think if you look at a longer horizon, it's closer to a 100%, and that's our number, 100%. And this year we are having strong cash flow and that's obviously because \u2013 one, we performed EBIT wise, but obviously if you deflate working capital, you generate cash net. So, we did. And so, in the years where we were inflated working capital, we have more headwind in years where we were building Mexico, we have headwind and then tornado, so lots of moving pieces. But over a longer perspective, it's a business that will generate 100% of net income. Thanks. Thanks, everyone. To wrap up, the residential market remained strong entering the fourth quarter and commercial and refrigeration markets continued to improve. The Lennox team is executing well and taking advantage of market opportunities and share gains. We look forward to closing 2020 strong with momentum into 2021. And again, thanks everyone for joining us today."

Now let me turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Todd Bluedorn.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Let me start with a quick overview on the second quarter that was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and then discuss the updated outlook for 2020, in which we\u2019re raising guidance for revenue and earnings for the year. For the second quarter, company revenue was $941 million, down 14%. GAAP operating income was $136 million, down 36%, and GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $2.62, down 7%. The second quarter last year included an insurance benefit of $26 million and a pension settlement charge of $61 million. Total segment profit was $153 million, down 24% from the prior year quarter that included an $18 million insurance benefit. From an operational perspective excluding the insurance benefit, total segment profit was down 17%. Total segment margin for the second quarter was 16.3%, down 210 basis points as reported and down 50 basis points from an operational perspective. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $2.97, down 21% as reported and down 12% from an operational perspective. And our Residential segment in the second quarter revenue was down 6%; revenue from replacement business is now high single digits; revenue from new construction was down low single digits. Residential segment profit was $127 million, down 17% as reported and down 6% on an operational basis excluding the $18 million insurance benefit in the second quarter a year-ago. Segment margin was 19.7% in the second quarter, down 260 basis points as reported and up 10 basis points on an operational basis. Our Residential business improved each month through the quarter and was up 7% in June as the economy continued to reopen and weather heated up for the summer. Cooling degree days for the second quarter overall were up 4% from the prior year quarter. For the month of June, cooling degree days were up 12% from last year. The hot weather has continued month to date in July and we're seeing strong Residential growth on excellent operational execution by the team to capitalize on market opportunities. Turning to our commercial-facing businesses, they're more heavily impacted from the pandemic as we expected. On the Commercial business segment, revenue was down 28%, segment profit was down 34%, and segment margin contracted 170 basis points to 18.9%. National account revenue was down approximately 40% and regional and local revenue was down approximately 20%. Breaking down the revenue another way; replacement was down 35%, and new constructions down nearly 20%. On the service side, Lennox National Account Service revenue was down about 20%, VRF revenue was up low single digits. While overall commercial equipment was down 30% in the second quarter, we're seeing signs of relative improvement in the business with commercial equipment backlog currently down 20% year-over-year. Commercial continues to win new business and position for future growth. Commercial won 15 new national account customers in the first half, including 6 in the second quarter. Turning to our Refrigeration business segment. Revenue was down broadly across our businesses in North America and Europe, declined 26% at constant currency. Segment profit was down 53%, and segment margin contracted 460 basis points to 8.2%.North America revenue was down more than 20% and Europe revenue was down about 30%. As in our Commercial business, we are seeing signs of relative improvement in refrigeration as well. Backlog is down approximately 20% year-over-year. Overall for the company for the second half of the year, we continue to face highly uncertain market conditions. Our stock repurchase program remains on hold, currently given the high uncertainty. But we continue to be encouraged by the performance of Residential business and relative improvement in the Commercial and Refrigeration businesses. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and expect a strong year of cash flow generation. We continue to target $340 million of free cash flow for 2020. The company has executed well on its $115 million of in-year SG&A savings for 2020, and we manage decremental EBIT margin of 20% on an operational basis in the second quarter. We are raising our financial guidance for 2020 and now expect adjusted revenue to be down 10% to 15% and adjusted EPS from continuing operations within a range of $7.90 to $8.70. As I turn it over to Joe, I will just mention that Lennox has a seasoned team with experience managing through economic downturns, while continuing to invest and advance the company's position. All of us are focused on capitalizing on market opportunities and share gains. Now over to Joe.\nJoe Reitmeier: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, starting with Residential Heating & Cooling. In the second quarter, revenue from Residential Heating & Cooling was $645 million, down 6%. Volume was down 8% and price and mix combined was up 2%, and foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Residential profit was $127 million, down 17% as reported. Segment margin was 19.7%, down 260 basis points as reported. Segment profit was negatively impacted by the year-over-year difference in the insurance benefit, higher warranty expense and the COVID-19 pandemic that led to lower volume to factory inefficiencies. Partial offsets included, favorable price and mix, lower material, freight and distribution costs and lower SG&A expense. Turning to our Commercial Heating & Cooling business. Commercial revenue was $188 million, down 28%. Volume was down 27%, price and mix combined was down 1%, with price up and mix down. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Commercial segment profit was $36 million, down 34%. Segment margin contracted 170 basis points to 18.9%. Segment profit was negatively impacted by unfavorable mix, higher warranty expense and the COVID-19 pandemic that led to lower volume. Partial offsets included lower material, freight and distribution costs and lower SG&A expense. In Refrigeration, second quarter revenue was $108 million, down 27%. Volume was down 27%, price and mix combined was up 1% and foreign exchange had a negative 1% impact on revenue. Refrigeration segment profit was $9 million, down 53%. Segment margin was 8.2%, down 460 basis points. Segment profit was impacted by higher warranty expense and the COVID-19 pandemic that led to lower volume and factory inefficiencies. Partial offsets included lower material, freight and distribution costs, lower SG&A expense and favorable foreign exchange. Regarding special items in the second quarter, the company had net after tax charges totaling $13.4 million. This included $7.9 million for the restructuring activities, $2.6 million for personal protective equipment and facility deep cleaning expense incurred due to the pandemic, and net $2.9 million in charges for various other items. Corporate expenses were $19 million in the second quarter, down 22% from the prior year quarter. Overall, SG&A was $130 million, down 15% from the prior year quarter. In the second quarter, the company generated $105 million of cash from operations compared to $30 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $19 million compared to $16 million in the prior year quarter that also had approximately $6 million of proceeds from insurance. free cash flow was approximately $87 million in the -- up in the quarter compared to $20 million in the prior year quarter. The company paid approximately $30 million in dividends in the quarter. Total debt was $1.39 billion at the end of the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.4. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $49 million at the end of June. Now, before I turn it over to Q&A, I will review our current market assumptions and guidance points for 2020. For the industry, overall, we expect North American residential HVAC shipments to be down mid-teens. We expect both commercial unitary shipments and refrigeration shipments to be down 25% for the industry. Looking at the company's performance in the first half of the year and the outlook for the second half, we are raising 2020 revenue guidance from a range of down 11% to 17% to a new range of down 10% to 15%. We are raising 2020 guidance for GAAP EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.07 to $8.07 to a new range of $7.31 to $8.11 for the year. We are raising 2020 guidance for adjusted EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.50 to $8.50 to a new range of $7.90 to $8.70 for the year. The various puts and takes in our financial guidance for 2020 remain unchanged. We continue to expect a benefit of approximately $25 million in net price for the year. We still expect a $20 million benefit from sourcing and engineering lead cost reductions. Residential factory productivity is still expected to be a $10 million headwind. Residential mix is still expected to be flat, and we still expect tariffs to be neutral. Commodities are expected to be a $20 million benefit this year, and we continue to expect freight to be a $10 million benefit. Now, a few other points to mention in our financial outlook. Corporate expenses are still targeted to be $75 million. And as we talked about last quarter, we have taken $115 million of SG&A cost reduction actions in total to benefit the second, third and fourth quarters of this year. Net interest expense and other expense guidance remains approximately $40 million. And we still expect an effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22% on an adjusted basis for the full year. We continue to expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full-year to be between 38 million to 39 million shares. We repurchased $100 million of stock in the first quarter and the $400 million plan going into this year. Our stock repurchase plans currently remain on hold. We continue to target capital expenditures of $120 million this year. And our guidance for free cash flow remains approximately $340 million for the year. And with that, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Maybe just the first question on the revenue outlook. So it looks like your guidance on revenue implies the second half is down mid-teens year-on-year, so similar to the Q2 decline. But you seem to have better momentum in Residential. And you even talked about stabilization in the other two divisions. So maybe just help us understand that second half revenue outlook.\nTodd Bluedorn: I'll be very clear. So I won't dance around the question. If the market environment remains like it is today, we're going to do better than the midpoint of our guide. The concern that we have is that there's a lot of moving pieces, both medically with the pandemic and the impact that it has on end markets. And so we baked that into our guide, but if you've been asked a question, I'll answer a question in July, our Residential business was up mid-teen. So we have strength in July. And if things stay the way it is, we're going to do better than the guide, but the concern is a changing world and a changing marketplace, and that\u2019s reflected in the guide.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. And then just secondly on the profit margins. Maybe clarify if you can, how much of that $115 million of SG&A cost out is still left to be booked in the P&L in the second half? And also clarify the decremental margin, I realize there's different categories of it, but I think if you take the adjusted number of 20% in Q2, are we right in thinking that the second half you're assuming that's around the mid-teens number at the midpoint of guidance?\nTodd Bluedorn: I will answer the last part first, yes, you're right to assume that second half of the year it's mid to high teens is the adjusted number of decrementals at the current guide. On the first part of the question, as we -- as we think about the $115 million this way, we implemented May 1 the vast -- or all the cost reductions were implemented by May 1, and the salary reductions were implemented effective May 1. And so I would think about May and June sort of full run rate savings for the $115 million and then third, fourth -- third and fourth quarter will be all three months will be run rate of the saving.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, gentlemen.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, Jeff. I want to start with your headline in your note of weather beats COVID was the best headline I\u2019ve seen in a while. I enjoyed it.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. I give my associate credit for that. So just we -- in our checks, we picked up a lot about supply chain. I know some facilities, not yours were shut down in Mexico. And I think your inventories on your balance sheet are low. Can you just speak to -- it seems like certainly Residential coming in better and just your ability to kind of manage inventory, manage demand, get the right product to your dealers.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, we did a really good job in second quarter. And there's a continual triage going on, I think across corporate America, certainly within our industry and certainly within our company, almost a whack-a-mole is another analogy, but our team and suppliers have done a great job through this. Our supply chain is flowing and our manufacturing plants are all up and running and we're focusing on meeting the demand in the market. I think we're as good or better positioned than anyone in the industry as we flow through the balance of the year.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. And then just on Commercial, I think you said some signs of stabilization what's getting better is that just work stoppages abating, or are you seeing kind of better -- where are you seeing better trends ultimately?\nTodd Bluedorn: Let me go a little bit into detail on the questions, Jeff. When I think -- we think about the commercial unitary business North America, really think about it in three parts. About 40% of the market is planned replacement. That's primarily for national accounts. We expected a quick decline in that and we saw that in April, May orders were down 40%, 50%. But they picked up and are stronger in June, so that the clients may be half of that at this point. 20% of the market is new construction and commercial new construction didn't drop as quickly as what we saw in the planned replacement, because planned replacement is discretionary, people can make the decision right away. New construction projects are ongoing. So we didn't see that drop early, but we're now starting to see that drop. And 40% is emergency replacement or flow business sort of like the residential business. It's slowed down, but not at all like national accounts that\u2019s been more in the 15 -- down 15%, 20% during the process. So, that's a lot of words, but I think the answer to your question is where we've seen improvement has been planned replacement national accounts where we have an outside position. As I mentioned in the script, while revenue was down 30% in Q2, our backlog is down about 20%.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. Thanks, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: Couple of questions. First, I was wondering any discernible trend on mix in resi? Are you seeing a mix down or because mix held up pretty well in July and \u2026\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. I mean, the mix in the Residential business was up slightly in the second quarter. We're still guiding for it to be flat year-over-year. There's lots of moving pieces on mix in any given quarter, but I think one strength is our Lennox branded product performed better than our ally branded product, and at the gross margin level it has higher margins.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. So you're not seeing a mix. And then secondly, just competitively, have you seen any change in behavior from your principal competitors in the U.S on the resi side?\nTodd Bluedorn: No change in behaviors. That's a specific question about Trane and Carrier that's often asked. I mean, I don't think it's a secret and certainly not a secret in the industry that Goodman's had some production issues, and that's opened up some opportunities for us and others in the industry to sort of pick up some of the business that Goodman hasn't been able to meet.\nGautam Khanna: And lastly, just pricing. I mean, obviously you're getting a little bit of price mix hasn't been worse. So any potential to actually raise prices in this environment, or is it not supportive of that type of dynamic?\nTodd Bluedorn: The pricing is more as you go into the season, you put a price in place and we have a price in place. And again, we have long standing relationships with these customers, with these customers, with these dealers. And sort of in a hot summer to raise prices, you really don't want to do that. So I think we are going to get the price that we committed to and the markets help and support that with the demand.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you. Nice results.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nDeepa Raghavan: Hey, good morning.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning.\nDeepa Raghavan: Okay. New construction pretty, I mean, strong, just given results especially in Residential. Curious how you're thinking about new construction trends for rest of the year? This is residential question. And would that be -- would that pays better than replacement?\nTodd Bluedorn: Our best guess is that it won't stay better than replacement. I think new construction, although it's been very resilient and low interest rates are helping. Our best guess is second half of the year that tails off and add on or replacement which has -- which was increasing sequentially stronger April, May and June continues to hang in there. And so we expect new construction to tail off. Another thing that I just want to weave into the conversation around some of our confidence about add on or replacement is, if you remember, Deepa and others on the call, during the great financial crisis, the canary in the coal mine in our industry was parts sales started to grow very quickly and that was an indicator that people were repairing rather than replacing. We haven't seen that yet. So what we saw in the second quarter was that for our Lennox business, our residential replacement was down low single digits, while parts were down high single digits. And for -- just for the month of June in our Lennox business, our residential replacement was up mid-teens and parts and supplies were up 1%. So we're not seeing anything like we saw during the financial crisis. And to me that's an indication that our replacements hanging in there and I would expect new construction to slow down.\nDeepa Raghavan: Got it. Thanks for the color. My follow-up is on cost actions. The last time we spoke about cost actions, because some of them are temporary mostly on the salary front. Just given how Residential trends have outpaced expectations in Q2 and how July is trending strong. I understand the uncertainty ahead, but how are you thinking about the timeline of rolling back some of those temporary measures, and does your guide range to assume any rollback, at least at the better end of it?\nJoe Reitmeier: Our guide range assumes our perspective on how the balance of the year is going to play out. And I understand that sounds like a political answer. So, yes, it encompasses our best guess of things coming back. In terms of the $115 million coming back, about 40% of the $115 million were what we call pay temporary salary reductions, STI [ph] or short-term incentive that sort of thing. And as we do better in 2020, especially second half of the year, I can imagine someone that would come back, but that's all encompassed by our guide. So there won't be bad news that we give you later because we decided to pull some of it back.\nDeepa Raghavan: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And next we go to line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, Todd, just my first question, there's a lot -- there's been a lot of commentary around the length of the resi replacement cycle and how far we are into that specific cycle. Do you think that the kind of changes is working from home dynamic, potentially taxing, HVAC systems actually changes the trajectory of that cycle? Just love -- we'd love any color around that.\nTodd Bluedorn: I think it could. I don't -- the honest answer is, I don't know. But when you think about it, I think about people working at home, it becomes their Island, it becomes their life, perhaps if you will, and the desire to sort of invest in it and protect it. Now, I think that's in a world where unemployment doesn't go back up to 20% and that people have money to spend. But certainly the repair versus replace dynamic I talked about earlier supports that answer, that things have changed. I also think as we said for a while, it's an inexact science and some -- not you, Joe, the -- any work Goldman does is spot on, but other sell-side models have attempted to sort of guess how this is going to work. There's some false precision. I'm not sure anyone would have guessed that with degree cooling days up 4% that we would see this kind of performance in the face of COVID including us. And so I think the market is pretty resilient.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, good to hear. And I guess just the second question, just thinking about the Commercial business, appreciate the breakdown that you guys gave us. So when you kind of think about this opportunity for like the potential service tail that come back quicker, and I know that we're in a bit of a difficult time right now with the surging continuing in the U.S., but how are you thinking about the -- just like the service tail to that business specifically for you guys and your ability to get onsite access to do -- to repairs and service on your commercial equipment?\nTodd Bluedorn: We have access. We have access today. Our North American -- NAS, our North America service business were up and running. We never shut down. We are an essential business. ON the product that we sell through our distributor, through our dealers, they are essential businesses, that are onsite. They're working. And so the service revenue were down and in second quarter we expect it to be flat, maybe even up second half of the year. And then on -- I talked a little bit about planned replacement that goes down steep, and I think it comes back steep too. So when it comes back, it comes back quickly. I think you have to have a bit more of a green light than what we have now, although, as I mentioned it's gone -- the order rate is gone from being down 40%, 50% in April, May time to half of that now. So it's not healthy, but it's certainly better than it was a couple of months ago.\nJoe Ritchie: Great. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning.\nJohn Walsh: Good morning, John.\nJohn Walsh: I guess just a question about the strength of the exit rates you're seeing and trying to understand if any of that, or if you can quantify how much of that is kind of from contractors, maybe not getting into a house, as we were kind of more at the peak of COVID in those kind of April and May months. Is some of this a catch up of that, or do you think -- we're at -- these exit rates are something we can kind of roll forward?\nTodd Bluedorn: You broke up a little bit on the beginning of the question. So can you restate it for me, John?\nJohn Walsh: Oh, sorry. I was just thinking about if some of the strength in the exit rates you're seeing is kind of a catch up from when contractors couldn't get into people's homes to do kind of replaced regular maintenance?\nTodd Bluedorn: No, I don't think so. I think when we talk [technical difficulty] when we talked to our contractors, I mean, they've had access to the entire time. I think it has to do with the hot June. And so degree cooling days going up 4% for the quarter were up -- I'm looking at my notes to make sure I have the right number.\nJoe Reitmeier: 12%.\nTodd Bluedorn: We are up 12% \u2026\nJoe Reitmeier: For June.\nTodd Bluedorn: \u2026 in June. So that warm weather helped us in June. I think the other thing that we're going to have to see is, we think we can share in the second quarter. In fact, I know we gained share in the second quarter because I see the industry data, and we had mentioned exiting 2019 that we had regained business with 80% of our contractors that have -- and dealers that have been impacted by the tornado and we're now seeing that flow through in our volumes. We also -- as I mentioned in the first quarter call in the last fourth quarter call, that we are focused on new business and we had a significant backlog of additional new business coming into the year. And we're seeing the benefits from that. And as I mentioned earlier, some of the issues that our competitor or competitors producing products. So I think it's a combination of a repair versus -- replace versus repair, staying in place, some hot weather. But I actually think share gain is one of the largest reasons we have such a strong June and quite frankly, we\u2019ve a very strong July.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thanks for that. And then, just curious if you're seeing your customers on the resi or the commercial side do more add-ons around indoor air quality. I don't know if that rolls into the mix piece, but just trying to see if there -- they might not go higher on the sphere, but they're doing other add-on that you might be able to benefit on as you capture that?\nTodd Bluedorn: Indoor air quality scenario, we focused on for years, both in residential and commercial. And when you think about in sort of a bit of a baseline for folks online, John, when we think about indoor air -- well, I think when industry thinks about indoor air quality, it's about air purification, which is filters, HEPA filters and UV lights without ventilation and circulation. And then third is about humidity control. And it's always about balancing bringing in outside air and that's part of the ventilation in that humidity control, and also the capacity, as you bring out the outside air that's untreated. We\u2019re definitely seeing increased interest in IAQ, indoor air quality in both Residential and Commercial. Our Residential pure air equipment is the best in the street. And that's just not our saying that, that's consumer reports and Commercial similar to Residential. We work with our customers to address their solutions. So I think it's important. And I think it's about you have to have the capability to win the customer and serve the customer, but it's not a big enough dollar item, even if people add it to the mix of the equipment to sort of have an outsized impact on sales and margin. I think it's about a binary item that you have to have this capability to be able to talk to your customers and customers and your dealer contractor customers to win business, and we're well positioned to do that.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we go to the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning, Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: Just maybe starting with the free cash flow guidance, just curious why that's not also moving higher as EPS was higher and maybe same topic, any thoughts around working capital, potentially flipping to an inflow in the second half of the year?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think we'll still continue to generate cash from working capital in the second half of the year. Given the caution that I identified around the EPS, even a greater caution around cash flow, just historically our ability to forecast it. So, I mean $340 million is our best guess right now, but similar to what I've said on earnings, if the world stays the way it is, we'll do better than $340 million.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay. Got it. Thanks, Todd. And then second question, just around the potential for dealer inventory restocking. I know that was something that hadn't really happened, obviously because of COVID as it normally does seasonally. Are you starting to see dealers restock inventory? And if not, is that -- and does that create potential for more uplift in 3Q, if that does start to happen?\nTodd Bluedorn: We've seen dealers restock in second quarter and hopefully if the weather continues to be hot, and it's a strong July and August, we'll see some more sort of loading on the distributor level, which is our allied business, which does 20% or so of what we do. It's more of an impact of when distributors decide to reload and they put off a broad degree April and May. We start to see them reload and sort of do some buying in June -- significant buying in June. And so I think that's where there's more momentum and sort of replenishing the channel for us. It's on our allied channel on the Lennox side, dealer started buying in May, June.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: And next we go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Todd, on the surface, the comps start looking tougher in the back half. I'm just wondering if you could give us a little color as we try to think about Q3 and this really strong result here in July. How the comps for the remainder of the quarter kind of play out, and was July particularly easy this year?\nTodd Bluedorn: No, I don\u2019t -- I'm doing a little bit from memory, I'll be honest with you, Jeff. I didn't spill up on that exact question. I don't -- July wasn't necessarily easy last year. As I recollect, we had a cool beginning to the summer last year. And so I think May and June, maybe -- might've been easier, but we saw that in degree cooling days and I think July was sort of a normal July for us. And then as I remember fourth quarter, we pitched about warm weather and the impact that it had on our furnace stations. So I think -- I don't think the comps are that dramatically harder. I think that when you look at the reported numbers, the tornado impact was much more pronounced during the first half of year than was second half of the year. But when you sort of adjust for the tornado impact, the comps weren't that much different.\nJeff Sprague: And on the factory inefficiency side, can you give us some sense of what we're talking about? Is that the -- just the $10 million that Joe mentioned, or there's just kind of other, perhaps harder to measure kind of noise, efficient -- inefficiencies going on in the factories?\nJoe Reitmeier: The inefficiencies were driven by both traditional absorption, right, which is we don't have the volume, so the fixed costs don't get absorbed. And then there's -- absenteeism is up a bit. As you could expect our factories that are in places like Georgia and Iowa and South Carolina, where there has been COVID and that has impact. I broadly think about it as we entered the year saying we were going to get $10 million of factory productivity, and now we're saying we're going to have $10 million of inefficiencies. So $20 million swing is what I would think about, driven both by volume and by the absenteeism, right.\nJeff Sprague: And then finally what do you need to see to restart the share repurchase? Everything you said here today sounds pretty constructive. Obviously, the future is cloudy, but anything in particular you need to see just another quarter under your belt, how are you thinking about that?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think the world is still changing quickly. So I think we certainly need another quarter under our belt. We will see how third quarter goes. And I think I've been -- I don't know if I said this on an earnings call, but I certainly have said publicly before. I think the other issue that we have to continue to ensure up is we've asked for shared sacrifice from our employees around pay cuts and zero bonuses. I think we have to start making some of the [indiscernible] before we aggressively make investment in share buyback. I think we've got sort of balanced on how the benefits flow out.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. We've covered a lot of ground already, Todd. So thinking about -- just take a step back and going back to 2Q and I'm looking at the kind of the cadence month-by-month. I'm not looking for a blow-by-blow count here. But the plus 7 in June, do we need to do any adjustments on sales -- selling days, because I think a lot of companies had to upsell days in June. Any distortions there, or is that plus 7, a good exit rates for 3Q in your view?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think the plus 7 is good. That's it.\nNigel Coe: Okay, great. And then on the inventory side, obviously your inventory is \u2026\nTodd Bluedorn: [Multiple speakers] I'd say the up mid-teens in July, I know that for a fact is day for day.\nNigel Coe: Right. Exactly. Yes. And then inventory down 10% from 4Q, which is obviously very unusual -- these are unusual times. What needs to happen given -- it seems Residential continues with this mid-teens cadence through 3Q. Do you actually need to raise production levels to kind of restock? I mean -- and then any color you have on where that inventory -- how that looks by business would be helpful? I'm just wondering, your free cash flow guidance, I wonder how much of that's embed some level of inventory kind of rebuild for you. And then any color on income taxes in 3Q? We're seeing some deferrals of income tax payments as well.\nTodd Bluedorn: On the inventory build, we started -- I don't know if it's 6 weeks ago, 7 weeks ago, 8 weeks ago, as soon as we started to see the markets and how they were behaving, we ramped up production. So we've already ramped up production to stay ahead of the demand curve. And as I said earlier we're all in the summer when it's hot, you have to work through both the supply chain and inventory levels lay on top of that COVID. So our teams are working hard, but we feel we're in a great position and certainly as good as anyone in the industry to meet demand. And I'm not sure I understood the question on taxes.\nNigel Coe: Yes. With the CARES Act, I think there was a bump down in cash tax payments into July from \u2026\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, it's a bit of a cash bump for us on the timing of the cash. But honestly it's the minimis for us.\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes, it's a modest benefit for quarter or two, but once again it's a timing issue.\nNigel Coe: Okay, great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And our next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBreindy Goldring: Hi, this is Breindy on for Josh.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey.\nBreindy Goldring: I wanted to ask about how the tornado customer reacquisition was going in this current environment? And in terms of the incentives and rebates that -- how that was trending versus the $10 million range that was given in part in December?\nTodd Bluedorn: It is tracking as we had hoped and expected and guided that it would. As I mentioned earlier, we think -- in fact, I know we gained share in second quarter, because I've seen the numbers and a big piece of that, as we talked about that we had 80% or so of the tornado impact we had gained back with our customers, we would see it flow through in 2020 and we're seeing that. Then in terms of incentives and benefits that we gave to dealers, that lines up what we committed to do, we're following through. Even in the -- even with a strong market, we're not going to back off those incentives, we are committed to doing them. And so, that's all in line also.\nBreindy Goldring: Okay. That's great. I will leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question is from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Good morning, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey Steve.\nJoe Reitmeier: Hi Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Todd, that shot at the sell side really hurts. It's just little sensitive these days. So I thought I was on the Watsco call there for a second. But \u2026\nTodd Bluedorn: I thought I complimented Jeff Hammond.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, yes, you did. But talking about how our -- there is some false precision in our models, which is factually, correct. But I guess there was also some false precision in your models as well because things are playing out better than you had kind of expected when we talked in April. And you did say that if consumer confidence rolls down, you would -- you were concerned about what it would do to the consumer and obviously unprecedented situation that is very hard to call for, I think everybody. What factor do you think is driving this? Obviously, this is very different than '08, '09 when there were negative savings rates and housing was imploding. Is it the fact that people are saving a lot more? Is it the fact that people are running their systems harder, because they're just sitting at home and so if you have a little bit of savings from stimulus checks or whatever it may be, I mean what is kind of the feedback you're getting on why unemployment and why consumer confidence is not rolling through these numbers to a more significant degree?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think its several factors and I will be humble in that we're in the throes of this. So it's good news. We're not 100% sure what's driving it, but we're damn happy that it is. And that's the -- boil it to a point, it's about we're not seeing repair versus replace, replace is hanging in there. I think it's a combination, I think, Steve. I think it's -- one, just psychologically, people are in their homes, they're working in their homes and it's all of a sudden, it's more important for them to invest in their nest and that where people could defer things and put it off because they're not at home. I think when you're there all the time, you want it dealt with. I don't think it's because people are running the units that much harder, because when we do studies and have done research even it's always shocking what percentage of people don't have programmable thermostats and even those who have programmable thermostats never set them. So units tend to sort of run steady state to a large degree, plus or minus a few degrees. So I don't think it's that. I also think it's -- we're not all in agreement with this. I continue to yell that this is the reason and our team says they're not sure this is the reason. But I continue to believe that people will not invest in depreciating assets. And so with the height of the financial crisis, when all you read was that your home is worth 30%, 40%, 50% less; the thought of putting in a new unit is something that was less -- work that much less was hard to swallow. I think -- we so far has been -- that hasn't been the case. In fact, it's sort of been the opposite that homes continue to appreciate new construction seems to be strong, demand is high for homes. I think people are willing to invest. So I think those are sort of the things that are happening. I also think there is may be a psychological viewpoint that with COVID, people can tend to see the finish line of when this may end, where the financial crisis, having lived through it, I thought is more nebulous about even what the causes were as you lay them in and when it would all sort its way out. Well here, we can understand it and can see a finish line, we can debate when that finish line is.\nSteve Tusa: Right, is -- outside of kind of the whole in April and May, I mean if we look out to kind of next year and a more normalized environment, but one where maybe unemployment is sustainably higher, what -- do we kind of look to next year and say where this wasn't kind of the reset of the cycle perhaps we were expecting that this is kind of back to more kind of normalized fundamentals as people kind of go on living their lives?\nTodd Bluedorn: I don't know Steve. I mean, again, that's sort of the humble nature of my answer. I think we are going to have to see how this plays out. For example, I mean, if everything goes back to traveling and work a 100% and everything is exactly as it was back at the end of '19, then some of the factors that I talked about are no longer at play. I can imagine a world that might be different.\nSteve Tusa: Right. Right.\nTodd Bluedorn: You work some more and so I'm not exactly sure how do we set for 2021.\nSteve Tusa: Okay.\nTodd Bluedorn: I think we are happy. And I wasn't taking a shot at your model, I was just making the point that we and you and others maybe had thought the cycle had ended and it is the case maybe not.\nSteve Tusa: No, I'm not taking it personally. I speak for all the sell-siders with false precision in our models. Just a second question, just remind us on the $115 million. Any update as to how -- just remind us of what's temporary and what's structural kind of as we look to next year?\nTodd Bluedorn: About 20% of $115 million comes from salaries, headcount reductions; about 40% comes from discretionary spending like travel, marketing, incentive trips, sort of things. And about 40% comes from pay actions including executive incentives and salary reductions for -- 6% for the salaried employees, 12% for executives and then 50% for me. The way I think about it is, if pay actions bounce back the other 60% will depend on what's happening in the end market and how we want to respond.\nSteve Tusa: Right. A little more kind of variable with what's going on with the volumes.\nTodd Bluedorn: Correct.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Thanks for the [indiscernible] color, as always.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nChris Dankert: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first off, any color or additional details as far as kind of how labor markets are impacting growth, whether it's in terms of the actual construction market or just are we seeing good access to customer sites, what are you hearing from contractors on the ground in terms of both labor and then being able to access customer sites today?\nTodd Bluedorn: Almost no barrier that I'm aware of, customer sites both Commercial and Residential. We're an essential industry and they needs us and we're going in personalized. I just had my air conditioner repaired. I had an issue with it and technician arrived and matched up, it's booted up, it's plugged up. And my wife and kids in the bedrooms and the guys did a magnificent work and left and I think we're seeing that across the industry in the offsite. In terms of labor availability, I think it's strong. I think it's better than it was a year ago. I think the only issue that we are seeing is when you're running a factory or a service business, if you have COVID strike, then you have to deal with it and continue appropriate way in quarantine, so that causes absenteeism and so we and our channel partners work through those issues, but I think we're all focused on safety and taking all the right measure and are working through all the issues.\nChris Dankert: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, my apologies, I fully appreciate the difficulty of trying to be precise to moment as we've kind of gone through, but I just have to ask again, thinking about the cadence of just volumes in a typical year, for things to kind of fall apart as maybe the guidance assumes, things would have to really tick down in August. Otherwise, we're kind of through the bulk of the selling season now. Is there any visibility as to why things might slow in August or is it just conservatism and just taking a cautious view?\nTodd Bluedorn: Well, I mean August is the end of selling season for AC, but obviously in the fourth quarter, whatever -- I'm doing the math, 20%, 25% of our volume is in fourth quarter, so it's the furnace season for us and look and see [indiscernible]. So fourth quarter still matter to us. So, yes, it's tied to earn about -- frankly, about COVID, what [indiscernible]. It's been surprising to me, humbling to me if you use that word again about how quickly things went down, how quickly they bounced up, I think Steve was right to sort of call me on it, on my bell-shaped distribution curve, I had no bell-shaped distribution. It said three weeks into the July, in Residential we would be up mid-teens. So we've been pleasantly surprised. We never have guessed it. But humble enough to know that it could go back the other way. And so we're going to play this a quarter at a time.\nChris Dankert: Yes, I absolutely appreciate that. And then just, as I was thinking about it, again, you can deal with some sweating. But I think when -- when it's cold outside, it's 32 degrees, you're going to replace that furnace, right? I just think it's a matter of flexibility there. But yes. Thank you very much for the color. Appreciate it.\nTodd Bluedorn: Although in my House, my dad would make us freeze. Okay, but enough about me. Let me wrap up; market conditions remain highly uncertain as we just sort of talked about here, but we are executing well, very well on market opportunities and share gains. Third quarter is off to a strong start for Residential and our Commercial and Refrigeration business just continue to see relative improvement. We\u2019ve raised our guidance for 2020 and look forward to the remainder of the summer and second half of the year. Thanks everyone for joining us. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, starting with Residential Heating & Cooling. In the second quarter, revenue from Residential Heating & Cooling was $645 million, down 6%. Volume was down 8% and price and mix combined was up 2%, and foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Residential profit was $127 million, down 17% as reported. Segment margin was 19.7%, down 260 basis points as reported. Segment profit was negatively impacted by the year-over-year difference in the insurance benefit, higher warranty expense and the COVID-19 pandemic that led to lower volume to factory inefficiencies. Partial offsets included, favorable price and mix, lower material, freight and distribution costs and lower SG&A expense. Turning to our Commercial Heating & Cooling business. Commercial revenue was $188 million, down 28%. Volume was down 27%, price and mix combined was down 1%, with price up and mix down. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Commercial segment profit was $36 million, down 34%. Segment margin contracted 170 basis points to 18.9%. Segment profit was negatively impacted by unfavorable mix, higher warranty expense and the COVID-19 pandemic that led to lower volume. Partial offsets included lower material, freight and distribution costs and lower SG&A expense. In Refrigeration, second quarter revenue was $108 million, down 27%. Volume was down 27%, price and mix combined was up 1% and foreign exchange had a negative 1% impact on revenue. Refrigeration segment profit was $9 million, down 53%. Segment margin was 8.2%, down 460 basis points. Segment profit was impacted by higher warranty expense and the COVID-19 pandemic that led to lower volume and factory inefficiencies. Partial offsets included lower material, freight and distribution costs, lower SG&A expense and favorable foreign exchange. Regarding special items in the second quarter, the company had net after tax charges totaling $13.4 million. This included $7.9 million for the restructuring activities, $2.6 million for personal protective equipment and facility deep cleaning expense incurred due to the pandemic, and net $2.9 million in charges for various other items. Corporate expenses were $19 million in the second quarter, down 22% from the prior year quarter. Overall, SG&A was $130 million, down 15% from the prior year quarter. In the second quarter, the company generated $105 million of cash from operations compared to $30 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $19 million compared to $16 million in the prior year quarter that also had approximately $6 million of proceeds from insurance. free cash flow was approximately $87 million in the -- up in the quarter compared to $20 million in the prior year quarter. The company paid approximately $30 million in dividends in the quarter. Total debt was $1.39 billion at the end of the second quarter, and we ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.4. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $49 million at the end of June. Now, before I turn it over to Q&A, I will review our current market assumptions and guidance points for 2020. For the industry, overall, we expect North American residential HVAC shipments to be down mid-teens. We expect both commercial unitary shipments and refrigeration shipments to be down 25% for the industry. Looking at the company's performance in the first half of the year and the outlook for the second half, we are raising 2020 revenue guidance from a range of down 11% to 17% to a new range of down 10% to 15%. We are raising 2020 guidance for GAAP EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.07 to $8.07 to a new range of $7.31 to $8.11 for the year. We are raising 2020 guidance for adjusted EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.50 to $8.50 to a new range of $7.90 to $8.70 for the year. The various puts and takes in our financial guidance for 2020 remain unchanged. We continue to expect a benefit of approximately $25 million in net price for the year. We still expect a $20 million benefit from sourcing and engineering lead cost reductions. Residential factory productivity is still expected to be a $10 million headwind. Residential mix is still expected to be flat, and we still expect tariffs to be neutral. Commodities are expected to be a $20 million benefit this year, and we continue to expect freight to be a $10 million benefit. Now, a few other points to mention in our financial outlook. Corporate expenses are still targeted to be $75 million. And as we talked about last quarter, we have taken $115 million of SG&A cost reduction actions in total to benefit the second, third and fourth quarters of this year. Net interest expense and other expense guidance remains approximately $40 million. And we still expect an effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22% on an adjusted basis for the full year. We continue to expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full-year to be between 38 million to 39 million shares. We repurchased $100 million of stock in the first quarter and the $400 million plan going into this year. Our stock repurchase plans currently remain on hold. We continue to target capital expenditures of $120 million this year. And our guidance for free cash flow remains approximately $340 million for the year. And with that, let's go to Q&A. Our guide range assumes our perspective on how the balance of the year is going to play out. And I understand that sounds like a political answer. So, yes, it encompasses our best guess of things coming back. In terms of the $115 million coming back, about 40% of the $115 million were what we call pay temporary salary reductions, STI [ph] or short-term incentive that sort of thing. And as we do better in 2020, especially second half of the year, I can imagine someone that would come back, but that's all encompassed by our guide. So there won't be bad news that we give you later because we decided to pull some of it back. 12%. For June. The inefficiencies were driven by both traditional absorption, right, which is we don't have the volume, so the fixed costs don't get absorbed. And then there's -- absenteeism is up a bit. As you could expect our factories that are in places like Georgia and Iowa and South Carolina, where there has been COVID and that has impact. I broadly think about it as we entered the year saying we were going to get $10 million of factory productivity, and now we're saying we're going to have $10 million of inefficiencies. So $20 million swing is what I would think about, driven both by volume and by the absenteeism, right. Yes, it's a modest benefit for quarter or two, but once again it's a timing issue. Hi Steve."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Let me start with a quick overview on the second quarter that was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and then discuss the updated outlook for 2020, in which we're raising guidance for revenue and earnings for the year. For the second quarter, company revenue was $941 million, down 14%. GAAP operating income was $136 million, down 36%, and GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $2.62, down 7%. The second quarter last year included an insurance benefit of $26 million and a pension settlement charge of $61 million. Total segment profit was $153 million, down 24% from the prior year quarter that included an $18 million insurance benefit. From an operational perspective excluding the insurance benefit, total segment profit was down 17%. Total segment margin for the second quarter was 16.3%, down 210 basis points as reported and down 50 basis points from an operational perspective. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $2.97, down 21% as reported and down 12% from an operational perspective. And our Residential segment in the second quarter revenue was down 6%; revenue from replacement business is now high single digits; revenue from new construction was down low single digits. Residential segment profit was $127 million, down 17% as reported and down 6% on an operational basis excluding the $18 million insurance benefit in the second quarter a year-ago. Segment margin was 19.7% in the second quarter, down 260 basis points as reported and up 10 basis points on an operational basis. Our Residential business improved each month through the quarter and was up 7% in June as the economy continued to reopen and weather heated up for the summer. Cooling degree days for the second quarter overall were up 4% from the prior year quarter. For the month of June, cooling degree days were up 12% from last year. The hot weather has continued month to date in July and we're seeing strong Residential growth on excellent operational execution by the team to capitalize on market opportunities. Turning to our commercial-facing businesses, they're more heavily impacted from the pandemic as we expected. On the Commercial business segment, revenue was down 28%, segment profit was down 34%, and segment margin contracted 170 basis points to 18.9%. National account revenue was down approximately 40% and regional and local revenue was down approximately 20%. Breaking down the revenue another way; replacement was down 35%, and new constructions down nearly 20%. On the service side, Lennox National Account Service revenue was down about 20%, VRF revenue was up low single digits. While overall commercial equipment was down 30% in the second quarter, we're seeing signs of relative improvement in the business with commercial equipment backlog currently down 20% year-over-year. Commercial continues to win new business and position for future growth. Commercial won 15 new national account customers in the first half, including 6 in the second quarter. Turning to our Refrigeration business segment. Revenue was down broadly across our businesses in North America and Europe, declined 26% at constant currency. Segment profit was down 53%, and segment margin contracted 460 basis points to 8.2%.North America revenue was down more than 20% and Europe revenue was down about 30%. As in our Commercial business, we are seeing signs of relative improvement in refrigeration as well. Backlog is down approximately 20% year-over-year. Overall for the company for the second half of the year, we continue to face highly uncertain market conditions. Our stock repurchase program remains on hold, currently given the high uncertainty. But we continue to be encouraged by the performance of Residential business and relative improvement in the Commercial and Refrigeration businesses. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and expect a strong year of cash flow generation. We continue to target $340 million of free cash flow for 2020. The company has executed well on its $115 million of in-year SG&A savings for 2020, and we manage decremental EBIT margin of 20% on an operational basis in the second quarter. We are raising our financial guidance for 2020 and now expect adjusted revenue to be down 10% to 15% and adjusted EPS from continuing operations within a range of $7.90 to $8.70. As I turn it over to Joe, I will just mention that Lennox has a seasoned team with experience managing through economic downturns, while continuing to invest and advance the company's position. All of us are focused on capitalizing on market opportunities and share gains. Now over to Joe. Hey, Julian. I'll be very clear. So I won't dance around the question. If the market environment remains like it is today, we're going to do better than the midpoint of our guide. The concern that we have is that there's a lot of moving pieces, both medically with the pandemic and the impact that it has on end markets. And so we baked that into our guide, but if you've been asked a question, I'll answer a question in July, our Residential business was up mid-teen. So we have strength in July. And if things stay the way it is, we're going to do better than the guide, but the concern is a changing world and a changing marketplace, and that's reflected in the guide. I will answer the last part first, yes, you're right to assume that second half of the year it's mid to high teens is the adjusted number of decrementals at the current guide. On the first part of the question, as we -- as we think about the $115 million this way, we implemented May 1 the vast -- or all the cost reductions were implemented by May 1, and the salary reductions were implemented effective May 1. And so I would think about May and June sort of full run rate savings for the $115 million and then third, fourth -- third and fourth quarter will be all three months will be run rate of the saving. Hey, Jeff. I want to start with your headline in your note of weather beats COVID was the best headline I've seen in a while. I enjoyed it. Yes, we did a really good job in second quarter. And there's a continual triage going on, I think across corporate America, certainly within our industry and certainly within our company, almost a whack-a-mole is another analogy, but our team and suppliers have done a great job through this. Our supply chain is flowing and our manufacturing plants are all up and running and we're focusing on meeting the demand in the market. I think we're as good or better positioned than anyone in the industry as we flow through the balance of the year. Let me go a little bit into detail on the questions, Jeff. When I think -- we think about the commercial unitary business North America, really think about it in three parts. About 40% of the market is planned replacement. That's primarily for national accounts. We expected a quick decline in that and we saw that in April, May orders were down 40%, 50%. But they picked up and are stronger in June, so that the clients may be half of that at this point. 20% of the market is new construction and commercial new construction didn't drop as quickly as what we saw in the planned replacement, because planned replacement is discretionary, people can make the decision right away. New construction projects are ongoing. So we didn't see that drop early, but we're now starting to see that drop. And 40% is emergency replacement or flow business sort of like the residential business. It's slowed down, but not at all like national accounts that's been more in the 15 -- down 15%, 20% during the process. So, that's a lot of words, but I think the answer to your question is where we've seen improvement has been planned replacement national accounts where we have an outside position. As I mentioned in the script, while revenue was down 30% in Q2, our backlog is down about 20%. Hey, Gautam. Yes. I mean, the mix in the Residential business was up slightly in the second quarter. We're still guiding for it to be flat year-over-year. There's lots of moving pieces on mix in any given quarter, but I think one strength is our Lennox branded product performed better than our ally branded product, and at the gross margin level it has higher margins. No change in behaviors. That's a specific question about Trane and Carrier that's often asked. I mean, I don't think it's a secret and certainly not a secret in the industry that Goodman's had some production issues, and that's opened up some opportunities for us and others in the industry to sort of pick up some of the business that Goodman hasn't been able to meet. The pricing is more as you go into the season, you put a price in place and we have a price in place. And again, we have long standing relationships with these customers, with these customers, with these dealers. And sort of in a hot summer to raise prices, you really don't want to do that. So I think we are going to get the price that we committed to and the markets help and support that with the demand. Thanks. Good morning. Our best guess is that it won't stay better than replacement. I think new construction, although it's been very resilient and low interest rates are helping. Our best guess is second half of the year that tails off and add on or replacement which has -- which was increasing sequentially stronger April, May and June continues to hang in there. And so we expect new construction to tail off. Another thing that I just want to weave into the conversation around some of our confidence about add on or replacement is, if you remember, Deepa and others on the call, during the great financial crisis, the canary in the coal mine in our industry was parts sales started to grow very quickly and that was an indicator that people were repairing rather than replacing. We haven't seen that yet. So what we saw in the second quarter was that for our Lennox business, our residential replacement was down low single digits, while parts were down high single digits. And for -- just for the month of June in our Lennox business, our residential replacement was up mid-teens and parts and supplies were up 1%. So we're not seeing anything like we saw during the financial crisis. And to me that's an indication that our replacements hanging in there and I would expect new construction to slow down. Good morning, Joe. I think it could. I don't -- the honest answer is, I don't know. But when you think about it, I think about people working at home, it becomes their Island, it becomes their life, perhaps if you will, and the desire to sort of invest in it and protect it. Now, I think that's in a world where unemployment doesn't go back up to 20% and that people have money to spend. But certainly the repair versus replace dynamic I talked about earlier supports that answer, that things have changed. I also think as we said for a while, it's an inexact science and some -- not you, Joe, the -- any work Goldman does is spot on, but other sell-side models have attempted to sort of guess how this is going to work. There's some false precision. I'm not sure anyone would have guessed that with degree cooling days up 4% that we would see this kind of performance in the face of COVID including us. And so I think the market is pretty resilient. We have access. We have access today. Our North American -- NAS, our North America service business were up and running. We never shut down. We are an essential business. ON the product that we sell through our distributor, through our dealers, they are essential businesses, that are onsite. They're working. And so the service revenue were down and in second quarter we expect it to be flat, maybe even up second half of the year. And then on -- I talked a little bit about planned replacement that goes down steep, and I think it comes back steep too. So when it comes back, it comes back quickly. I think you have to have a bit more of a green light than what we have now, although, as I mentioned it's gone -- the order rate is gone from being down 40%, 50% in April, May time to half of that now. So it's not healthy, but it's certainly better than it was a couple of months ago. You broke up a little bit on the beginning of the question. So can you restate it for me, John? No, I don't think so. I think when we talk [technical difficulty] when we talked to our contractors, I mean, they've had access to the entire time. I think it has to do with the hot June. And so degree cooling days going up 4% for the quarter were up -- I'm looking at my notes to make sure I have the right number. We are up 12% ... ... in June. So that warm weather helped us in June. I think the other thing that we're going to have to see is, we think we can share in the second quarter. In fact, I know we gained share in the second quarter because I see the industry data, and we had mentioned exiting 2019 that we had regained business with 80% of our contractors that have -- and dealers that have been impacted by the tornado and we're now seeing that flow through in our volumes. We also -- as I mentioned in the first quarter call in the last fourth quarter call, that we are focused on new business and we had a significant backlog of additional new business coming into the year. And we're seeing the benefits from that. And as I mentioned earlier, some of the issues that our competitor or competitors producing products. So I think it's a combination of a repair versus -- replace versus repair, staying in place, some hot weather. But I actually think share gain is one of the largest reasons we have such a strong June and quite frankly, we've a very strong July. Indoor air quality scenario, we focused on for years, both in residential and commercial. And when you think about in sort of a bit of a baseline for folks online, John, when we think about indoor air -- well, I think when industry thinks about indoor air quality, it's about air purification, which is filters, HEPA filters and UV lights without ventilation and circulation. And then third is about humidity control. And it's always about balancing bringing in outside air and that's part of the ventilation in that humidity control, and also the capacity, as you bring out the outside air that's untreated. We're definitely seeing increased interest in IAQ, indoor air quality in both Residential and Commercial. Our Residential pure air equipment is the best in the street. And that's just not our saying that, that's consumer reports and Commercial similar to Residential. We work with our customers to address their solutions. So I think it's important. And I think it's about you have to have the capability to win the customer and serve the customer, but it's not a big enough dollar item, even if people add it to the mix of the equipment to sort of have an outsized impact on sales and margin. I think it's about a binary item that you have to have this capability to be able to talk to your customers and customers and your dealer contractor customers to win business, and we're well positioned to do that. Good morning, Nicole. I think we'll still continue to generate cash from working capital in the second half of the year. Given the caution that I identified around the EPS, even a greater caution around cash flow, just historically our ability to forecast it. So, I mean $340 million is our best guess right now, but similar to what I've said on earnings, if the world stays the way it is, we'll do better than $340 million. We've seen dealers restock in second quarter and hopefully if the weather continues to be hot, and it's a strong July and August, we'll see some more sort of loading on the distributor level, which is our allied business, which does 20% or so of what we do. It's more of an impact of when distributors decide to reload and they put off a broad degree April and May. We start to see them reload and sort of do some buying in June -- significant buying in June. And so I think that's where there's more momentum and sort of replenishing the channel for us. It's on our allied channel on the Lennox side, dealer started buying in May, June. Good morning, Jeff. No, I don't -- I'm doing a little bit from memory, I'll be honest with you, Jeff. I didn't spill up on that exact question. I don't -- July wasn't necessarily easy last year. As I recollect, we had a cool beginning to the summer last year. And so I think May and June, maybe -- might've been easier, but we saw that in degree cooling days and I think July was sort of a normal July for us. And then as I remember fourth quarter, we pitched about warm weather and the impact that it had on our furnace stations. So I think -- I don't think the comps are that dramatically harder. I think that when you look at the reported numbers, the tornado impact was much more pronounced during the first half of year than was second half of the year. But when you sort of adjust for the tornado impact, the comps weren't that much different. I think the world is still changing quickly. So I think we certainly need another quarter under our belt. We will see how third quarter goes. And I think I've been -- I don't know if I said this on an earnings call, but I certainly have said publicly before. I think the other issue that we have to continue to ensure up is we've asked for shared sacrifice from our employees around pay cuts and zero bonuses. I think we have to start making some of the [indiscernible] before we aggressively make investment in share buyback. I think we've got sort of balanced on how the benefits flow out. I think the plus 7 is good. That's it. [Multiple speakers] I'd say the up mid-teens in July, I know that for a fact is day for day. On the inventory build, we started -- I don't know if it's 6 weeks ago, 7 weeks ago, 8 weeks ago, as soon as we started to see the markets and how they were behaving, we ramped up production. So we've already ramped up production to stay ahead of the demand curve. And as I said earlier we're all in the summer when it's hot, you have to work through both the supply chain and inventory levels lay on top of that COVID. So our teams are working hard, but we feel we're in a great position and certainly as good as anyone in the industry to meet demand. And I'm not sure I understood the question on taxes. Yes, it's a bit of a cash bump for us on the timing of the cash. But honestly it's the minimis for us. Hey. It is tracking as we had hoped and expected and guided that it would. As I mentioned earlier, we think -- in fact, I know we gained share in second quarter, because I've seen the numbers and a big piece of that, as we talked about that we had 80% or so of the tornado impact we had gained back with our customers, we would see it flow through in 2020 and we're seeing that. Then in terms of incentives and benefits that we gave to dealers, that lines up what we committed to do, we're following through. Even in the -- even with a strong market, we're not going to back off those incentives, we are committed to doing them. And so, that's all in line also. Hey Steve. I thought I complimented Jeff Hammond. I think its several factors and I will be humble in that we're in the throes of this. So it's good news. We're not 100% sure what's driving it, but we're damn happy that it is. And that's the -- boil it to a point, it's about we're not seeing repair versus replace, replace is hanging in there. I think it's a combination, I think, Steve. I think it's -- one, just psychologically, people are in their homes, they're working in their homes and it's all of a sudden, it's more important for them to invest in their nest and that where people could defer things and put it off because they're not at home. I think when you're there all the time, you want it dealt with. I don't think it's because people are running the units that much harder, because when we do studies and have done research even it's always shocking what percentage of people don't have programmable thermostats and even those who have programmable thermostats never set them. So units tend to sort of run steady state to a large degree, plus or minus a few degrees. So I don't think it's that. I also think it's -- we're not all in agreement with this. I continue to yell that this is the reason and our team says they're not sure this is the reason. But I continue to believe that people will not invest in depreciating assets. And so with the height of the financial crisis, when all you read was that your home is worth 30%, 40%, 50% less; the thought of putting in a new unit is something that was less -- work that much less was hard to swallow. I think -- we so far has been -- that hasn't been the case. In fact, it's sort of been the opposite that homes continue to appreciate new construction seems to be strong, demand is high for homes. I think people are willing to invest. So I think those are sort of the things that are happening. I also think there is may be a psychological viewpoint that with COVID, people can tend to see the finish line of when this may end, where the financial crisis, having lived through it, I thought is more nebulous about even what the causes were as you lay them in and when it would all sort its way out. Well here, we can understand it and can see a finish line, we can debate when that finish line is. I don't know Steve. I mean, again, that's sort of the humble nature of my answer. I think we are going to have to see how this plays out. For example, I mean, if everything goes back to traveling and work a 100% and everything is exactly as it was back at the end of '19, then some of the factors that I talked about are no longer at play. I can imagine a world that might be different. You work some more and so I'm not exactly sure how do we set for 2021. I think we are happy. And I wasn't taking a shot at your model, I was just making the point that we and you and others maybe had thought the cycle had ended and it is the case maybe not. About 20% of $115 million comes from salaries, headcount reductions; about 40% comes from discretionary spending like travel, marketing, incentive trips, sort of things. And about 40% comes from pay actions including executive incentives and salary reductions for -- 6% for the salaried employees, 12% for executives and then 50% for me. The way I think about it is, if pay actions bounce back the other 60% will depend on what's happening in the end market and how we want to respond. Correct. Almost no barrier that I'm aware of, customer sites both Commercial and Residential. We're an essential industry and they needs us and we're going in personalized. I just had my air conditioner repaired. I had an issue with it and technician arrived and matched up, it's booted up, it's plugged up. And my wife and kids in the bedrooms and the guys did a magnificent work and left and I think we're seeing that across the industry in the offsite. In terms of labor availability, I think it's strong. I think it's better than it was a year ago. I think the only issue that we are seeing is when you're running a factory or a service business, if you have COVID strike, then you have to deal with it and continue appropriate way in quarantine, so that causes absenteeism and so we and our channel partners work through those issues, but I think we're all focused on safety and taking all the right measure and are working through all the issues. Well, I mean August is the end of selling season for AC, but obviously in the fourth quarter, whatever -- I'm doing the math, 20%, 25% of our volume is in fourth quarter, so it's the furnace season for us and look and see [indiscernible]. So fourth quarter still matter to us. So, yes, it's tied to earn about -- frankly, about COVID, what [indiscernible]. It's been surprising to me, humbling to me if you use that word again about how quickly things went down, how quickly they bounced up, I think Steve was right to sort of call me on it, on my bell-shaped distribution curve, I had no bell-shaped distribution. It said three weeks into the July, in Residential we would be up mid-teens. So we've been pleasantly surprised. We never have guessed it. But humble enough to know that it could go back the other way. And so we're going to play this a quarter at a time. Although in my House, my dad would make us freeze. Okay, but enough about me. Let me wrap up; market conditions remain highly uncertain as we just sort of talked about here, but we are executing well, very well on market opportunities and share gains. Third quarter is off to a strong start for Residential and our Commercial and Refrigeration business just continue to see relative improvement. We've raised our guidance for 2020 and look forward to the remainder of the summer and second half of the year. Thanks everyone for joining us. Have a good day."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Steve Harrison, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSteve Harrison: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for this review of Lennox International's financial performance for the first quarter of 2020. I'm here today with Chairman, CEO, Todd Bluedorn; and CFO, Joe Reitmeier. Todd will review key points for the quarter and the outlook, and Joe will take you through the company's financial performance and expectations. To give everyone time to ask questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to a couple of questions or follow-ups and re-queue for any additional questions. In the earnings release we issued this morning, we have included the necessary reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures that will be discussed to GAAP measures. All comparisons mentioned today are against the prior year period. You can find a direct link to the webcast to today\u2019s conference call on our website at www.lennoxinternational.com.

Now let me turn the call today over to the Chairman and CEO, Todd Bluedorn.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks Steve. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. Let me start with a quick overview on the first quarter, then discuss our current outlook for 2020 and the actions we\u2019re taking in this unprecedented time. For the first quarter, company revenue was $724 million, down 8% on a GAAP basis, down 4% on an adjusted basis that excludes the impact from divestitures last year. GAAP operating income was $36 million, down from $95 million in the prior year quarter that included approximately $47 million of insurance benefit related to the 2018 tornado. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.32 compared to $1.73 in the prior year quarter that included $0.87 from insurance benefit. On an adjusted basis, total segment profit was $38 million compared to $99 million in the prior year quarter that included $40 million of insurance benefit. Total adjusted segment margin for the first quarter was 5.2% compared to 13.1% in the prior year quarter as reported and 7.8%, excluding the insurance benefit. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.56 compared to $1.68 in the prior year quarter that includes $0.75 of insurance benefit. Looking at the business segment performance for the first quarter, there are a couple of overarching comments to make. First, weather continued to have a significant adverse impact. Heating degree days were down from last year and every month down 15% overall for the quarter. Second, we saw an increasing impact on our business in March from the COVID-19 pandemic, first in Europe and then in North America. On the demand side, we saw contractors stop stocking up less residential equipment ahead of the spring and summer seasons due to the rising economic uncertainty, and national account customers in both our Commercial and Refrigeration businesses have pushed orders out. Operationally, HVAC has been designated an essential business in North America, Europe and in Mexico. We have managed the supply chain well across regions that we source from, including Asia and combined with our buffer stock we have not seen an impact on our manufacturing capability in this regard. In late March, we did make the decision to close some of our factories for a couple of weeks and broadly protected the Lennox team from COVID-19 cases at those locations. These factors are all back up and running and of course, protection for the team members are in place. In our Residential segment, in the first quarter, revenue was down 5%. Revenue from replacement business was down high single digits impacted by the warm weather. New construction revenue was up high single digits as the warm weather generally enabled homebuilders to get an early start in the year. Residential segment profit was $33 million, down from $87 million in the prior year quarter on a reported basis that included the $40 million of insurance benefits that I mentioned earlier. Segment margin was 7.4% in the quarter compared to 18.6% as reported or 10% excluding insurance benefit in the prior year quarter. In Commercial, revenue was up 3% in the first quarter and segment profit rose 24%. Segment margin expanded 180 basis points to 10.5%. Commercial equipment revenue was up low single digits in the quarter. New construction revenue was up high teens and replacement revenue was down high single digits. Breaking out the business another way, revenue from regional and local business was up low single digits. And national account equipment revenue was also up low single digits in the quarter. On the service side, Lennox national account service revenue was up low double digits. In Refrigeration segment for the first quarter, adjusted to exclude the impact from divestitures in the prior year, revenue was down 11% at constant currency. Segment margin declined 730 basis points to 0.7% and segment profit was down 93%. The segment has approximately 55% of its revenue from North America and 45% from Europe, which has seen soft markets for some time and that was impacted earlier from the pandemic in North America, including shut down at both of our French factories. North America revenue was down mid-single digits and Europe revenue was down high teens. Looking ahead for the company overall, market conditions are highly uncertain and there are significant challenges we are addressing. But Lennox has a focused and seasoned team with experience managing through economic downturns in difficult times. For me personally, I manage Carriers HVAC business in Southeast Asia in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in the late 90s. Those of you who don't remember, I urge you to go Google it. I manage Carriers North America HVAC businesses through the impact from 9/11 and then a CEO at Lennox through the residential new construction collapse in the global financial crisis of a little over a decade ago. Based on how HVAC markets performed in those prior downturns, our current view is that the North America residential and commercial unitary HVAC in refrigeration markets will be negatively impacted about 20% this year by the pandemic. We have reset our financial expectations for the year based on that level of market impact and now expect revenue to be down 11% to 17% from last year versus our previous guidance for growth of 4% to 8%. We expect adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $7.50 to $8.50 for the year. We have already taken cost reduction actions to realize approximately $150 million in SG&A savings for the balance of the year. The decremental drop through on the guidance reduction, on our revenue is 25%, which reflects our aggressive cost actions. We expect cash generation to remain strong for this year as working capital requirements shrink and capital expenditure plans have been reduced from $153 million to $120 million this year. We tend to think of maintenance CapEx levels of being around 10% to 15% of that. We are targeting $340 million free cash flow for 2020. Lennox is rated investment grade by both S&P and Moody's and we expect to remain well within our debt covenants. Our bank revolver and asset securitization line do not have to go through renewal again until the latter half of 2021 and our senior notes will not mature until November 2023. The company's quarterly dividend plans are unchanged. Most recently $0.70 per share or more than $150 million in total for this year. We repurchased $100 million of stock in the first quarter of our $400 million planned going into this year. But we have placed repurchases plans for the second quarter on hold and we will review plans for the third and fourth quarter as the year progresses. As I turn it over to Joe to discuss financial results, I will just say that while we execute -- while we execute on what is required in these current economic conditions, we remain mindful of the future and are confident we will once again strengthen our position in the market as we emerge in the recovery. Now I will turn it over to Joe.\nJoe Reitmeier: Thank you, Todd and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, starting with Residential Heating & Cooling. In the first quarter, revenue from Residential Heating & Cooling was $442 million, down 5%. Volume was down 6% and price and mix combined was up 1%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Residential profit was $33 million, down 62% as reported, or down 30% adjusted for the insurance benefit in the prior year quarter. Segment margin was 7.4%, down 1,120 basis points as reported, or down 260 basis points adjusted for the insurance benefit in the prior year quarter. Segment profit was negatively impacted by the year-over-year difference in the insurance benefit, unfavorable weather, COVID-19 pandemic that led to lower volume and factory shutdown costs, higher other product costs and unfavorable mix. Partial offsets included favorable price, lower material costs, lower tariffs, favorable warranty costs, lower freight costs, lower SG&A expenses and favorable foreign exchange. Turning to our Commercial Heating & Cooling business. Commercial revenue was up 3% to $170 million. Volume was down 2%, price and mix combined was up 5% and foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Commercial segment profit rose 24% to $19 million. Segment margin expanded 180 basis points to 10.5%. Segment profit was favorably impacted by favorable mix, lower material costs and lower SG&A expenses. Partial offsets included the COVID-19 pandemic that led to lower volume and unfavorable warranty costs. In Refrigeration, on an adjusted basis, first quarter revenue was down $103 million, down 12% -- excuse me, first quarter revenue was $103 million, which was down 12%. Volume was down 12%, price and mix combined was up 1% and foreign exchange had a negative 1% impact on revenue. Refrigeration segment profit was $1 million in the first quarter, down 93% and segment margin was 0.7%, down 730 basis points. Segment profit was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that led to lower volume and factory shutdown costs, higher other product costs and unfavorable mix. Partial offsets include favorable price and lower SG&A expenses. Regarding special items in the quarter. The company had net after tax charges totaling $9.2 million. This included $8.3 million for -- in total for other tax items net and excess tax benefits from share based compensation, $1.3 million for loss from natural disaster net of insurance recoveries and a net benefit of $0.4 million for various other items. Corporate expenses were $14 million in the first quarter, and overall SG&A on an adjusted basis was $131 million or 18.1% of adjusted revenue, down from 18.7% in the prior year quarter. In the first quarter, the company used $99 million of cash from operations compared to a usage $141 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $25 million compared to $37 million in the prior year quarter that also included $7 million of proceeds from divestitures and insurance. Free cash flow was a use of approximately $123 million in the quarter compared to a use of $171 million in the prior year quarter. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, the company tends to have a cash -- have a use of cash early in the year and generates cash later in the year. The company paid $30 million in dividends and repurchased $100 million of stock in the quarter. Total debt was $1.44 billion at the end of the first quarter and we ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.3. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $43 million at the end of March. Now, before I turn it over to Q&A, I will review our current market estimates for 2020. For the industry overall, we now expect North American residential HVAC shipments to be down mid-teens compared to prior expectations to be up mid-single digits, a 20 point negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect both Commercial unitary shipments and Refrigeration shipments in North America to be down 25% compared to our expectation for flat markets. Under these market assumptions, we expect our revenue to be down 11% to 17% from the prior year compared to our prior expectations of 4% to 8% growth. We expect GAAP EPS from continuing operations to be in a range of $7.07 to $8.07 for the year, including a pre-tax charge of approximately $10 million expected in the second quarter for restructuring actions. We expect adjusted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $7.50 to $8.50 for the year. Previous EPS guidance for both of these was a range of $11.30 to $11.90. Looking at the various puts and takes in our financial assumptions for 2020, we now expect a benefit of $25 million in net price for the year compared to our previous guidance of $30 million. We now expect $20 million -- a $20 million benefit from sourcing and engineering led cost reductions compared to prior guidance of $25 million. Residential factory productivity is expected to flip from a $10 million benefit to a $10 million headwind given the significantly lower volume. Residential mix is now expected to be flat compared to prior guidance of a $5 million benefit. Tariffs are now expected to be neutral compared to prior guidance for a $10 million -- excuse me, a $5 million headwind and commodities are still expected to be a $20 million benefit and freight is still expected to be a $10 million benefit. A few other points to mention in our current financial outlook. Corporate expenses are targeted at $75 million compared to 20 -- excuse me, compared to $90 million previously. Net interest expense and other expense is now expected to be approximately $40 million compared to previous guidance of approximately $50 million. We still expect an effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22% on an adjusted basis for the full-year. We continue to expect weighted average diluted share count for the full-year to be between 38 million to 39 million shares. And as Todd mentioned, our repurchase of $100 million of stock in the first quarter of our $400 million plan going into this year. But we have placed the repurchase plans for the second quarter on hold and we will review plans in third and fourth quarters as the year progresses. The company's quarterly dividend plans are unchanged. Most recently $0.77 per share or more than $115 million for the total year. We are targeting capital expenditures of $120 million this year, down from $153 million previously. Free cash flow is expected to be $340 million this year compared to previous guidance of $410 million. And as Todd talked about, we have taken SG&A cost reduction actions to realize $115 million of savings over the remaining three quarters of this year. We are well-prepared to manage through these market conditions and make adjustments as needed along the way. And with that, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: Hey, thanks. So first off, Todd, can you break down the resi mid-teens decline to -- into your replacement and new construction?\nTodd Bluedorn: We haven't broken out that guide. We usually don't give the annual guide, but I think sort of the phenomenon that you saw in first quarter will play out for a little bit longer, which is the starts that have started will continue. And so I wouldn't be surprised to see in the near-term new construction up as that on replacement continues to go down. But I think certainly, I think during the second half of the year the new construction will start to pull back significantly.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. And then maybe talk about the sales cadence through March and into April. Are you seeing resi down 10% plus at this point?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, we are. I mean, what we've seen is through the end of March, it's sort of hung in there. And then during the first two weeks of April, it's been down mid-to-high teens. And that's, quite frankly, what I would expect. I mean, what we're seeing is we really have two broad buckets of add on the replacement this time of the year. Demand business, which is dealer sees a job, buys the equipment, installs it. The demand business actually is hanging in there relatively well. I mean, it's down low single digits. But where we're seeing a real slowdown is dealer stocking up for the summer selling season. They're just not doing that given all the uncertainty.\nRyan Merkel: Right. Thanks.\nTodd Bluedorn: And I will get a little bit more into this later is, we are an essential business and so we're going to continue to produce. People need our products and that\u2019s going to continue to flow. So I -- we'll see what happens.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. All right. And just lastly, on the $150 million of cost saves, how much of that is temporary versus permanent? And then what's the quarterly cadence for our model?\nTodd Bluedorn: I would look at it -- I would think about the $150 million cost savings this way. About 20% of the savings comes from salaried headcount reductions, about 40% comes from discretionary spending like cuts, like travel, marketing, incentive trips, etcetera. And about 40% come -- comes from pay actions, zero executive incentives and a salary reduction for our salaried employees, 50% for me, 12% for other executives and 6% for other salaried employees. And when you think about those snapping back, I would -- if I was modeling 2021, I would certainly assume that the salary reduction snap back in 2021 because if you do longer than 8 or 9 months, it's really not temporary. And then the other two categories, we just wait and see what was going on with the market conditions.\nRyan Merkel: Okay, great. Thank you.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning. Just my first question around decremental margins. Those were pretty steep in Q1. I think you're expecting a narrowing of those as we work through the year, even though the sales trends deteriorate, presumably in Q2 and Q3. So maybe just help us understand the logic behind that. And also, what impact did the under absorption that you've cited back at the Q4 call that we should expect in Q1? How bad did that end up being given you had an additional volume shortfall?\nTodd Bluedorn: Well, I think there's sort of a lot to unpack. The decremental margins in the first quarter were primarily driven by the bad mix that we had in residential. And we talked about that publicly at Steve Tusa's conference about midway through March. And while we said there was that the warm weather had impacted our furnace sales and our parts and supply sales, and those are our two most profitable business lines and that had a real impact to the business. When I think about the balance of the year, the reason we're able to get 25% decrementals is we've taken $115 million costs out of the business. So our normal contribution margin is order of magnitude 38%, 40%. And if we took no cost actions and the decrementals come in around 40%, but we took out $150 million of cost. And so we're now going to see decrementals in the order of magnitude of 25%. And then, the other point I would make, I\u2019m going to ask the question -- but I will ramble when I'm talking. I mean, 20% is an uncertain number. We -- that\u2019s after an obvious statement for the day. And as I mentioned on the call, I've been through a couple of these. And when I was a carrier in North America, run a commercial business after 9/11 and then here at the financial crisis, and so the 20% sort of feels right given what happens in those downturns. But it's sort of a ballpark number. And we're -- we were able to get 25% decrementals on a 20% drop in the market. But if the market goes down more than 20%, the cost levers are harder to find. And so if you're building your own model, our decrementals after we're down more than 20% revenue are going to be more like 30%, 35%. But for that first drop of 20%, $150 million are cost take outs allowed us to -- will allow us to deliver a 25% decremental.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you. And maybe just my follow-up question. You've talked a fair amount about residential trends. Maybe just clarifying in the commercial side of the business. Are you seeing -- what are you seeing in terms of, I guess, the aftermarket parts of commercial and any major bifurcation you'd call out in your guide for commercial unitary between OE and aftermarket just for 2020 as a whole?\nTodd Bluedorn: The broad -- the guide that we gave is down 25% from North America unitary. We haven't bifurcated it. I would -- without putting numbers on it, tell you that my experience what will happen, quite frankly, what is happening is that the new -- it's like residential, new construction continues until all the projects that have started wind down. And that hasn't happened yet, but it will. The planned replacement continues to flow for a little bit until all the decision makers decide what they need to do to pullback to get their companies lined up correctly. So planned replacements, some of its slowing down over the last two weeks. And then the third piece of the business is at want demand or emerging replacement. And that continues to flow even in the tough times because people need to buy HVAC. And so my experience when I ran Carrier during 9/11 is the marble rolls off the table on commercial quickly and are better stated. When it happens, it happens quickly. And the marble hasn't rolled off yet. I mean, we're down. Backlog order rates are down maybe 10%, not 25% yet, but our guess is that it will.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, Jeff.\nJoe Reitmeier: Hey, Jeff.\nJeff Hammond: So can we just talk about just obviously a lot of moving pieces here, just what you're seeing from a share [ph] dynamic and being able to get that back and just what plans have changed if any for kind of parts plus build out?\nTodd Bluedorn: The parts plus build out as we\u2019ve put the 20 stores that we're going to add in 2020 on pause for right now. So right now, the plan is not to add. We're not in the process of adding any new stores. We'll get partway through the year just like on the share buyback and reevaluate that. What we've been very focused on is we made these SG&A cuts. Again, my experience from prior downturns is it's easy to cut costs, it's easy to gain share, it's hard to do both at the same time. And so we've been very focused about what are the investments we want to protect. And so we've protected all our new product development programs. We've protected all our key digitization programs. And while we aren't adding new stores, we're not decimating our distribution network. We're keeping it intact. And so it's protection of the key growth initiatives that we have. We're still keeping those intact. And we've asked for shared sacrifice of employees as we've taken a salary reduction rather than cut some of those key programs.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. And then just on the -- it sounds like the biggest impact on Q1 was kind of seasonal build. What kind of feedback are you getting from, contractors in terms of like the selling season and people change them being able to kind of get out just that I'm just wondering if -- if you go into the season with less inventory and then maybe things are a little more normal, do you get some spring loading here, catch up?\nTodd Bluedorn: Short answer is yes to that final piece, which is we've got lots of inventory and we're not -- we're going to manage inventory appropriately to hit our free cash flow target. But we're prepared for the spring back. And so we hope we're wrong on the 20%. I hope it's a lot less than that. And if it is, then we're going to be chugging [ph] and we will be selling product and our dealers will be ready to go. They just don't want to carry the inventory right now, so we are carrying it for them. When we talk to the dealer contractors depending on what part of the country you're in and you could figure that out on your own, where there's less concern about all this, they're still relatively optimistic. But again, my experience on prior prices was if you rely on your dealer contractor to tell you the market is going to turn, then you've waited too long. But there's sort of quick in the debt and all this and you either sort of figure out that the market is turning, you get your costs in line and you have inventory takes you wrong and then you bounce back with it. If you don't do that, what happens is you chase the market down with cost cuts and you end up cutting costs right when the market is getting ready to turn. And it's better to cut them now, get it behind you and move on, that's what we've done. The optimistic answer to your question is, if we're wrong on the market and the market starts to come back, we'll rock and roll several of our dealers.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. And then if I could just squeeze one last in. The refrigeration margins got hit pretty hard and I think you mentioned a couple of things. But just maybe speak to that business, what really happened?\nTodd Bluedorn: I mean, there were a couple of things in the quarter that \u2026\nJeff Hammond: 2Q from a margin perspective.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, there were a couple of things in the quarter that really drove the margins down and obviously they were disappointing margins. One is, we had our two French factories shut down because of COVID virus and that was about $2 million of EBIT negative impact. We had year-over-year difference in refrigerant sales. Remember, last year we said had this windfall of a couple of million in the first quarter, that didn't repeat. And then the volume being down 10%, the volume are down 10% and we hadn't taken all the cost actions yet. And so we had some painful decrementals. As we go through the balance of the year, hopefully the factory shutdowns are behind us, but who knows, the refrigerant noise is behind us and we've taken the cost actions to adjust our costs for the lower volume.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. Thanks, Todd.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Thanks for all the detailed visual. A lot of companies are obviously not have been giving guidance. And so the color is always very helpful and you guys are also on top of the stuff. So I appreciate that.\nTodd Bluedorn: I will just sort of give an advertisement then for my colleagues. We've always been transparent, but every training and leadership instinct I've ever been taught or learned is in a crisis you want to even be more transparent. So I think sort of pulling guidance and hiding isn't the way to go now. Again, we're putting large caveats around our guidance, I mean 20% god knows whether we're right or not, but we're trying to give you a view of our decrementals, the 20%. Our decrementals -- if it's worse than 20% and the costs that we've taken out and sort of how those costs will behave when the market recovers. And so that's what we're trying to communicate.\nSteve Tusa: Right. I mean, I was giving more credit to Joe and Steve anyway, so. But you're doing -- you\u2019re -- you've got a little bit of credit as well. I mean you have the [multiple speakers]\nTodd Bluedorn: I'm so glad to see this crisis hasn\u2019t softened you in any way.\nSteve Tusa: You've got -- yes, you got to get the rubber stamp. So anyway, how much of your business is housing now? I feel like a couple of years ago you guys were a little bit overweight on the housing front. How much of your businesses is builders and housing?\nTodd Bluedorn: 15% -- 15% to 20%. 15% to 20%.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Got it. And then just \u2026\nTodd Bluedorn: Resi.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, resi, of course. And then just on the guidance, so if I kind of do the bridge of the midpoint negative kind of 14% revenue and then 25% decrementals, it's kind of more around the $7 of EPS range, not $8, is that -- Am I missing something there, or maybe there's a few kind of below the line items that we haven't kind of squared away on that front. We can -- I can also take that off line if it's \u2026\nTodd Bluedorn: You can take -- the answer is rates are down and so we have better interest costs, that may be a piece of it. But I don\u2019t know if that explains the whole dollar, but that's it. But take it off line, I mean, as you can -- we\u2019ve worked and modeled detail ourselves, so we can work with you.\nJoe Reitmeier: I think [indiscernible].\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then how are you balancing this? I mean, it seems like you have embedded some share gains in your numbers, or are you no longer embedding that? I mean, how you're kind of balancing these cost cuts with that drive to kind of recapture some of the tornado share?\nTodd Bluedorn: We still have some share gain in there. But again, as we talked about at the end of December when we were together, a lot of that share gain is already baked into the cake. In other words, those were dealers we were converting in third and fourth quarter and as we turned our new business development process loose. And so now we just need those dealers to buy. So I think we already have some new share baked into the cake. And then again as I mentioned earlier, we continue to sort of protect our key investments to gain share. And our sales guys, while they\u2019re not physically calling on many of our customers, they\u2019re calling on our customers and we are still out there pushing and driving to get share of wallet of our customers. So again, there is not heroic share of gain in that number, but there is some share gain in that number.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then just one last quick one. Usually commercial kind of has a weak 1quarter and then steps up to almost double that in the second quarter and then bounces around a little bit, perhaps kind of fade to the rest of the year. Given you kind of, you didn't really see a drop off there yet, but you\u2019re -- you're going to kind of experience one here in the next couple of quarters, are we -- should we just kind of assume like a, flat to up type of number from the first quarter for the rest of the year like, I'm just trying to kind of better understand the seasonal dynamics, or the lack thereof.\nTodd Bluedorn: So let me get this right. Most of my peers are pulling guidance and you want me to give a segment revenue forecast by quarter?\nSteve Tusa: No, I guess just do you anticipate that seasonal step up, I guess, is the simple question. It would seem like you and your guide, but I'm just that's the simple question.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. I think that the answer is our commercial team is on a roll. And they were on a roll before the virus hit. And so the virus is going to impact them in a meaningful way. Down -- the market's going to go down 25%. But they're gaining share and they're winning in the marketplace. And I think all that's going to be consistent even with the market that's down 25%.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot guys. Really appreciate the details again. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hi, Nicole.\nJoe Reitmeier: Hi.\nNicole DeBlase: So maybe carrying on from Steve's question a little bit. With respect to the 20% revenue impact that you've embedded for the full-year, is all of that coming in the second quarter? And I guess, was there any in 1Q and are you embedding like a pretty quick snapback in the second quarter? Just trying to get a sense of like where that impact is lying.\nTodd Bluedorn: No. I mean, I'm not going to necessarily give quarterly guidance, but what we baked in was for the balance -- for full-year our guide is down 20%. And so for balance of the year its down even more than that. And it gives you the weighted average of what happened in the first quarter, it's down 21%, 22%, 23% for the balance of the year. And that's the guide that we are giving. Now I think it may be worse in second quarter than it is in third and fourth quarter, but I'm not sure. But the way we've loaded it into our internal models is equally split across the quarters, so it's down the same each quarter because again, it's -- I don't want to give too much precision assumption around the 20%, I mean, it's not like we did this bottoms up roll by quarter by business unit, by AOR, by new construction and came up with this detailed number, it's 20% and we ran it across the business. We did it by quarter and we set our costs that way and we're going to stop to see how this plays out. There's too many variables to really know for certain how it's going to play out.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay. Totally fair. Got it. Thanks, Todd. And then just for my follow-up, then maybe drawing on what you've seen in your career and past downturns, is there a risk that in the resi business we see a big shift away from replacement and towards repair Band-Aid of systems over the next several years as this plays out?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, I think when you -- if we end up in a world which it looks like we're going to do 25%, 30% unemployment, people are going to try and Band-Aid their units. So, yes, I think we'll see a spike up in parts and repair parts and then a decline in units. I think that's assumption sort of baked in broadly speaking to our number. But yes, that's what happened. Now how's this for trying to find a silver lining? That just like we saw after the financial crisis, that demand doesn't go away, it just gets pushed out. And I'm looking forward to, I don't know if it's a year from now, year and a half now, we'll have a new model out about all the pent-up demand that was created in the throes of all this, and all that demand will come back to us. And just like in 10, 11 and 12, we'll have resi markets that are up double digits because all this pent-up demand will be unleashed. So we're not Carnival Cruises, we're not Caesar's Palace. It's not when this demand goes away and never comes back or you lose it forever, this demand gets pushed out. And so we're pushing it out. But it will come back.\nNicole DeBlase: Thanks, Todd. I will pass it on.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Wojs: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hi, Tim.\nTimothy Wojs: I guess among -- some of your third-party distributors and just some of your larger stocking dealers, how do you feel about just kind of their financial profile and kind of access to credit, I guess more broadly.\nTodd Bluedorn: It's a great question. We keep a close eye on that. They're in good shape. Broadly speaking, I'm not aware of any of our large dealer or distributor customers having any issue. They\u2019re savvy business people. We've -- we aggressively reached out to the dealer network and had webinars and training around the small business loans that were available or grants and hopefully there's more of that money coming. And we've worked with our partners to make sure they have access to that, that's something that they want to do. But again, it's a little bit of a survival of the fittest. Most of our customers survived the financial crisis and the housing downturn and the bubble of residential market. And so they're savvy and they know how to -- they know what they need to do.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. And then just on mix. Have you seen, I guess, on the demand oriented business, have you seen any changes in mix, over the last probably 4 to 6 weeks, and then are you embedding some deterioration as you kind of go to the summer?\nTodd Bluedorn: We've -- again, it's early, because we're only a couple weeks into this. But what our expectation would be you'd have some mix down in resi and that's built into the numbers.\nTimothy Wojs: Okay. Okay. Thanks for all the color and good luck to this.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: And I do want to say, well done on the guidance, because I don't think there's going to be too many people giving us perspective. So it's really well appreciated. Thanks a lot.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes.\nNigel Coe: So on the components of the guide, you took down the price by $5 million. Is that purely just on the lower volumes you get of the less price benefits, or is there some element of pricing pressure across various businesses? And I guess the question is, are you seeing any deterioration in pricing?\nTodd Bluedorn: No. You've got it, it's broadly speaking, the reduction in volume.\nNigel Coe: Okay, great. And then on -- you mentioned shutting down factories at the end of March in both the U.S and Europe. We've seen this across the board. To what degree did that impact your productivity? Actually having those factories shuts for a week or so in the quarter. And then on a go-forward basis, testing employees and maintaining distances within the factory, to what extent does that limit or maybe raise costs in terms of ramping up production and raising the kind of go-forward costs.\nTodd Bluedorn: We've managed it well so far. We've -- cleaning the factories, lots of hand gel, even things like putting plastic barriers between some of the assembly stations, we\u2019re in the process of ramping up PPE gloves, taking people's temperatures, those sort of things. And so we\u2019re like most of industrial America, we're working our way through this. We had a shut down on our two French factories. We had a shut down in our Marshalltown factory because we had some cases and also quite a few quarantines, but both those factories are up and running. As I speak today -- I didn\u2019t check first thing this morning, but as I speak today, all our factories are running. Different levels of absenteeism in our factories as people stay away from work. And again, this isn't a political statement. It's just an observation that our factories in places like Iowa, Arkansas, Georgia, and they're not in New York City, they're not in California. And so some of our workers have a different perspective on the virus than I do maybe. And so they're coming to work, but even beyond that, we're taking care of them. Make sure it works. I mean - and then second order equation, obviously, in our factories has to do with the supply chain. And our team has done a great job of managing that first in Asia, and that's now way in the rear-view mirror. Increasingly, it's about Mexico and U.S. of making sure that our supply base runs and it has. And then the final piece is you get a little bit more wiggle room on this when the markets are declining. So the markets are declining even if we have some issues around production, we're able to absorb it in a natural way because even if we had a 100% production capability, we would have to bring down our factories in any case to help manage the inventory levels. And so even if we have some places where we have to take it down, we take it down in an orderly way.\nNigel Coe: That's great color. And then a quick one on the Mexican supply chain. I hear there's one or two factories were shut down by the Mexican government. Is that now back up and running?\nTodd Bluedorn: Our factory was never shut down, so we actually went through -- I\u2019m going to be careful I don\u2019t advertise it to the -- too much to the government where they want to prove me wrong. But we had the federal Mexican government come in and inspect us on an afternoon and we got a stamp of approval, both as an essential industry and also about all the processes that we were using to protect our people. And so we were down in Mexico, we took it down just for production reasons, but we haven't taken it down because the government thought we should.\nNigel Coe: Okay, guys, good luck. Thanks.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, John. Hey. So I guess, I think it was in response to an earlier question when you were talking about how the decrementals throttle a different volume declines. You\u2019ve obviously running that scenario analysis. So what are you watching for to see if volumes could actually be down worse than you're kind of expecting? Is it the employment numbers, is it consumer confidence, something else? Maybe what are the indicators you're watching for that?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, I mean, this is as you know, an imprecise science. And I think we are watching macro trends, but I mean, we're sort of off the board with macro trends. And so we're trying to spend time with our customers for looking at order rates, we're just seeing what happens. The one number that I have taken most comfort in today has been the demand business in our residential. And as I said earlier, that was down a little bit month to date, but still reasonably solid, now all things considering. And that gives me comfort that when people's air conditioning breaks and need to get it fixed, they need to get it addressed, they\u2019re at home and it's still flowing. And the other thing that I -- that we keep track of is that we're happy that we're in the central business. And so our dealers are working across the country and they're up and running and they're going out taking care of their homeowner customers. And so as long as all that's in place, then that's a good sign that we look at. But the way I think about this is we measured twice and then we cut once. So we measured 20% down, we cut. And now we quite frankly just got to let it play out a little bit. I'm not sure we are going to know a whole lot more next week than we know today or even three weeks or a month. I think we've got to get through the summer selling season or into the summer selling season to see how things are behaving, and then we'll readjust our thinking then.\nJohn Walsh: Thank you. And then maybe just a follow on a high level picture here. Obviously, one of the nice secular tailwinds in HVAC is around energy efficiency regulations, refrigerant changes. It might be too early, but are you hearing conversations that some of the bodies that govern this might be wanting to throttle back or push back instead of when we get some of these changes, or is that not something we would expect to see, depending on the duration of this downturn?\nTodd Bluedorn: The honest answer is, I don't know. We haven't heard anything yet. I mean, two ways to look at it. One would be some may think that's a stimulus to the economy, not to force industries to add costs. Another view may be the scientists may actually be right on some of these things and protecting the environment may make sense. So I think it could cut both ways.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nDeepa Raghavan: Hey, good morning, all.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hi, Deepa.\nDeepa Raghavan: Hey, can you -- Todd, can you talk through how your revenue mix is right now on the residential front versus geographies that are being hard hit with the lockdown? I mean, New York, California, Pennsylvania and some parts of the Midwest, obviously, but are you underrepresented or over represented in some of these places? Can you talk through that broadly, please?\nTodd Bluedorn: No, I don't -- I'm not worried about being underrepresented anywhere or over represented somewhere else. I think, again, it's a small sample size, but sort over the last three or four weeks, there's parts of the country, the Southeast, that continues to do well. So our revenue in resi over the last three weeks in the Southeast is actually up. Our revenue in Canada is down and down pretty significantly. And I think that reflects the Canadians took the lockdown pretty serious and things are flowing as well there. But I don't think we're under -- we're not under -- we have lower share, certainly, and higher share depending on where you look in the country. But there's no step function difference. So we're ready to play no matter where the markets are strong.\nDeepa Raghavan: Okay. So you've not necessarily been additionally hit in places where the lockdown has been stronger. It's the best to now have you \u2026\nTodd Bluedorn: No, I misunderstood the question. Yes, I mean, when -- in the parts of the country where people are abiding most closely. So in the Northeast -- in the Northeast, we're down much more than we are in the Southeast. And so in Florida, we're actually up year-over-year in April. And in the Northeast, we're down and down pretty significantly year-over-year. So, yes, I think you think about it that way.\nDeepa Raghavan: Okay, got it. My follow-up is on, some color versus last cycle. You obviously divested some businesses since the last recession, Hearth, etcetera. Can you talk through some data on how the repair and replacement dynamics played out, not including those businesses? And how maybe you're thinking through -- how unemployment rate or any of these other metrics that you probably analyze at your end that actually will determine when people actually get back into replacement mode. I mean, obviously going to recession, people choose to repair. You have mid-teens unemployment rate, but that probably starts to peter out. But is there like a threshold metric, like an unemployment rate or something [multiple speakers]?\nTodd Bluedorn: No, I mean, there's not a math formula. When I think about what happened during the financial crisis, it was a multitude of things, and some of them are true now, some of them aren\u2019t and then there's a whole new set of things now. So one thing we saw during the financial crisis, it was a housing led problem. And so that was in our sweet spot. And existing home values went down in many parts of the country 30%, 40%, 50%. And that had a chilling effect on people wanting to spend $5,000 to put an air conditioner in. And then you laid on top of that the housing crisis turned into a financial crisis, which led to unemployment and lack of consumer confidence. Now where we sit today so far in this is, it's hard -- it's going to be higher unemployment. Consumer confidence, we'll see how that plays out, but I guess -- my guess is it's going to follow unemployment. But we haven't had a crash in the housing market so far. And so I -- and then the other question is, what's the recovery look back like and how quickly do people come back? And so I just think there's variables out there. I think there's clearly going to be some repair versus replace in the near-term. How long it lasts, I\u2019m not certain.\nDeepa Raghavan: Got it. Thank you so much.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nWalter Liptak: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. And I'll say thanks to you for the guidance. And I wonder if you could talk a little bit more, kind of a follow on to the last question about this 3-recession analysis, which I think looks like the right way to look at this. But each one of those recessions was a little bit different. And I wonder why, considering what you just said in the last question, why you took the conservative route with the guidance versus you expecting more of a snap back in the second half?\nTodd Bluedorn: My experience, especially from 9/11 running the Carrier Commercial business, is it was death to chase the market down. I think you've got to get out ahead of it and get your cost sized right. And the costs that we took, a lot of them were pay cuts and incentive cuts and things that can -- that we can sort of unleash again if we had to if the market takes back. But the worst thing to do, I think or one of the worst things to do is to, one call we say the market is going to be down 5, then it's down 10, then it's down 15, then it's down 20, because that means we're running our business that way. And then if you\u2019re chasing the cost down, it's just so disruptive to the organization. It's better to get it out of the way, measure twice, cut once. And if you're wrong, have enough inventory to prove everybody that you can manage the upside also and I think that's what we've done. I just find that a better way to run the business.\nWalter Liptak: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. The bad debts this quarter didn't look that bad yet. And I wonder if you can talk about how bad debts should trend given your outlook and how they did in the last recessions.\nTodd Bluedorn: They held up well last time. We didn't have much of a debt problem. And again, we are not -- we are exposed to tens of thousands of small customers. And we have a pretty good group who is constantly monitoring that. And even on the national accounts side, we sell to pretty high caliber brands and customers. And so that wasn't a concern last time. I don't expect it will be a major concern this time, although we're focused on it and watching it.\nWalter Liptak: Okay, great. Thank you.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nRobert McCarthy: Good morning.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, Rob.\nRobert McCarthy: Thanks for all the color. Two questions and I know we're getting kind of top of the hour, so I will keep it quick. One, on the commercial side, it looks like you took a very appropriate assumption for that 25% decline. I guess, and again, thank you for all the detail on the guidance. So this is a bit of an unfair question, but it probably takes into account the initial disruption. But we just hosted a call with a former CFO of a large retail based restaurant company for quick service dining in a lot of malls and from that standpoint, given what we're seeing with casual dining and then the expected cut in units and then also the independents, we could be in kind of a nuclear winter for commercial real estate for quite some time. How do we think about that in the context beyond the guide of how you're going to manage your business, because could it be maybe not as bad as a 25%, but could we would be looking at 2 to 3 years of just kind of a really tough slog here on the commercial real estate side? And let us know how you think about it?\nTodd Bluedorn: Well, I would say a couple of things. I mean, in our commercial business, we're two-thirds close to 70% replacement. And so we're buffered from commercial new construction in many ways. And that's because we're a replacement market and replacement units are going to have to flow. And then I think there's pockets of demand, I mean, Amazon is a customer, Costco is a customer, Walmart is a customer. Those are all big customers of ours. And so, yes, new construction, you pick your worst case and it could be bad, but we're replacement and we have some large customers and some are doing well and some aren't doing well. And again, as I said earlier, look, I don't have a crystal ball and I can convince myself it's not snap back, I can convince myself to put my head underwater. But we picked a middle path and have sized the business accordingly. And if we're wrong, either direction we will adjust.\nRobert McCarthy: And then just anything else you can add to what you've talked about in terms of just cash collection. And should we be nervous about cash conversion this year, just given kind of the -- through [ph] generous nature of this downturn, or do you think that's going to be something that's fairly manageable.\nTodd Bluedorn: I think it would be fairly manageable. I mean, we'll see how it plays out. But I mean, we've -- we're going to shrink our working capital. We will -- we have a line of sight with our customers and we're collecting receivables to not aging fast yet and we will shrink the inventory and so we will generate cash there. And then we pull back on working capital. And if you look what happened during the financial crisis, and again, it was different and I know you lived through it, Rob, I'm not sure everyone on the call did, intimately but you didn't have the fear of dying, but you certainly had the fear that the world was on fire. And even during the financial crisis, we generated more cash during the financial crisis than we did before because we were able to take working capital a lot quicker than our earnings go down. And that's what we'll see this year.\nRobert McCarthy: And the last thing is, it sounds like from a financing perspective, the fixed income and financing markets remain very robust. Wouldn't you confirm that from your seat?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, I don't know if -- I'm not sure, I'm in a position to say very robust. I'd say we have no concerns. We have no concerns. No issues. We're in great shape.\nRobert McCarthy: Thanks for your time.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDamian Karas: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, Damian.\nDamian Karas: Appreciate all the color on your preparedness to navigate through this downturn as well as on how you get into the 20% forecast. Just have a quick follow-up question on resi mix. You talked about in the past during the global financial crisis how you kind of really saw a bifurcation, if you will, in the resi market with a much higher proportion of the population flocking to minimum efficiency. Have you started seeing that dynamic play out yet? It sounds like in your guidance here you're expecting to some extent that to happen. Could you just kind of remind us of how this sort of price and margin variance is as you move from the minimum efficiency up through your premium product?\nTodd Bluedorn: It scales rough on the price side, it scales rough -- roughly in line this year. So a 26-year order of magnitude is twice as expensive as a 13 SEER. And then the margin percentages, they don't scale quite that way, but a margin percentage at the high-end -- we have a greater margin percentage on the high-end than we do on the entry level, although much closer than it was 7, 8 years ago as we've taken costs out of the entry level product. Yes, as I said earlier, we expect certainly some mix down and it's early, but 2 or 3 weeks in April, we're seeing some of that. And again, as you mentioned or you right, correctly remembered what we saw during the financial crisis was a barbell distribution. People who had money continue to have money and people who were in trouble weren't or didn't and so bought entry level. But in all these things are different. We certainly expect some mix down. We built that into our guide.\nDamian Karas: Okay. That makes sense. And with the current lockdown situation, just wondering if you've seen any change in trends with your online platform. Is there a potential here to maybe see an acceleration in the ramp there, or just kind of too soon to tell with the softening demand environment.\nTodd Bluedorn: Our online platform is for our dealers, contractors. And our sales guys are talking to them all the time. So they want to give us an order over the phone, we'll take that -- take it there. So I don't think there's a huge ramp up online. It's not like a signal to the grocery store, I'm using ships instead to buy it and it's all going online. Our relationship with the dealers hasn't changed that much. We are not going into their office every day, but we're talking to them every day. And a lot of the orders, quite frankly, they don\u2019t come online, the dealers just tell us and we place the orders ourselves.\nDamian Karas: Makes sense. Appreciate the color, guys. Good luck.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Thanks, guys, and appreciate the \u2026\nTodd Bluedorn: Hi, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: How are you doing? I appreciate the granularity as well. I'll be brief. A lot of questions asked and answered. But first, Todd, I was hoping you could give us some historical perspective on how pricing behaves in these downturns and why the industry will be more rational this time?\nTodd Bluedorn: Even in the financial crisis, we got price. We got -- I'm doing it from memory, but I think the worst year in pricing, we got $15 million, $20 million of price on a smaller business than we have today. And we're able to pass it on because there's still sort of pressures that you have on the business. They're not commodities anymore, but it's the additional cost that we have to help protect us from COVID. It's the absenteeism that we have to manage through. So it's sort of the inflationary pressures from, or the cost increases that we're having in that direction, we passed the price on. And we\u2019ve already in many ways passed the price on, it's in the price books. We've had the conversations with our customers. And so we're going to pass it on. And my expectation is our competitors will do the same thing.\nGautam Khanna: And as a follow-up, we've asked about consolidation forever. Do you think the current environment makes it more or less likely to happen?\nTodd Bluedorn: I mean, I think I will just give you a textbook answer. I think it would be if someone gets into a liquidity issue, it certainly helps. And it would have to go on -- the equity values at the current levels would have to stay there, hopefully they don't. But would have to stay there for some period of time before people reset expectations. But it's hard to imagine that very many deals get done in the near-term anywhere in any industry, because people just don't believe that they were 30% less than what they were a month ago or two months ago.\nGautam Khanna: Right. And I'm sorry, a last one, if I could sneak one in. Just to play macro economist. When -- what year would you expect to get back to 2019 levels? I mean, do you -- just based on historical context, is this a 3-year work out of 5-year workout? How bad is it in your -- from where you're sitting?\nTodd Bluedorn: [indiscernible] I don't know. And the reason I don't know is I think you have to answer the \u2013 in my opinion, you have to answer the medical question first. And I just don't know. And so, look, if we have a -- if we have therapeutics in two months, I'd say it's Katy, bar the door. If it's 3 years and we're still searching for a vaccine and the barn's burned down. So you have somewhere between those two and I just don\u2019t know.\nGautam Khanna: Appreciate the candor. Thank you.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys, and appreciate all the detail. So I'll keep it quick. I'm not sure I heard your answer to Julian's question earlier on the cost outs. Are they linear? And then secondly, if this does turn out to be worse than a down 20% market Todd, what other kind of levers do you have at your disposal to try to offset some maybe more dire weakness?\nTodd Bluedorn: I'm not sure I answer that or I answered that question earlier, so I will answer for you. But broadly speaking, the cost take outs are linear, although all things being said, as you can imagine, some of these things kick in a little later in the year. But we've already announced internally the restructuring. They\u2019re already effective. The salary reductions take effect on May 1. And so all that's happening. And then in terms of what other costs we have, I mean, it's still the same three buckets. I mean, it's -- can you -- do you have to attack heads, you attack discretionary spending and you'd have to attack pay. But as I said earlier, we were able to get to a 25% decremental with a contribution margin of close to 40. And so the next tranche down, I would expect the decremental to be closer to 30%, 35%. And so that means while there's some cost there, you run out of -- diminishing opportunities.\nJoe Ritchie: That makes sense. Thanks very much, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks. Appreciate it. Okay, everyone. Appreciate the time, appreciate the interest. To wrap up, these are unprecedented times, but Lennox has a focused and seasoned team with experience in managing through difficult challenges. We will execute on what needs to be done near-term while mindful of the future and are confident we will again strengthen our market position as we emerge in recovery. Thanks, everyone for joining us today. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude our conference for today.

            "name": "Joe Reitmeier",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, starting with Residential Heating & Cooling. In the first quarter, revenue from Residential Heating & Cooling was $442 million, down 5%. Volume was down 6% and price and mix combined was up 1%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Residential profit was $33 million, down 62% as reported, or down 30% adjusted for the insurance benefit in the prior year quarter. Segment margin was 7.4%, down 1,120 basis points as reported, or down 260 basis points adjusted for the insurance benefit in the prior year quarter. Segment profit was negatively impacted by the year-over-year difference in the insurance benefit, unfavorable weather, COVID-19 pandemic that led to lower volume and factory shutdown costs, higher other product costs and unfavorable mix. Partial offsets included favorable price, lower material costs, lower tariffs, favorable warranty costs, lower freight costs, lower SG&A expenses and favorable foreign exchange. Turning to our Commercial Heating & Cooling business. Commercial revenue was up 3% to $170 million. Volume was down 2%, price and mix combined was up 5% and foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Commercial segment profit rose 24% to $19 million. Segment margin expanded 180 basis points to 10.5%. Segment profit was favorably impacted by favorable mix, lower material costs and lower SG&A expenses. Partial offsets included the COVID-19 pandemic that led to lower volume and unfavorable warranty costs. In Refrigeration, on an adjusted basis, first quarter revenue was down $103 million, down 12% -- excuse me, first quarter revenue was $103 million, which was down 12%. Volume was down 12%, price and mix combined was up 1% and foreign exchange had a negative 1% impact on revenue. Refrigeration segment profit was $1 million in the first quarter, down 93% and segment margin was 0.7%, down 730 basis points. Segment profit was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that led to lower volume and factory shutdown costs, higher other product costs and unfavorable mix. Partial offsets include favorable price and lower SG&A expenses. Regarding special items in the quarter. The company had net after tax charges totaling $9.2 million. This included $8.3 million for -- in total for other tax items net and excess tax benefits from share based compensation, $1.3 million for loss from natural disaster net of insurance recoveries and a net benefit of $0.4 million for various other items. Corporate expenses were $14 million in the first quarter, and overall SG&A on an adjusted basis was $131 million or 18.1% of adjusted revenue, down from 18.7% in the prior year quarter. In the first quarter, the company used $99 million of cash from operations compared to a usage $141 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $25 million compared to $37 million in the prior year quarter that also included $7 million of proceeds from divestitures and insurance. Free cash flow was a use of approximately $123 million in the quarter compared to a use of $171 million in the prior year quarter. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, the company tends to have a cash -- have a use of cash early in the year and generates cash later in the year. The company paid $30 million in dividends and repurchased $100 million of stock in the quarter. Total debt was $1.44 billion at the end of the first quarter and we ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.3. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $43 million at the end of March. Now, before I turn it over to Q&A, I will review our current market estimates for 2020. For the industry overall, we now expect North American residential HVAC shipments to be down mid-teens compared to prior expectations to be up mid-single digits, a 20 point negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect both Commercial unitary shipments and Refrigeration shipments in North America to be down 25% compared to our expectation for flat markets. Under these market assumptions, we expect our revenue to be down 11% to 17% from the prior year compared to our prior expectations of 4% to 8% growth. We expect GAAP EPS from continuing operations to be in a range of $7.07 to $8.07 for the year, including a pre-tax charge of approximately $10 million expected in the second quarter for restructuring actions. We expect adjusted EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $7.50 to $8.50 for the year. Previous EPS guidance for both of these was a range of $11.30 to $11.90. Looking at the various puts and takes in our financial assumptions for 2020, we now expect a benefit of $25 million in net price for the year compared to our previous guidance of $30 million. We now expect $20 million -- a $20 million benefit from sourcing and engineering led cost reductions compared to prior guidance of $25 million. Residential factory productivity is expected to flip from a $10 million benefit to a $10 million headwind given the significantly lower volume. Residential mix is now expected to be flat compared to prior guidance of a $5 million benefit. Tariffs are now expected to be neutral compared to prior guidance for a $10 million -- excuse me, a $5 million headwind and commodities are still expected to be a $20 million benefit and freight is still expected to be a $10 million benefit. A few other points to mention in our current financial outlook. Corporate expenses are targeted at $75 million compared to 20 -- excuse me, compared to $90 million previously. Net interest expense and other expense is now expected to be approximately $40 million compared to previous guidance of approximately $50 million. We still expect an effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22% on an adjusted basis for the full-year. We continue to expect weighted average diluted share count for the full-year to be between 38 million to 39 million shares. And as Todd mentioned, our repurchase of $100 million of stock in the first quarter of our $400 million plan going into this year. But we have placed the repurchase plans for the second quarter on hold and we will review plans in third and fourth quarters as the year progresses. The company's quarterly dividend plans are unchanged. Most recently $0.77 per share or more than $115 million for the total year. We are targeting capital expenditures of $120 million this year, down from $153 million previously. Free cash flow is expected to be $340 million this year compared to previous guidance of $410 million. And as Todd talked about, we have taken SG&A cost reduction actions to realize $115 million of savings over the remaining three quarters of this year. We are well-prepared to manage through these market conditions and make adjustments as needed along the way. And with that, let's go to Q&A. Hey, Jeff. I think [indiscernible]. Hi."

            "name": "Todd Bluedorn",
            "content": "Thanks Steve. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. Let me start with a quick overview on the first quarter, then discuss our current outlook for 2020 and the actions we're taking in this unprecedented time. For the first quarter, company revenue was $724 million, down 8% on a GAAP basis, down 4% on an adjusted basis that excludes the impact from divestitures last year. GAAP operating income was $36 million, down from $95 million in the prior year quarter that included approximately $47 million of insurance benefit related to the 2018 tornado. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.32 compared to $1.73 in the prior year quarter that included $0.87 from insurance benefit. On an adjusted basis, total segment profit was $38 million compared to $99 million in the prior year quarter that included $40 million of insurance benefit. Total adjusted segment margin for the first quarter was 5.2% compared to 13.1% in the prior year quarter as reported and 7.8%, excluding the insurance benefit. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.56 compared to $1.68 in the prior year quarter that includes $0.75 of insurance benefit. Looking at the business segment performance for the first quarter, there are a couple of overarching comments to make. First, weather continued to have a significant adverse impact. Heating degree days were down from last year and every month down 15% overall for the quarter. Second, we saw an increasing impact on our business in March from the COVID-19 pandemic, first in Europe and then in North America. On the demand side, we saw contractors stop stocking up less residential equipment ahead of the spring and summer seasons due to the rising economic uncertainty, and national account customers in both our Commercial and Refrigeration businesses have pushed orders out. Operationally, HVAC has been designated an essential business in North America, Europe and in Mexico. We have managed the supply chain well across regions that we source from, including Asia and combined with our buffer stock we have not seen an impact on our manufacturing capability in this regard. In late March, we did make the decision to close some of our factories for a couple of weeks and broadly protected the Lennox team from COVID-19 cases at those locations. These factors are all back up and running and of course, protection for the team members are in place. In our Residential segment, in the first quarter, revenue was down 5%. Revenue from replacement business was down high single digits impacted by the warm weather. New construction revenue was up high single digits as the warm weather generally enabled homebuilders to get an early start in the year. Residential segment profit was $33 million, down from $87 million in the prior year quarter on a reported basis that included the $40 million of insurance benefits that I mentioned earlier. Segment margin was 7.4% in the quarter compared to 18.6% as reported or 10% excluding insurance benefit in the prior year quarter. In Commercial, revenue was up 3% in the first quarter and segment profit rose 24%. Segment margin expanded 180 basis points to 10.5%. Commercial equipment revenue was up low single digits in the quarter. New construction revenue was up high teens and replacement revenue was down high single digits. Breaking out the business another way, revenue from regional and local business was up low single digits. And national account equipment revenue was also up low single digits in the quarter. On the service side, Lennox national account service revenue was up low double digits. In Refrigeration segment for the first quarter, adjusted to exclude the impact from divestitures in the prior year, revenue was down 11% at constant currency. Segment margin declined 730 basis points to 0.7% and segment profit was down 93%. The segment has approximately 55% of its revenue from North America and 45% from Europe, which has seen soft markets for some time and that was impacted earlier from the pandemic in North America, including shut down at both of our French factories. North America revenue was down mid-single digits and Europe revenue was down high teens. Looking ahead for the company overall, market conditions are highly uncertain and there are significant challenges we are addressing. But Lennox has a focused and seasoned team with experience managing through economic downturns in difficult times. For me personally, I manage Carriers HVAC business in Southeast Asia in the wake of the Asian financial crisis in the late 90s. Those of you who don't remember, I urge you to go Google it. I manage Carriers North America HVAC businesses through the impact from 9/11 and then a CEO at Lennox through the residential new construction collapse in the global financial crisis of a little over a decade ago. Based on how HVAC markets performed in those prior downturns, our current view is that the North America residential and commercial unitary HVAC in refrigeration markets will be negatively impacted about 20% this year by the pandemic. We have reset our financial expectations for the year based on that level of market impact and now expect revenue to be down 11% to 17% from last year versus our previous guidance for growth of 4% to 8%. We expect adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $7.50 to $8.50 for the year. We have already taken cost reduction actions to realize approximately $150 million in SG&A savings for the balance of the year. The decremental drop through on the guidance reduction, on our revenue is 25%, which reflects our aggressive cost actions. We expect cash generation to remain strong for this year as working capital requirements shrink and capital expenditure plans have been reduced from $153 million to $120 million this year. We tend to think of maintenance CapEx levels of being around 10% to 15% of that. We are targeting $340 million free cash flow for 2020. Lennox is rated investment grade by both S&P and Moody's and we expect to remain well within our debt covenants. Our bank revolver and asset securitization line do not have to go through renewal again until the latter half of 2021 and our senior notes will not mature until November 2023. The company's quarterly dividend plans are unchanged. Most recently $0.70 per share or more than $150 million in total for this year. We repurchased $100 million of stock in the first quarter of our $400 million planned going into this year. But we have placed repurchases plans for the second quarter on hold and we will review plans for the third and fourth quarter as the year progresses. As I turn it over to Joe to discuss financial results, I will just say that while we execute -- while we execute on what is required in these current economic conditions, we remain mindful of the future and are confident we will once again strengthen our position in the market as we emerge in the recovery. Now I will turn it over to Joe. We haven't broken out that guide. We usually don't give the annual guide, but I think sort of the phenomenon that you saw in first quarter will play out for a little bit longer, which is the starts that have started will continue. And so I wouldn't be surprised to see in the near-term new construction up as that on replacement continues to go down. But I think certainly, I think during the second half of the year the new construction will start to pull back significantly. Yes, we are. I mean, what we've seen is through the end of March, it's sort of hung in there. And then during the first two weeks of April, it's been down mid-to-high teens. And that's, quite frankly, what I would expect. I mean, what we're seeing is we really have two broad buckets of add on the replacement this time of the year. Demand business, which is dealer sees a job, buys the equipment, installs it. The demand business actually is hanging in there relatively well. I mean, it's down low single digits. But where we're seeing a real slowdown is dealer stocking up for the summer selling season. They're just not doing that given all the uncertainty. And I will get a little bit more into this later is, we are an essential business and so we're going to continue to produce. People need our products and that's going to continue to flow. So I -- we'll see what happens. I would look at it -- I would think about the $150 million cost savings this way. About 20% of the savings comes from salaried headcount reductions, about 40% comes from discretionary spending like cuts, like travel, marketing, incentive trips, etcetera. And about 40% come -- comes from pay actions, zero executive incentives and a salary reduction for our salaried employees, 50% for me, 12% for other executives and 6% for other salaried employees. And when you think about those snapping back, I would -- if I was modeling 2021, I would certainly assume that the salary reduction snap back in 2021 because if you do longer than 8 or 9 months, it's really not temporary. And then the other two categories, we just wait and see what was going on with the market conditions. Thanks. Good morning, Julian. Well, I think there's sort of a lot to unpack. The decremental margins in the first quarter were primarily driven by the bad mix that we had in residential. And we talked about that publicly at Steve Tusa's conference about midway through March. And while we said there was that the warm weather had impacted our furnace sales and our parts and supply sales, and those are our two most profitable business lines and that had a real impact to the business. When I think about the balance of the year, the reason we're able to get 25% decrementals is we've taken $115 million costs out of the business. So our normal contribution margin is order of magnitude 38%, 40%. And if we took no cost actions and the decrementals come in around 40%, but we took out $150 million of cost. And so we're now going to see decrementals in the order of magnitude of 25%. And then, the other point I would make, I'm going to ask the question -- but I will ramble when I'm talking. I mean, 20% is an uncertain number. We -- that's after an obvious statement for the day. And as I mentioned on the call, I've been through a couple of these. And when I was a carrier in North America, run a commercial business after 9/11 and then here at the financial crisis, and so the 20% sort of feels right given what happens in those downturns. But it's sort of a ballpark number. And we're -- we were able to get 25% decrementals on a 20% drop in the market. But if the market goes down more than 20%, the cost levers are harder to find. And so if you're building your own model, our decrementals after we're down more than 20% revenue are going to be more like 30%, 35%. But for that first drop of 20%, $150 million are cost take outs allowed us to -- will allow us to deliver a 25% decremental. The broad -- the guide that we gave is down 25% from North America unitary. We haven't bifurcated it. I would -- without putting numbers on it, tell you that my experience what will happen, quite frankly, what is happening is that the new -- it's like residential, new construction continues until all the projects that have started wind down. And that hasn't happened yet, but it will. The planned replacement continues to flow for a little bit until all the decision makers decide what they need to do to pullback to get their companies lined up correctly. So planned replacements, some of its slowing down over the last two weeks. And then the third piece of the business is at want demand or emerging replacement. And that continues to flow even in the tough times because people need to buy HVAC. And so my experience when I ran Carrier during 9/11 is the marble rolls off the table on commercial quickly and are better stated. When it happens, it happens quickly. And the marble hasn't rolled off yet. I mean, we're down. Backlog order rates are down maybe 10%, not 25% yet, but our guess is that it will. Thanks. Hey, Jeff. The parts plus build out as we've put the 20 stores that we're going to add in 2020 on pause for right now. So right now, the plan is not to add. We're not in the process of adding any new stores. We'll get partway through the year just like on the share buyback and reevaluate that. What we've been very focused on is we made these SG&A cuts. Again, my experience from prior downturns is it's easy to cut costs, it's easy to gain share, it's hard to do both at the same time. And so we've been very focused about what are the investments we want to protect. And so we've protected all our new product development programs. We've protected all our key digitization programs. And while we aren't adding new stores, we're not decimating our distribution network. We're keeping it intact. And so it's protection of the key growth initiatives that we have. We're still keeping those intact. And we've asked for shared sacrifice of employees as we've taken a salary reduction rather than cut some of those key programs. Short answer is yes to that final piece, which is we've got lots of inventory and we're not -- we're going to manage inventory appropriately to hit our free cash flow target. But we're prepared for the spring back. And so we hope we're wrong on the 20%. I hope it's a lot less than that. And if it is, then we're going to be chugging [ph] and we will be selling product and our dealers will be ready to go. They just don't want to carry the inventory right now, so we are carrying it for them. When we talk to the dealer contractors depending on what part of the country you're in and you could figure that out on your own, where there's less concern about all this, they're still relatively optimistic. But again, my experience on prior prices was if you rely on your dealer contractor to tell you the market is going to turn, then you've waited too long. But there's sort of quick in the debt and all this and you either sort of figure out that the market is turning, you get your costs in line and you have inventory takes you wrong and then you bounce back with it. If you don't do that, what happens is you chase the market down with cost cuts and you end up cutting costs right when the market is getting ready to turn. And it's better to cut them now, get it behind you and move on, that's what we've done. The optimistic answer to your question is, if we're wrong on the market and the market starts to come back, we'll rock and roll several of our dealers. I mean, there were a couple of things in the quarter that ... Yes, there were a couple of things in the quarter that really drove the margins down and obviously they were disappointing margins. One is, we had our two French factories shut down because of COVID virus and that was about $2 million of EBIT negative impact. We had year-over-year difference in refrigerant sales. Remember, last year we said had this windfall of a couple of million in the first quarter, that didn't repeat. And then the volume being down 10%, the volume are down 10% and we hadn't taken all the cost actions yet. And so we had some painful decrementals. As we go through the balance of the year, hopefully the factory shutdowns are behind us, but who knows, the refrigerant noise is behind us and we've taken the cost actions to adjust our costs for the lower volume. Thanks, Jeff. Hey, Steve. I will just sort of give an advertisement then for my colleagues. We've always been transparent, but every training and leadership instinct I've ever been taught or learned is in a crisis you want to even be more transparent. So I think sort of pulling guidance and hiding isn't the way to go now. Again, we're putting large caveats around our guidance, I mean 20% god knows whether we're right or not, but we're trying to give you a view of our decrementals, the 20%. Our decrementals -- if it's worse than 20% and the costs that we've taken out and sort of how those costs will behave when the market recovers. And so that's what we're trying to communicate. I'm so glad to see this crisis hasn't softened you in any way. 15% -- 15% to 20%. 15% to 20%. Resi. You can take -- the answer is rates are down and so we have better interest costs, that may be a piece of it. But I don't know if that explains the whole dollar, but that's it. But take it off line, I mean, as you can -- we've worked and modeled detail ourselves, so we can work with you. We still have some share gain in there. But again, as we talked about at the end of December when we were together, a lot of that share gain is already baked into the cake. In other words, those were dealers we were converting in third and fourth quarter and as we turned our new business development process loose. And so now we just need those dealers to buy. So I think we already have some new share baked into the cake. And then again as I mentioned earlier, we continue to sort of protect our key investments to gain share. And our sales guys, while they're not physically calling on many of our customers, they're calling on our customers and we are still out there pushing and driving to get share of wallet of our customers. So again, there is not heroic share of gain in that number, but there is some share gain in that number. So let me get this right. Most of my peers are pulling guidance and you want me to give a segment revenue forecast by quarter? Yes. I think that the answer is our commercial team is on a roll. And they were on a roll before the virus hit. And so the virus is going to impact them in a meaningful way. Down -- the market's going to go down 25%. But they're gaining share and they're winning in the marketplace. And I think all that's going to be consistent even with the market that's down 25%. Hi, Nicole. No. I mean, I'm not going to necessarily give quarterly guidance, but what we baked in was for the balance -- for full-year our guide is down 20%. And so for balance of the year its down even more than that. And it gives you the weighted average of what happened in the first quarter, it's down 21%, 22%, 23% for the balance of the year. And that's the guide that we are giving. Now I think it may be worse in second quarter than it is in third and fourth quarter, but I'm not sure. But the way we've loaded it into our internal models is equally split across the quarters, so it's down the same each quarter because again, it's -- I don't want to give too much precision assumption around the 20%, I mean, it's not like we did this bottoms up roll by quarter by business unit, by AOR, by new construction and came up with this detailed number, it's 20% and we ran it across the business. We did it by quarter and we set our costs that way and we're going to stop to see how this plays out. There's too many variables to really know for certain how it's going to play out. Yes, I think when you -- if we end up in a world which it looks like we're going to do 25%, 30% unemployment, people are going to try and Band-Aid their units. So, yes, I think we'll see a spike up in parts and repair parts and then a decline in units. I think that's assumption sort of baked in broadly speaking to our number. But yes, that's what happened. Now how's this for trying to find a silver lining? That just like we saw after the financial crisis, that demand doesn't go away, it just gets pushed out. And I'm looking forward to, I don't know if it's a year from now, year and a half now, we'll have a new model out about all the pent-up demand that was created in the throes of all this, and all that demand will come back to us. And just like in 10, 11 and 12, we'll have resi markets that are up double digits because all this pent-up demand will be unleashed. So we're not Carnival Cruises, we're not Caesar's Palace. It's not when this demand goes away and never comes back or you lose it forever, this demand gets pushed out. And so we're pushing it out. But it will come back. Thanks. Hi, Tim. It's a great question. We keep a close eye on that. They're in good shape. Broadly speaking, I'm not aware of any of our large dealer or distributor customers having any issue. They're savvy business people. We've -- we aggressively reached out to the dealer network and had webinars and training around the small business loans that were available or grants and hopefully there's more of that money coming. And we've worked with our partners to make sure they have access to that, that's something that they want to do. But again, it's a little bit of a survival of the fittest. Most of our customers survived the financial crisis and the housing downturn and the bubble of residential market. And so they're savvy and they know how to -- they know what they need to do. We've -- again, it's early, because we're only a couple weeks into this. But what our expectation would be you'd have some mix down in resi and that's built into the numbers. Thanks. Hey, Nigel. Yes. No. You've got it, it's broadly speaking, the reduction in volume. We've managed it well so far. We've -- cleaning the factories, lots of hand gel, even things like putting plastic barriers between some of the assembly stations, we're in the process of ramping up PPE gloves, taking people's temperatures, those sort of things. And so we're like most of industrial America, we're working our way through this. We had a shut down on our two French factories. We had a shut down in our Marshalltown factory because we had some cases and also quite a few quarantines, but both those factories are up and running. As I speak today -- I didn't check first thing this morning, but as I speak today, all our factories are running. Different levels of absenteeism in our factories as people stay away from work. And again, this isn't a political statement. It's just an observation that our factories in places like Iowa, Arkansas, Georgia, and they're not in New York City, they're not in California. And so some of our workers have a different perspective on the virus than I do maybe. And so they're coming to work, but even beyond that, we're taking care of them. Make sure it works. I mean - and then second order equation, obviously, in our factories has to do with the supply chain. And our team has done a great job of managing that first in Asia, and that's now way in the rear-view mirror. Increasingly, it's about Mexico and U.S. of making sure that our supply base runs and it has. And then the final piece is you get a little bit more wiggle room on this when the markets are declining. So the markets are declining even if we have some issues around production, we're able to absorb it in a natural way because even if we had a 100% production capability, we would have to bring down our factories in any case to help manage the inventory levels. And so even if we have some places where we have to take it down, we take it down in an orderly way. Our factory was never shut down, so we actually went through -- I'm going to be careful I don't advertise it to the -- too much to the government where they want to prove me wrong. But we had the federal Mexican government come in and inspect us on an afternoon and we got a stamp of approval, both as an essential industry and also about all the processes that we were using to protect our people. And so we were down in Mexico, we took it down just for production reasons, but we haven't taken it down because the government thought we should. Thanks. Hey, John. Hey. So I guess, I think it was in response to an earlier question when you were talking about how the decrementals throttle a different volume declines. You've obviously running that scenario analysis. So what are you watching for to see if volumes could actually be down worse than you're kind of expecting? Is it the employment numbers, is it consumer confidence, something else? Maybe what are the indicators you're watching for that? Yes, I mean, this is as you know, an imprecise science. And I think we are watching macro trends, but I mean, we're sort of off the board with macro trends. And so we're trying to spend time with our customers for looking at order rates, we're just seeing what happens. The one number that I have taken most comfort in today has been the demand business in our residential. And as I said earlier, that was down a little bit month to date, but still reasonably solid, now all things considering. And that gives me comfort that when people's air conditioning breaks and need to get it fixed, they need to get it addressed, they're at home and it's still flowing. And the other thing that I -- that we keep track of is that we're happy that we're in the central business. And so our dealers are working across the country and they're up and running and they're going out taking care of their homeowner customers. And so as long as all that's in place, then that's a good sign that we look at. But the way I think about this is we measured twice and then we cut once. So we measured 20% down, we cut. And now we quite frankly just got to let it play out a little bit. I'm not sure we are going to know a whole lot more next week than we know today or even three weeks or a month. I think we've got to get through the summer selling season or into the summer selling season to see how things are behaving, and then we'll readjust our thinking then. The honest answer is, I don't know. We haven't heard anything yet. I mean, two ways to look at it. One would be some may think that's a stimulus to the economy, not to force industries to add costs. Another view may be the scientists may actually be right on some of these things and protecting the environment may make sense. So I think it could cut both ways. Thanks. Hi, Deepa. No, I don't -- I'm not worried about being underrepresented anywhere or over represented somewhere else. I think, again, it's a small sample size, but sort over the last three or four weeks, there's parts of the country, the Southeast, that continues to do well. So our revenue in resi over the last three weeks in the Southeast is actually up. Our revenue in Canada is down and down pretty significantly. And I think that reflects the Canadians took the lockdown pretty serious and things are flowing as well there. But I don't think we're under -- we're not under -- we have lower share, certainly, and higher share depending on where you look in the country. But there's no step function difference. So we're ready to play no matter where the markets are strong. No, I misunderstood the question. Yes, I mean, when -- in the parts of the country where people are abiding most closely. So in the Northeast -- in the Northeast, we're down much more than we are in the Southeast. And so in Florida, we're actually up year-over-year in April. And in the Northeast, we're down and down pretty significantly year-over-year. So, yes, I think you think about it that way. No, I mean, there's not a math formula. When I think about what happened during the financial crisis, it was a multitude of things, and some of them are true now, some of them aren't and then there's a whole new set of things now. So one thing we saw during the financial crisis, it was a housing led problem. And so that was in our sweet spot. And existing home values went down in many parts of the country 30%, 40%, 50%. And that had a chilling effect on people wanting to spend $5,000 to put an air conditioner in. And then you laid on top of that the housing crisis turned into a financial crisis, which led to unemployment and lack of consumer confidence. Now where we sit today so far in this is, it's hard -- it's going to be higher unemployment. Consumer confidence, we'll see how that plays out, but I guess -- my guess is it's going to follow unemployment. But we haven't had a crash in the housing market so far. And so I -- and then the other question is, what's the recovery look back like and how quickly do people come back? And so I just think there's variables out there. I think there's clearly going to be some repair versus replace in the near-term. How long it lasts, I'm not certain. Thanks. My experience, especially from 9/11 running the Carrier Commercial business, is it was death to chase the market down. I think you've got to get out ahead of it and get your cost sized right. And the costs that we took, a lot of them were pay cuts and incentive cuts and things that can -- that we can sort of unleash again if we had to if the market takes back. But the worst thing to do, I think or one of the worst things to do is to, one call we say the market is going to be down 5, then it's down 10, then it's down 15, then it's down 20, because that means we're running our business that way. And then if you're chasing the cost down, it's just so disruptive to the organization. It's better to get it out of the way, measure twice, cut once. And if you're wrong, have enough inventory to prove everybody that you can manage the upside also and I think that's what we've done. I just find that a better way to run the business. They held up well last time. We didn't have much of a debt problem. And again, we are not -- we are exposed to tens of thousands of small customers. And we have a pretty good group who is constantly monitoring that. And even on the national accounts side, we sell to pretty high caliber brands and customers. And so that wasn't a concern last time. I don't expect it will be a major concern this time, although we're focused on it and watching it. Thanks. Hey, Rob. Well, I would say a couple of things. I mean, in our commercial business, we're two-thirds close to 70% replacement. And so we're buffered from commercial new construction in many ways. And that's because we're a replacement market and replacement units are going to have to flow. And then I think there's pockets of demand, I mean, Amazon is a customer, Costco is a customer, Walmart is a customer. Those are all big customers of ours. And so, yes, new construction, you pick your worst case and it could be bad, but we're replacement and we have some large customers and some are doing well and some aren't doing well. And again, as I said earlier, look, I don't have a crystal ball and I can convince myself it's not snap back, I can convince myself to put my head underwater. But we picked a middle path and have sized the business accordingly. And if we're wrong, either direction we will adjust. I think it would be fairly manageable. I mean, we'll see how it plays out. But I mean, we've -- we're going to shrink our working capital. We will -- we have a line of sight with our customers and we're collecting receivables to not aging fast yet and we will shrink the inventory and so we will generate cash there. And then we pull back on working capital. And if you look what happened during the financial crisis, and again, it was different and I know you lived through it, Rob, I'm not sure everyone on the call did, intimately but you didn't have the fear of dying, but you certainly had the fear that the world was on fire. And even during the financial crisis, we generated more cash during the financial crisis than we did before because we were able to take working capital a lot quicker than our earnings go down. And that's what we'll see this year. Yes, I don't know if -- I'm not sure, I'm in a position to say very robust. I'd say we have no concerns. We have no concerns. No issues. We're in great shape. Thanks. Hey, Damian. It scales rough on the price side, it scales rough -- roughly in line this year. So a 26-year order of magnitude is twice as expensive as a 13 SEER. And then the margin percentages, they don't scale quite that way, but a margin percentage at the high-end -- we have a greater margin percentage on the high-end than we do on the entry level, although much closer than it was 7, 8 years ago as we've taken costs out of the entry level product. Yes, as I said earlier, we expect certainly some mix down and it's early, but 2 or 3 weeks in April, we're seeing some of that. And again, as you mentioned or you right, correctly remembered what we saw during the financial crisis was a barbell distribution. People who had money continue to have money and people who were in trouble weren't or didn't and so bought entry level. But in all these things are different. We certainly expect some mix down. We built that into our guide. Our online platform is for our dealers, contractors. And our sales guys are talking to them all the time. So they want to give us an order over the phone, we'll take that -- take it there. So I don't think there's a huge ramp up online. It's not like a signal to the grocery store, I'm using ships instead to buy it and it's all going online. Our relationship with the dealers hasn't changed that much. We are not going into their office every day, but we're talking to them every day. And a lot of the orders, quite frankly, they don't come online, the dealers just tell us and we place the orders ourselves. Thanks. Thank you. Hi, Gautam. Even in the financial crisis, we got price. We got -- I'm doing it from memory, but I think the worst year in pricing, we got $15 million, $20 million of price on a smaller business than we have today. And we're able to pass it on because there's still sort of pressures that you have on the business. They're not commodities anymore, but it's the additional cost that we have to help protect us from COVID. It's the absenteeism that we have to manage through. So it's sort of the inflationary pressures from, or the cost increases that we're having in that direction, we passed the price on. And we've already in many ways passed the price on, it's in the price books. We've had the conversations with our customers. And so we're going to pass it on. And my expectation is our competitors will do the same thing. I mean, I think I will just give you a textbook answer. I think it would be if someone gets into a liquidity issue, it certainly helps. And it would have to go on -- the equity values at the current levels would have to stay there, hopefully they don't. But would have to stay there for some period of time before people reset expectations. But it's hard to imagine that very many deals get done in the near-term anywhere in any industry, because people just don't believe that they were 30% less than what they were a month ago or two months ago. [indiscernible] I don't know. And the reason I don't know is I think you have to answer the \u2013 in my opinion, you have to answer the medical question first. And I just don't know. And so, look, if we have a -- if we have therapeutics in two months, I'd say it's Katy, bar the door. If it's 3 years and we're still searching for a vaccine and the barn's burned down. So you have somewhere between those two and I just don't know. Thanks. I'm not sure I answer that or I answered that question earlier, so I will answer for you. But broadly speaking, the cost take outs are linear, although all things being said, as you can imagine, some of these things kick in a little later in the year. But we've already announced internally the restructuring. They're already effective. The salary reductions take effect on May 1. And so all that's happening. And then in terms of what other costs we have, I mean, it's still the same three buckets. I mean, it's -- can you -- do you have to attack heads, you attack discretionary spending and you'd have to attack pay. But as I said earlier, we were able to get to a 25% decremental with a contribution margin of close to 40. And so the next tranche down, I would expect the decremental to be closer to 30%, 35%. And so that means while there's some cost there, you run out of -- diminishing opportunities. Thanks. Appreciate it. Okay, everyone. Appreciate the time, appreciate the interest. To wrap up, these are unprecedented times, but Lennox has a focused and seasoned team with experience in managing through difficult challenges. We will execute on what needs to be done near-term while mindful of the future and are confident we will again strengthen our market position as we emerge in recovery. Thanks, everyone for joining us today. Have a good day."

At the request of your host, all lines are currently in a listen-only mode. There will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Steve Harrison, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSteve Harrison: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for this review of Lennox International's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2021. I'm here today with Chairman and CEO, Todd Bluedorn and CFO, Joe Reitmeier. Todd will review key points for the quarter, and Joe will take you through the company's financial performance for the quarter and year, as well as the outlook for 2022.  To give everyone time to ask questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to a couple of questions or follow-ups and re-queue for any additional questions. In the earnings release we issued this morning, we have included the necessary reconciliation of the non - GAAP financial measures that will be discussed to GAAP measures. All comparisons mentioned today are against the prior year period. You can find a direct link to the webcast of today's conference call on our website at www.lennoxinternational.com.  The webcast will be archived on the site for replay. I would like to remind everyone that in the course of this call, to give you a better understanding of our operations, we will be making certain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. For information concerning these risks and uncertainties, see Lennox International's publicly available filings with the SEC. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Now, let me turn the call over to Chairman and CEO Todd Bluedorn.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks Steve. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. Let me start with the financial highlights for 2021 overall, and then walk through the fourth quarter as the company closed out a year of record revenue and earnings per share. Overall for 2021, revenue rose to 15% to a record $4.2 billion, at constant-currency revenue was up 14%. GAAP operating income rose 23% to $590 million. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rose 34% to a record $12.39.  Total segment profit for the full year rose 19% to $604 million. And the total segment margin expanded 50 basis points to 14.4%. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations rose to 27% to a record $12.60. Turning to fourth quarter financial results were impacted by 6% fewer days in the prior year quarter. As well as the continued impact from COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions that significantly impacted performance.  As a benefit to the quarter tax timing or one-time tax benefits lowered the effective tax rate to 7% on a GAAP basis, and 8% on an adjusted basis. That brought the effective tax rate for the full year to 17% on a GAAP basis and 18% on an adjusted basis. Company revenue in the quarter was up 6% to a fourth quarter record $965 million. GAAP operating income was $98 million compared to a $139 million in the prior year quarter. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $2.27 compared to $2.91 in the prior year quarter.  Total segment profit for the fourth quarter was a $102 million compared to a $139 million in the prior-year quarter and total segment margin was 10.6% compared to 15.2% in the fourth quarter a year ago. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $2.35 compared to $2.89 in the prior year quarter. Looking at our business segments for the fourth quarter, residential revenue was up 12% to a fourth quarter record $620 million.  And again, that's [Indiscernible] 6% fewer days, both replacement and new construction business were up double-digits. Residential segment profit was down 5%, and segment margin was down 310 basis points to 17.8% from the prior-year quarter. In commercial, the business continued to be hit the hardest by COVID-19, and global supply chain disruptions in fourth quarter. Revenue was down 11%, segment profit was down 64%, and segment margin was down 170 basis points to 7.7%.  Commercial equipment revenue was down mid-teens in the quarter. Within this replacement, revenue was down mid-teens with planned emergency - excuse me, planned replacement down low single-digits and emergency replacement down more than 40%. New construction revenue was down high-teens in the quarter. Breaking out revenue another way, regional and local business revenue was down mid-teens, national equipment revenue was down high-teens. On the service side, Lennox National Account Service revenue was up low single-digits again on 6% fewer days. While the commercial business continue to work through significant disruptions and constraints in the fourth-quarter, looking ahead, we expect revenue to resume year-over-year growth in the first quarter. And profitability to be up by mid-2022 and for the full year. In refrigeration for the fourth quarter revenue was up 6% as reported and up 8% at constant currency.  North America revenue is up more than 20%. Europe refrigeration revenue was down low-single digits as reported, up low-single digits at constant currency. In Europe, HVAC revenue was down mid-teens as reported, down low double-digits constant-currency. Refrigeration segment profit rose 50% and segment margin expanded a 190 basis points to 8.9%. For the company overall in 2022, we are reiterating guidance for revenue growth of 5% to 10%. We are raising guidance for GAAP and adjusted EPS from continued operations from a range of 13.40 to 14.40, to a new range of 13.50 to 14.50 for the full-year.  This reflects a net benefit of lower effective tax rate of 18% to 20%, and higher interest rate expense assumptions. We are reiterating plans for $400 million of stock repurchases in 2022. HVAC and Refrigeration market, demand remains high, and as COVID-19 and the global supply chain improve Lennox International is positioned to further capitalize on the growth opportunities and higher profitability. Now, I'll turn it over to Joe.\nJoseph Reitmeier: Thank you, Todd. And good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the fourth quarter and the year overall starting with Residential Heating & Cooling. In the fourth quarter revenue from Residential Heating & Cooling was a fourth quarter record $620 million up 12%. Volume was up 3%, price was up 8%, and mix was up 1%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Residential profit was $110 million down 5%. Segment margin was 17.8%, down 310 basis points.  Segment profit was primarily impacted by 6% fewer days than the prior year quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, higher material, freight and other product costs, and higher SG&A. Positive impacts included higher volume, favorable price, mix, foreign exchange and warranty and distribution efficiency programs. For the full-year, Residential segment revenue was a record $2.78 billion up 18%, volume was up 13%, price was up 4%, and mix was flat with foreign exchange being a 1% favorable benefit to revenue.  Residential profit was a record $540 million up 26%. Segment margin was 19.5% up 140 basis points. Now, turning to our Commercial Heating and Cooling business. In the fourth quarter, commercial revenue was $201 million down 11%. Volume was down 21%, price was up 2%, and mix was up 8%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Commercial segment profit was $16 million down 64%. Segment margin was 7.7% down 1170 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by 6% fewer days than the prior year quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, lower volume, higher material warranty, tariff, freight, and other product costs and higher SG&A.  Partial offsets included favorable price and mix. For the full year commercial revenue was $865 million up 8%. Volume was up 3%, price was up 1%, and mix was up 3%. Foreign exchange was 1% favorable benefit to revenue. Segment profit was $111 million down 19%, and segment margin was 12.8% down 430 basis points. In refrigeration, revenue was a fourth quarter record, $143 million up 6%. Volume was up 4%, price was up 1%, and mix was down 1%. Foreign exchange had a favorable 2% impact on revenue. Refrigeration segment profit was $13 million in the fourth quarter, which was up 29%.  Segment margin was 9.2% up 170 basis points. Segment profit was positively impacted by higher volume, favorable price and mix and lower SG&A. Partial offsets included 6% fewer days in the prior year quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions in higher material, freight, and other product costs. For the full year, Refrigeration revenue was $554 million, up 17%. Volume was up 13%, price was up 3%, and mix was flat.  Foreign exchange had a favorable 1% impact. Segment profit was $49 million up 50% and segment profit margin was 8.9% up 190 basis points. Regarding special items, the company had net after-tax charges of $3.2 million for the fourth quarter and $7.4 million for the full year. Corporate expenses were $37 million in the fourth quarter, and $96 million for the full year. Overall, SG&A was $152 million in the fourth quarter or 15.7% of revenue, the same as the prior quarter. For 2021, overall SG&A was $599 million or 14.3% of revenue, down from 15.3% in the prior year.  Our 2021 income tax rate declined year-over-year, attributable to geographic mix, year-end adjustments of taxes on export sales, and finalization and settlement of our prior-year tax obligations. For 2021, the company had cash from operations of $516 million, compared to $612 million in the prior year. As working capital increased, primarily due to sales growth, increasing accounts receivable, and inventory increasing due to mitigation strategies to combat supply chain disruptions, along with inflationary effects year-over-year on product costs.  Capital expenditures were $106 million for the full year compared to $77 million in the prior year. Free cash flow was $410 million for the year compared to $535 million in the prior year. In 2021, the company paid approximately $127 million in dividends and repurchased $600 million of company stock. Total debt was $1.24 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and we ended the year with a debt-to - EBITDA ratio of 1.8.  Cash and cash equivalents were $31 million at the end of the year. Now, before I turn it over to Q&A, I'll review our outlook for 2022. Our underlying market assumptions for the year remain the same. We expect the industry to see low single-digit shipment growth in residential, and mid-single-digit shipment growth in commercial, unitary, and refrigeration markets in North America. Our guidance for 2022, revenue growth remains 5% to 10% with neutral foreign exchange impact.  And we are raising our guidance for GAAP and adjusted EPS from continuing operations from a range of $13.40 to $14.40, to a new range of $13.50 to $14.50. This reflects the net of a lower expected effective tax rate of 18% to 20% compared to our prior guidance of approximately 20%, as well as higher interest and other expense approximately $40 million compared to prior guidance for $35 million.  Now, let me run you through some of the other key assumptions in our guidance and the puts and takes for 2022, all of which are unchanged. Pricing is expected to be a benefit of $235 million for the year, which is about a 5% yield. Factory productivity and production from our third Mexico plant is expected to be a $20 million benefit. We are guiding for residential mix to be neutral. Tariffs are also expected to be neutral, and we assume neutral foreign exchange impact. For the headwinds of -- in 2022, we still expect a $110 million headwind from commodities.  A headwind of $60 million from components have offset by $30 million of cost take outs for a net $30 million headwind. Freight is still expected to be a $5 million headwind. We will be at more -- at a more normal run-rate with distribution investments this year with 30 new Lennox stores planned. SG&A is expected to be up $45 million this year, including our investments in Research and Development and Information Technology.  A few other points. Corporate expenses are still targeted at $95 million, and we are planning capital expenditures to be approximately $125 million this year. Free cash flow is targeted at $400 million and finally, we expect the weighted average deluded share count for the full year, to be between 36 to 37 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase $400 million of stock this year. And with that, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen just a quick reminder. [Operator Instructions]. And first go to the line of Nicole Deblase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNicole Deblase: Yeah, thanks. Good morning.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning, Nicole.\nNicole Deblase: I guess maybe we could start with looking across 2022. It seems it might be a bit of an unusual year. Any update on your thoughts on the quarterly cadence and earnings and maybe just categorize it relative to the normal seasonality you would see in your business?\nTodd Bluedorn: The way we plan right now and way we expect it to be is, well, the last couple of years have been abnormal, while last two or three go all the way back to tornado. I think if you go back past pre - COVID pre -tornado, I think it's more of a normal cadence. Our best guess is that's how it's going to lay out, normal to prior years.\nNicole Deblase: Okay. Got it. Thanks, Todd. And I guess from a commodity perspective, saw that you guys maintained exactly what you said at the analyst day last month. Commodity cost have continued to tail off a little bit. Is that a potential source of upside if that trend continues or is the advanced purchases hedging you guys do, does that make that difficult for 2022?\nTodd Bluedorn: No. If commodities go down, especially steel, which is our largest, and we don't hedge it, it will certainly be a benefit. I mean, we're not changing that because it wiggles one way or another. And we take guesses on what the balance of the year is based on what futures are predicted to be. Short answer is, if commodities goes down, that's good news.\nNicole Deblase: Got it. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much. Good morning. Maybe Todd, starting out with your views around volume growth in residential over the year, any commentary on how the year has started out for your resi volumes and any kind of major cadence as we go through the year, I think relative to your low to mid-single-digit volume growth that resi does in the guide?\nTodd Bluedorn: The short answer is we're starting out strong. I mean, we got lots of \u201corders and backlog\u201d, although that's tough in this business. But given supply constraints, we have lots of people telling us they need things. The orders remained strong but as you well know, it's tough to predict much from January. I think the short answer is consumer seems strong, still buying, we get to a warm summer I think it's going to be another record year.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much. And then in commercial maybe a couple of things. One is just any finer points on the confidence on that profit expansion by mid-year, other than easy comps on profitability. And then how do you see that backlog in commercial playing out? I think in a lot of industrial facing, and commercial businesses backlogs may be peaking right now, and then start to bleed down a bit. Do you see that as likely to happen this year?\nTodd Bluedorn: I don't think so. Again, I get the years confused, but in 2020, the industry was down 20% and so the HVAC discretionary spending went way down. It's come back partway this year and I expect it to continue to grow in 2022 and we certainly have record backlog again, driven by supply constraints -- production constraints. But everything we can see, it still feels very strong and [we\u2019re charged](ph) when we talk to our large national accounts. Obviously [Indiscernible] fourth-quarter [Indiscernible] year on the margins.  There's a couple of reasons for that. One is we have one factory, it is in Stuttgart, Arkansas been very hard hit by COVID. There were days in fourth quarter where over 25% over quarter the hourly workers didn't come in because of COVID. Either they had it or they were close contacts. Similar impact we had with Omicron in January. I think the good news is that's starting. It's like the python swallowing the rat.  I think it's now going through the system. We're on the downside. Also, been hit by supply chain issues; harder there than anywhere else and I think we worked through those. We have a strong production team there. I think we're focused on the right things. So then you're right. I mean, I got a lower baseline to come from. I feel pretty confident we will be back year-over-year growth and profitability by mid-year.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: Hi, good morning everyone.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hi Jeff.\nJeff Hammond: Hi, maybe just update us on, your inventory levels. What you think channel inventories look like? I know these seasonal weaker periods you've been trying to catch up.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yeah. We're still low on inventory both in residential and specifically in commercial. That's why you saw emergency replacement down 40%, our ability to have the inventory on the ground. So we're focused on driving it up. People who look at the detailed charts will see our inventory levels are up year-over-year for fourth quarter but that's driven by a couple things. That's driven by the increased cost of components and labor so the inflationary pressures and also we have a lot of WIP in raw material.  So we're pulling together material and we'll miss a piece or a part and we won't be able to finish the unit and so some of that's go in there. Then I think the distributor channel through our Allied business I still think that's relatively lean, so I don't think we've peaked out in any way. I think there - in our sell in to competitors, Carrier and Trane I don't -- I think their distribution is the same way. I don't think Watsco has too much inventory yet. I think people are still buying.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. And then just on supply chain, can you talk about where you think you're starting to see some stabilization or relief, versus maybe whereas things are still very problematic?\nTodd Bluedorn: It's a continuing changing picture, if you will. I -- back in December when we spoke, I was confident and remain confident. But Omicron, I think -- I don't think I know had an impact. Backed everybody up a bit. And specifically in our factories, Omicron hit hard in January. We still feel confident for the quarter, but had an impact in January. The supply chain is healing. Although I would tell you there's still a card or two on Omicron that has to be turned over on the impact that's had on the supply chain.  We're having fewer issues on the things. We had big issues with controls, steel, aluminum packaging, sort of all those things, I think are in the rearview mirror. We have a great team focused on this. We're doing all the things you'd expect us to do, and I talked about were in supplier's locations. We're investing in inventory. We're spending millions of dollars air-freighting in components from Asia, and make sure we have safety stock.  We're doing all the right things. I just think every time I wanted a clear victory -- excuse me, COVID takes a slightly different direction or a large direction. I think Omicron is the last piece. I think that's now behind us in our factories. I think it's broadly behind our supply base, and I think we heal quickly because again what our factories have seen with Omicron [Indiscernible] went up like a rocket, coming down like a rocket. But you tell me what COVID is going to do then I'll be certain what [Indiscernible] going to do.\nJeff Hammond: Okay, appreciate the color, Todd. Thanks.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: Hey, good morning. Thanks. So first question, Todd, it looks like production was right down the middle in 4Q. Any change to the outlook for production in the first half either way?\nTodd Bluedorn: I'm not sure I understand the question.\nRyan Merkel: Production rates, meaning factory productivity, any change to how you're thinking about that for first half?\nTodd Bluedorn: Our guide's to guide, I mean -- and again, it's as you know multi-variable equation we hope to do better. And they will see.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Okay. And then what are the key focus points and opportunities you are looking at over the next couple of quarters. I assume supply chain and solving that's number one, but what else is there?\nTodd Bluedorn: Supply chain, price, drive productivity in our factories as we stabilize to production and inventory rates. And then the third is our strategic investments, whether it's a product and we have some great new product coming out over the next 18 months. Digitization, which you know a lot about, and then continue to build out our distribution, our store strategy in North America. So, first our team is laser-focused on keeping the product flowing, or improving production, driving productivity, getting price, and continue to focus on strategic investments.\nRyan Merkel: Perfect. Thanks.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question is from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Morning and thanks for taking my questions.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, Tom.\nTommy Moll: Todd, I wanted to focus on labor and wages today. What context can you give us on the level of wage inflation you're seeing here in the U.S., versus maybe in Mexico as well, and the level of difficulty in hiring new employees at this point? What update could you give us there?\nTodd Bluedorn: We've been fighting that battle for a year-and-a-half, maybe for two years. And, we've raised wages in our factories pretty significantly, 10% -15% depending on the factory, some even more. We pay premiums to get people to work second and third shift on our factories, both in Mexico and North America. I think it's all pre -stabilized at this point. I think the one factory that we've had the most issues with, but I think we're now focused on the right levers is the one that's been hit hardest in the margins, which is our [Indiscernible] our Arkansas factory, that may be the most rural of our factories.  Just hard to get to employees, but I think we've balanced away traits to get that and that's obviously all in the guide. And again, as you know, our cost of goods sold is less than 10% direct labor. So we have some flexibility to pay what we need to do to get people in.\nTommy Moll: Thanks. That's helpful Todd. Just to follow up on your stores roll out this year, I think you said 30 earlier. Can you give us any sense of the timing across the quarters and what, if any revenue benefit from those new locations is embedded in your guidance?\nTodd Bluedorn: I don't think much revenue. I think mathematically, mechanically, people back or something. I think it's more of the stores we opened this year start to kick in and -- or excuse me, in 2021 kick in and have some revenue and back, we typically are back and loaded on stores just because we start to freeze things up in March as we prepare for the summer selling season and we don't want to distract the Salesforce. And so I don't have the list in front of me, but historically it's been 2/3 or so second half of the year and my guess is that's what it will be this year.\nTommy Moll: Appreciate it. I'll turn it back.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Todd, I got to ask the where are we on the CEO search, if you can say anything?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yeah, it's the same placeholder answer that may be given since it began. And it will be -- it's the -- independent directors have -- are engaged in the search, and when they have somebody as my replacement, we'll announce it. And Adam Schefter may say something different, but when we have somebody we'll announce. That's for the football fans out there.\nGautam Khanna: Yes, just confirmed the returns everything. Brady just announced it.\nTodd Bluedorn: He announced it. Well, I have no announcement.\nGautam Khanna: Just related to the Commercial business, can you update us on your views on IAQ and what the pace of inquiry is been around that? And do you have any view that's changed on what the average ticket size can be in the commercial space in the resi space relatively to the cost of the system? Thanks.\nTodd Bluedorn: Now, I'll answer the second part of the question first. Our point of view, or my point-of-view personally hasn't changed. I think it's an important product offering to have. I think it's important to talk to your customers about. I think when you sell it, it can improve to ticket by 10%, 15%, 20%. But it's not every application. I think as we get through the pandemic and it becomes an epidemic or whatever the right phrase is.  I think some of the focus on this start to pass. I think it's important that we have it. Now I'll be honest with you, over the last quarter or two. We are so focused on taking care of core customer requirements given the production issues. We talked about IAQ or selling it. But I would tell you the sales force is spending a lot of time just taking care of base requirement.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Nigel Coe, with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Oh, hi. Good morning. Thanks, Todd. So just going back to Nicole's question on normal seasonality, quote-unquote normal. You mentioned obviously pre -COVID tornado Scanning the numbers suggest 10% or below. Is that what you're thinking towards in terms of normal seasonality? Second part of my question really is, any expectations we should have around 1Q margins, the recovery, the sequential ramp from 4Q. Would you expect 4Q to be sort of fairly normal, since is 1Q? If that question makes any sense, was wondering a situation about margins and that seasonality for 1Q specifically.\nTodd Bluedorn: I understand the specific question. I'm not going to get to tightened into answer because I don't want to get into habit of giving quarterly guidance. I think if I was [Indiscernible] a model, I would normalize it based on our track record pre - COVID, pre tornado. That's roughly what it's going to be. I think Q4 may have some strength compared to prior Q4s, if there's any prebuy. But right now I don't -- my best guess is there won't be much of one. Q1 demand strong, but were supply constrained, and so I don't -- I think that will hinder what we can do in Q1 and some will [Indiscernible] into Q2. I think it's always with us. It's going to be a second and third quarter game.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And then just my follow-on is around the mix neutral and Residential for FY2022, I think we had some mix down during 2021 so I thought we might get some relief on that especially the semi. The semi supply is getting better so just as curious to know what's driving that assumption for neutral mix. And I'm just wondering the pre -buy effect into that.\nTodd Bluedorn: No, I don't think it pre -buys factors in a major way, because I just said we're not counting much on that. I think maybe there's some conservatism in that number. I mean, we just got to get our -- as you know, our -- at least what I've spoken about our Mexico factories performed the best for us. And that's where we tend to have more the entry-level product. We've turned on some of our mid-tier and high-tier product that we hadn't allowed certain dealers to buy, that's now turned on. If we continue to ramp up in our Marshalltown factory, then maybe we have some positive news on mix.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thanks Todd.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wondering if we could touch on price a little bit more. Todd, looks like on the exit rate on resi, you're going to be in the ballpark of what you're anticipating for the year on. I just wonder how much incremental price relative to your exit rate, do you actually need to get in the market to hit that? What is it? $235 million or so for the year?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think what happens is you lap part of that. So part of the price that we got in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year comp goes away as we go into 2022, because it was the price increase that we announced in -- early in first quarter of 2021. So the answer is we still got to go stick price and we've announced it and we're confident we're sticking it. If again the numbers were giving your fourth quarter numbers, first quarter we're confident that we're going to get the price that we need as you suggested. We had 8% or so in fourth quarter in resi and that's an order of magnitude the number for next -- for 2022. Full year we need to get six. I think Joe said 5%, that's 6% on my notes so it's probably 5.5 price in 2022, and we're confident we're going to able to do that.\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yeah. It is 5 1/2, Todd.\nTodd Bluedorn: Okay. Great.\nJeff Sprague: Okay. Good then. And just one more peculiarity and maybe I heard it wrong, but it looks like refrigeration got less price in the quarter, and then in the year, is that correct? Everything else seem to be building over the course of the year.\nTodd Bluedorn: I mean, not on that one.\nJeff Sprague: I think Joseph can answer that one. Joseph price up one, I think for the quarter and up three for the year. Maybe I wrote that down wrong.\nTodd Bluedorn: And what's yours question about that?\nJeff Sprague: I just want to confirm that's correct?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes.\nJeff Sprague: It is. Okay.\nTodd Bluedorn: Joe, you know that?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yeah.\nTodd Bluedorn: What I have in my notes is, for the year, we got about 5% pricing. In 2022, we need to get 5% price in Refrigeration. And we're confident we're going to able to do that. But I think they're confirming the numbers, $1 million in fourth quarter, $3 for the year.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Next will go to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Guys, can you help me maybe parse out the margin headwinds in 4Q and resi, given you did exit with eight points of price? Just trying to understand what you felt the impact in. And then, should we be anticipating a similar impact in 1Q in the resi business?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think one thing to think about is on a year over year basis, we had 6% fewer days. That was worth order of magnitude 10 million of EBITDA. And then the other impact in [Indiscernible] was the COVID impact. And I think that will be less in first quarter than it was in fourth quarter. And that was order of magnitude another 10 million. So there's sort of 20 million of headwind between COVID and 6% fewer days on a year-over-year basis that -- that don't impact first-quarter.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess maybe just kind of thinking through the commercial business, and getting back to like pre COVID margin in that business. It's the expectation for 2022, we don't quite get there, but you'll see meaningful improvement in the second half, maybe we start to see those kind of rates in 2-H?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think that's right. I don't think we get back to where we were pre -COVID, and Commercial and one year, I think will take a couple of years and that is acceptable, be mid-year when we start the improvement. But again, I think all the pieces are there we got the product, we have customer demand, we just got to get the factory Hammond.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it, helpful. Thank you.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Our final question will be from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [Brandy] (ph) for Josh. How are you?\nTodd Bluedorn: Good. How are you?\nUnidentified Analyst: Question on commercial market share. I know the timing of business differences make it a little hard to compare to this, but do you have a sense for how your Commercial businesses did in 2021 versus your comparable light unitary markets?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think we lost share. I don't think there's any doubt about that. [Indiscernible] I [Indiscernible] the numbers. I don't give the exact numbers, but we lost share. I don't -- it's less than a point of share because share moves slowly in commercial. But we lost share. And I think in our residential businesses, we are flat to slightly up but the production issue is in commercial artists.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, that's helpful. And then on resi mix up 1%, do you have an idea of what mix was within replacement, and how 2021 mix within replacement compares to a typical year?\nTodd Bluedorn: No, I don't have that in front of me. I'll have Steve dig that up and get back. I think the answer is for that -- but I have in the math in front of me is we didn't have the normal mix up in replacement, that we typically would because we were able to produce more products in our Mexico facility, which is more entry level. And so we steered customers to more entry-level product and we typically would. And so I think on a full year basis, replacement mix was probably flat to slightly down.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thank you.\nOperator: I'll turn it back here. Go ahead if any closing comments.\nTodd Bluedorn: Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us to wrap up and challenging conditions Lennox International team is executing well, capitalize on market opportunities, and we look forward to a year of strong growth and profitability in 2022. Thanks everyone again for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Todd. And good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the fourth quarter and the year overall starting with Residential Heating & Cooling. In the fourth quarter revenue from Residential Heating & Cooling was a fourth quarter record $620 million up 12%. Volume was up 3%, price was up 8%, and mix was up 1%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Residential profit was $110 million down 5%. Segment margin was 17.8%, down 310 basis points.  Segment profit was primarily impacted by 6% fewer days than the prior year quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, higher material, freight and other product costs, and higher SG&A. Positive impacts included higher volume, favorable price, mix, foreign exchange and warranty and distribution efficiency programs. For the full-year, Residential segment revenue was a record $2.78 billion up 18%, volume was up 13%, price was up 4%, and mix was flat with foreign exchange being a 1% favorable benefit to revenue.  Residential profit was a record $540 million up 26%. Segment margin was 19.5% up 140 basis points. Now, turning to our Commercial Heating and Cooling business. In the fourth quarter, commercial revenue was $201 million down 11%. Volume was down 21%, price was up 2%, and mix was up 8%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Commercial segment profit was $16 million down 64%. Segment margin was 7.7% down 1170 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by 6% fewer days than the prior year quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, lower volume, higher material warranty, tariff, freight, and other product costs and higher SG&A.  Partial offsets included favorable price and mix. For the full year commercial revenue was $865 million up 8%. Volume was up 3%, price was up 1%, and mix was up 3%. Foreign exchange was 1% favorable benefit to revenue. Segment profit was $111 million down 19%, and segment margin was 12.8% down 430 basis points. In refrigeration, revenue was a fourth quarter record, $143 million up 6%. Volume was up 4%, price was up 1%, and mix was down 1%. Foreign exchange had a favorable 2% impact on revenue. Refrigeration segment profit was $13 million in the fourth quarter, which was up 29%.  Segment margin was 9.2% up 170 basis points. Segment profit was positively impacted by higher volume, favorable price and mix and lower SG&A. Partial offsets included 6% fewer days in the prior year quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions in higher material, freight, and other product costs. For the full year, Refrigeration revenue was $554 million, up 17%. Volume was up 13%, price was up 3%, and mix was flat.  Foreign exchange had a favorable 1% impact. Segment profit was $49 million up 50% and segment profit margin was 8.9% up 190 basis points. Regarding special items, the company had net after-tax charges of $3.2 million for the fourth quarter and $7.4 million for the full year. Corporate expenses were $37 million in the fourth quarter, and $96 million for the full year. Overall, SG&A was $152 million in the fourth quarter or 15.7% of revenue, the same as the prior quarter. For 2021, overall SG&A was $599 million or 14.3% of revenue, down from 15.3% in the prior year.  Our 2021 income tax rate declined year-over-year, attributable to geographic mix, year-end adjustments of taxes on export sales, and finalization and settlement of our prior-year tax obligations. For 2021, the company had cash from operations of $516 million, compared to $612 million in the prior year. As working capital increased, primarily due to sales growth, increasing accounts receivable, and inventory increasing due to mitigation strategies to combat supply chain disruptions, along with inflationary effects year-over-year on product costs.  Capital expenditures were $106 million for the full year compared to $77 million in the prior year. Free cash flow was $410 million for the year compared to $535 million in the prior year. In 2021, the company paid approximately $127 million in dividends and repurchased $600 million of company stock. Total debt was $1.24 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and we ended the year with a debt-to - EBITDA ratio of 1.8.  Cash and cash equivalents were $31 million at the end of the year. Now, before I turn it over to Q&A, I'll review our outlook for 2022. Our underlying market assumptions for the year remain the same. We expect the industry to see low single-digit shipment growth in residential, and mid-single-digit shipment growth in commercial, unitary, and refrigeration markets in North America. Our guidance for 2022, revenue growth remains 5% to 10% with neutral foreign exchange impact.  And we are raising our guidance for GAAP and adjusted EPS from continuing operations from a range of $13.40 to $14.40, to a new range of $13.50 to $14.50. This reflects the net of a lower expected effective tax rate of 18% to 20% compared to our prior guidance of approximately 20%, as well as higher interest and other expense approximately $40 million compared to prior guidance for $35 million.  Now, let me run you through some of the other key assumptions in our guidance and the puts and takes for 2022, all of which are unchanged. Pricing is expected to be a benefit of $235 million for the year, which is about a 5% yield. Factory productivity and production from our third Mexico plant is expected to be a $20 million benefit. We are guiding for residential mix to be neutral. Tariffs are also expected to be neutral, and we assume neutral foreign exchange impact. For the headwinds of -- in 2022, we still expect a $110 million headwind from commodities.  A headwind of $60 million from components have offset by $30 million of cost take outs for a net $30 million headwind. Freight is still expected to be a $5 million headwind. We will be at more -- at a more normal run-rate with distribution investments this year with 30 new Lennox stores planned. SG&A is expected to be up $45 million this year, including our investments in Research and Development and Information Technology.  A few other points. Corporate expenses are still targeted at $95 million, and we are planning capital expenditures to be approximately $125 million this year. Free cash flow is targeted at $400 million and finally, we expect the weighted average deluded share count for the full year, to be between 36 to 37 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase $400 million of stock this year. And with that, let's go to Q&A. Yeah. It is 5 1/2, Todd. Yeah."

            "name": "Todd Bluedorn",
            "content": "Thanks Steve. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. Let me start with the financial highlights for 2021 overall, and then walk through the fourth quarter as the company closed out a year of record revenue and earnings per share. Overall for 2021, revenue rose to 15% to a record $4.2 billion, at constant-currency revenue was up 14%. GAAP operating income rose 23% to $590 million. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rose 34% to a record $12.39.  Total segment profit for the full year rose 19% to $604 million. And the total segment margin expanded 50 basis points to 14.4%. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations rose to 27% to a record $12.60. Turning to fourth quarter financial results were impacted by 6% fewer days in the prior year quarter. As well as the continued impact from COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions that significantly impacted performance.  As a benefit to the quarter tax timing or one-time tax benefits lowered the effective tax rate to 7% on a GAAP basis, and 8% on an adjusted basis. That brought the effective tax rate for the full year to 17% on a GAAP basis and 18% on an adjusted basis. Company revenue in the quarter was up 6% to a fourth quarter record $965 million. GAAP operating income was $98 million compared to a $139 million in the prior year quarter. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $2.27 compared to $2.91 in the prior year quarter.  Total segment profit for the fourth quarter was a $102 million compared to a $139 million in the prior-year quarter and total segment margin was 10.6% compared to 15.2% in the fourth quarter a year ago. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $2.35 compared to $2.89 in the prior year quarter. Looking at our business segments for the fourth quarter, residential revenue was up 12% to a fourth quarter record $620 million.  And again, that's [Indiscernible] 6% fewer days, both replacement and new construction business were up double-digits. Residential segment profit was down 5%, and segment margin was down 310 basis points to 17.8% from the prior-year quarter. In commercial, the business continued to be hit the hardest by COVID-19, and global supply chain disruptions in fourth quarter. Revenue was down 11%, segment profit was down 64%, and segment margin was down 170 basis points to 7.7%.  Commercial equipment revenue was down mid-teens in the quarter. Within this replacement, revenue was down mid-teens with planned emergency - excuse me, planned replacement down low single-digits and emergency replacement down more than 40%. New construction revenue was down high-teens in the quarter. Breaking out revenue another way, regional and local business revenue was down mid-teens, national equipment revenue was down high-teens. On the service side, Lennox National Account Service revenue was up low single-digits again on 6% fewer days. While the commercial business continue to work through significant disruptions and constraints in the fourth-quarter, looking ahead, we expect revenue to resume year-over-year growth in the first quarter. And profitability to be up by mid-2022 and for the full year. In refrigeration for the fourth quarter revenue was up 6% as reported and up 8% at constant currency.  North America revenue is up more than 20%. Europe refrigeration revenue was down low-single digits as reported, up low-single digits at constant currency. In Europe, HVAC revenue was down mid-teens as reported, down low double-digits constant-currency. Refrigeration segment profit rose 50% and segment margin expanded a 190 basis points to 8.9%. For the company overall in 2022, we are reiterating guidance for revenue growth of 5% to 10%. We are raising guidance for GAAP and adjusted EPS from continued operations from a range of 13.40 to 14.40, to a new range of 13.50 to 14.50 for the full-year.  This reflects a net benefit of lower effective tax rate of 18% to 20%, and higher interest rate expense assumptions. We are reiterating plans for $400 million of stock repurchases in 2022. HVAC and Refrigeration market, demand remains high, and as COVID-19 and the global supply chain improve Lennox International is positioned to further capitalize on the growth opportunities and higher profitability. Now, I'll turn it over to Joe. Good morning, Nicole. The way we plan right now and way we expect it to be is, well, the last couple of years have been abnormal, while last two or three go all the way back to tornado. I think if you go back past pre - COVID pre -tornado, I think it's more of a normal cadence. Our best guess is that's how it's going to lay out, normal to prior years. No. If commodities go down, especially steel, which is our largest, and we don't hedge it, it will certainly be a benefit. I mean, we're not changing that because it wiggles one way or another. And we take guesses on what the balance of the year is based on what futures are predicted to be. Short answer is, if commodities goes down, that's good news. Thanks. The short answer is we're starting out strong. I mean, we got lots of \u201corders and backlog\u201d, although that's tough in this business. But given supply constraints, we have lots of people telling us they need things. The orders remained strong but as you well know, it's tough to predict much from January. I think the short answer is consumer seems strong, still buying, we get to a warm summer I think it's going to be another record year. I don't think so. Again, I get the years confused, but in 2020, the industry was down 20% and so the HVAC discretionary spending went way down. It's come back partway this year and I expect it to continue to grow in 2022 and we certainly have record backlog again, driven by supply constraints -- production constraints. But everything we can see, it still feels very strong and [we're charged](ph) when we talk to our large national accounts. Obviously [Indiscernible] fourth-quarter [Indiscernible] year on the margins.  There's a couple of reasons for that. One is we have one factory, it is in Stuttgart, Arkansas been very hard hit by COVID. There were days in fourth quarter where over 25% over quarter the hourly workers didn't come in because of COVID. Either they had it or they were close contacts. Similar impact we had with Omicron in January. I think the good news is that's starting. It's like the python swallowing the rat.  I think it's now going through the system. We're on the downside. Also, been hit by supply chain issues; harder there than anywhere else and I think we worked through those. We have a strong production team there. I think we're focused on the right things. So then you're right. I mean, I got a lower baseline to come from. I feel pretty confident we will be back year-over-year growth and profitability by mid-year. Hi Jeff. Yeah. We're still low on inventory both in residential and specifically in commercial. That's why you saw emergency replacement down 40%, our ability to have the inventory on the ground. So we're focused on driving it up. People who look at the detailed charts will see our inventory levels are up year-over-year for fourth quarter but that's driven by a couple things. That's driven by the increased cost of components and labor so the inflationary pressures and also we have a lot of WIP in raw material.  So we're pulling together material and we'll miss a piece or a part and we won't be able to finish the unit and so some of that's go in there. Then I think the distributor channel through our Allied business I still think that's relatively lean, so I don't think we've peaked out in any way. I think there - in our sell in to competitors, Carrier and Trane I don't -- I think their distribution is the same way. I don't think Watsco has too much inventory yet. I think people are still buying. It's a continuing changing picture, if you will. I -- back in December when we spoke, I was confident and remain confident. But Omicron, I think -- I don't think I know had an impact. Backed everybody up a bit. And specifically in our factories, Omicron hit hard in January. We still feel confident for the quarter, but had an impact in January. The supply chain is healing. Although I would tell you there's still a card or two on Omicron that has to be turned over on the impact that's had on the supply chain.  We're having fewer issues on the things. We had big issues with controls, steel, aluminum packaging, sort of all those things, I think are in the rearview mirror. We have a great team focused on this. We're doing all the things you'd expect us to do, and I talked about were in supplier's locations. We're investing in inventory. We're spending millions of dollars air-freighting in components from Asia, and make sure we have safety stock.  We're doing all the right things. I just think every time I wanted a clear victory -- excuse me, COVID takes a slightly different direction or a large direction. I think Omicron is the last piece. I think that's now behind us in our factories. I think it's broadly behind our supply base, and I think we heal quickly because again what our factories have seen with Omicron [Indiscernible] went up like a rocket, coming down like a rocket. But you tell me what COVID is going to do then I'll be certain what [Indiscernible] going to do. Thanks I'm not sure I understand the question. Our guide's to guide, I mean -- and again, it's as you know multi-variable equation we hope to do better. And they will see. Supply chain, price, drive productivity in our factories as we stabilize to production and inventory rates. And then the third is our strategic investments, whether it's a product and we have some great new product coming out over the next 18 months. Digitization, which you know a lot about, and then continue to build out our distribution, our store strategy in North America. So, first our team is laser-focused on keeping the product flowing, or improving production, driving productivity, getting price, and continue to focus on strategic investments. Thanks. Hey, Tom. We've been fighting that battle for a year-and-a-half, maybe for two years. And, we've raised wages in our factories pretty significantly, 10% -15% depending on the factory, some even more. We pay premiums to get people to work second and third shift on our factories, both in Mexico and North America. I think it's all pre -stabilized at this point. I think the one factory that we've had the most issues with, but I think we're now focused on the right levers is the one that's been hit hardest in the margins, which is our [Indiscernible] our Arkansas factory, that may be the most rural of our factories.  Just hard to get to employees, but I think we've balanced away traits to get that and that's obviously all in the guide. And again, as you know, our cost of goods sold is less than 10% direct labor. So we have some flexibility to pay what we need to do to get people in. I don't think much revenue. I think mathematically, mechanically, people back or something. I think it's more of the stores we opened this year start to kick in and -- or excuse me, in 2021 kick in and have some revenue and back, we typically are back and loaded on stores just because we start to freeze things up in March as we prepare for the summer selling season and we don't want to distract the Salesforce. And so I don't have the list in front of me, but historically it's been 2/3 or so second half of the year and my guess is that's what it will be this year. Thanks. Yeah, it's the same placeholder answer that may be given since it began. And it will be -- it's the -- independent directors have -- are engaged in the search, and when they have somebody as my replacement, we'll announce it. And Adam Schefter may say something different, but when we have somebody we'll announce. That's for the football fans out there. He announced it. Well, I have no announcement. Now, I'll answer the second part of the question first. Our point of view, or my point-of-view personally hasn't changed. I think it's an important product offering to have. I think it's important to talk to your customers about. I think when you sell it, it can improve to ticket by 10%, 15%, 20%. But it's not every application. I think as we get through the pandemic and it becomes an epidemic or whatever the right phrase is.  I think some of the focus on this start to pass. I think it's important that we have it. Now I'll be honest with you, over the last quarter or two. We are so focused on taking care of core customer requirements given the production issues. We talked about IAQ or selling it. But I would tell you the sales force is spending a lot of time just taking care of base requirement. Thanks. I understand the specific question. I'm not going to get to tightened into answer because I don't want to get into habit of giving quarterly guidance. I think if I was [Indiscernible] a model, I would normalize it based on our track record pre - COVID, pre tornado. That's roughly what it's going to be. I think Q4 may have some strength compared to prior Q4s, if there's any prebuy. But right now I don't -- my best guess is there won't be much of one. Q1 demand strong, but were supply constrained, and so I don't -- I think that will hinder what we can do in Q1 and some will [Indiscernible] into Q2. I think it's always with us. It's going to be a second and third quarter game. No, I don't think it pre -buys factors in a major way, because I just said we're not counting much on that. I think maybe there's some conservatism in that number. I mean, we just got to get our -- as you know, our -- at least what I've spoken about our Mexico factories performed the best for us. And that's where we tend to have more the entry-level product. We've turned on some of our mid-tier and high-tier product that we hadn't allowed certain dealers to buy, that's now turned on. If we continue to ramp up in our Marshalltown factory, then maybe we have some positive news on mix. Thanks. I think what happens is you lap part of that. So part of the price that we got in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year comp goes away as we go into 2022, because it was the price increase that we announced in -- early in first quarter of 2021. So the answer is we still got to go stick price and we've announced it and we're confident we're sticking it. If again the numbers were giving your fourth quarter numbers, first quarter we're confident that we're going to get the price that we need as you suggested. We had 8% or so in fourth quarter in resi and that's an order of magnitude the number for next -- for 2022. Full year we need to get six. I think Joe said 5%, that's 6% on my notes so it's probably 5.5 price in 2022, and we're confident we're going to able to do that. Okay. Great. I mean, not on that one. And what's yours question about that? Yes. Joe, you know that? What I have in my notes is, for the year, we got about 5% pricing. In 2022, we need to get 5% price in Refrigeration. And we're confident we're going to able to do that. But I think they're confirming the numbers, $1 million in fourth quarter, $3 for the year. Hey Joe. I think one thing to think about is on a year over year basis, we had 6% fewer days. That was worth order of magnitude 10 million of EBITDA. And then the other impact in [Indiscernible] was the COVID impact. And I think that will be less in first quarter than it was in fourth quarter. And that was order of magnitude another 10 million. So there's sort of 20 million of headwind between COVID and 6% fewer days on a year-over-year basis that -- that don't impact first-quarter. I think that's right. I don't think we get back to where we were pre -COVID, and Commercial and one year, I think will take a couple of years and that is acceptable, be mid-year when we start the improvement. But again, I think all the pieces are there we got the product, we have customer demand, we just got to get the factory Hammond. Thanks. Good. How are you? I think we lost share. I don't think there's any doubt about that. [Indiscernible] I [Indiscernible] the numbers. I don't give the exact numbers, but we lost share. I don't -- it's less than a point of share because share moves slowly in commercial. But we lost share. And I think in our residential businesses, we are flat to slightly up but the production issue is in commercial artists. No, I don't have that in front of me. I'll have Steve dig that up and get back. I think the answer is for that -- but I have in the math in front of me is we didn't have the normal mix up in replacement, that we typically would because we were able to produce more products in our Mexico facility, which is more entry level. And so we steered customers to more entry-level product and we typically would. And so I think on a full year basis, replacement mix was probably flat to slightly down. Thank you. Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us to wrap up and challenging conditions Lennox International team is executing well, capitalize on market opportunities, and we look forward to a year of strong growth and profitability in 2022. Thanks everyone again for joining us."

Now, let me turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Todd Bluedorn.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Strong demand continued in the third quarter across all our businesses but global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions to production and labor availability negatively impacted our financial results, approximately a $75 million impact to revenue and $75 million to operating profit in the quarter. Company revenue was up slightly to a third quarter record of $1.06 billion, with the benefit of strong price in the shipment-constrained environment. GAAP operating income was down 3%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was relatively flat at $3.41 compared to $3.42 in the prior year quarter. Total segment profit was down 7% and total segment margin was down 120 basis points to 15.5%. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was down 4% to $3.40, including approximately $0.55 of negative impact from the global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions. Looking at business segment highlights for the third quarter. Residential revenue was down 2% and segment profit was down 6%. Segment margin was down 90 basis points to 20.3%. Residential revenue from replacement business is down mid-single digits. Revenue from new construction was up low-double digits. Lennox brand revenue was down low-single digits, and revenue from Allied and our other brands were up low-single digits. Market demand remains high entering the fourth quarter, and we remain bullish on the residential market as we look ahead to 2022 in the coming years. More people continue to work from home and run our HVAC systems than before the pandemic. With global warming, the hotter weather we are seeing has an exponential impact on reducing the life of cooling systems. And there are more complete HVAC system sales taking place with old R-22 refrigerant systems in replacement window. This is driven by the EPA ban on the sale and distribution of equipment using R-22 refrigerant effective January 1, 2010, and the ban of the production or import of R-22 refrigerant effective January 1, 2020. While R-22 refrigerant is still available in the market, it's significantly more expensive than 410A. In many cases, it's cheaper to replace with a new 410A system, which is also more efficient and comes with a new warranty than to repair the old R-22 system. From 2005 to 2010, 60% of air conditioners and heat pumps sold were R-22. The need to replace these has a meaningful benefit to residential growth. We expect these dynamics to lead to strong residential market conditions for the years ahead. In addition, Lennox and Allied will be running a proven playbook for market share gains. Moving to our Commercial business; third quarter revenue was up 2%. Commercial profit was down 42%. The segment margin declined 800 basis points to 10.7%. On top of supply chain shortages and bottlenecks disrupting production, our Arkansas factory was hit the hardest by COVID-19 in the quarter and labor availability was a significant issue. At constant currency, commercial equipment revenue was down low-single digits in the quarter. Within this, replacement revenue was up low-single digits with planned replacement up more than 20%, and emergency replacement down more than 30%. New construction revenue was down mid-single digits. Breaking out revenue another way, regional and local business revenue was down high-single digits. National account equipment revenue was up high-single digits. The team won two national account equipment customers in the third quarter to total 11 year-to-date. On the service side, Lennox National Account Service revenue was up mid-teens. VRF revenue was up more than 30%. In Refrigeration for the third quarter, revenue was up 10%. North America revenue was up more than 20%. Europe Refrigeration revenue was relatively flat, and Europe HVAC revenue was down mid-single digits. Refrigeration segment profit was up 12% as margin expanded 20 basis points to 10.6%. Looking ahead for both our Refrigeration and Commercial businesses, demand remained strong. Backlog is up approximately 60% for Refrigeration and 90% for Commercial, and order rates continue to be strong. Demand is clearly not an issue. But as we look at the fourth quarter, we continue to expect a material impact to production from supply chain shortages and bottlenecks. We currently expect a similar negative financial impact to our business as we saw in the third quarter, approximately $75 million of revenue and $25 million of operating profit. We continue to see broad inflationary pressures, including for commodities and components but we have enacted three rounds of price increases this year. The latest one was just on September 1 with a focus on staying ahead of inflation. The company yielded 4% price overall in the third quarter, including 5% in Residential. In addition to the carryover benefit next year from our June and September price increases, we're announcing additional price increases heading into 2022. Our Refrigeration business has announced a price increase of 8% in North America effective for December 1. Likewise, our European business has recently announced another round of increases generally from 5% to 10% to drive price in 2022. Our Commercial business has announced a price increase of up to 13% effective January 1, and our Residential business will be announcing another round of price increases in November to be effective heading into 2022. For 2021, we are narrowing our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. We are narrowing 2021 guidance for revenue from 12% to 16% to a new range of 13% to 15%. Foreign exchange is still expected to be a 1% favorable to revenue. We are narrowing 2021 guidance for adjusted EPS from continuing operations from $12.10 to $12.70 to a new range of $12.10 to $12.30. Our free cash flow guidance remains $400 million for the year. As the company continues to battle through the disruptions to production from the global supply chain in COVID-19, we are also positioning the company for the future. It's too early to set guidance for 2022 (ph), but as we think about next year, we expect strong pricing power to continue. The company yielded 4% in the third quarter which had just one month of benefit from the third price increase this year. For 2022, we'll have carry over price benefit from our June and September 2021 price increase. We have announced additional price increases in our next year with a strong price benefit to offset commodity headwind next year. Looking at market drivers and our strong backlog position and order HVAC Residential, Commercial unitary refrigeration up in 2022, as we get more and more of the supply disruptions behind us, we expect to return to strong growth and profitability as we capitalize on market opportunities. Now, let me turn it over to Joe.\nJoseph Reitmeier: Thank you, Todd and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, starting with Residential Heating & Cooling. In the third quarter, revenue from Residential Heating & Cooling was $711 million, down 2%. Volume was down 6%, price was up 5% and mix was down 1%, with foreign exchange neutral to revenue. Residential segment profit was $144 million, down 6%. Segment margin was 20.3%, down 90 basis points. Residential profit was primarily impacted by lower volume due to global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions to production, factory inefficiencies, unfavorable mix, higher material, freight, distribution, tariffs and other product costs, with partial offsets included favorable price and lower SG&A expenses. Now turning to our Commercial Heating & Cooling business. In the third quarter, Commercial revenue was $212 million, up 2%. Volume was down 6%, price was up 1% and mix was up 6%. Foreign exchange had a positive 1% impact to revenue. Commercial segment profit was $23 million, down 42%. Segment margin was 10.7%, down 800 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by lower volume due to global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions to production, factory inefficiencies, higher material, freight, distribution, tariffs and other product costs, with partial offsets included favorable price and mix. In Refrigeration, revenue was $137 million, up 10%. Volume was up 9%, price was up 2% and mix was down 1%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Refrigeration segment profit was $15 million, up 12%. Segment margin was 10.6% which was up 20 basis points. Global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions to production constrained revenue and profit growth. Segment profit was negatively impacted by factory inefficiencies and higher material, freight and SG&A costs. Results were positively impacted by higher volume and favorable price. Regarding special items in the quarter, the company had net after-tax benefit of $0.5 million that included a benefit of $2.7 million for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation and a net charge of $2.4 million in total for various items excluded from segment profit, including personal protective equipment and facility deep cleaning expenses incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a net benefit of $0.2 million for other items. Corporate expense was $16 million in the third quarter, down from $28 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower incentive compensation. Overall, SG&A was $134 million compared to $152 million in the prior year quarter. SG&A was down as a percent of revenue to 12.7% from 14.4% in the prior year quarter. In the third quarter, cash from operations was $222 million compared to $440 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $23 million in the third quarter compared to approximately $12 million in the prior quarter. Free cash flow was $199 million in the third quarter compared to $428 million in the prior year quarter. The company paid $34 million in dividends and repurchased $200 million of stock in the quarter. Total debt was $1.28 billion at the end of the third quarter and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $44 million at the end of the third quarter. Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I'll review current market assumptions and our guidance points for 2021. For Residential and Commercial unitary HVAC and Refrigeration markets in North America for the full year, we continue to expect low double-digit shipment growth for the industry. For the company, we are now narrowing guidance for 2021 revenue growth from 12% to 16% to a new range of 13% to 15% and we still expect a 1% benefit to revenue from foreign exchange. We are narrowing guidance for 2021 GAAP EPS from continuing operations from $11.97 to $12.57 to a new range of $11.97 to $12.17. And we are narrowing 2021 guidance for adjusted EPS from continuing operations from $12.10 to $12.70 to a new range of $12.10 to $12.30. And as previously mentioned, the fourth quarter of 2021 will have a headwind of 6% from fewer days than the prior year quarter. The first quarter of 2021 had a 6% benefit from more days than the prior year quarter. For 2022, there are no days differences, I'd like just to highlight. Now, let me run you through the key points of our guidance assumptions and puts and takes for 2021. First, for the items that are changing. We now expect a benefit of $130 million from price for the year, up from prior guidance of $110 million benefit. We continued -- with continued inflation and components, we are reducing our net savings from sourcing and engineering-led cost reduction to neutral, down from prior guidance, to be a $5 million benefit. We now expect LIFO accounting adjustments to be approximately $20 million this year, up from our prior guidance of $15 million due to higher material costs from inflationary pressures. About 40% of that was in the third quarter and about 40% is expected in the fourth quarter. Factory productivity is now expected to be a $10 million headwind, down from prior guidance, to be a $10 million benefit. Residential mix is swinging from a $10 million headwind -- excuse me, swinging to a $10 million headwind from a $10 million benefit and corporate expense is now expected to be $95 million, down from prior guidance of $100 million on lower incentive compensation. Overall, SG&A is now expected to be approximately a $40 million headwind, down from prior guidance of $45 million. Within SG&A, we continue to make investments in research and development and IT for continued innovation and leadership in products, controls, e-commerce, factory automation and productivity. For headwinds that are unchanged from our prior guidance, commodities are still expected to be a headwind of $80 million and freight is still expected to be a $5 million headwind with tariffs still expected to be a $5 million headwind as well. Other guidance items that remain the same: foreign exchange is still expected to be a $10 million benefit; we still expect a net interest and pension expense to be approximately $35 million; the effective tax rate guidance remains approximately 20% on an adjusted basis for the full year; and we still expect capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million this year, about $30 million of which is for the third plant at our campus in Saltillo, Mexico. This is still on track to be completed by the end of 2021. Pilot runs of the initial products took place in mid-October. We now plan to start initial production before the end of 2021 and ramp up to full production in mid-2022 and we expect nearly a $10 million in annual savings from that third plant. Free cash flow is targeted to be approximately $400 million for the full year. In the third quarter, we repurchased $200 million of stock to complete our target of $600 million for the full year and then guidance for our weighted average diluted share count for the full year remains between 37 million to 38 million shares. And with that, operator, let's now go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to understand from you how you're thinking about sort of the pace of the catch-up here from some of these issues, the $0.55 headwind in Q3, similar in Q4. How quickly can Lennox sort of come back from these headwinds when you're thinking about aspects like market share recapture, getting those plant inefficiencies down into 2022?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. Let me unpack it and sort of swing away at that question because that's obviously the topic of the day. When we get AHRI data, we look through August year to date, we're sort of flat on shares. So, I think others are having issues too. I know Watsco reported a larger number. But again, their carriers primary are top distributor. If you looked at top 80% dealers and distributors, they're up also, it's a 20% or 30% that we're shutting off that are down so much. So, I think share wise, I think we're sort of doing -- our sense is, different people or different OEMs at different times have had their turn in the penalty box. We think we're middle of the pack, maybe even slightly above middle of the pack. But let's see how others report and sort of see where they're at. In terms of the timing of getting things behind us, we're making very good progress, both on the COVID impact, which I'll talk more about in a second and about the supply chain impact. Things are getting better. Although financially, fourth quarter looks similar to third quarter, that's just the way it works because the costs get hung up on the balance sheet. You don't see it until you sell it. So, it is sort of the absorption impact and the overtime impact and our problems are being seen. And then on the revenue side, it's because we're entering -- we ended the quarter with lower inventory than what we need. But on the production line rates, we're seeing nice improvements. So let me unpack it a little bit. 65%, 70% or so of the issues are driven by supply chain, the balance from COVID. Let me talk about COVID first. We saw unplanned absenteeism in our Southern factory, South Carolina, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, double due to COVID. The good news is the Delta variant has really sort of run its course in our factories, and we're confident, at least as we stand today, that the worst is behind us. On the supply chain side, I mean it's the things we all know. It's integrated circuits which are in motors, which are in compressors. It's things as mundane as corrugated cardboard and pallets. We've aggressively worked to sort of address that. We're taking inventory in parts and buying a year's worth of inventory in things like integrated circuits to protect ourselves. We're requalifying different parts with suppliers, and we have tiger teams literally in key factories making sure -- and supplier factories getting what we need. So, it's not the best news, obviously. But from a competitive viewpoint, at least today, we've seen so far, we don't think we're losing much. We think others are in similar situations, although we haven't seen all the OEM numbers published, but what we see in share data from AHRI, and we think COVID is behind us to a large degree in supply chain, while we're still battling, it's better now than it was a month ago and significantly better than two months ago, although we'll still see the tail of the financial impact in Q4.\nJulian Mitchell: That's really helpful, Todd. And maybe just one follow-up on residential market demand. You emphasized your bullishness on the market trend there as you look at 2022. The volumes in Lennox Residential, I think, were down about 6% year-on-year, Joe had said, in Q3. Are you sort of thinking that, yes, there's some noise in there from sort of inventory absorption and supply chain, and so that\u2019s sort of flat-to-down slightly is a good sort of placeholder year-on-year for the next couple of quarters? And then as you go through 2022, momentum sort of year-on-year on volumes reaccelerate?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think high level, it is yes, but let me put it in my own words which I think will be constructive to your question. If you adjust for the volume miss that we have because of production, our Lennox Residential revenue's up 2%, 3%, 4%. And I think compared against the very tough third quarter comp, that we had from last year that people were really intimidated by, including us, quite frankly, I think would have been a very nice performance. And then I lay on top of that all the things you've heard me talk about around the units running longer, that R-22 systems 60% from 2005 to 2010, and the system sales kick in and the fact that it just continues to be warmer summer. So, I still feel as we've talked about, bullish about the market.\nJulian Mitchell: Great, thank you.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, everyone. Todd, maybe you can jump into this mix shift. I think you swung at $20 million on the guide. Is that what people are buying or is that tied to the supply chain and COVID issues?\nTodd Bluedorn: It's tied to COVID issues. I mean we talked about the resi business that new construction was up and replacement was down, and there's a couple -- one supply -- the other issue is we protected our big builders, for obvious reasons, and so that drove it. And then on the supply side is our Mexico facility has -- Saltillo has been the most resilient facility around both COVID and around supply chain for a myriad of reasons, and it's a lower mix of product category that comes from there. So, we would have been able to have a more rich mix if we were to produce more out of Iowa, not South Carolina and not Mississippi.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. And then just on the -- I mean, it sounds like the COVID dynamic is getting better and who knows what happens with resurgence. But the supply chain dynamic, is your thought that, that carries well into '22? Or I know you mentioned it getting better but when do you think you\u2019d get back to normal there?\nTodd Bluedorn: I'm not sure it's the honest answer. I think what I know on a micro level when we look -- when I sit out with the businesses and supply chain reviews is it's better -- like I said, it's better than a month ago. It's better than two months ago, significantly better than three months ago. And we're sort of putting things to bed around integrated circuits because when we find them, we buy them and we have significant inventory to buffer us. But I think we're close enough to 2022 that I think clearly supply chain issues in corporate America or industrial America aren't done.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. And then just on price, if we snap the line on all the increases you've announced or planning to announce, like is a 4% kind of favorable price a good starting point to think about for 2022?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. I mean we're going to get significant price. I mean math that I'll give you is what we said on the call which was in the script, we got 4% in Q3, resi was up 5% and we guided at $130 million for the full year. If you do the math which you will when you have time, through Q3, we're up about $70 million. And so that implies we're going to get over 6% prices at corporation in the fourth quarter. Now that's going to be the best run rate quarter. But we still -- you think about second, third and the fourth quarter price increases this year, we're going to have lots of Carrier we're going into next year.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. Great, thanks.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Todd, can you just pick up on price a little bit more? So it sounds like we should expect a normal kind of December-ish, January-ish bump of some reasonable magnitude also.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. I mean we -- what we tried to convey in the call or on the script was we've already announced Commercial up to 13% effective, I think, January 1. And the resi guys are just sort of putting the final wraps on things to probably aggravate me because they want to communicate it probably on their own but we're going to announce something similar for resi effective January 1. And then Refrigeration already went out both in Europe and the U.S. in December with pricing -- for pricing increases effective December. So yes, there's another way that's effective in essence at the end of the year.\nJeff Sprague: And I wonder if you could actually update us on the succession process, where that's at. Any other kind of update on expected timing or anything?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. I think it's as is. I mean the search is ongoing, Board's fully into it. And when we have something to say, we'll announce it, I think, is the long and short of it.\nJeff Sprague: Great. I'll leave it there. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: And we'll go to Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: Hey, thanks. So first off, when do you expect to shift the $150 million of pushed res? And was the majority in commercial? Or what's the rough split?\nTodd Bluedorn: I'll answer the second part of the question. I'm not sure of the first part of the question but the second part of the question is, in third quarter, it was more resident -- excuse me, more Commercial than Residential. And then the fourth quarter will be more Residential than Commercial. And sort of the split is like 60-40. So third quarter is 60% Commercial, 40% resi. In the next quarter, it's the flip. And then what's the first part of the question, when we're going to ship it?\nRyan Merkel: Yes, when you are going to introduce it and ship the push -- yes.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. I think it's sort of just -- I think what's happening -- short answer is in fourth quarter, right? So there's sort of a bubble that moves through the system. And some of the things we couldn't ship in fourth -- third quarter, we ship in fourth quarter. I think we will see an AHRI data when it comes out that third and fourth quarter will sort of be muted quarters industry-wide in units, i.e., it will be flat to down. And I think what that will mean is we've all had trouble producing, as I suggested. And we're sort of at the end of the season. And while some of the demand is being picked up by Watsco and people have some things but I think broadly, what's happening is the lead times from local dealers to install HVAC or air conditioners is long enough that people are deferring the replacement until the summer season in many parts of the country. Not in Phoenix, not in Miami but in many parts of the country, I think people are deferring because I think there'll be a bow wave when we enter -- when we get into 2022 when production picks up and we start to enter the summer selling season next year.\nRyan Merkel: Yes. That makes sense. Okay. And then for my follow-up, you hit on this a little, Todd but can you talk about the newer strategies you're implementing to offset the supply issues in COVID? And is there a time line you can share for when the company is going to see improvements from initiatives?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think the answer is the time line was a month ago. So we're already seeing significant improvements from the initiatives. Just like I said, it just takes a while for it all to flow through the P&L. So I would have said the peak of disruption in our business was August, early September and we're now past that peak. And the things that we're doing is we have, I want to say, tens of millions of dollars, maybe it's a little less than that. It just feels like that of inventory of integrated circuits. We're buying 18 months a year of an integrated circuit inventory. We're sort of taking our MCR engineering team and focused them on qualifying new suppliers and we're spending lots of times with key suppliers. So I think the major ones are behind us. But again, this thing is a bit of a bumpy ride and we're trying to work through it and things are getting better. But if our motor suppliers call us on the phone and say they have an issue, we got to work through it quickly. And we've had those phone calls. We had compressors. I never thought I'd live in a world where pallets would be short but they are and we've worked through that also. So I think the answer is the financial news is -- I'm repeating myself for the fifth time, I know but the financial news is still bad in Q4 around this issue but operationally, we're much better. It just takes a while for the cost caught up in inventory to work it's way through the system.\nRyan Merkel: Helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hey, good morning guys. Todd, just to kind of pick up that last comment on some of the good work's already been done and it's just a matter of time. I mean, I guess maybe specifically in commercial, not to get ahead of ourselves on '22 guidance but can margins start to kind of flatten out or go up on a year-over-year basis in the first half next year? Or do we need to kind of fully lap annually some of these dynamics before stuff gets better?\nTodd Bluedorn: I'll be honest with you, Josh, I'm not trying to be coy. I don't have that -- I can't see that math in my head. But I think the answer -- I'll just make a third quarter comment, the fact we're down 800 basis points in the quarter, that's a one-off and we'll be back. What I do know is on a full year basis, we expect margins to increase in commercial next year from this year.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then on the refrigerant dynamic that you talked about in resi, I think you're one of the only OEMs out there that sort of pointing to that as a specific driver, Watsco included, hasn't really noticed that per se. But anything that you can sort of put around that number-wise that's kind of driving that delta to the consumer? And maybe as kind of a side point, I remember like 10 years ago, recycling was supposed to be a big thing. Like why hasn't that kind of stepped in to fill in some of the supply or shortages there?\nTodd Bluedorn: Well, I think Watsco's talking about it, too. I think everyone close to the business understands it. But I'll give you an example. Say, your house, Josh, you're getting a big unit. So you're getting a 5-ton unit for that 8,000 square foot you have in your house. And sort of the difference between a 5-ton air conditioner right now, the refrigerant charge, if you buy R-22 and assume there's 3-pounds of charge per ton, it costs you about $2,300 for the refrigerant. It's about $153 per ton. And for a 410A unit, it's about $1,100 because it's about $70 per ton of refrigerant. So that's about a $1,000 difference for a 5-ton unit of buying -- of recharging with refrigerant. So I have a unit that leaks, I have a bad coil and someone comes out and says, \"Okay, it's $2,200 for me to put the refrigerant back in, plus there's some labor with that, or I can sell you a whole new system for $5,000. And by the way, that's only $1,000 refrigerant charge that's baked into that and you get a 10-year warranty and you get more efficiency.\" Those are the conversations that are taking place. And dealers know this. They're very, very good at this. And there's recycling that takes place but it's the -- it's just supply and demand and the R-22 spiked up and it will continue to spike up.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it, that's helpful. I think we're more like vesting fans electric fan blowing over ice cubes but good example.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Our Next question is from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Baumann: Hi, good morning, Todd. Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for taking my question. First one, just looking at the fourth quarter and the guidance for organic sales. It looks flattish in terms of the year-over-year and I think you said price is about 6% and then you have a days sales impact which pulls down the revenue by 6% [ph]. I guess I'm coming at it and looking at it, I guess you're assuming flattish on volume. And my question -- on a selling days adjusted basis, that is. And my question is really what's your visibility to kind of improving that volume growth rate in the fourth quarter versus what it looked like was kind of low to mid-single-digit decline on volume in the third quarter. It just seems like from your comments, you're not really embedding improvement from like the disruptions from COVID and supply chain. So maybe it's availability related to furnaces versus AC or something like that. I'm just kind of curious if you could give some color on that.\nTodd Bluedorn: No. I think it's tied to what I said, that I mean we entered -- we're already almost a month through the quarter and we entered low on inventory. And so my comments were around our product -- our production capabilities. And so they're materially better than what they were a month ago and even more better than they were two or three months ago. So I mean the guide's to guide but our production capabilities -- we're getting these issues behind us.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay. Got it. The issues are behind but the impact from the disruptions are unchanged.\nTodd Bluedorn: I said the issues are getting behind us, right? So I didn't say it's fixed, I said getting behind us. And then I said that the cost hangs up on the balance sheet and then you have to enter the quarter with the inventory to be able to sell and you sort of catch up as you go along. And so that's the issue that we face.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay. And then my follow-up is on Commercial HVAC and I wrote this down quickly, so I just want to obviously confirm these numbers. But I think you said emergency replacement down 30% and planned replacement up 20%. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about the drivers behind that. And since it was emergency replacement that was down a lot, doesn't that -- isn't that by definition just hard to kind of recapture?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. I didn't say we were going to recapture emergency replacement. So I didn't say that but I don't disagree with that. But what it reflects is we're protecting our national accounts which is, by the way, a higher margin business for us. So we've captured -- we're going after it. And yes, it's hard to replace emergency replacement. But what I said earlier I think others are having similar issues. So we'll sort of see what the market share shake out as.\nPatrick Baumann: Understood. Thanks for the color. Appreciate the time.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question is from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Todd, it sounds like the pricing environment is still rather constructive. So I'm just curious. Is there any sign of that momentum diminishing? Is there any lack of discipline among the players in the industry? And what's your confidence level that you can keep price cost neutral into 2022?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. It still remains constructive. I think that's Southern understatement, Tommy. I mean our price I said it's going to be up over 6% before. That's more than constructive. So the answer is we're aggressively getting priced. We're offsetting it this year even when we're sort of on our -- flatfooted going into it. But this year, we're going to get $130 million of price commodities is $80 million; LIFO which doesn't affects cost, $15 million; freight, $5 million; tariffs are $5 million, that all adds up to $105 million. And so we're more than offsetting those inflationary pressures this year and we'll even have a better performance next year.\nTommy Moll: Perhaps there was a little understatement there.\nTodd Bluedorn: It's a tough quarter, Tommy. You've got to be helping me here. You can't get be [indiscernible].\nTommy Moll: I wanted to ask a follow-up on the SG&A line. Just anything you would do to level set us on any comparisons next year versus this year that may be squarely, whether they be favorable or unfavorable? Or should we think about next year as best you know today, any way where that line should deliver a typical type of incremental as we've been accustomed to expect?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think broadly, I would say that I think sort of high level things I think about is as salary increases maybe up a hair more than normal, given sort of inflationary pressures that we're all seeing and labor issues that we see, I think that's probably true. Even though we've taken a step down second half of the year on -- we had a really, really strong first half of the year. So on a full year basis, incentive comp is up above target this year. And so we'll get a benefit next year when we re-base line it. And we'll continue to make the investments in products and distribution and in IT like we always do. So I think that's a long-winded way of saying there's some puts and takes but I would end up where you started with this as I would sort of look at a model over the last couple of years of SG&A increases and we're sort of going up less than revenue and that's what I would bake in.\nTommy Moll: Got it. Thank you, Todd. I'll turn it back.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So maybe just parsing out those price cost comments just a little further, Todd. So you mentioned the six points in the fourth quarter. I mean, should we be thinking about that as kind of like a run rate then into the next maybe the first half of 2022? And obviously, like those cost curves are starting to come down. So at what point do you think you start to get the benefit of that spread widening into next year?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think the cost curves are coming down much lower than I thought. So steel, still pretty high. Copper is down a little bit but steel's -- aluminum is down out a little bit but steel's where we're most exposed at this point as we move away from two large degree copper coils. So I think it starts to take a while to unwind. I think over -- given the carryforward and the timing of things this year, commodities will still be up -- at least we're planning for commodities and our cost structure, given that we hedge and buy steel based on different formats to include prior quarter CRU pricing, we still expect commodities on a year-over-year basis next year to be up significantly. And we're pricing -- that's why we passed on a significant price increase at the end of the year. And so we're going to have headwinds again next year. We're really confident we're going to offset them with price though. And I think to answer your question, the price increases of last year were beginning of the year, second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter of this year. So yes, we'll have some nice tailwind the first half of the year.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. No, that's helpful. I guess my one follow-on. And so you kind of referred to resi replacement being down mid-single digits. It sounds like supply chain certainly impacted that to some degree. And this conversation just around kind of R-22 and the potential replacement. I guess any other color that you can provide in terms of just what's left to replace? I don't know if you guys have dug into that any further and how to think about kind of like this resi replacement market as we head into 2022.\nTodd Bluedorn: I understand the question. I mean, we haven't done the math on the 2005 to 2010, that's 60% R-22. But I would -- when you think about 2009, 2010, even 2008, there's a lot of those units still out there. I mean they don't -- they're under warranty up until last year or the year before, depending on the time slice so people just get it fixed. So those units are out there and systems are out there. And so I think it's a major driver of demand -- significant driver of demand.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, that's great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Next question from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Nobody asked about IAQ, so I figure I might as well. Can you comment on what you're seeing in terms of inquiries? How big it is maybe in the Commercial business?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. I mean it still remains important but I'll be honest with you. I mean, it sort of gets pushed a little bit to the side, given the other issues that we have and how we're taking care of customers and how we're prioritizing customers. So the biggest market for us is probably schools and low-rise office buildings and inquiries are still strong and resi is still an important part. But as you know, I've been a little less bullish than others. So when I think about our opportunities going into 2022, I mean we'll drive and we're focused on it but some of these other issues are obviously much more important.\nGautam Khanna: Can you remind us what the incremental ticket size is if you do sell a system with IAQ add-ons? What is the portion...\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, if you do it on a resi system, it can be 20% or so. On a Commercial system, probably less than that, 10% to 20%. You sort of get the full package, if you get everything. If you just do MERV filters -- if you just upgrade filters, it's probably 3% or 4%, 5%. That's UV lights. That's sort of the whole thing.\nGautam Khanna: Helpful. And Todd, just to be clear, on the Q3 and Q4 impacts from COVID, is that almost entirely a Commercial issue? Or did it also impact the resi facility in South Carolina or Iowa? You mentioned Saltillo was a little more resilient but...\nTodd Bluedorn: The factories that had impacted the most in order to the business was Arkansas. Our Arkansas factory which is Commercial but our Mississippi Residential factory and our Orangeburg, South Carolina Residential factory. So really sort of two resi factories and then the Commercial factory. And again, we think about lots of criteria where we put our factories. I know I will offend people when I say this but I'm going to say it anyhow. I mean we never had a criteria where people believe in science, right? And in the Southern factories, our vaccine rates are much, much lower than they are in other parts of the country, as you would expect, because society reflects that. And so we've had around some of these factories with 20%, 30% vaccine rates.\nGautam Khanna: And last question for me. You mentioned the mix dynamics. Is it also true that the higher-end SEER systems have more electronic components? And therefore, are more kind of at risk pinch points from the supply chain relative to the entry-level SEER products? Or is that not true? Does that also have an impact on the mix, just the supply constraint?\nTodd Bluedorn: That's probably fair. I mean, I simplified it as thinking about it as production site that Mexico did better than Marshalltown, Iowa and we had lower mix there. But I think you're probably right, both around variable speed and around control systems. So my guess is you're probably right, if I dug in, that would probably be part of the answer.\nGautam Khanna: Got it. Thank you very much, guys.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey, Nigel Coe?\nOperator: Nigel Coe, your line is open, if you're on mute, possibly.\nNigel Coe: Yes, I was on mute. Good morning, everyone. So when we talk about the improving conditions in supply chain sort of real time, are we talking primarily about labor availability and productivity in the factory? Or is it labor and supply of compressive motors? And then just a sort of subtext to that would be the Commercial impacts on replacement. Was that partly VRF imports from your -- from Medea? Or is that something separate?\nTodd Bluedorn: I'll answer it maybe in reverse order. VRF was up in the quarter, so we weren't really impacted much there. But the emergency replacement was clearly impacted by availability because we were protecting our large national accounts. I mean we had to protect our existing customers before we went after new contractor business replacement. What was the first part of the question, Nigel?\nNigel Coe: Yes, it's really -- is it mainly labor that's gotten better for you? Or is it...\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. What's behind us? Yes. The COVID impact sort of unplanned absenteeism, that's sort of behind us at this point. And again, you should see it in the Southern states COVID case charts. So if you look at New York Times, look at Arkansas, look at South Carolina, look in Mississippi, they're down dramatically and we've seen that in our factories. So supply chain, we still have challenges that we're facing but it's much better than it was two or three months ago. And I think that's an order inventory positions that we've taken on critical components, investments we've made in qualified new suppliers. And I -- and then the third piece is, I think the supply chain itself is healing even if we hadn't taken actions on our own.\nNigel Coe: And then the auto companies are talking about some of these rare metals as constraints, magnesium and other metals that I can't even pronounce. But aluminum alloys are coming up as an issue. I know you're a consumer of aluminum but any sort of [indiscernible]?\nTodd Bluedorn: No, not that's on my radar screen yet. I mean that may pop up in the future. But I think the issue around different metals has impacted the integrated circuit market in some ways. But I mean we buy straightforward aluminum and straightforward cold-rolled steel. So we're not buying anything exotic but that doesn't mean there might not be issues in the future. But right now, that's not an issue with us. And the auto guys slowing down has helped us with aluminum and steel, as you might imagine. And so that has actually helped.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Great. And then Todd, can we just address once again the CEO search. I mean you're not -- you're committed to the company until mid-2022. So would you describe the search right now as intense? Or is there a time -- still time on your hands? I mean are we talking about weeks, months? Any color there would be helpful.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. It's intense. I think we all understand that once you announce something like this, the sooner you move on, the better. And I got my wheels -- I've got my hands on the wheel and I'm driving as hard as I can and fighting every day. But as soon as they get somebody then the transition will take place. And so it's intense. We're trying to get it done as quick as we can, or to better say it, the Board is trying to get it done as quick as they can.\nNigel Coe: Got it. Okay. Thanks, Todd.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to come at the cost side of price cost a little differently here. Obviously, this year, demand has been, I think, better for the market than folks expected. So we've heard there might have been a little bit more spot buying of some of the commodities. Just curious if you would characterize this year as unusual on how much you buy in the spot market. I'm just thinking about next year, what you might have on hedged in terms of commodities versus what you had on hedged this year in terms of commodities?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think I understand the question. I'm going to ramble around it and maybe directly touch on it and touch other areas. I think the inflationary pressures have hit us, to your point, of buying on spot in different ways but I think broadly -- not broadly, I communicated that commodities are still going to be up significantly next year. This is the way we see it going forward. I think the other way that inflationary pressures has hurt us in a way that we typically don't talk about is material cost reduction is usually $20 million to $30 million a year, where net costs were taking out. This year, it's closer to breakeven. And the delta isn't that we aren't doing cost reduction, we are. The delta is that people are passing on price increases to us. So we're also seeing pricing pressure from suppliers who are passing on things that have steel in it, that have aluminum in it and they're passing that on to us. And so when we go into next year, we'll have -- we'll also not have our normal material cost reduction here. But again, we're able to offset that aggressively with price and that's why we're seeing the new price at the end of this year.\nJohn Walsh: Thank you for that. And then maybe just one on heat pumps. Are they meaningful -- are they a big enough part of the mix yet that they would have a mix impact, if there is actually one, from heat pumps? I don't know if they're actually accretive or dilutive to the overall margin for Lennox.\nTodd Bluedorn: I think they're roughly in line with the margin. If we sell heat pump system with an outdoor heat pump and an indoor air handler, it's not dissimilar to the margins that we get if we sell an AC outdoor and a furnace indoor. And it's a meaningful part. It's, from memory, one-third or so industry-wide and with us of our total cooling capacity are heat pumps. So it's a meaningful part of our business. And we've made significant investments, as I've spoken about, we are coming out with a cold weather or cold region heat pump that allows you to buy them as far north as Canada and still have them to be energy efficient and appropriate. And so we've made significant investments. I would have said five years ago, we lagged the industry. I'd say now we've caught up and maybe even ahead of people maybe not sort of a Carrier who has made significant investments but almost everybody else we're ahead of.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll pass it along.\nOperator: Our final question will be from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJoe O'Dea: Hi, good morning, everyone. First, I just want to understand on Mexico. Is it strictly just you've had fewer COVID issues for disruptions there? Or is there anything else about Mexico and supply chain that has made that a more favorable place to be kind of manufacturing through what we've seen in the supply chain environment so far? And does that continue to pay dividends as you increase your capacity when that factory comes online?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think one is COVID, that we were less hit there than we were certainly in our other factories in south of the Mason-Dixon line in the U.S. I think Gautam was probably on to something that I hadn't articulated, that I think the more entry-level product has less integrated circuits, so it's less at risk. And then the third is just some sort of basic areas like steel supply, pallet supply, the suppliers that we use for Mexico were more robust -- happen to be more robust. I don't think it's structurally in the answer that says Mexico is a better place to be for that reason. But the way it worked out, they, in fact, were.\nJoe O'Dea: Okay. And then a question on emergency replace. I just wonder as you get kind of more connected equipment and more data and maybe more preventive maintenance. Does that just become less of an opportunity in the marketplace for share shift over time? Are you seeing that where you can better protect share because you're not losing it out if there's an emergency replace and someone tries to swoop in and get that?\nTodd Bluedorn: I don't think so because in a sense, emergency replacement tends to be entry-level product, electromechanical controls. They're not monitoring it. We're not monitoring it. It's -- they turn it on when it's hot and they turn it off when it's cold and then it breaks and they call us. So I don't think we're going to remote monitor that in any meaningful way that will impact demand if people aren't booked -- if any -- if customers are sort of thinking about remote monitoring, then we're usually able to trade them up to a better unit.\nJoe O'Dea: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nTodd Bluedorn: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Mr. Bluedorn, I'll turn it back to you for any closing comments.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks a lot. To wrap up, we're battling through supply chain disruptions today but also positioning the company for the future. We carry strong pricing power into 2022 to offset inflationary pressure. Looking at market drivers and our strong backlog position and order rates, we see residential, commercial unitary and refrigeration markets up in 2022. To get more and more of the supply chain disruptions behind us, we expect to return to strong growth and profitability as we capitalize on market opportunities. I want to thank everyone for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joseph Reitmeier",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, starting with Residential Heating & Cooling. In the third quarter, revenue from Residential Heating & Cooling was $711 million, down 2%. Volume was down 6%, price was up 5% and mix was down 1%, with foreign exchange neutral to revenue. Residential segment profit was $144 million, down 6%. Segment margin was 20.3%, down 90 basis points. Residential profit was primarily impacted by lower volume due to global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions to production, factory inefficiencies, unfavorable mix, higher material, freight, distribution, tariffs and other product costs, with partial offsets included favorable price and lower SG&A expenses. Now turning to our Commercial Heating & Cooling business. In the third quarter, Commercial revenue was $212 million, up 2%. Volume was down 6%, price was up 1% and mix was up 6%. Foreign exchange had a positive 1% impact to revenue. Commercial segment profit was $23 million, down 42%. Segment margin was 10.7%, down 800 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by lower volume due to global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions to production, factory inefficiencies, higher material, freight, distribution, tariffs and other product costs, with partial offsets included favorable price and mix. In Refrigeration, revenue was $137 million, up 10%. Volume was up 9%, price was up 2% and mix was down 1%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Refrigeration segment profit was $15 million, up 12%. Segment margin was 10.6% which was up 20 basis points. Global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions to production constrained revenue and profit growth. Segment profit was negatively impacted by factory inefficiencies and higher material, freight and SG&A costs. Results were positively impacted by higher volume and favorable price. Regarding special items in the quarter, the company had net after-tax benefit of $0.5 million that included a benefit of $2.7 million for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation and a net charge of $2.4 million in total for various items excluded from segment profit, including personal protective equipment and facility deep cleaning expenses incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a net benefit of $0.2 million for other items. Corporate expense was $16 million in the third quarter, down from $28 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower incentive compensation. Overall, SG&A was $134 million compared to $152 million in the prior year quarter. SG&A was down as a percent of revenue to 12.7% from 14.4% in the prior year quarter. In the third quarter, cash from operations was $222 million compared to $440 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $23 million in the third quarter compared to approximately $12 million in the prior quarter. Free cash flow was $199 million in the third quarter compared to $428 million in the prior year quarter. The company paid $34 million in dividends and repurchased $200 million of stock in the quarter. Total debt was $1.28 billion at the end of the third quarter and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $44 million at the end of the third quarter. Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I'll review current market assumptions and our guidance points for 2021. For Residential and Commercial unitary HVAC and Refrigeration markets in North America for the full year, we continue to expect low double-digit shipment growth for the industry. For the company, we are now narrowing guidance for 2021 revenue growth from 12% to 16% to a new range of 13% to 15% and we still expect a 1% benefit to revenue from foreign exchange. We are narrowing guidance for 2021 GAAP EPS from continuing operations from $11.97 to $12.57 to a new range of $11.97 to $12.17. And we are narrowing 2021 guidance for adjusted EPS from continuing operations from $12.10 to $12.70 to a new range of $12.10 to $12.30. And as previously mentioned, the fourth quarter of 2021 will have a headwind of 6% from fewer days than the prior year quarter. The first quarter of 2021 had a 6% benefit from more days than the prior year quarter. For 2022, there are no days differences, I'd like just to highlight. Now, let me run you through the key points of our guidance assumptions and puts and takes for 2021. First, for the items that are changing. We now expect a benefit of $130 million from price for the year, up from prior guidance of $110 million benefit. We continued -- with continued inflation and components, we are reducing our net savings from sourcing and engineering-led cost reduction to neutral, down from prior guidance, to be a $5 million benefit. We now expect LIFO accounting adjustments to be approximately $20 million this year, up from our prior guidance of $15 million due to higher material costs from inflationary pressures. About 40% of that was in the third quarter and about 40% is expected in the fourth quarter. Factory productivity is now expected to be a $10 million headwind, down from prior guidance, to be a $10 million benefit. Residential mix is swinging from a $10 million headwind -- excuse me, swinging to a $10 million headwind from a $10 million benefit and corporate expense is now expected to be $95 million, down from prior guidance of $100 million on lower incentive compensation. Overall, SG&A is now expected to be approximately a $40 million headwind, down from prior guidance of $45 million. Within SG&A, we continue to make investments in research and development and IT for continued innovation and leadership in products, controls, e-commerce, factory automation and productivity. For headwinds that are unchanged from our prior guidance, commodities are still expected to be a headwind of $80 million and freight is still expected to be a $5 million headwind with tariffs still expected to be a $5 million headwind as well. Other guidance items that remain the same: foreign exchange is still expected to be a $10 million benefit; we still expect a net interest and pension expense to be approximately $35 million; the effective tax rate guidance remains approximately 20% on an adjusted basis for the full year; and we still expect capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million this year, about $30 million of which is for the third plant at our campus in Saltillo, Mexico. This is still on track to be completed by the end of 2021. Pilot runs of the initial products took place in mid-October. We now plan to start initial production before the end of 2021 and ramp up to full production in mid-2022 and we expect nearly a $10 million in annual savings from that third plant. Free cash flow is targeted to be approximately $400 million for the full year. In the third quarter, we repurchased $200 million of stock to complete our target of $600 million for the full year and then guidance for our weighted average diluted share count for the full year remains between 37 million to 38 million shares. And with that, operator, let's now go to Q&A."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Strong demand continued in the third quarter across all our businesses but global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions to production and labor availability negatively impacted our financial results, approximately a $75 million impact to revenue and $75 million to operating profit in the quarter. Company revenue was up slightly to a third quarter record of $1.06 billion, with the benefit of strong price in the shipment-constrained environment. GAAP operating income was down 3%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was relatively flat at $3.41 compared to $3.42 in the prior year quarter. Total segment profit was down 7% and total segment margin was down 120 basis points to 15.5%. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was down 4% to $3.40, including approximately $0.55 of negative impact from the global supply chain and COVID-19 disruptions. Looking at business segment highlights for the third quarter. Residential revenue was down 2% and segment profit was down 6%. Segment margin was down 90 basis points to 20.3%. Residential revenue from replacement business is down mid-single digits. Revenue from new construction was up low-double digits. Lennox brand revenue was down low-single digits, and revenue from Allied and our other brands were up low-single digits. Market demand remains high entering the fourth quarter, and we remain bullish on the residential market as we look ahead to 2022 in the coming years. More people continue to work from home and run our HVAC systems than before the pandemic. With global warming, the hotter weather we are seeing has an exponential impact on reducing the life of cooling systems. And there are more complete HVAC system sales taking place with old R-22 refrigerant systems in replacement window. This is driven by the EPA ban on the sale and distribution of equipment using R-22 refrigerant effective January 1, 2010, and the ban of the production or import of R-22 refrigerant effective January 1, 2020. While R-22 refrigerant is still available in the market, it's significantly more expensive than 410A. In many cases, it's cheaper to replace with a new 410A system, which is also more efficient and comes with a new warranty than to repair the old R-22 system. From 2005 to 2010, 60% of air conditioners and heat pumps sold were R-22. The need to replace these has a meaningful benefit to residential growth. We expect these dynamics to lead to strong residential market conditions for the years ahead. In addition, Lennox and Allied will be running a proven playbook for market share gains. Moving to our Commercial business; third quarter revenue was up 2%. Commercial profit was down 42%. The segment margin declined 800 basis points to 10.7%. On top of supply chain shortages and bottlenecks disrupting production, our Arkansas factory was hit the hardest by COVID-19 in the quarter and labor availability was a significant issue. At constant currency, commercial equipment revenue was down low-single digits in the quarter. Within this, replacement revenue was up low-single digits with planned replacement up more than 20%, and emergency replacement down more than 30%. New construction revenue was down mid-single digits. Breaking out revenue another way, regional and local business revenue was down high-single digits. National account equipment revenue was up high-single digits. The team won two national account equipment customers in the third quarter to total 11 year-to-date. On the service side, Lennox National Account Service revenue was up mid-teens. VRF revenue was up more than 30%. In Refrigeration for the third quarter, revenue was up 10%. North America revenue was up more than 20%. Europe Refrigeration revenue was relatively flat, and Europe HVAC revenue was down mid-single digits. Refrigeration segment profit was up 12% as margin expanded 20 basis points to 10.6%. Looking ahead for both our Refrigeration and Commercial businesses, demand remained strong. Backlog is up approximately 60% for Refrigeration and 90% for Commercial, and order rates continue to be strong. Demand is clearly not an issue. But as we look at the fourth quarter, we continue to expect a material impact to production from supply chain shortages and bottlenecks. We currently expect a similar negative financial impact to our business as we saw in the third quarter, approximately $75 million of revenue and $25 million of operating profit. We continue to see broad inflationary pressures, including for commodities and components but we have enacted three rounds of price increases this year. The latest one was just on September 1 with a focus on staying ahead of inflation. The company yielded 4% price overall in the third quarter, including 5% in Residential. In addition to the carryover benefit next year from our June and September price increases, we're announcing additional price increases heading into 2022. Our Refrigeration business has announced a price increase of 8% in North America effective for December 1. Likewise, our European business has recently announced another round of increases generally from 5% to 10% to drive price in 2022. Our Commercial business has announced a price increase of up to 13% effective January 1, and our Residential business will be announcing another round of price increases in November to be effective heading into 2022. For 2021, we are narrowing our revenue and EPS guidance for the year. We are narrowing 2021 guidance for revenue from 12% to 16% to a new range of 13% to 15%. Foreign exchange is still expected to be a 1% favorable to revenue. We are narrowing 2021 guidance for adjusted EPS from continuing operations from $12.10 to $12.70 to a new range of $12.10 to $12.30. Our free cash flow guidance remains $400 million for the year. As the company continues to battle through the disruptions to production from the global supply chain in COVID-19, we are also positioning the company for the future. It's too early to set guidance for 2022 (ph), but as we think about next year, we expect strong pricing power to continue. The company yielded 4% in the third quarter which had just one month of benefit from the third price increase this year. For 2022, we'll have carry over price benefit from our June and September 2021 price increase. We have announced additional price increases in our next year with a strong price benefit to offset commodity headwind next year. Looking at market drivers and our strong backlog position and order HVAC Residential, Commercial unitary refrigeration up in 2022, as we get more and more of the supply disruptions behind us, we expect to return to strong growth and profitability as we capitalize on market opportunities. Now, let me turn it over to Joe. Yes. Let me unpack it and sort of swing away at that question because that's obviously the topic of the day. When we get AHRI data, we look through August year to date, we're sort of flat on shares. So, I think others are having issues too. I know Watsco reported a larger number. But again, their carriers primary are top distributor. If you looked at top 80% dealers and distributors, they're up also, it's a 20% or 30% that we're shutting off that are down so much. So, I think share wise, I think we're sort of doing -- our sense is, different people or different OEMs at different times have had their turn in the penalty box. We think we're middle of the pack, maybe even slightly above middle of the pack. But let's see how others report and sort of see where they're at. In terms of the timing of getting things behind us, we're making very good progress, both on the COVID impact, which I'll talk more about in a second and about the supply chain impact. Things are getting better. Although financially, fourth quarter looks similar to third quarter, that's just the way it works because the costs get hung up on the balance sheet. You don't see it until you sell it. So, it is sort of the absorption impact and the overtime impact and our problems are being seen. And then on the revenue side, it's because we're entering -- we ended the quarter with lower inventory than what we need. But on the production line rates, we're seeing nice improvements. So let me unpack it a little bit. 65%, 70% or so of the issues are driven by supply chain, the balance from COVID. Let me talk about COVID first. We saw unplanned absenteeism in our Southern factory, South Carolina, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, double due to COVID. The good news is the Delta variant has really sort of run its course in our factories, and we're confident, at least as we stand today, that the worst is behind us. On the supply chain side, I mean it's the things we all know. It's integrated circuits which are in motors, which are in compressors. It's things as mundane as corrugated cardboard and pallets. We've aggressively worked to sort of address that. We're taking inventory in parts and buying a year's worth of inventory in things like integrated circuits to protect ourselves. We're requalifying different parts with suppliers, and we have tiger teams literally in key factories making sure -- and supplier factories getting what we need. So, it's not the best news, obviously. But from a competitive viewpoint, at least today, we've seen so far, we don't think we're losing much. We think others are in similar situations, although we haven't seen all the OEM numbers published, but what we see in share data from AHRI, and we think COVID is behind us to a large degree in supply chain, while we're still battling, it's better now than it was a month ago and significantly better than two months ago, although we'll still see the tail of the financial impact in Q4. I think high level, it is yes, but let me put it in my own words which I think will be constructive to your question. If you adjust for the volume miss that we have because of production, our Lennox Residential revenue's up 2%, 3%, 4%. And I think compared against the very tough third quarter comp, that we had from last year that people were really intimidated by, including us, quite frankly, I think would have been a very nice performance. And then I lay on top of that all the things you've heard me talk about around the units running longer, that R-22 systems 60% from 2005 to 2010, and the system sales kick in and the fact that it just continues to be warmer summer. So, I still feel as we've talked about, bullish about the market. Thanks. It's tied to COVID issues. I mean we talked about the resi business that new construction was up and replacement was down, and there's a couple -- one supply -- the other issue is we protected our big builders, for obvious reasons, and so that drove it. And then on the supply side is our Mexico facility has -- Saltillo has been the most resilient facility around both COVID and around supply chain for a myriad of reasons, and it's a lower mix of product category that comes from there. So, we would have been able to have a more rich mix if we were to produce more out of Iowa, not South Carolina and not Mississippi. I'm not sure it's the honest answer. I think what I know on a micro level when we look -- when I sit out with the businesses and supply chain reviews is it's better -- like I said, it's better than a month ago. It's better than two months ago, significantly better than three months ago. And we're sort of putting things to bed around integrated circuits because when we find them, we buy them and we have significant inventory to buffer us. But I think we're close enough to 2022 that I think clearly supply chain issues in corporate America or industrial America aren't done. Yes. I mean we're going to get significant price. I mean math that I'll give you is what we said on the call which was in the script, we got 4% in Q3, resi was up 5% and we guided at $130 million for the full year. If you do the math which you will when you have time, through Q3, we're up about $70 million. And so that implies we're going to get over 6% prices at corporation in the fourth quarter. Now that's going to be the best run rate quarter. But we still -- you think about second, third and the fourth quarter price increases this year, we're going to have lots of Carrier we're going into next year. Yes. I mean we -- what we tried to convey in the call or on the script was we've already announced Commercial up to 13% effective, I think, January 1. And the resi guys are just sort of putting the final wraps on things to probably aggravate me because they want to communicate it probably on their own but we're going to announce something similar for resi effective January 1. And then Refrigeration already went out both in Europe and the U.S. in December with pricing -- for pricing increases effective December. So yes, there's another way that's effective in essence at the end of the year. Yes. I think it's as is. I mean the search is ongoing, Board's fully into it. And when we have something to say, we'll announce it, I think, is the long and short of it. I'll answer the second part of the question. I'm not sure of the first part of the question but the second part of the question is, in third quarter, it was more resident -- excuse me, more Commercial than Residential. And then the fourth quarter will be more Residential than Commercial. And sort of the split is like 60-40. So third quarter is 60% Commercial, 40% resi. In the next quarter, it's the flip. And then what's the first part of the question, when we're going to ship it? Yes. I think it's sort of just -- I think what's happening -- short answer is in fourth quarter, right? So there's sort of a bubble that moves through the system. And some of the things we couldn't ship in fourth -- third quarter, we ship in fourth quarter. I think we will see an AHRI data when it comes out that third and fourth quarter will sort of be muted quarters industry-wide in units, i.e., it will be flat to down. And I think what that will mean is we've all had trouble producing, as I suggested. And we're sort of at the end of the season. And while some of the demand is being picked up by Watsco and people have some things but I think broadly, what's happening is the lead times from local dealers to install HVAC or air conditioners is long enough that people are deferring the replacement until the summer season in many parts of the country. Not in Phoenix, not in Miami but in many parts of the country, I think people are deferring because I think there'll be a bow wave when we enter -- when we get into 2022 when production picks up and we start to enter the summer selling season next year. I think the answer is the time line was a month ago. So we're already seeing significant improvements from the initiatives. Just like I said, it just takes a while for it all to flow through the P&L. So I would have said the peak of disruption in our business was August, early September and we're now past that peak. And the things that we're doing is we have, I want to say, tens of millions of dollars, maybe it's a little less than that. It just feels like that of inventory of integrated circuits. We're buying 18 months a year of an integrated circuit inventory. We're sort of taking our MCR engineering team and focused them on qualifying new suppliers and we're spending lots of times with key suppliers. So I think the major ones are behind us. But again, this thing is a bit of a bumpy ride and we're trying to work through it and things are getting better. But if our motor suppliers call us on the phone and say they have an issue, we got to work through it quickly. And we've had those phone calls. We had compressors. I never thought I'd live in a world where pallets would be short but they are and we've worked through that also. So I think the answer is the financial news is -- I'm repeating myself for the fifth time, I know but the financial news is still bad in Q4 around this issue but operationally, we're much better. It just takes a while for the cost caught up in inventory to work it's way through the system. I'll be honest with you, Josh, I'm not trying to be coy. I don't have that -- I can't see that math in my head. But I think the answer -- I'll just make a third quarter comment, the fact we're down 800 basis points in the quarter, that's a one-off and we'll be back. What I do know is on a full year basis, we expect margins to increase in commercial next year from this year. Well, I think Watsco's talking about it, too. I think everyone close to the business understands it. But I'll give you an example. Say, your house, Josh, you're getting a big unit. So you're getting a 5-ton unit for that 8,000 square foot you have in your house. And sort of the difference between a 5-ton air conditioner right now, the refrigerant charge, if you buy R-22 and assume there's 3-pounds of charge per ton, it costs you about $2,300 for the refrigerant. It's about $153 per ton. And for a 410A unit, it's about $1,100 because it's about $70 per ton of refrigerant. So that's about a $1,000 difference for a 5-ton unit of buying -- of recharging with refrigerant. So I have a unit that leaks, I have a bad coil and someone comes out and says, \"Okay, it's $2,200 for me to put the refrigerant back in, plus there's some labor with that, or I can sell you a whole new system for $5,000. And by the way, that's only $1,000 refrigerant charge that's baked into that and you get a 10-year warranty and you get more efficiency.\" Those are the conversations that are taking place. And dealers know this. They're very, very good at this. And there's recycling that takes place but it's the -- it's just supply and demand and the R-22 spiked up and it will continue to spike up. Thanks. No. I think it's tied to what I said, that I mean we entered -- we're already almost a month through the quarter and we entered low on inventory. And so my comments were around our product -- our production capabilities. And so they're materially better than what they were a month ago and even more better than they were two or three months ago. So I mean the guide's to guide but our production capabilities -- we're getting these issues behind us. I said the issues are getting behind us, right? So I didn't say it's fixed, I said getting behind us. And then I said that the cost hangs up on the balance sheet and then you have to enter the quarter with the inventory to be able to sell and you sort of catch up as you go along. And so that's the issue that we face. Yes. I didn't say we were going to recapture emergency replacement. So I didn't say that but I don't disagree with that. But what it reflects is we're protecting our national accounts which is, by the way, a higher margin business for us. So we've captured -- we're going after it. And yes, it's hard to replace emergency replacement. But what I said earlier I think others are having similar issues. So we'll sort of see what the market share shake out as. Thanks. Yes. It still remains constructive. I think that's Southern understatement, Tommy. I mean our price I said it's going to be up over 6% before. That's more than constructive. So the answer is we're aggressively getting priced. We're offsetting it this year even when we're sort of on our -- flatfooted going into it. But this year, we're going to get $130 million of price commodities is $80 million; LIFO which doesn't affects cost, $15 million; freight, $5 million; tariffs are $5 million, that all adds up to $105 million. And so we're more than offsetting those inflationary pressures this year and we'll even have a better performance next year. It's a tough quarter, Tommy. You've got to be helping me here. You can't get be [indiscernible]. I think broadly, I would say that I think sort of high level things I think about is as salary increases maybe up a hair more than normal, given sort of inflationary pressures that we're all seeing and labor issues that we see, I think that's probably true. Even though we've taken a step down second half of the year on -- we had a really, really strong first half of the year. So on a full year basis, incentive comp is up above target this year. And so we'll get a benefit next year when we re-base line it. And we'll continue to make the investments in products and distribution and in IT like we always do. So I think that's a long-winded way of saying there's some puts and takes but I would end up where you started with this as I would sort of look at a model over the last couple of years of SG&A increases and we're sort of going up less than revenue and that's what I would bake in. I think the cost curves are coming down much lower than I thought. So steel, still pretty high. Copper is down a little bit but steel's -- aluminum is down out a little bit but steel's where we're most exposed at this point as we move away from two large degree copper coils. So I think it starts to take a while to unwind. I think over -- given the carryforward and the timing of things this year, commodities will still be up -- at least we're planning for commodities and our cost structure, given that we hedge and buy steel based on different formats to include prior quarter CRU pricing, we still expect commodities on a year-over-year basis next year to be up significantly. And we're pricing -- that's why we passed on a significant price increase at the end of the year. And so we're going to have headwinds again next year. We're really confident we're going to offset them with price though. And I think to answer your question, the price increases of last year were beginning of the year, second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter of this year. So yes, we'll have some nice tailwind the first half of the year. I understand the question. I mean, we haven't done the math on the 2005 to 2010, that's 60% R-22. But I would -- when you think about 2009, 2010, even 2008, there's a lot of those units still out there. I mean they don't -- they're under warranty up until last year or the year before, depending on the time slice so people just get it fixed. So those units are out there and systems are out there. And so I think it's a major driver of demand -- significant driver of demand. Yes. I mean it still remains important but I'll be honest with you. I mean, it sort of gets pushed a little bit to the side, given the other issues that we have and how we're taking care of customers and how we're prioritizing customers. So the biggest market for us is probably schools and low-rise office buildings and inquiries are still strong and resi is still an important part. But as you know, I've been a little less bullish than others. So when I think about our opportunities going into 2022, I mean we'll drive and we're focused on it but some of these other issues are obviously much more important. Yes, if you do it on a resi system, it can be 20% or so. On a Commercial system, probably less than that, 10% to 20%. You sort of get the full package, if you get everything. If you just do MERV filters -- if you just upgrade filters, it's probably 3% or 4%, 5%. That's UV lights. That's sort of the whole thing. The factories that had impacted the most in order to the business was Arkansas. Our Arkansas factory which is Commercial but our Mississippi Residential factory and our Orangeburg, South Carolina Residential factory. So really sort of two resi factories and then the Commercial factory. And again, we think about lots of criteria where we put our factories. I know I will offend people when I say this but I'm going to say it anyhow. I mean we never had a criteria where people believe in science, right? And in the Southern factories, our vaccine rates are much, much lower than they are in other parts of the country, as you would expect, because society reflects that. And so we've had around some of these factories with 20%, 30% vaccine rates. That's probably fair. I mean, I simplified it as thinking about it as production site that Mexico did better than Marshalltown, Iowa and we had lower mix there. But I think you're probably right, both around variable speed and around control systems. So my guess is you're probably right, if I dug in, that would probably be part of the answer. Hey, Nigel Coe? I'll answer it maybe in reverse order. VRF was up in the quarter, so we weren't really impacted much there. But the emergency replacement was clearly impacted by availability because we were protecting our large national accounts. I mean we had to protect our existing customers before we went after new contractor business replacement. What was the first part of the question, Nigel? Yes. What's behind us? Yes. The COVID impact sort of unplanned absenteeism, that's sort of behind us at this point. And again, you should see it in the Southern states COVID case charts. So if you look at New York Times, look at Arkansas, look at South Carolina, look in Mississippi, they're down dramatically and we've seen that in our factories. So supply chain, we still have challenges that we're facing but it's much better than it was two or three months ago. And I think that's an order inventory positions that we've taken on critical components, investments we've made in qualified new suppliers. And I -- and then the third piece is, I think the supply chain itself is healing even if we hadn't taken actions on our own. No, not that's on my radar screen yet. I mean that may pop up in the future. But I think the issue around different metals has impacted the integrated circuit market in some ways. But I mean we buy straightforward aluminum and straightforward cold-rolled steel. So we're not buying anything exotic but that doesn't mean there might not be issues in the future. But right now, that's not an issue with us. And the auto guys slowing down has helped us with aluminum and steel, as you might imagine. And so that has actually helped. Yes. It's intense. I think we all understand that once you announce something like this, the sooner you move on, the better. And I got my wheels -- I've got my hands on the wheel and I'm driving as hard as I can and fighting every day. But as soon as they get somebody then the transition will take place. And so it's intense. We're trying to get it done as quick as we can, or to better say it, the Board is trying to get it done as quick as they can. I think I understand the question. I'm going to ramble around it and maybe directly touch on it and touch other areas. I think the inflationary pressures have hit us, to your point, of buying on spot in different ways but I think broadly -- not broadly, I communicated that commodities are still going to be up significantly next year. This is the way we see it going forward. I think the other way that inflationary pressures has hurt us in a way that we typically don't talk about is material cost reduction is usually $20 million to $30 million a year, where net costs were taking out. This year, it's closer to breakeven. And the delta isn't that we aren't doing cost reduction, we are. The delta is that people are passing on price increases to us. So we're also seeing pricing pressure from suppliers who are passing on things that have steel in it, that have aluminum in it and they're passing that on to us. And so when we go into next year, we'll have -- we'll also not have our normal material cost reduction here. But again, we're able to offset that aggressively with price and that's why we're seeing the new price at the end of this year. I think they're roughly in line with the margin. If we sell heat pump system with an outdoor heat pump and an indoor air handler, it's not dissimilar to the margins that we get if we sell an AC outdoor and a furnace indoor. And it's a meaningful part. It's, from memory, one-third or so industry-wide and with us of our total cooling capacity are heat pumps. So it's a meaningful part of our business. And we've made significant investments, as I've spoken about, we are coming out with a cold weather or cold region heat pump that allows you to buy them as far north as Canada and still have them to be energy efficient and appropriate. And so we've made significant investments. I would have said five years ago, we lagged the industry. I'd say now we've caught up and maybe even ahead of people maybe not sort of a Carrier who has made significant investments but almost everybody else we're ahead of. I think one is COVID, that we were less hit there than we were certainly in our other factories in south of the Mason-Dixon line in the U.S. I think Gautam was probably on to something that I hadn't articulated, that I think the more entry-level product has less integrated circuits, so it's less at risk. And then the third is just some sort of basic areas like steel supply, pallet supply, the suppliers that we use for Mexico were more robust -- happen to be more robust. I don't think it's structurally in the answer that says Mexico is a better place to be for that reason. But the way it worked out, they, in fact, were. I don't think so because in a sense, emergency replacement tends to be entry-level product, electromechanical controls. They're not monitoring it. We're not monitoring it. It's -- they turn it on when it's hot and they turn it off when it's cold and then it breaks and they call us. So I don't think we're going to remote monitor that in any meaningful way that will impact demand if people aren't booked -- if any -- if customers are sort of thinking about remote monitoring, then we're usually able to trade them up to a better unit. Sure. Thank you. Thanks a lot. To wrap up, we're battling through supply chain disruptions today but also positioning the company for the future. We carry strong pricing power into 2022 to offset inflationary pressure. Looking at market drivers and our strong backlog position and order rates, we see residential, commercial unitary and refrigeration markets up in 2022. To get more and more of the supply chain disruptions behind us, we expect to return to strong growth and profitability as we capitalize on market opportunities. I want to thank everyone for joining us today."

In the second quarter, we continued to see strong momentum on our residential business combined with continued rebound in commercial and refrigeration as the overall company set new record highs for revenue and profit. Company revenue was up 32% to a new record of $1.24 billion, at constant currency revenue was up 30%. GAAP operating income was up 59% to a record $216 million. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was up 72% to a record $4.51. Total segment profit rose 45% to a record $222 million. Total segment margin expanded 160 basis points to 17.9%, and adjusted EPS from continuing operations rose 54% to a record $4.57. Looking at the business segment highlights for the second quarter, in residential we set new highs for revenue, margin, and profit. Residential revenue was up 30% as reported and up 29% at constant currency. Segment profit rose 49% and segment margin expanded 290 basis points to 22.6%. Residential had comparable revenue growth in both replacement and new construction of approximately 30%. Lennox brand revenue was up 30% as was our allied and other brands combined.  Broad strength across residential in the second quarter. Year-over-year comparisons become tougher in the second half, actually started in June, and as we previously mentioned, the fourth quarter of 2021 will have a headwind of 6% from fewer days in the prior year quarter. Our market demand remained high entering the second half, and our residential business continues to perform as well or better than anyone in the market.  Looking beyond the second half of the year to 2022 and future years, we remain extremely bullish on the residential market as we see the residential replacement cycle spinning faster due to shorter equipment life.  We analyzed the actual run time data on air conditioners last year with many people at home due to the pandemic. Adjusted for weather, air conditioners ran 30% more during the summer season last year. This summer, we may not be getting a run time impact of 30%, but there are still a lot of people working from home and many will continue to work from home full time, or like here at Lennox on a flexible schedule a couple days a week. If the run time impact is 20%, that will reduce the medium life of an air conditioner from 15 years to around 12 years. Another factor is weather and the impact of hotter summers. Our original analysis of air conditioner lifespan for years 2005 to 2015. Since then for the years 2016 through 2020, weather as measured by average cooling degree days has been 5% hotter in the United States. For 2021, we are still in the middle of summer, but the second quarter was even hotter than last year. Where run time impacts equipment life on a linear basis, hot summers impact equipment life on an exponential basis. Another reason we are bullish on the residential replacement cycle for the coming years is that there will be more complete HVAC system sales taking place as old R22 refrigerant systems come into the replacement window. For those not familiar with the history, the EPA banned the sale and distribution of equipment using the R22 refrigerant effective January 1, 2010, and banned the production or import of the R22 refrigerant effective January 1, 2020. While R22 refrigerant is still available in the market, it\u2019s significantly more expensive than 410A. In many cases, it is cheaper to replace with a new 410A system, which is also more efficient and comes with a new warranty than to repair the old R22 system. This also accelerates the replacement cycle. We expect all these dynamics to lead to a strong residential market condition for years ahead. On top of this, Lennox and Allied will be running their proven playbooks for market share gains. Moving on to our commercial business, second quarter revenue was up 34% as reported, and 33% at constant currency. Segment profit rose 27%. Segment margin was 17.9%, down 100 basis points on the timing of expenses and factory inefficiencies. At constant currency, commercial equipment revenue was up more than 30% in the quarter. Within this, replacement revenue was up more than 40% with planned replacement up 50% and emergency replacement up more than 20%. New construction revenue was up high teens. Breaking out another way, regional and local business revenue was up more than 20%, national account equipment revenue was up more than 50%, and this market continues to rebound and benefit from the pent-up demand created last year. The team won six new national account equipment customers in the second quarter to a total nine in the first half.  On the service side, Lennox national accounts services revenue was up more than 30%. VRF revenue was up more than 25%. In refrigeration for the second quarter, revenue was up 37% as reported and 32% at constant currency. North America revenue was up more than 30%. Europe refrigeration revenue was up more than 30% at constant currency, and Europe HVAC revenue was up more than 25% at constant currency. Refrigeration segment margins expanded 90 basis points to 9.1% and segment profit rose 52%.  With the strong performance for the company overall in the second quarter and outlook for the second half, we have raised 2021 guidance. We now expect revenue growth of 12% to 16% on a reported basis or 11% to 15% at constant currency. We raised guidance for adjusted EPS from continuing operations to $12.10 to $12.70 for the year. We are raising free cash flow guidance to $400 million for the year and stock repurchase guidance to a total of $600 million for the year. Joe will talk about the specifics, but inflationary pressures continued to ratchet up this year, and we are seeing headwinds from commodities, components, LIFO adjustments, and labor. We\u2019re capturing a higher yield from our first two price increases this year and now expect $110 million of price benefit from those. In addition, we just announced a third price increase of up to 8% for most of our businesses that is effective September 1. This should yield even more price benefit than the $110 million of guidance provided today, so a third price increase is not in our current guidance. This is a special year. Demand is blistering and supply chains are tight at this level of high demand, but the company continues to execute as well or better than anyone in the industry. One thing to note in regard to our public guidance this year. We have been incrementally moving the earnings outlook up one quarter at a time, now after the first quarter and again after the second quarter, so while our guidance is our guidance, given the unique uncertainty this year, we are remaining balanced on future guidance. Lastly, as I\u2019m sure most of you saw, the company announced on July 14 that after 15 years, I plan to step down as Chairman and CEO of Lennox International by mid-2022. There\u2019s never a perfect time for a transition like this, but with end markets strong and the company well positioned for the future with an exceptional management team, hard working and dedicated employees, and the benefit of all the strategic investments we\u2019ve made in product, technology and distribution, we think it\u2019s a good time. The board has commenced a search for LII\u2019s next CEO, and I will be here over the next year to ensure a smooth transition. In the interim, managing day to day, be assured I\u2019m in the ring punching until the final bell. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Joe.\nJoseph Reitmeier: Thank you Todd, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, starting with residential heating and cooling. In the second quarter, revenue from residential heating and cooling was a record $838 million, up 30%. Volume was up 27%, price was up 3%, and mix was down 1%. Foreign exchange had a positive 1% impact on revenue. Residential segment profit was a record $190 million, up 49%. Segment margin expanded 290 basis points to a record 22.6%. Residential profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price, higher factory productivity, sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, freight savings, and favorable foreign exchange. Partial offsets included unfavorable mix, higher commodities, tariffs and warranty costs, distribution investments and higher SG&A, including research and development and information technology investments. Now turning to our commercial heating and cooling business, in the second quarter commercial revenue was $253 million, up 34%. Volume was up 29%, price was flat, and mix was up 4%. Foreign exchange had a positive 1% impact to revenue. Commercial segment profit was $45 million, which was up 27%. Segment margin was 17.9%, down 100 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume and favorable mix. Partial offsets included higher material, distribution, freight, tariffs and other product costs, factory inefficiencies, and higher SG&A including research and development, and information technology investments. In refrigeration, revenue was $148 million, up 37%. Volume was up 30%, price was up 2%, and mix was flat. Foreign exchange had a positive 5% impact to revenue. Refrigeration segment profit was $14 million, up 52%, and segment margin was 9.1%, which was up 90 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price and sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, and partial offsets included higher commodity, freight, and other product costs, and higher SG&A including research and development and information technology investments. Regarding special items in the second quarter, the company had net after-tax charges of $2 million that included a charge of $1 million for restructuring activities, a net charge of $3.4 million for various other items in total, and a benefit of $2.4 million for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation and other tax items.  Corporate expenses were $27 million in the second quarter compared to $19 million in the prior year quarter, primarily on higher incentive compensation. Overall, SG&A was $168 million compared to $130 million in the prior year quarter. SG&A was down as a percent of revenue to 13.5% from 13.8% in the prior year quarter. In the second quarter, cash from operations was $192 million, up from $105 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $21 million in the second quarter compared to approximately $19 million in the prior year quarter. We generated $171 million of free cash flow in the second quarter, up from approximately $87 million in the prior year quarter. The company paid $29 million in dividends in the quarter and repurchased $200 million of stock. The total debt was $1.24 billion at the end of the second quarter and we ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.7. Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments were $47 million at the end of the second quarter.  Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I\u2019ll review our current market assumptions and our updated guidance points for 2021.  We now expect the industry to see low double-digit shipment growth in residential, commercial unitary, and refrigeration markets in North America for the full year, up from our prior assumptions of high single digit growth. This is an industry comment, including competitors who ship primarily to independent distributors, unlike our model.  As previously announced, on July 14 we raised guidance for 2021 revenue growth from 7% to 11% to a new range of 11% to 15% at constant currency. We now expect a one-point benefit from foreign exchange for revenue growth of 12% to 16% for the year at actual currency.  We raised guidance for 2021 GAAP EPS from continuing operations from $11.33 to $11.93, to a new range of $11.97 to $12.57, and we raised guidance for 2021 adjusted EPS from continuing operations from $11.40 to $12, to a new range of $12.10 to $12.70.  As we previously mentioned, the first quarter of 2021 had a 6% benefit from more days than in the prior year quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we\u2019ll have a headwind of 6% from fewer days than the prior year quarter, as Todd mentioned. For 2022, there are no days differences like this to highlight. Let me now run through the key points in our guidance assumptions and the puts and takes for 2021. First for the items that are changing, we now expect a benefit of $110 million from price for the year, up from our prior guidance of a $90 million benefit. The new $110 million price guidance reflects the additional yield we are capturing from our first two price increases this year. In addition, we announced a third price increase for up to 8% that is effective September 1 for most of our businesses. This will yield a price benefit on top of the $110 million we are currently guiding for full year price this year. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a $10 million benefit, up from neutral of our previous assumption, and we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 20% on an adjusted basis for the full year compared to the previous guidance of approximately 21%. Free cash flow is now targeted to be approximately $400 million for the full year, up from prior guidance of approximately $375 million on stronger earnings performance in the first half and our current outlook. We are raising stock repurchase guidance for the year from $400 million, which we completed in the first half, to $600 million. For the headwinds from prior guidance, commodities are now expected to be a headwind of $80 million, up from our prior guidance of $55 million. With inflation and components, we are reducing our net savings from sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions to a $5 million benefit, down from prior guidance of a $15 million benefit. The higher material costs from inflationary pressures in 2021 are leading to a LIFO accounting adjustment of approximately $15 million this year. Factory productivity is now expected to be a $10 million benefit, down from a $20 million benefit in our prior guidance, and we are now planning for corporate expenses to be $100 million, up from $95 million in our prior guidance primarily due to higher incentive compensation. Now for the guidance items that remain the same, we still expect residential mix to be a $10 million benefit. With 30 new Lennox stores planned for this year, our distribution investments are up from last year to a more traditional run rate level. Freight is still expected to be a $5 million headwind and tariffs are expected to be a $5 million headwind. We are planning on SG&A to be up approximately 7% for the year, or a headwind of approximately $45 million, and within SG&A we are making investments in R&D and IT for continued innovation and leadership in products, controls, ecommerce, and factory automation and productivity. Now for a few other final guidance points, we still expect net interest and pension expense to be approximately $35 million. We still expect capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million this year, about $30 million of which is for the third plant at our campus in Mexico. We expect construction to be completed by the end of 2021 and to have the plant fully operational by mid-2022, and we expect nearly $10 million in annual savings from the third plant. Finally, we still expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between 37 million to 38 million shares. With that, let\u2019s now go to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with Keybanc. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: Hey, good morning everyone. Todd, first of all, congrats - it\u2019s been a good 15 years together.\nTodd Bluedorn: I agree.\nJeff Hammond: Just on price, it seems like the numbers you gave for 2Q are kind of low, just given the higher yields, and I just wanted to understand how you expect price to flow into the second half, particularly on commercial.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, I think you\u2019re pulling on the right thread. It steps up. One, the second price increase in residential has a bigger bite in the second half of the year than the first half of the year, just sort of the timing of things, but for commercial and refrigeration, we got some price in second quarter but we\u2019ll get significantly more second half of the year. Then as we talked about in the script, there\u2019s a third price increase that\u2019s announced September 1 - that won\u2019t have much impact on commercial and refrigeration just given the lead times, but it will have a material impact for residential and that\u2019s not currently in the guide. We\u2019re still framing exactly what that will look like and we\u2019ll update it on after the third quarter call. \nJeff Hammond: Okay, and then your inventory levels look a little bit low for the season and the demand. Just talk about your ability to keep up with demand and where you frame inventory levels here as you go into this second half.\nTodd Bluedorn: We\u2019ve been transparent about this from the beginning - I think the entire industry is facing challenges. I think all corporate America is facing challenges with integrated circuits, with steel, with lots of things that we\u2019re buying, but when we talk to our customers and our suppliers, the one thing that we\u2019re confident on, and we see our own share position, so we know we\u2019re gaining share, we\u2019re doing as well or better than anyone in the industry. Look - we\u2019d like to have more inventory right now, so you see that in the numbers and that\u2019s clear, we\u2019d like to have more product; and if we did, we\u2019d probably sell more.\nJeff Hammond: Okay, thanks a lot, Todd.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: Hey, thanks. First off, Todd, you mentioned the resi replacement cycle spinning faster and you gave us some nice data points. Can you just speak to how much this will increase HVAC demand annually, and what I\u2019m trying to do is just trying to judge how impactful these changes are.\nTodd Bluedorn: Well, I think the most important metric that I gave is if you think the unit life goes from, on average, 15 to 12, so in other words the curve I always show shifts to the left by three years, what that does is it all doesn\u2019t come into the market in one year but in essence, what you\u2019re doing is creating all this demand that spreads out, I think over a multi-year period, and I haven\u2019t specifically called it out because what I was trying to introduce is this very explicit point that the traditional way you guys and us--not you personally, Ryan, but the analysts have viewed it and the industry has viewed it is a very traditional boom echo analysis - when were the units put in place during the housing boom, how old are they, and how long do they last, and we\u2019re introducing some new variables that are real, we\u2019ve measured them, so when it spins and you take three years off the life, or 30% off the life or 20% off the life, then all of a sudden you\u2019re creating much more demand over a five or six-year period, is sort of our best guess of how it will play out. That\u2019s why we\u2019re real confident of what we\u2019ve been publicly saying that this mid-single-digit growth market for years and that we\u2019re not afraid of a cliff. \nRyan Merkel: Got it, okay. Makes sense.  Then second question, you raised revenues all year, but EBIT margins for the second half have come down. What explains this, if you were to rank order them? I think price-cost may be first, but just clarify that, if you would.\nTodd Bluedorn: I think it\u2019s inflationary pressures from components and commodities. I think it is the tightness of the supply chain that leads itself to productivity issues in the factories. We\u2019re running overtime and sort of mixing up shifts to be able to juggle things. Then, I think the third thing is it doesn\u2019t incorporate the third price increase yet, so I don\u2019t think we get all the way back to 30% incrementals but I think as the price increase spikes and timing of some SG&A, I think it will look better than what\u2019s out there now.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. All right, thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Hey, thank you, and congrats Todd - I know you\u2019re here for another year, but it\u2019s always been a pleasure to work with you. We\u2019re going to miss you.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks. I feel like I\u2019m Tom Sawyer at his funeral, if you\u2019ve ever read Tom Sawyer. But go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Yes, I totally get it. I was just going to ask, on the national account business, it was up quite a bit. I was wondering if you had any updates to your thoughts on how quickly commercial deferred replacement picks up, catches up.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, I stand by my current view, it\u2019s a year and a half to two years. That\u2019s what I saw after 9/11 when I was at Carrier. That\u2019s what I saw after the financial crisis that commercial buyers, national accounts, better stated, deferred planned replacement for a year or 15 months and they\u2019ve now turned it back on. They don\u2019t do it all immediately, and they don\u2019t even do it all in a year - it\u2019s 18 months to two years, so I think we have a nice tailwind in commercial.\nGautam Khanna: Okay, thank you. Then just another one on resi - last quarter, we asked about competitors and their ability to supply and if that\u2019s benefiting Lennox in terms of share pick-up. Do you have an update on that, an updated view on whether some of your--you\u2019re hearing in the channel that some of the competitors are just not able to get product and that\u2019s conferring an outsized benefit to LII?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think the answer is all the major competitors have one issue or another, because we\u2019re all the same supply chain. Trane had an issue with their Tyler factory, Goodman\u2019s had issues in Houston, so I think it\u2019s all the challenge. What unfortunately happens in this type of environment is some of the lower end brands, people like Nordyne, maybe people like Green have a little bit of advantage because they\u2019re able to pick up share they hadn\u2019t before. We\u2019re gaining share. We\u2019re quite not frankly not gaining as much share as we could if we had more product, but we\u2019re gaining share and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s one competitor. I think it depends on the marketplace, and I think what competitors are doing are protecting certain marketplaces and certain distributors, so I assume Carrier is protecting Watsco as best as they can, where some of their other distributors aren\u2019t being protected as much.\nGautam Khanna: Great, thank you. Todd, one last one. What are your current views on consolidation in the HVAC industry, the likelihood of it and what might actually drive it if there\u2019s a catalyst, because we\u2019ve been talking about it for a long time but not a whole lot\u2019s happened. Just curious if you have any views.\nTodd Bluedorn: I\u2019ll answer the question more broadly, but I\u2019ll directly narrow the question. I think there was--well, I read all the things you guys write and some of the notes we\u2019re talking about, whether my announcement had any impact on consolidation - there was somebody who suggested it might. I don\u2019t think it matters one way or another what I\u2019m doing on industry consolidation. In terms of the precondition for industry consolidation, I think it\u2019s either someone\u2019s willing to pay the Lennox premium to buy us, which I don\u2019t think they will or need to, or whatever. I think the other way would be if someone who\u2019s in the business decides to get out, and it\u2019s hard to imagine that happens when resi\u2019s going as well as it is. I\u2019ve been very adamant over the years that someone like JCI is a commercial player and isn\u2019t getting full value out of their residential business, but they feel differently and so it\u2019s up to them to make a decision, or anyone else.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks a lot, good morning. Maybe one question around the margin outlook. I just wanted to double check - are you sort of dialing in a mid-20s incremental margin for the year as a whole, so margins are down 100 BPs plus year-on-year in the back half, is that roughly the right way to think about it?\nTodd Bluedorn: I was trying to be a little cuter than that. I think if you take our guide, it\u2019s a hair lower than that, and that I was signalling that we had some additional upside versus the guide because of the price increase, that it was south of 30 but north of low 20s, so I think you\u2019re probably in the right zip code.\nJulian Mitchell: Perfect, thank you. Then just on the commercial business specifically, you had the margin headwind year-on-year in the second quarter. Just wondered, maybe some more background on what\u2019s behind that and what you think happens to those commercial margins in the back half.\nTodd Bluedorn: You know, there was a couple things that--well, three things that impacted commercial, two that have impacted all the businesses but one was sort of unique. One was just the timing of expenses - incentive comp and some SG&A expenses, of when they happened this year versus the prior year, and in a business that size you have a couple of those happen that can kind of hurt the margins. But the other maybe more important points are the things I\u2019ve spoken about, which is inflationary pressures and their inability to get price during the quarter because they have--we had a larger backlog where it was already priced out, and we\u2019ll start to get price second half of the year in a better way. Then the inefficiencies in the factories due to shortage of supply and labor shortages at our Stuttgart facility, so those are sort of all the things that led to lower margins. I expect that they\u2019ll have a better performance, or we expect they\u2019ll have a better performance for the balance of the year.\nJulian Mitchell: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. \nTodd Bluedorn: Of course, Tommy.\nTommy Moll: Todd, I wanted to start by following up on your commentary on the replacement cycle potentially bringing the asset life in three years, give or take. You referenced some run time data that you\u2019ve combed through, but I just was curious if there\u2019s any more detail you could offer there in terms of the method or any surprises you came across - it seems pretty straightforward, but anything else you could offer there would be helpful.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, I think we did it the way, Tommy, you might have thought we did, but I\u2019ll say it for others. We have eye comfort on a lot of our units, tens of thousands of units, and we have access to the run times, so we were able to go in region by region, not quite zip code by zip code but region by region, adjust for the weather, make other adjustments we thought were appropriate, and then we were able to come up with the average run time of the units on a year-over-year basis, and that was around that, say, 30%, plus or minus 30%, but right around 30%. Then I did some Kentucky windage by just saying it\u2019s probably not going to be that on an ongoing basis because we won\u2019t have as many people working from home as we did last year, so then I just said, say it\u2019s 20% instead of 30%, and that sort of felt right, at least from the world that I\u2019m living in, because we still have a lot of people working at home and we will continue to have people working at home, even when we get to the other side of this. That\u2019s where the 20% came from, and then 20% times 15 gets you three, 15 minus three gets you 12, and then I just sort of rolled into it to say the weather is 5% warmer the last three or four years than it was when we originally came up with the 15-year data point, and that 5% weather has a higher impact than just saying you reduced the life cycle by 5%. I didn\u2019t even try and quantify it, but it\u2019s sort of exponential in nature, so it\u2019s sort of somewhere between 5% and 10%, maybe closer to 10% from having 5% warmer weather, and that\u2019s sort of in the mix also. I wanted, as I\u2019m repeating myself, just to introduce the concept of very traditional way of saying, okay, how many units were installed in 2006 and we\u2019re 15 years forward, so that means it goes to zero - that\u2019s not the way to look at this, and I think we all knew that there are other variables in play because it doesn\u2019t explain what\u2019s been happening in the market for the last couple years. The bears have been predicting resi turning for a while now and they\u2019ve been wrong, and the reason they\u2019re wrong, we think, are these new variables.\nTommy Moll: Thank you Todd, that\u2019s helpful. I wanted to follow up on price. You\u2019ve pushed two increases through, you\u2019ve got another one announced for the fall. Just interested to hear you confirm, I think that you\u2019ve yet to see any kind of gamesmanship across the industry, it seems pretty consistent across the group there\u2019s no one trying to steal share with a little bit of price in this environment, and then if you think downstream just in terms of customers, has there been any pushback at all or does it feel like, at least for your Lennox brand, that your customers can pretty easily pass it along ultimately to the homeowner?\nTodd Bluedorn: Well, I think the short answer is they can absolutely pass it on right now. In fact, if we had more units, I think we could price at whatever we wanted and many people would pay. On the competitor side, Carrier announced up to 8% effective September 1, AAON 5% effective September 1, Trane 7% effective August 7, Daikin 4% to 5% effective August 1, JCI 6% to 13% effective July 19, so we\u2019re all in the pool together.  I think the other point I would make, and we\u2019re not talking about 2022 yet or 2023 yet, but I\u2019d remind everyone, and you know this, Tommy, but the way this industry works is you have this inflationary shock with commodities - and granted, this is different than anything we\u2019ve seen before, but you have inflationary shock with commodities, and then when the inflationary pressure abates, you never pass the price back, and so we\u2019re sort of roughly keeping up this year, although a little bit of lag in second quarter, the full year will be roughly in line, but then in the out years if you think cold rolled steel, which was $600 a ton 18 months ago and is now over $1800 a ton, you think it\u2019s going to pull back at some point, when that happens we won\u2019t give the price back, or if you think copper, it\u2019s closer to 3 than to 450, we don\u2019t give the price back, so there\u2019s going to be an out year, whether it\u2019s \u201922 or \u201923, where all that\u2019s going to come back to us and we\u2019ll still hang onto the price. Again, that\u2019s why I feel good about the trajectory of the business and the business model.\nTommy Moll: Thanks Todd, I\u2019ll turn it back.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nTodd Bluedorn: Why don\u2019t you go to someone else, Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNicole DeBlase: Thanks guys, good morning. Congrats to Todd.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hi Nicole, thanks.\nNicole DeBlase: I think you mentioned in the press release, there was unfavorable mix dynamics in resi. Can you just talk about that a little bit and the expectation for mix over the next quarters?\nTodd Bluedorn: You know, the biggest mix issue on resi is just that we\u2019ve been able to produce more product out of the Saltillo factory, which is more entry level product, and so as we\u2019ve been production constrained, we\u2019ve been able to get more out of Saltillo, and that\u2019s quite frankly due to the supply base in Mexico being able to stay with us longer than the supply base in the U.S. has done. That\u2019s the major reason, and then the other reason is sort of the mix of the customers and just some of the customers that we were selling to had a slightly lower mix, but overall a good quarter for resi so I wouldn\u2019t be concerned about the mix going forward. \nNicole DeBlase: Got it, thanks Todd. That\u2019s really helpful. Then I don\u2019t think you commented in the prepared remarks, but you typically do - like, order activity in commercial and refrigeration, and I\u2019d be curious how long the backlog goes out now. Are you booking into 2022?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, we\u2019re not quite booking into 2022 because if we did, we\u2019d be in big, big trouble. I mean, typically what we see in this business, in our commercial business is entering a quarter, we\u2019re about half the quarter on backlog and half we book and ship, so if we were quoting into next year, we\u2019d be like the integrated circuit guys - we\u2019d have long lead times that no one would buy from, so we don\u2019t have that yet. I didn\u2019t get into the order rates in the backlog just because they\u2019re sort of silly high numbers because of where we last year at this time, but the answer is the momentum in commercial and refrigeration remains strong, and what I said about commercial having another year and a half to two years of strength is absolutely true and to a lesser degree if it\u2019s still the same directional point as [indiscernible] refrigeration, so order rates and backlogs are extremely strong in both businesses.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it, thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Just as a reminder, if you wish to put yourself in the question queue, please press one then zero at this time.  Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Thank you. Good morning guys, and congratulations Todd.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Todd, I want to focus maybe just one question on the announcement. I know that from my vantage point, I was a little surprised, and a lot of folks that I spoke to were also surprised a little bit by the timing because there wasn\u2019t necessarily a successor in place. Anything that you can kind of tell us around what influenced your decision, whatever you\u2019re comfortable disclosing, just any thoughts around the timing would be helpful.\nTodd Bluedorn: Well, in some ways, and I don\u2019t want to offend anyone who has elderly grandparents, but it\u2019s sort of like I had a 93-year-old grandfather who died, and I was shocked that he died. What I mean by that is I\u2019ve been at LII for 15 years - that\u2019s a long time, and I\u2019m ready for a change. I think the company--in fact, I know the company, the board wanted me to stay, but in some ways I think there\u2019s a shelf life on a CEO, and 15 years may be it. My hands are firmly on the wheel and I\u2019m going to keep running the business like I do every day until the day I leave. As we mentioned in the press release, I\u2019m stepping down to create a better balance between my personal and professional life, but I\u2019m not done with my career. I like to think of myself as young-ish, if not young, and I have lots of energy and I plan to do something more entrepreneurial, maybe private equity, maybe venture capital, but something. Now, there\u2019s never a perfect time to make this kind of transition - I get that, but this is a good time to begin the transition with the strong market conditions and the company well positioned for growth and higher profitability, and now that I\u2019ve announced, the board can conduct an open search for the right person, and the year transition that I\u2019ve committed to ensures that their process is not rushed and that there will be a smooth transition.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it, that\u2019s super helpful. Thanks for that detail. I guess maybe my follow-on question, and just focused on how you guys have now characterized what the resi replacement cycle looks like, the commentary around R22 was interesting. I\u2019m curious - when you guys did your in-depth analysis, how much is left from an installed base perspective on R22? I\u2019m just trying to understand that opportunity as the potential upgrade cycle over the next few years.\nTodd Bluedorn: That\u2019s a very good question, Joe. I don\u2019t have it at my fingertips. We\u2019ll get it out publicly. I think it\u2019s in the AHRI data, but we\u2019ll pull it out. Again, those who have sort of been ingrained in this story for years may remember in 2011, there was this huge dry run--excuse me, dry charge phenomenon that had a huge impact on the year, those are all R22 condensing units that were put in place, so even past 2010 there were units being placed into the market that were R22, and again the bell-shaped curve of those units that were being put in place were 15, ignoring the heat comments and the run time comments I gave, at the old 15 midpoint the right side of that bell-shaped curve is going to get cut off because you\u2019re not even going to be able to do traditional repairs because if you lose the charge, it\u2019s prohibitively expensive. But I understand the question, Joe, and we\u2019ll get that data and put it out to you guys. \nJoe Ritchie: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we go to the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephen Volkmann: Great, I\u2019ll try this again - can you hear me?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, sure can.\nStephen Volkmann: Sorry, I don\u2019t know what happened last time. Just a couple quick follow-ups, if you will. You talked about that replacement spinning faster, Todd. Any similar thoughts or analysis you\u2019ve done on the commercial side?\nTodd Bluedorn: No, we haven\u2019t, in part because emergency replacement in commercial is 30%, 40% of the market. As important is the planned replacement, which really isn\u2019t broadly impacted by that, and then the new construction. Again, the major driver of resi is people being at home. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a negative--maybe I\u2019m not answering your question, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a negative reciprocal of that, if that\u2019s the right way of phrasing it, for commercial, at least unitary commercial. Maybe for high rise office space, but we don\u2019t play there, but retail has been running, restaurants have been running, and whether you have one person shopping or a thousand people shopping, you\u2019re still running the unit, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a negative implication to commercial.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay, great. Then I\u2019m curious about your commentary around heat and more degree days, etc. It seems like a lot of that\u2019s been focused on the northern part of the U.S. recently, where there may actually be still some penetration opportunity. Do you have any view on that?\nStephen Volkmann: I think that\u2019s true. That\u2019s not worked into our point of view, but that\u2019s, quite frankly, throwing another log on the fire. I didn\u2019t know this number, so I\u2019ll quote it from an article I read that said in the northwest, it\u2019s about 40% penetration of installed HVAC. If they have many more 100 degree summer days, I think that\u2019s going to head higher than 40%, so that\u2019s clearly an opportunity for us moving forward also.\nTodd Bluedorn: Okay, appreciate it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we go to the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Walsh: Good morning everyone.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hey John.\nJohn Walsh: Maybe just a quick one on the unitary, right - I mean, if you look at PK through 12, unitary makes up a good amount of that installed base. We talked a lot about the corporate accounts, but what are you seeing there on the education verticals, and is this stimulus we\u2019ve all been reading about, is that actually flowing through and are you seeing it?\nTodd Bluedorn: We\u2019re seeing some flow through, but it\u2019s a long--in a normal case, it\u2019s a long gestation period for schools. The decision making is slower and it\u2019s obviously more of a board decision than an individual decision. Then lay on top of that the overlay of this money coming and what\u2019s the money going to be spent on, who has decision rights on the money, it\u2019s a little slower than we would like it to be but I remain real confident that slightly less than 10% of our unitary business is K through 12, and that\u2019s going to be a growth market going forward. \nJohn Walsh: Great, then a lot of discussion around the margins, and I appreciate you guys obviously don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but Q4 on the residential business, the margin the last couple of years, you haven\u2019t seen that normal step down sequentially from Q3 to Q4. One year you had the insurance recoveries, last year was really strong. I\u2019m just curious, how are you thinking about it in your guidance that you gave us today? Are you expecting a normal step down or how do we think about that, the seasonality in the back half just within your guide?\nTodd Bluedorn: Well, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll directly answer the question, but I think the one thing to sort of weigh into any thinking is going to be we have 6% fewer days in the quarter, and so that creates headwind not only on revenue but you have--you can\u2019t absorb all the costs. You have more factory fixed costs fall to the bottom line, and so having 6% less days in the fourth quarter, everything else being equal, will have a negative impact on margins.\nJohn Walsh: Yes, okay. Makes sense. Thank you for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we go to the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Hey thanks, good morning everyone. Todd, just a couple for me. First on price, understand with things so fluid, you don\u2019t really want to dial this into your guide, but maybe just give us a little bit more color on how the market responded to the first two price increases. Obviously we\u2019ve got the number for the year now you gave us, but are you worried about it being accepted? There\u2019s some mix down that might result. Just want to understand why you actually don\u2019t want to include it in the guide, because I assume you\u2019re including the inflationary pressures in the guide. \nTodd Bluedorn: Well, I think in part we didn\u2019t--you know, I\u2019ll be very transparent. We came out early with the earnings because of my announcement and we came out with a guide, and then between that time--and we were finalizing the price increase, the third price increase, but we hadn\u2019t made a decision yet. We made a decision shortly after the announcement, we announced it, and we\u2019re going to implement it September 1. I just thought it was a little cute to have a guide two weeks ago and then change it today, so I just thought we\u2019ll just leave it where it\u2019s at, being very transparent that it\u2019s out there and that we\u2019ll touch it up end of third quarter. The first part of your question is just on the first two price increases, we had been guiding that we\u2019re going to get 90, now we\u2019re guiding that we\u2019re going to get 110, so I think that answers the question to how it\u2019s being accepted - it\u2019s being accepted and we\u2019re able to pass it on, and it\u2019s sticking. Again, the fact that our competitors have announced third price increases across the board and, quite frankly, I actually struggled at Aecon, which I shouldn\u2019t admit as a CEO, but the one thing I remembered in Aecon is if demand is high and supply is down, I think price should go up, and that\u2019s what the industry is doing. \nJeff Sprague: Absolutely. On the replacement thing, we all know we can make this seem much more realistic in an Excel spreadsheet than it is in real life for sure, but I\u2019m just wondering how much of this pull forward do you think might have already happened, right, because again if we do go back to the Excel spreadsheet, one complication we have is 12 years ago was actually the \u201909, \u201910, \u201911 trough when there weren\u2019t many units being shipped, so just wonder if you could tell from that data has this pull forward already happened, is it in progress, or do you think it\u2019s still in front of us?\nTodd Bluedorn: Well, I think it\u2019s--I don\u2019t think it\u2019s already happened, I think it\u2019s probably already started because last summer already started and the units running more has already started. But I think it\u2019s in large part in front of us, and again I\u2019m not validating all these numbers, I\u2019m just--I\u2019m validating the 30% and I\u2019m validating the 5% warmer, but sort of guessing at 20% reduction on an ongoing basis, that\u2019s just a swag, use your own number. But if it goes from 15 to 12, a 20% reduction means 20% of a full year\u2019s production sort of gets moved, and that\u2019s not happening in one year. That\u2019s not what this year is about. This year is about scarcity of demand and distributors buying a lot of units to protect themselves. I think that\u2019s what this year is about. I\u2019m a broken record on this, Jeff, as you know, but now I\u2019m putting some math around my opinion that I think we\u2019ve got multiple years of mid-single digit growth in resi.\nJeff Sprague: Great, understood. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nTodd Bluedorn: Josh, that wasn\u2019t even the same zip code as your name! Are you there, Josh?  Operator, he was so offended on how you pronounced his name, he hung up, so can you bring someone else in, please?\nOperator: He\u2019s here, thank you.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Okay, is he here? Are you there, Josh?\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Can you hear me? \nTodd Bluedorn: I can, Josh. Why don\u2019t you go ahead?\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Excellent. Yes, I think we were a few eastern bloc countries off on the pronunciation there, but I\u2019ve probably heard worse. Todd, on this whole replacement cycle stuff, you know I have as much Excel time in that as anyone [indiscernible] on that over the years, but I just wanted to make sure I\u2019m understanding this right. This is assuming, like, 20% higher home usage for [indiscernible].\nTodd Bluedorn: No, I think it will be to sort of get the full benefit of going from 15 to 12 forever, then it\u2019s 20%. There was a year where they ran 30% more - I know that as a fact, so that die is already cast. There have been four years that the weather\u2019s 5% hotter than what we built in the model - that\u2019s already cast, and then other than Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan, I think most companies are letting people stay at home as we get through the pandemic, and so decide whether people are going to work 50% flex time at home or 60\u201d% flex time at home, at Lennox it\u2019s going to be 40% flex time at home for most of our employees, so it\u2019s somewhere south of 30, greater than zero that the units are going to run more, and I think that\u2019s here to stay.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. I may you need to write me a doctor\u2019s note on that work-from-home policy.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Then on the parts side of the equation, I\u2019m sure you saw Watsco had pretty healthy growth on the equipment side as well as parts. You guys clearly have a window into that as well with PartsPlus stores. Did you see kind of proportionate growth, any observations on repair versus replace? I would imagine there\u2019s probably a bit more replacement than usual, but I don\u2019t want to make it sound like it\u2019s overloaded to one side. \nTodd Bluedorn: No, I mean, equipment grew faster than parts did for us in the quarter, but we had strong growth rates in both.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it, and then just last one, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, on the price-cost inflation, we can all sort of look at steel costs, copper and aluminum, and sort of play the hedging game, which never really ever works, so I gave up on that. But there\u2019s a lot of inflation out there that kind of falls outside of commodities, whether it\u2019s labor or logistics. How does that visibility look, like is that getting worse or better, and then how do you think your ability to kind price that into the marketplace versus other material inflation trends over time?\nTodd Bluedorn: I would think about it this way. We typically get $25 million, $30 million engineering sourcing-led cost reductions a year, and that\u2019s always a net number - that\u2019s after all the price increases we get. This year, we\u2019re calling it out at $5 million, so what you should take from that is we\u2019re having $20 million or so more price increases on components that we buy from others along with the $80 million of steel, along with the $15 million of LIFO, and all that\u2019s being offset by the $110 million of price we\u2019ve already gotten plus the third price increase that we\u2019re going to have in fourth quarter. I think we\u2019re offsetting this year, we\u2019re not offsetting it and still getting the margin percentage, but then as I said earlier, those things will turn and when they turn, we won\u2019t give the price back but all of a sudden, we\u2019ll have our engineering-led cost reductions instead of being a normal 25, 30, because all the commodity price increases that we took for motors and compressors and everything else we have, we\u2019ll get those reduced and so we\u2019ll have a year where we\u2019ll have a blowout cost reduction year plus commodities will decline, plus we\u2019ll hang onto price.  We\u2019re sort of having lower margins than normal this year, but then there will be a year or two where margin percentage will be higher than the 30% because of the things I just said.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Crystal clear, appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, good morning. \nTodd Bluedorn: Hey Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Congrats on really an epic run, great grassroots turnaround, fantastic market outgrowth, and you deserve all the credit in the world to enjoy whatever you do next, so congrats.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks, I appreciate it.\nSteve Tusa: And you\u2019re a good guy. I think you\u2019re a really good guy, but I think I kind of disagree on a lot of the numbers, and I just wanted to dig in a little bit. I was a poli-sci major, so Mark Twain and fancy macro econ stuff wasn\u2019t my suit.  How did you validate the 30% again? You said on a few thousand Lennox units that you have visibility into?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, exactly. We contract the units, so in our dealer portal when the homeowner signs up for it, we can track the run hours on units, so we\u2019re able to go in on our installed base and do it region by region, so then we can adjust for weather. It wasn\u2019t just sort of, okay, we have 20,000 units, how much did they run? We\u2019d go region by region, not quite zip code by zip code, and understand how long the units were running. I\u2019ve got detailed analysis, detailed spreadsheets, we went through it and looked at it and then we were able to say what we expected, which is people are home more, they\u2019re running the units more. Then we calibrated it and it came out a lower number, but we looked at how much energy usage went up at homes, and that\u2019s just a high level macro number, and I think for the full year it was up about 10, 15%, so that sort of said, okay, we\u2019re in the right zip code and we would expect air conditioners in the summer to run longer because people are at home. The furnaces, you\u2019re going to still sort of have it roughly at a set point in the wintertime because you don\u2019t want it to go down, so again my commentary is about air conditioners running 30% more. We feel pretty good about it.\nSteve Tusa: What was the sample size of that again?\nTodd Bluedorn: I don\u2019t know off the top of my head.\nJoseph Reitmeier: It was about 150,000, Todd.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, so a small number, only 150,000.\nSteve Tusa: And what do you think the installed base is for the industry?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think you could figure that out on your own, right, so look at an annual number, multiply times 15, that\u2019s probably the installed base.\nSteve Tusa: And then I thought you guys had said it was 16 years, but obviously there was a curve around that, but I feel like in the last couple of years of the housing echo boom discussion, that you guys--you know, it was more of a 16-year number you threw out there.\nTodd Bluedorn: I think I was rounding because there\u2019s a mean--sometimes we talk mean, sometimes we talk mode, but say it\u2019s 16, so it goes from 16 to 13.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, got it. Just on the--I think the last thing you talked about was this has been--you\u2019ve tried to figure out what\u2019s been happening in the last couple of year. I mean, when I look at your data, you guys were down kind of coming into COVID. You guys really weren\u2019t growing very much - I know that there was the \u201918 year that was kind of messed up, but the industry was, I think, down kind of heading into COVID, it was at least weak, in the low single digit range. Isn\u2019t the strength just really the last 12 months, like how are you so confident that what happened during COVID is really something that we kind of need to dig into and figure out how this has changed kind of a decade-plus long type of discussion we\u2019ve been having for the last few years?\nTodd Bluedorn: I\u2019m not a poli-sci major, I\u2019m an electrical engineer and I look at the data, and everything I know about the data tells me two things: how long you run the unit impacts how long it lasts, and how hot the weather is, because in a spike up in temperature, it\u2019s an exponential impact on how long the unit lasts. So the question that we\u2019ve been asking ourselves is there has to be an impact of people staying at home - we\u2019ve been talking about that for a year and a half, and I think it\u2019s--I think you have to take the new facts into consideration. We all are as things are changing, and so we looked at the data and the data said 150,000 units are being run longer, and that fits with all my anecdotal evidence. We talked to dealers, I talked to my family members, my own freaking home, so it makes sense they\u2019re running longer, and if they\u2019re running longer, they\u2019re going to break soon. And then I stepped back--I know JP Morgan\u2019s coming back to work, but Lennox ain\u2019t 100% and neither is Apple and neither is Dell, and neither is a lot of other companies, so it\u2019s pretty clear to me it\u2019s a phenomenon that\u2019s going to change. Now, it may change back in five years, but it\u2019s there and it\u2019s going to have an impact.\nSteve Tusa: But I guess my point is--sorry, last one on this because I think it\u2019s a really interesting discussion, obviously, it\u2019s really been only the last 12 months, so I just struggle to read into something that\u2019s happened in a pretty abnormal time period over the last 12 months, and you said, look, it\u2019s 20% or whatever it is - I mean, your average sales have been up 20% for the last 12 months, so why haven\u2019t we just experienced that and why are we making this out to be something that\u2019s been a trend for two or three years that we have to figure out?  I mean, again, I haven\u2019t really been as bearish on the market in the last three to four year, but you know, the math, you know?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think you\u2019re just stating what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m saying two things. I think the weather\u2019s been warmer over the last three or four years. I think the units over the last 18 months, because the pandemic started in March of 2020, units for the last 18 months have been running, pick your number, 20%, 30% longer, and that\u2019s going to have an impact on the life cycle of the product. Then you ask yourself, is that going to continue, and the answer is yes, so I sort of extrapolated. If we were talking about Buicks and we said the entire country moved 20% further from their workplace and we\u2019re going to put 20% more miles on the Buick, would the units break faster, we\u2019d say of course they would, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in HVAC.  Again, it\u2019s been 18 months, I\u2019m trying to get answers to what\u2019s going on, the world\u2019s changing quickly, Steve, and so we can wait another three years to come out with numbers, but I\u2019m telling you what\u2019s happening now.\nSteve Tusa: Right, right. Very, very helpful. Just one last one.  Any color on--you gave us the days impact in 4Q, any color on just high level, what you expect the industry to grow in 3Q, maybe what you\u2019re seeing so far in the first few days of July?\nTodd Bluedorn: We continue to do well. Demand is strong. On the industry call, we call this a full year, which is up low double digits, and we\u2019ll see how it plays out. I think the variable that\u2019s unaccounted for in my mind is those who are selling exclusively to independent distribution, as I\u2019ve said, are going to hit a cliff before we do, and so I don\u2019t know what they see. That will impact the industry more than what we do, because we\u2019re a little less than 20% of it. The question is what\u2019s the other 80% that are selling independent distribution do, because they\u2019re going to hit a cliff before we do. \nSteve Tusa: Great, thanks for all the color. I appreciate it, Todd. Congrats again.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019ll turn it back to the speakers for closing comments.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks Operator. To wrap up, we raised guidance for revenue, profit, free cash flow, and stock repurchases for this year. Demand remains extremely strong and the company is doing as well or better than anyone in the market. We look forward to the second half and continued strong market conditions in 2022 and beyond. Thanks everyone for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you Todd, and good morning everyone. I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, starting with residential heating and cooling. In the second quarter, revenue from residential heating and cooling was a record $838 million, up 30%. Volume was up 27%, price was up 3%, and mix was down 1%. Foreign exchange had a positive 1% impact on revenue. Residential segment profit was a record $190 million, up 49%. Segment margin expanded 290 basis points to a record 22.6%. Residential profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price, higher factory productivity, sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, freight savings, and favorable foreign exchange. Partial offsets included unfavorable mix, higher commodities, tariffs and warranty costs, distribution investments and higher SG&A, including research and development and information technology investments. Now turning to our commercial heating and cooling business, in the second quarter commercial revenue was $253 million, up 34%. Volume was up 29%, price was flat, and mix was up 4%. Foreign exchange had a positive 1% impact to revenue. Commercial segment profit was $45 million, which was up 27%. Segment margin was 17.9%, down 100 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume and favorable mix. Partial offsets included higher material, distribution, freight, tariffs and other product costs, factory inefficiencies, and higher SG&A including research and development, and information technology investments. In refrigeration, revenue was $148 million, up 37%. Volume was up 30%, price was up 2%, and mix was flat. Foreign exchange had a positive 5% impact to revenue. Refrigeration segment profit was $14 million, up 52%, and segment margin was 9.1%, which was up 90 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price and sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, and partial offsets included higher commodity, freight, and other product costs, and higher SG&A including research and development and information technology investments. Regarding special items in the second quarter, the company had net after-tax charges of $2 million that included a charge of $1 million for restructuring activities, a net charge of $3.4 million for various other items in total, and a benefit of $2.4 million for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation and other tax items.  Corporate expenses were $27 million in the second quarter compared to $19 million in the prior year quarter, primarily on higher incentive compensation. Overall, SG&A was $168 million compared to $130 million in the prior year quarter. SG&A was down as a percent of revenue to 13.5% from 13.8% in the prior year quarter. In the second quarter, cash from operations was $192 million, up from $105 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $21 million in the second quarter compared to approximately $19 million in the prior year quarter. We generated $171 million of free cash flow in the second quarter, up from approximately $87 million in the prior year quarter. The company paid $29 million in dividends in the quarter and repurchased $200 million of stock. The total debt was $1.24 billion at the end of the second quarter and we ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.7. Cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments were $47 million at the end of the second quarter.  Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I'll review our current market assumptions and our updated guidance points for 2021.  We now expect the industry to see low double-digit shipment growth in residential, commercial unitary, and refrigeration markets in North America for the full year, up from our prior assumptions of high single digit growth. This is an industry comment, including competitors who ship primarily to independent distributors, unlike our model.  As previously announced, on July 14 we raised guidance for 2021 revenue growth from 7% to 11% to a new range of 11% to 15% at constant currency. We now expect a one-point benefit from foreign exchange for revenue growth of 12% to 16% for the year at actual currency.  We raised guidance for 2021 GAAP EPS from continuing operations from $11.33 to $11.93, to a new range of $11.97 to $12.57, and we raised guidance for 2021 adjusted EPS from continuing operations from $11.40 to $12, to a new range of $12.10 to $12.70.  As we previously mentioned, the first quarter of 2021 had a 6% benefit from more days than in the prior year quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we'll have a headwind of 6% from fewer days than the prior year quarter, as Todd mentioned. For 2022, there are no days differences like this to highlight. Let me now run through the key points in our guidance assumptions and the puts and takes for 2021. First for the items that are changing, we now expect a benefit of $110 million from price for the year, up from our prior guidance of a $90 million benefit. The new $110 million price guidance reflects the additional yield we are capturing from our first two price increases this year. In addition, we announced a third price increase for up to 8% that is effective September 1 for most of our businesses. This will yield a price benefit on top of the $110 million we are currently guiding for full year price this year. Foreign exchange is now expected to be a $10 million benefit, up from neutral of our previous assumption, and we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 20% on an adjusted basis for the full year compared to the previous guidance of approximately 21%. Free cash flow is now targeted to be approximately $400 million for the full year, up from prior guidance of approximately $375 million on stronger earnings performance in the first half and our current outlook. We are raising stock repurchase guidance for the year from $400 million, which we completed in the first half, to $600 million. For the headwinds from prior guidance, commodities are now expected to be a headwind of $80 million, up from our prior guidance of $55 million. With inflation and components, we are reducing our net savings from sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions to a $5 million benefit, down from prior guidance of a $15 million benefit. The higher material costs from inflationary pressures in 2021 are leading to a LIFO accounting adjustment of approximately $15 million this year. Factory productivity is now expected to be a $10 million benefit, down from a $20 million benefit in our prior guidance, and we are now planning for corporate expenses to be $100 million, up from $95 million in our prior guidance primarily due to higher incentive compensation. Now for the guidance items that remain the same, we still expect residential mix to be a $10 million benefit. With 30 new Lennox stores planned for this year, our distribution investments are up from last year to a more traditional run rate level. Freight is still expected to be a $5 million headwind and tariffs are expected to be a $5 million headwind. We are planning on SG&A to be up approximately 7% for the year, or a headwind of approximately $45 million, and within SG&A we are making investments in R&D and IT for continued innovation and leadership in products, controls, ecommerce, and factory automation and productivity. Now for a few other final guidance points, we still expect net interest and pension expense to be approximately $35 million. We still expect capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million this year, about $30 million of which is for the third plant at our campus in Mexico. We expect construction to be completed by the end of 2021 and to have the plant fully operational by mid-2022, and we expect nearly $10 million in annual savings from the third plant. Finally, we still expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between 37 million to 38 million shares. With that, let's now go to Q&A. It was about 150,000, Todd."

            "name": "Todd Bluedorn",
            "content": "Thanks Steve. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. In the second quarter, we continued to see strong momentum on our residential business combined with continued rebound in commercial and refrigeration as the overall company set new record highs for revenue and profit. Company revenue was up 32% to a new record of $1.24 billion, at constant currency revenue was up 30%. GAAP operating income was up 59% to a record $216 million. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was up 72% to a record $4.51. Total segment profit rose 45% to a record $222 million. Total segment margin expanded 160 basis points to 17.9%, and adjusted EPS from continuing operations rose 54% to a record $4.57. Looking at the business segment highlights for the second quarter, in residential we set new highs for revenue, margin, and profit. Residential revenue was up 30% as reported and up 29% at constant currency. Segment profit rose 49% and segment margin expanded 290 basis points to 22.6%. Residential had comparable revenue growth in both replacement and new construction of approximately 30%. Lennox brand revenue was up 30% as was our allied and other brands combined.  Broad strength across residential in the second quarter. Year-over-year comparisons become tougher in the second half, actually started in June, and as we previously mentioned, the fourth quarter of 2021 will have a headwind of 6% from fewer days in the prior year quarter. Our market demand remained high entering the second half, and our residential business continues to perform as well or better than anyone in the market.  Looking beyond the second half of the year to 2022 and future years, we remain extremely bullish on the residential market as we see the residential replacement cycle spinning faster due to shorter equipment life.  We analyzed the actual run time data on air conditioners last year with many people at home due to the pandemic. Adjusted for weather, air conditioners ran 30% more during the summer season last year. This summer, we may not be getting a run time impact of 30%, but there are still a lot of people working from home and many will continue to work from home full time, or like here at Lennox on a flexible schedule a couple days a week. If the run time impact is 20%, that will reduce the medium life of an air conditioner from 15 years to around 12 years. Another factor is weather and the impact of hotter summers. Our original analysis of air conditioner lifespan for years 2005 to 2015. Since then for the years 2016 through 2020, weather as measured by average cooling degree days has been 5% hotter in the United States. For 2021, we are still in the middle of summer, but the second quarter was even hotter than last year. Where run time impacts equipment life on a linear basis, hot summers impact equipment life on an exponential basis. Another reason we are bullish on the residential replacement cycle for the coming years is that there will be more complete HVAC system sales taking place as old R22 refrigerant systems come into the replacement window. For those not familiar with the history, the EPA banned the sale and distribution of equipment using the R22 refrigerant effective January 1, 2010, and banned the production or import of the R22 refrigerant effective January 1, 2020. While R22 refrigerant is still available in the market, it's significantly more expensive than 410A. In many cases, it is cheaper to replace with a new 410A system, which is also more efficient and comes with a new warranty than to repair the old R22 system. This also accelerates the replacement cycle. We expect all these dynamics to lead to a strong residential market condition for years ahead. On top of this, Lennox and Allied will be running their proven playbooks for market share gains. Moving on to our commercial business, second quarter revenue was up 34% as reported, and 33% at constant currency. Segment profit rose 27%. Segment margin was 17.9%, down 100 basis points on the timing of expenses and factory inefficiencies. At constant currency, commercial equipment revenue was up more than 30% in the quarter. Within this, replacement revenue was up more than 40% with planned replacement up 50% and emergency replacement up more than 20%. New construction revenue was up high teens. Breaking out another way, regional and local business revenue was up more than 20%, national account equipment revenue was up more than 50%, and this market continues to rebound and benefit from the pent-up demand created last year. The team won six new national account equipment customers in the second quarter to a total nine in the first half.  On the service side, Lennox national accounts services revenue was up more than 30%. VRF revenue was up more than 25%. In refrigeration for the second quarter, revenue was up 37% as reported and 32% at constant currency. North America revenue was up more than 30%. Europe refrigeration revenue was up more than 30% at constant currency, and Europe HVAC revenue was up more than 25% at constant currency. Refrigeration segment margins expanded 90 basis points to 9.1% and segment profit rose 52%.  With the strong performance for the company overall in the second quarter and outlook for the second half, we have raised 2021 guidance. We now expect revenue growth of 12% to 16% on a reported basis or 11% to 15% at constant currency. We raised guidance for adjusted EPS from continuing operations to $12.10 to $12.70 for the year. We are raising free cash flow guidance to $400 million for the year and stock repurchase guidance to a total of $600 million for the year. Joe will talk about the specifics, but inflationary pressures continued to ratchet up this year, and we are seeing headwinds from commodities, components, LIFO adjustments, and labor. We're capturing a higher yield from our first two price increases this year and now expect $110 million of price benefit from those. In addition, we just announced a third price increase of up to 8% for most of our businesses that is effective September 1. This should yield even more price benefit than the $110 million of guidance provided today, so a third price increase is not in our current guidance. This is a special year. Demand is blistering and supply chains are tight at this level of high demand, but the company continues to execute as well or better than anyone in the industry. One thing to note in regard to our public guidance this year. We have been incrementally moving the earnings outlook up one quarter at a time, now after the first quarter and again after the second quarter, so while our guidance is our guidance, given the unique uncertainty this year, we are remaining balanced on future guidance. Lastly, as I'm sure most of you saw, the company announced on July 14 that after 15 years, I plan to step down as Chairman and CEO of Lennox International by mid-2022. There's never a perfect time for a transition like this, but with end markets strong and the company well positioned for the future with an exceptional management team, hard working and dedicated employees, and the benefit of all the strategic investments we've made in product, technology and distribution, we think it's a good time. The board has commenced a search for LII's next CEO, and I will be here over the next year to ensure a smooth transition. In the interim, managing day to day, be assured I'm in the ring punching until the final bell. Now I'll turn it over to Joe. I agree. Yes, I think you're pulling on the right thread. It steps up. One, the second price increase in residential has a bigger bite in the second half of the year than the first half of the year, just sort of the timing of things, but for commercial and refrigeration, we got some price in second quarter but we'll get significantly more second half of the year. Then as we talked about in the script, there's a third price increase that's announced September 1 - that won't have much impact on commercial and refrigeration just given the lead times, but it will have a material impact for residential and that's not currently in the guide. We're still framing exactly what that will look like and we'll update it on after the third quarter call. We've been transparent about this from the beginning - I think the entire industry is facing challenges. I think all corporate America is facing challenges with integrated circuits, with steel, with lots of things that we're buying, but when we talk to our customers and our suppliers, the one thing that we're confident on, and we see our own share position, so we know we're gaining share, we're doing as well or better than anyone in the industry. Look - we'd like to have more inventory right now, so you see that in the numbers and that's clear, we'd like to have more product; and if we did, we'd probably sell more. Thanks. Well, I think the most important metric that I gave is if you think the unit life goes from, on average, 15 to 12, so in other words the curve I always show shifts to the left by three years, what that does is it all doesn't come into the market in one year but in essence, what you're doing is creating all this demand that spreads out, I think over a multi-year period, and I haven't specifically called it out because what I was trying to introduce is this very explicit point that the traditional way you guys and us--not you personally, Ryan, but the analysts have viewed it and the industry has viewed it is a very traditional boom echo analysis - when were the units put in place during the housing boom, how old are they, and how long do they last, and we're introducing some new variables that are real, we've measured them, so when it spins and you take three years off the life, or 30% off the life or 20% off the life, then all of a sudden you're creating much more demand over a five or six-year period, is sort of our best guess of how it will play out. That's why we're real confident of what we've been publicly saying that this mid-single-digit growth market for years and that we're not afraid of a cliff. I think it's inflationary pressures from components and commodities. I think it is the tightness of the supply chain that leads itself to productivity issues in the factories. We're running overtime and sort of mixing up shifts to be able to juggle things. Then, I think the third thing is it doesn't incorporate the third price increase yet, so I don't think we get all the way back to 30% incrementals but I think as the price increase spikes and timing of some SG&A, I think it will look better than what's out there now. Thanks. I feel like I'm Tom Sawyer at his funeral, if you've ever read Tom Sawyer. But go ahead. Yes, I stand by my current view, it's a year and a half to two years. That's what I saw after 9/11 when I was at Carrier. That's what I saw after the financial crisis that commercial buyers, national accounts, better stated, deferred planned replacement for a year or 15 months and they've now turned it back on. They don't do it all immediately, and they don't even do it all in a year - it's 18 months to two years, so I think we have a nice tailwind in commercial. I think the answer is all the major competitors have one issue or another, because we're all the same supply chain. Trane had an issue with their Tyler factory, Goodman's had issues in Houston, so I think it's all the challenge. What unfortunately happens in this type of environment is some of the lower end brands, people like Nordyne, maybe people like Green have a little bit of advantage because they're able to pick up share they hadn't before. We're gaining share. We're quite not frankly not gaining as much share as we could if we had more product, but we're gaining share and I don't think it's one competitor. I think it depends on the marketplace, and I think what competitors are doing are protecting certain marketplaces and certain distributors, so I assume Carrier is protecting Watsco as best as they can, where some of their other distributors aren't being protected as much. I'll answer the question more broadly, but I'll directly narrow the question. I think there was--well, I read all the things you guys write and some of the notes we're talking about, whether my announcement had any impact on consolidation - there was somebody who suggested it might. I don't think it matters one way or another what I'm doing on industry consolidation. In terms of the precondition for industry consolidation, I think it's either someone's willing to pay the Lennox premium to buy us, which I don't think they will or need to, or whatever. I think the other way would be if someone who's in the business decides to get out, and it's hard to imagine that happens when resi's going as well as it is. I've been very adamant over the years that someone like JCI is a commercial player and isn't getting full value out of their residential business, but they feel differently and so it's up to them to make a decision, or anyone else. I was trying to be a little cuter than that. I think if you take our guide, it's a hair lower than that, and that I was signalling that we had some additional upside versus the guide because of the price increase, that it was south of 30 but north of low 20s, so I think you're probably in the right zip code. You know, there was a couple things that--well, three things that impacted commercial, two that have impacted all the businesses but one was sort of unique. One was just the timing of expenses - incentive comp and some SG&A expenses, of when they happened this year versus the prior year, and in a business that size you have a couple of those happen that can kind of hurt the margins. But the other maybe more important points are the things I've spoken about, which is inflationary pressures and their inability to get price during the quarter because they have--we had a larger backlog where it was already priced out, and we'll start to get price second half of the year in a better way. Then the inefficiencies in the factories due to shortage of supply and labor shortages at our Stuttgart facility, so those are sort of all the things that led to lower margins. I expect that they'll have a better performance, or we expect they'll have a better performance for the balance of the year. Of course, Tommy. Yes, I think we did it the way, Tommy, you might have thought we did, but I'll say it for others. We have eye comfort on a lot of our units, tens of thousands of units, and we have access to the run times, so we were able to go in region by region, not quite zip code by zip code but region by region, adjust for the weather, make other adjustments we thought were appropriate, and then we were able to come up with the average run time of the units on a year-over-year basis, and that was around that, say, 30%, plus or minus 30%, but right around 30%. Then I did some Kentucky windage by just saying it's probably not going to be that on an ongoing basis because we won't have as many people working from home as we did last year, so then I just said, say it's 20% instead of 30%, and that sort of felt right, at least from the world that I'm living in, because we still have a lot of people working at home and we will continue to have people working at home, even when we get to the other side of this. That's where the 20% came from, and then 20% times 15 gets you three, 15 minus three gets you 12, and then I just sort of rolled into it to say the weather is 5% warmer the last three or four years than it was when we originally came up with the 15-year data point, and that 5% weather has a higher impact than just saying you reduced the life cycle by 5%. I didn't even try and quantify it, but it's sort of exponential in nature, so it's sort of somewhere between 5% and 10%, maybe closer to 10% from having 5% warmer weather, and that's sort of in the mix also. I wanted, as I'm repeating myself, just to introduce the concept of very traditional way of saying, okay, how many units were installed in 2006 and we're 15 years forward, so that means it goes to zero - that's not the way to look at this, and I think we all knew that there are other variables in play because it doesn't explain what's been happening in the market for the last couple years. The bears have been predicting resi turning for a while now and they've been wrong, and the reason they're wrong, we think, are these new variables. Well, I think the short answer is they can absolutely pass it on right now. In fact, if we had more units, I think we could price at whatever we wanted and many people would pay. On the competitor side, Carrier announced up to 8% effective September 1, AAON 5% effective September 1, Trane 7% effective August 7, Daikin 4% to 5% effective August 1, JCI 6% to 13% effective July 19, so we're all in the pool together.  I think the other point I would make, and we're not talking about 2022 yet or 2023 yet, but I'd remind everyone, and you know this, Tommy, but the way this industry works is you have this inflationary shock with commodities - and granted, this is different than anything we've seen before, but you have inflationary shock with commodities, and then when the inflationary pressure abates, you never pass the price back, and so we're sort of roughly keeping up this year, although a little bit of lag in second quarter, the full year will be roughly in line, but then in the out years if you think cold rolled steel, which was $600 a ton 18 months ago and is now over $1800 a ton, you think it's going to pull back at some point, when that happens we won't give the price back, or if you think copper, it's closer to 3 than to 450, we don't give the price back, so there's going to be an out year, whether it's '22 or '23, where all that's going to come back to us and we'll still hang onto the price. Again, that's why I feel good about the trajectory of the business and the business model. Why don't you go to someone else, Operator? Hi Nicole, thanks. You know, the biggest mix issue on resi is just that we've been able to produce more product out of the Saltillo factory, which is more entry level product, and so as we've been production constrained, we've been able to get more out of Saltillo, and that's quite frankly due to the supply base in Mexico being able to stay with us longer than the supply base in the U.S. has done. That's the major reason, and then the other reason is sort of the mix of the customers and just some of the customers that we were selling to had a slightly lower mix, but overall a good quarter for resi so I wouldn't be concerned about the mix going forward. Yes, we're not quite booking into 2022 because if we did, we'd be in big, big trouble. I mean, typically what we see in this business, in our commercial business is entering a quarter, we're about half the quarter on backlog and half we book and ship, so if we were quoting into next year, we'd be like the integrated circuit guys - we'd have long lead times that no one would buy from, so we don't have that yet. I didn't get into the order rates in the backlog just because they're sort of silly high numbers because of where we last year at this time, but the answer is the momentum in commercial and refrigeration remains strong, and what I said about commercial having another year and a half to two years of strength is absolutely true and to a lesser degree if it's still the same directional point as [indiscernible] refrigeration, so order rates and backlogs are extremely strong in both businesses. Thanks Joe. Well, in some ways, and I don't want to offend anyone who has elderly grandparents, but it's sort of like I had a 93-year-old grandfather who died, and I was shocked that he died. What I mean by that is I've been at LII for 15 years - that's a long time, and I'm ready for a change. I think the company--in fact, I know the company, the board wanted me to stay, but in some ways I think there's a shelf life on a CEO, and 15 years may be it. My hands are firmly on the wheel and I'm going to keep running the business like I do every day until the day I leave. As we mentioned in the press release, I'm stepping down to create a better balance between my personal and professional life, but I'm not done with my career. I like to think of myself as young-ish, if not young, and I have lots of energy and I plan to do something more entrepreneurial, maybe private equity, maybe venture capital, but something. Now, there's never a perfect time to make this kind of transition - I get that, but this is a good time to begin the transition with the strong market conditions and the company well positioned for growth and higher profitability, and now that I've announced, the board can conduct an open search for the right person, and the year transition that I've committed to ensures that their process is not rushed and that there will be a smooth transition. That's a very good question, Joe. I don't have it at my fingertips. We'll get it out publicly. I think it's in the AHRI data, but we'll pull it out. Again, those who have sort of been ingrained in this story for years may remember in 2011, there was this huge dry run--excuse me, dry charge phenomenon that had a huge impact on the year, those are all R22 condensing units that were put in place, so even past 2010 there were units being placed into the market that were R22, and again the bell-shaped curve of those units that were being put in place were 15, ignoring the heat comments and the run time comments I gave, at the old 15 midpoint the right side of that bell-shaped curve is going to get cut off because you're not even going to be able to do traditional repairs because if you lose the charge, it's prohibitively expensive. But I understand the question, Joe, and we'll get that data and put it out to you guys. Yes, sure can. No, we haven't, in part because emergency replacement in commercial is 30%, 40% of the market. As important is the planned replacement, which really isn't broadly impacted by that, and then the new construction. Again, the major driver of resi is people being at home. I don't think there's a negative--maybe I'm not answering your question, but I don't think there's a negative reciprocal of that, if that's the right way of phrasing it, for commercial, at least unitary commercial. Maybe for high rise office space, but we don't play there, but retail has been running, restaurants have been running, and whether you have one person shopping or a thousand people shopping, you're still running the unit, so I don't think there's a negative implication to commercial. Okay, appreciate it. Thanks. Hey John. We're seeing some flow through, but it's a long--in a normal case, it's a long gestation period for schools. The decision making is slower and it's obviously more of a board decision than an individual decision. Then lay on top of that the overlay of this money coming and what's the money going to be spent on, who has decision rights on the money, it's a little slower than we would like it to be but I remain real confident that slightly less than 10% of our unitary business is K through 12, and that's going to be a growth market going forward. Well, I don't know if I'll directly answer the question, but I think the one thing to sort of weigh into any thinking is going to be we have 6% fewer days in the quarter, and so that creates headwind not only on revenue but you have--you can't absorb all the costs. You have more factory fixed costs fall to the bottom line, and so having 6% less days in the fourth quarter, everything else being equal, will have a negative impact on margins. Well, I think in part we didn't--you know, I'll be very transparent. We came out early with the earnings because of my announcement and we came out with a guide, and then between that time--and we were finalizing the price increase, the third price increase, but we hadn't made a decision yet. We made a decision shortly after the announcement, we announced it, and we're going to implement it September 1. I just thought it was a little cute to have a guide two weeks ago and then change it today, so I just thought we'll just leave it where it's at, being very transparent that it's out there and that we'll touch it up end of third quarter. The first part of your question is just on the first two price increases, we had been guiding that we're going to get 90, now we're guiding that we're going to get 110, so I think that answers the question to how it's being accepted - it's being accepted and we're able to pass it on, and it's sticking. Again, the fact that our competitors have announced third price increases across the board and, quite frankly, I actually struggled at Aecon, which I shouldn't admit as a CEO, but the one thing I remembered in Aecon is if demand is high and supply is down, I think price should go up, and that's what the industry is doing. Well, I think it's--I don't think it's already happened, I think it's probably already started because last summer already started and the units running more has already started. But I think it's in large part in front of us, and again I'm not validating all these numbers, I'm just--I'm validating the 30% and I'm validating the 5% warmer, but sort of guessing at 20% reduction on an ongoing basis, that's just a swag, use your own number. But if it goes from 15 to 12, a 20% reduction means 20% of a full year's production sort of gets moved, and that's not happening in one year. That's not what this year is about. This year is about scarcity of demand and distributors buying a lot of units to protect themselves. I think that's what this year is about. I'm a broken record on this, Jeff, as you know, but now I'm putting some math around my opinion that I think we've got multiple years of mid-single digit growth in resi. Josh, that wasn't even the same zip code as your name! Are you there, Josh?  Operator, he was so offended on how you pronounced his name, he hung up, so can you bring someone else in, please? I can, Josh. Why don't you go ahead? No, I think it will be to sort of get the full benefit of going from 15 to 12 forever, then it's 20%. There was a year where they ran 30% more - I know that as a fact, so that die is already cast. There have been four years that the weather's 5% hotter than what we built in the model - that's already cast, and then other than Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan, I think most companies are letting people stay at home as we get through the pandemic, and so decide whether people are going to work 50% flex time at home or 60\u201d% flex time at home, at Lennox it's going to be 40% flex time at home for most of our employees, so it's somewhere south of 30, greater than zero that the units are going to run more, and I think that's here to stay. Yes. No, I mean, equipment grew faster than parts did for us in the quarter, but we had strong growth rates in both. I would think about it this way. We typically get $25 million, $30 million engineering sourcing-led cost reductions a year, and that's always a net number - that's after all the price increases we get. This year, we're calling it out at $5 million, so what you should take from that is we're having $20 million or so more price increases on components that we buy from others along with the $80 million of steel, along with the $15 million of LIFO, and all that's being offset by the $110 million of price we've already gotten plus the third price increase that we're going to have in fourth quarter. I think we're offsetting this year, we're not offsetting it and still getting the margin percentage, but then as I said earlier, those things will turn and when they turn, we won't give the price back but all of a sudden, we'll have our engineering-led cost reductions instead of being a normal 25, 30, because all the commodity price increases that we took for motors and compressors and everything else we have, we'll get those reduced and so we'll have a year where we'll have a blowout cost reduction year plus commodities will decline, plus we'll hang onto price.  We're sort of having lower margins than normal this year, but then there will be a year or two where margin percentage will be higher than the 30% because of the things I just said. Hey Steve. Thanks, I appreciate it. Yes, exactly. We contract the units, so in our dealer portal when the homeowner signs up for it, we can track the run hours on units, so we're able to go in on our installed base and do it region by region, so then we can adjust for weather. It wasn't just sort of, okay, we have 20,000 units, how much did they run? We'd go region by region, not quite zip code by zip code, and understand how long the units were running. I've got detailed analysis, detailed spreadsheets, we went through it and looked at it and then we were able to say what we expected, which is people are home more, they're running the units more. Then we calibrated it and it came out a lower number, but we looked at how much energy usage went up at homes, and that's just a high level macro number, and I think for the full year it was up about 10, 15%, so that sort of said, okay, we're in the right zip code and we would expect air conditioners in the summer to run longer because people are at home. The furnaces, you're going to still sort of have it roughly at a set point in the wintertime because you don't want it to go down, so again my commentary is about air conditioners running 30% more. We feel pretty good about it. I don't know off the top of my head. Yes, so a small number, only 150,000. I think you could figure that out on your own, right, so look at an annual number, multiply times 15, that's probably the installed base. I think I was rounding because there's a mean--sometimes we talk mean, sometimes we talk mode, but say it's 16, so it goes from 16 to 13. I'm not a poli-sci major, I'm an electrical engineer and I look at the data, and everything I know about the data tells me two things: how long you run the unit impacts how long it lasts, and how hot the weather is, because in a spike up in temperature, it's an exponential impact on how long the unit lasts. So the question that we've been asking ourselves is there has to be an impact of people staying at home - we've been talking about that for a year and a half, and I think it's--I think you have to take the new facts into consideration. We all are as things are changing, and so we looked at the data and the data said 150,000 units are being run longer, and that fits with all my anecdotal evidence. We talked to dealers, I talked to my family members, my own freaking home, so it makes sense they're running longer, and if they're running longer, they're going to break soon. And then I stepped back--I know JP Morgan's coming back to work, but Lennox ain't 100% and neither is Apple and neither is Dell, and neither is a lot of other companies, so it's pretty clear to me it's a phenomenon that's going to change. Now, it may change back in five years, but it's there and it's going to have an impact. I think you're just stating what I'm saying. I'm saying two things. I think the weather's been warmer over the last three or four years. I think the units over the last 18 months, because the pandemic started in March of 2020, units for the last 18 months have been running, pick your number, 20%, 30% longer, and that's going to have an impact on the life cycle of the product. Then you ask yourself, is that going to continue, and the answer is yes, so I sort of extrapolated. If we were talking about Buicks and we said the entire country moved 20% further from their workplace and we're going to put 20% more miles on the Buick, would the units break faster, we'd say of course they would, and that's what we're seeing in HVAC.  Again, it's been 18 months, I'm trying to get answers to what's going on, the world's changing quickly, Steve, and so we can wait another three years to come out with numbers, but I'm telling you what's happening now. We continue to do well. Demand is strong. On the industry call, we call this a full year, which is up low double digits, and we'll see how it plays out. I think the variable that's unaccounted for in my mind is those who are selling exclusively to independent distribution, as I've said, are going to hit a cliff before we do, and so I don't know what they see. That will impact the industry more than what we do, because we're a little less than 20% of it. The question is what's the other 80% that are selling independent distribution do, because they're going to hit a cliff before we do. Yes, thanks. Thanks Operator. To wrap up, we raised guidance for revenue, profit, free cash flow, and stock repurchases for this year. Demand remains extremely strong and the company is doing as well or better than anyone in the market. We look forward to the second half and continued strong market conditions in 2022 and beyond. Thanks everyone for joining us."

Now, let me turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Todd Bluedorn.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks a lot, Steve. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter we continued to see strong momentum in our residential business combined with strong improvement in commercial and refrigeration, as the overall company set new first quarter highs for revenue, profit and earnings per share.  Overall for the company, revenue was up 29% to a new first quarter record of $931 million. At constant currency, revenue was up 28%. GAAP operating income was a first quarter record 114 million, up 213%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was a first quarter record $2.20, up 588%. Total segment profit rose 208% to a first quarter record of 116 million. Total segment margin expanded 720 basis points to 12.4% and adjusted EPS from continuing operations rose 305% to a first quarter record $2.27.  Looking at our business segments for the first quarter, we realized double digit revenue growth and margin expansion in all three businesses. In residential, we set new first quarter highs for revenue and profit. Residential revenue was up 37%, segment profit rose 197% and segment margin expanded 850 basis points to 15.9%. Replacement business is up more than 40% and new construction was up more than 25%. Breaking it down between our Lennox business and our Allied business, Lennox revenue was up about 25% and Allied was up about 70%, strong growth rates. Let me take a moment to unpack the strength we saw in residential in the quarter. First, with strong operational execution, our residential team is capitalizing on its ability to deliver to meet contractor and distributor demand and gain share. Post the 2018 tornado and initial 2020 pandemic impact, we are back on offense with production, distribution and executing our playbook for market share gains.  Second, residential benefited from the colder winter weather with heating degree days up 13% from the first quarter last year. You may recall we had a soft first quarter in 2020. Third, I'd like to note that we had six -- I would like to note that we had a 6% benefit to revenue for more days in the quarter this year than last year. That happens every four years as we reset the calendar.  Conversely, the fourth quarter will have a 6% headwind from fewer days in the quarter this year. This applies to residential as well as all our other businesses. Adjusting for the days, residential grew 31% with Lennox growing nearly 20% and Allied growing about 65%.  In addition for Allied, we had approximately 25 million of pull-forward in the first quarter from different distributor loading patterns this year than last year. Adjusted for both days and this pull-forward, Allied was up approximately 35% in the quarter. Working through all this math I gave adjusting for days and the pull-forward in our Allied business which sells independent distribution, overall residential segment revenue was up about 25%. We believe this compares to mid teens sell-through for the industry, driven in part by the favorable cold weather that I talked about. Our performance that is above that is due to market share gains.  As I mentioned earlier, we are back on the offense with production, distribution and executing our playbook for gaining share. The team has had strong operational execution to drive this outperformance and we are well positioned for the summer season and our largest seasonal quarters.  In commercial, revenue, segment profit and margin were all first quarter records. Revenue was up 12%. At constant currency, revenue was up 11%. Segment profit was up 47% and segment margin expanded 330 basis points at 13.8%. In the first quarter, we saw broad strength in commercial as year-over-year growth turned positive across all of our businesses.  At constant currency, commercial equipment revenue was up mid teens in the quarter. Within this, replacement revenue was up mid teens with plan replacement up mid teens and emergency replacement up high teens. New construction revenue was up high single digits.  Breaking out revenue another way, regional local business revenue was up mid teens. National account equipment revenue was also up mid teens. Our team won three new national account equipment customers in the quarter. On the service side, the next national accounts services revenue was up mid single digits. VRF revenue was up mid 30s percentage.  Some highlights to mention for commercial. Schools continue to be an area of focus for us. We have a dedicated sales force and product line that will drive a multiyear growth opportunity for us in this market. Today, K-12 schools are just a little under 10% equipment revenue for this segment. This business was up more than 20% for us in the first quarter.  And given the recent stimulus package that benefits HVAC indoor air quality spending for schools, we expect K-12 schools to be a growth vertical for us moving forward. Indoor air quality continues to be an important focus for us with our Building Better Air initiatives. Most interesting activity we're seeing are in this K-12 school segment where conversations are taking place with many customers across many industry verticals.  We have launched our new Model L Rooftop unit as we continue to lead the field in energy efficiency. The Model L features variable speed technology and an all new advanced control system. We're seeing high customer interest in this industry leading product for 2021 and beyond.  Overall for commercial entering the second quarter, momentum continues with backlog up double digits and strong order rates. In refrigeration for the first quarter, revenue was up 21%. At constant currency, revenue was up 17%. In North America, revenue was up more than 25%. Europe refrigeration revenue was up low single digits at constant currency. And Europe HVAC revenue was up mid single digits at constant currency. In refrigeration, segment margin expanded 560 basis points to 6.3% and segment profit rose to $8 million from $1 million in the prior year quarter. Like in commercial, momentum continues for refrigeration entering the second quarter, with backlog up double digits and strong order flow led by North America. With strong performance for the company overall in the first quarter and outlook for the second quarter and year, we are raising 2021 guidance. We now expect 7% to 11% revenue growth and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $11.40 to $12. We are also raising free cash flow guidance to $375 million for the full year.  We now assume about 55% of earnings in the first half of the year compared to the prior guidance of about 50%. This reflects the strong first quarter performance and second quarter outlook. We repurchased $200 million of stock in the first quarter and plan on another 200 million for a total 400 million in our guidance for the year.  Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Joe. \nJoe Reitmeier: Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, starting with residential heating and cooling. In the quarter, revenue from residential heating and cooling was a first quarter record $606 million, up 37%, volume was up 32%, price was up 1% and mix was up 4%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Residential profit was a first quarter record $96 million, up 197%.  Segment margin expanded 850 basis points to 15.9%. Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price and mix, higher factory productivity, sourcing and engineering led cost reductions, distribution and freight savings and favorable foreign exchange. Partial offsets included higher commodity, warranty and other product costs and higher SG&A.  Now turning to our commercial heating and cooling business. In the first quarter, commercial revenue was a first quarter record $199 million, up 12%, volume was up 15%, price was flat and mix was down 4%. Foreign exchange had a positive 1% impact to revenue growth.  Commercial segment profit was a first quarter record $27 million, up 47%. Segment margin was a first quarter record 13.8%, which was up 330 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, lower material costs and lower SG&A. Partial offsets included unfavorable mix.  In refrigeration, revenue was $125 million, up 21%, volume was up 15%, price was up 1% and mix was up 1%. Foreign exchange had a positive 4% impact to revenue growth. Refrigeration segment profit was $8 million in the first quarter compared to $1 million in the prior quarter. Segment margin was 6.3%, up 560 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price and mix, lower material costs and higher factory productivity. Higher SG&A was a partial offset.  Regarding special items in the first quarter, the company had net after tax charges of $2.7 million. That included a $2 million net charge for other tax items, a $1.9 million net charge in total for various other items and a $1.2 million benefit for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.  Corporate expenses were $16 million in the first quarter compared to $14 million in the prior quarter. Overall, SG&A was $145 million compared to $131 million in the prior quarter. SG&A was down as a percent of revenue to 15.6% from 18.1% in the prior quarter. In the first quarter, the company used $18 million in cash from operations compared to a usage of $99 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $24 million in the first quarter and in the prior quarter. Free cash flow was a negative $42 million in the first quarter compared to a negative $123 million in the prior quarter.  The company paid approximately $30 million in dividends in the quarter and repurchased $200 million of stock. Total debt was 1.17 billion at the end of the first quarter. And we ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.8. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $40 million at the end of the first quarter.  Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I'll review current market assumptions and our updated guidance points for 2021. We now expect the industry to see high single digit shipment growth in residential, commercial unitary and refrigeration markets in North America for the full year, up from our prior assumption of mid single digit growth in these end markets.  For the company, we are raising guidance for 2021 revenue growth from a 4% to 8% range to a new range of 7% to 11%, and we still expect foreign exchange to be neutral to revenue for the full year. We are raising guidance for 2021 GAAP EPS from continuing operations from a range of $10.55 to $11.15 to a new range of $11.33 to $11.93. And we are raising our 2021 adjusted EPS from continuing operations from $10.55 to $11.15 to a new range of $11.40 to $12.  Now, let me run through the key points in our guidance assumptions and the puts and takes for 2021. First, for the items that are changing. We have announced a second round of price increases and now expect a benefit of $90 million in price for the year, up from our prior guidance of $50 million. We now expect residential mix of $10 million, up from our prior guidance for neutral mix.  We expect a benefit of $15 million from sourcing and engineering led cost reduction actions, down from our prior guidance of $25 million. And this change reflects inflationary pressures from suppliers.  For commodities, we now expect a $55 million headwind, up from our prior guidance of $30 million. Corporate expenses are now expected to be approximately $95 million, up from prior guidance of $90 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation.  And now for the guidance items that remain the same. We still expect a $20 million benefit from factory productivity with 30 new Lennox stores planned for this year will be at a more normal run rate with distribution investments compared to last year. Freight is still expected to be a $5 million headwind and tariffs are also expected to be a $5 million headwind.  We are planning for SG&A to be up approximately 7% for the year or a headwind of about $45 million. Now within SG&A, we are making investments in R&D and our IT for continued innovation and leadership in products, controls, e-commerce and factory automation and productivity.  A few other guidance points. We still expect neutral foreign exchange. We still expect interest in pension expense to be approximately $35 million. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% on an adjusted basis for the full year.  We are still planning capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million this year, about $30 million of which is for the third plant at our campus in Mexico. We expect construction to be completed at the end of 2021 and have the plant fully operational by mid 2022. And we expect nearly 10 million in annual savings from the third plant.  Free cash flow is now targeted to be approximately $375 million for the full year, up from prior guidance of approximately $325 million on the strong earnings performance in the first quarter and our current outlook. And finally, we still expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between 37 million shares to 38 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase $400 million of stock this year.  And with that, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Hammond: Good to see you back on the offensive. Just on mix, it seems like kind of Tale of Two Cities here with res mix really good and commercial negative. Just kind of explain what was going on there and how you see that persisting going forward? I know you raised the mix guidance.\nTodd Bluedorn: For residential, it\u2019s just a positive benefit from the premium product. We're seeing traction on the new furnace line that we launched, which is our premium product now part of the ultimate comfort and we're coming out with 26-year residential units. So we feel good about the mix and we saw that in the quarter. I wouldn't read too much into commercial. That just has to do with the lumpiness of customers in the quarter. So we feel good about mix full year for commercial.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. And then it looks like the incrementals were a little bit better than kind of your run rate. Just maybe talk about what went right in the quarter and how you're thinking about -- as you look at the moving pieces of price cost, how you think about incremental into the selling season?\nTodd Bluedorn: The things we did well was we managed the factories in the face of lots of pressures on the supply chain and on labor because of COVID, managed the factories well. We executed on MCR. But there's some timing involved here obviously, Jeff, as you know. That's why you asked the question. We're getting the benefit of the price increase and we're getting benefit of lapping the SG&A cuts that we did in April of last year. But we don't have the full inflationary pressure set of commodities and components in the numbers yet. So the incrementals will soften as we go through the year, but it will still be overall for a full year basis. Nice, but they won't be as strong as they are in first quarter balance of the year.\nJeff Hammond: And where do you think price cost is the biggest challenge, like timing wise? Does that kick in, in 2Q or --?\nTodd Bluedorn: It will be second half of the year; third, fourth quarter.\nJeff Hammond: Second half of the year, okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning, Tommy.\nJoe Reitmeier: Hi, Tommy.\nTommy Moll: Todd, I wanted to start on the resi market, specifically on your comment back on offense, good to hear. So I wanted to ask what levers you've pulled in the business behind that strategy. You mentioned a couple of points, distribution among them. But what specific changes to the business or the strategy would you call out? And then as you look to the full year, just bridging from Lennox to the industry, it sounds like the outlook for units now went from mid to high singles. Should we think about Lennox is in line there, maybe outperforming or too early to tell for the full year?\nTodd Bluedorn: Well, we're certainly expecting to outperform the market. So I'll answer that question first. So we raised the market from mid to high for resi and for the other end markets. And our goal is always to gain share and we certainly have been gaining share, and we expect to do that for the full year. Now the point about being back on the offense is it seems like forever, certainly been since mid 2018, we had a tornado, then we had the pandemic. And so we\u2019ve sort of been stalled on driving new business. And we talked about coming out of the tornado in 2019 right before the pandemic hit that we had won back the dealers, we were sort of gaining their business and that's a multiyear effect. You start to get the flywheel going on new business development that really helps. We had really -- we've had strong momentum in our Allied business where there it\u2019s not signing up dealers, it\u2019s signing up distributors. And then it just continues to be the flywheel effect of investments we continue to make in digital on our e-commerce initiatives and our ability to support our dealer contractors with our control systems. And then it continues to be investments in product. Our residential dealers are excited by our new ultimate home comfort system. They're excited by our new heat pump products. And we have a full product lineup and we're making significant investments to even make it better, and we're seeing the benefits of that.\nTommy Moll: Thank you, Todd. That's all helpful. One quick follow up on the stores. It sounds like 30 is still the number for this year. Rough timing you could give us on when you think you'll execute through that plan? And just given the strength to the market at least through one quarter, any potential that number might go higher?\nTodd Bluedorn: I don't know if the number will go higher just in terms of the lead time to find the real estate to put it in place. And the majority of the stores are second half of the year. We put a handful in first quarter. We'll put some in second quarter. But it's really third and fourth quarters once we get through the summer selling season that we really start to stack up the stores.\nTommy Moll: Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll turn it back.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephen Volkmann: Great. Good morning, guys. Todd, can I just ask you to give us a little more on sort of the shift a little bit toward the first half from the second half? The 55% in the first half now, it used to be 50%. Is that all kind of Allied or distributor channels or anything in commercial that might be moving that at all?\nTodd Bluedorn: No, it's not commercial. A large part of it's the Allied reshuffling and that's sort of best expectations.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay. Thanks. And then you talked about the K-12 opportunity. It seems like that's taking off. What are you actually seeing those guys doing? Are they upsizing systems? Are they putting in just more IAQ or what exactly is driving that growth?\nTodd Bluedorn: It's replacement. So it's -- I think about it as replacement rather than new systems. But yes, they have older systems. They're now comfortable that they're going to have financing and available capital to upgrade it. So they're doing that. They're talking a lot about indoor air quality. That really isn't what moves the needle. What moves the needle is replacing the entire system, and then that has better efficiency, better ventilation, which leads to better indoor air quality.\nStephen Volkmann: Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to circle back on the earnings sort of seasonality. So I think your guidance implies at the high end around $5.40 for the second half in EPS. Last year, second half was around $1 higher. So just wondered if you could help us understand year-on-year how that dollar decline breaks out, how much is just kind of resi volume versus bigger price cost headwind firm-wide, any other -- there's a day sales impact that you mentioned. Any other factors that I didn't capture there? \nJoe Reitmeier: If I'd put them in order, I think it would be inflationary pressure commodities, it would be the days impact. And then it would be -- I understand there's lots of questions about, and rightfully so about what we're doing on full year guidance. As you know, Julian, I've been doing this for 14 years. I don't think I've ever raised guidance after the first quarter. And so we raised guidance by $0.85 for the full year after first quarter. I said I'd never ever do that. We did it. Let's get through second quarter, then we'll see \u2013 we\u2019ll have a better clear view of what we should do for the full year guidance. Obviously, our guidance is our guidance right now. But let's go through second quarter and I think we\u2019ll have a better clearer view of second half of the year.\nJulian Mitchell: Fair enough. Thank you. And maybe just to switch to commercial for a second, you mentioned the replacement activity in the education vertical just now but it was interesting to see the high single digit revenue growth in new construction in commercial in Q1. I think that\u2019s surprising for people given all the macro data on the U.S. non-resi market starts and so forth. So maybe help us understand what drove that new construction growth in the quarter, and how you see that new construction growth in commercial over the balance of the year?\nJoe Reitmeier: Again, not to get too hung up on the math of things, you make the adjustment for days, its low single digits. It's a good number. It's not quite impressive as high single digits. And then it was multiple verticals. It certainly wasn't K-12. It was some of our retail customers. But maybe the largest driver was the distribution customers, people like Amazon, building new distribution.\nJulian Mitchell: Got it. Thank you very much.\nJoe Reitmeier: Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Todd, I missed a little bit at the open, but did you also comment on kind of the margin impact of kind of the revenue pull forward and if there's any kind of distortive effects on the margins in resi, in particular?\nTodd Bluedorn: I did, but short answer there really isn't. The revenue would have dropped through on the normal margin line. So when I think about the margin expansion in residential, I would hang my hat on the pool -- I quite frankly would hang my hat on factory productivity, the SG&A cuts that we took at the end of last year, the ability to get price in the fact that commodities and inflationary pressures haven\u2019t worked their way into the numbers, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: And just thinking about the price given the inflationary pressure, it sounds like there's talk of kind of round two actions this year and some of those are out in the market I think already. But what do you see the kind of the likelihood of kind of a second bite of the apple one price and any kind of pushback in the channel on that?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think the second bite\u2019s already taken place, Jeff, right? So we announced the price increase -- a second price increase effective June 1. Trane\u2019s announced the second price increase, Daikin\u2019s announced a second price increase, Rheem\u2019s announced a second price increase, Goodman\u2019s announced a second price increase, Carrier businesses have announced a second price increase. So we've all announced second price increases. And we feel \u2013 as you know, we give price to offset commodities as recently as 2019, 2018. We got 2% of price and we're signing up for a little bit more this year, but inflationary pressures are greater this year. So we feel pretty good about the price increases.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks. I'll leave it there.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: And your next question is from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNicole DeBlase: Good morning.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning, Nicole.\nJoe Reitmeier: Hi, Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: So Todd, you kind of alluded to some challenges on the supply chain side. Could you just provide a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing and what the bottlenecks are, and I guess the level of concern as we see [indiscernible]?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. I think the highest level message I would give is, you can see from our performance in Q1, we're delivering a lot of product and we're set up to deliver a lot of product in second quarter. We think we're as good or better shape than anyone else in the industry is what we hear from our customers. The areas that we're wrestling with, and I think everyone in our industry if not corporate America is wrestling with, is integrated circuits both on our own control systems, but integrated circuits that go in components that we buy from others. Steel and resin and sort of other raw commodities are under some pressure to make sure we get them. And then as -- since the pandemic started over a year ago, sort of a hopscotch around the globe of wherever the hotspot is, then you have pressure on a supply chain that comes from there. And right now, we think that's largely behind us, because we don't source much from India. But that's sort of has been the issue that we've wrestled with when Mexico was not going well, we had issues. And when U.S. was having some problems, we're having some issues. And then I think the final piece of it and we've talked about this over the years, it went away last year, it's now back. It's just shortage of direct labor that in our factories -- in our suppliers\u2019 factories making sure we have enough workers to build this high demand is something we continue to work through. And unemployment has snapped back or employment has snapped back nicely. And I'm all for the President's policies. I'm a Democrat, but I would observe when you pay people to stay at home, they're less likely to come to work. And we continue to wrestle with that.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. Thanks, Todd. That's really helpful. And I guess just one follow up a little bit about channel inventory and how you're positioned as we move into the summer selling season, maybe how that compares to last year?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. We think we're in really good position, as you know, but I'll say it for others on the phone call, 80% of our business is Lennox residential. And there that's when the homeowner decides to buy a product, the dealer replenishes the stock. And so we sort of have direct sell-through almost to the end customer. So dealers aren\u2019t carrying inventory. I saw one sell-side analyst note that suggested maybe because of price increases, homeowners were deciding to preemptively replace their systems. Ain't no way that's happening. People aren't going to do that because of a 2% price increase. For the portion of the market that we sell independent distribution, we talked about the 25 million pull forward. And we got that number broadly speaking by talking to our distributors understanding their inventory levels, and so one way of thinking about it is inventory levels are 25 million higher than last year. At this point in time it\u2019s a pull-forward inventory.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. Thanks, Todd. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So Todd, maybe my first question just starting on just the growth outlook for the rest of the year, if I think about the second quarter if we resi for Q1, you still come up against the easiest comp in 2Q. And it sounds like the backlog trends are really good. So is there any reason why like the second quarter growth number can't be as good as you put up in Q1, again, kind of normalizing for the resi days and the inventory portfolio?\nTodd Bluedorn: We\u2019re set up to have a strong second quarter. So I hate the hypotheticals or any reason not -- yes, I come out with the reasons not, but we're set up for a strong second quarter and we obviously just need to execute.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. And then just like talking through the comments you made earlier, I think to Julian's question around the guidance, it's just too early for you guys to take up the back half guide at this point. But as you see today, things seem really good. And the 7% to 11% looks like a beatable number at this point, it looks conservative.\nTodd Bluedorn: So let's try nuances [ph]. The guide\u2019s the guide, number one. So the guide\u2019s the guide. But as I said earlier, we never raise after first quarter. We raised $0.85 cents. I\u2019ve learned many things since the tornado and the pandemic is things can change quickly. If we stay on the trend line we are in North America, because we're a North America business that we've looked the pandemic and we're back to normal economy with all the government investments in the economy. I have a nice run for a couple of years in all three of our businesses and we're prepared for that. So we feel good about 2021. Quite frankly, I feel good about 2022. But the guide\u2019s the guide is I guess the short answer.\nJoe Ritchie: Yes, I don't mean to back you in but that makes a lot of sense. I guess one last one is just thinking through the -- you mentioned the pull forward on the Allied side of the business this quarter. You think that there's any dynamics with the pricing that's going into effect in June, where you continue to see kind of stronger demand ahead of the June pricing increases?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think there may be some effects. There may be some effects, but I think it's -- distributors right now want to make sure they have enough to get through the summer selling season. And they're willing -- they're going to pay what they need to do to make that happen. So I think they will be some pull forward. But again, it's sort of the demand levels we're at. We may not have all the product when they want the product to load the barns [ph] early, they may just have the product when they need the product. And so we'll continue to work through what will happen and there may be some pull forward. But again, that's 20% of our business. I don't think it'll be a material impact to us.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. Nice quarter, guys. Thank you.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And next we\u2019ll go to John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Walsh: Hi. Good morning.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hi, John.\nJohn Walsh: I was just -- you mentioned heat pumps earlier. Just wanted to get kind of your temperature on where your capacity is for this product, and if you might be spending any CapEx to increase production of heat pumps in particular?\nTodd Bluedorn: We can always continue to manage capacity versus demand. And we make them on the same line. So when we talk about adding a third factory in Saltillo, that's adding overall capacity to heat pumps and every other product line that we do. So heat pump continues to be a growing market for us. We came out with a high -- excuse me, cold weather heat pump that allows us to play north of the Mason-Dixon line, be very competitive in northern climates and we think that's a growing market. And I would have said five years ago, we lagged the competitors in our heat pump offering. I'd say now we're on par with the big boys\u2019 carrier and training and further ahead of our other competitors. And so we like that market and we're well positioned to compete there.\nJohn Walsh: Great. And then just maybe a second question here on capital allocation, taking up the free cash flow, taking up your share repo, should we think that the majority of the excess cash goes to buy back stock or might there be anything in terms of M&A bolt-on or otherwise we should be thinking about?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, I'm not breaking any news. I would think about it and I'll say for others, I know you know this is we don't want to delever. So we'll do something with the cash. And we'll have dividends grow with earnings. And we will invest in the business. And we'll do type of M&A we've spoken about, but we've done one deal of any size since I've been here and then the balance will give back a share buyback.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you for taking the questions.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, Todd.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hi, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: So I think I've got the numbers, the underlying numbers for Allied is plus 35% ex the days and ex the $25 million. Just to be clear. The $25 million, is that the full extent of the inventory restock dynamic or is there some inventory restock within the plus 35% as well?\nTodd Bluedorn: The 25 million is our best guess at the extent to the inventory. The 35 million is ex any pre-buy.\nNigel Coe: Okay. So plus 35% is kind of an apples-for-apples, this is basically dealer market share gains, not inventory stock dynamics going on there.\nTodd Bluedorn: It is. The 35 versus say the 15 or that I said was sell-through, the difference is we're winning new distributors. And when you win new distributors, you have a big sort of wash of volume that flows through your business. So it's not necessarily winning at the dealer level, it's winning at the distributor level. We're converting dealers from our competitors. And when we convert them, we get a slug of new volume.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that\u2019s fair. And then your inventory levels, I think 502 at the end of the quarter, definitely a lot lower than what you'd normally have. And you answered Nicole\u2019s question very well on supply chain, but I'm just curious, all things being equal, is that low level of inventory, is that caused by just a surge in demand and then therefore completion of end equipments or was it some of the pricing constraints that meant you weren't able to replenish your inventory. Just curious in terms of what caused that level of inventory to be so low and your confidence in sort of rebuilding those levels?\nTodd Bluedorn: It\u2019s primarily the demand. Look, I knew we were out [ph] first quarter. I didn't think resi was going to be up 37% six months ago. And so I think that's a primary issue. And then once you see the white of their eyes, if you will, and you see the demand rising, then you try and ramp up production to catch up with it. And then when you start to ramp up production, then you run into some of the issues that I talked about, which is if you're going to try and raise production 50%, 60% to get ahead of everything, then you run into integrated circuits and you're running away, but then you run into other things. So, look, I've said we're doing as well or better than anyone in the industry. But everyone, when you have this kind of demand levels, you're sort of not grinding gears, but you're running hot. And we're running hot.\nNigel Coe: Right. Okay. Thanks, Todd.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: Hi. Thanks for fitting me in. So first off, you mentioned K-12 and the good outlook there. If everything goes well with the stimulus money, what kind of growth rates could you see from K-12 the next couple of years?\nTodd Bluedorn: I understand the question. I'll be honest with you. We haven't really modeled it in any great detail. I've seen some of the sell-side notes, including yours, sort of take cracks at it. We think it could be a material opportunity for us and I know people are modeling it externally. I just want to give the number that's about 10% of our segment revenue. And so whatever growth rate others are modeling looking at the stimulus number, 10% of our business will grow at that same speed.\nRyan Merkel: Okay, that's helpful. And then just talk about the resi new construction outlook, any signs of moderation or just full steam ahead there?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think it's full steam ahead. I think the only moderation is trades. The employment issues I spoke about, it impacts builders also. And then inflationary pressures, but I don't think inflationary pressures will slow things down right now. I think people need homes. And there's not much inventory on used or existing homes right now. And so builders are trying to build. We feel pretty good about new construction for the balance of the year.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Thanks.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: And next is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Todd, just on the mix front, I guess that number stood out to me on residential that it was plus 4, even with all that strong growth in Allied. I would imagine you have some sort of long-term model of like how much the industry should mix up or homeowners kind of buy up on features or SEER in a given year. Did we just jump like several years forward, like what's going on there? And how much ahead of where you would have been in recent years are we today on that mix dynamic?\nTodd Bluedorn: I wouldn't read too much long-term macro. And so I\u2019d tell you what I might read into it is our highest margin business as far as we had a warm winter last year, we had a cold winter this year, guess what furnace sales grew probably fast. I don't have exact numbers in front of me. But furnace sales grew strongly in the quarter and that helped the mix of business. So I think that's the biggest driver. That combined with -- we've launched some new product that's helped us. But saying that we're going to be up full year 10 million of mix, that's sort of a normal guide. I think the bigger question was, why were we guiding flat in mix for a full year in resi? And the reason we are guiding flat was because we had uncertainty of what was happening with the pandemic, and whether people are just going to buy entry level product, because they were concerned economically. That's now behind us and we feel confident for the full year.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then I guess just kind of thinking about entering the selling season here, first quarter I don't know is -- it's really indicative of much of all but we're kind of through April at this point. At what point does the industry, whether it's dealers or your independent distributors even though there's not the type of bulk of the business, at what point did they just say, okay, now we're ready? Are they still positioning inventory, thinking about what price level they want to be loaded at right now? Are they sort of saying we're ready to go for the season?\nTodd Bluedorn: And again, you know this, Josh, I\u2019ll say for others, 80% of our business we're selling to dealers. They don't think that way. They're not stocking up inventory. They're not getting ready. They see demand, they sell demand, they buy some more. And some of them may have a week to really -- well capitalized dealers may have a couple of weeks, but that's not how that works. For the independent distribution, the order rates remain strong. They still want inventory and they're still selling product right now, and demand is still high at the dealer -- excuse me at the homeowner level. And so they're coming out of a very good first quarter and they want more inventory and we're selling it to them.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it, that's helpful. I apologize, I\u2019m just going to try to squeeze in one more. The Allied color that you said where a lot of that growth is new distributors, any sense on kind of same-store growth within Allied versus the contribution from new customers there?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes, I don't have a map in front of me because I tend not to think about same stores. I know our internal people do within those businesses. I don't have that number in front of me. We're also focused on existing distributors, getting them to grow. My guess would be the existing distributors who were selling to dealers, they were buying at 15%, 20% also, if that's what the end markets were growing.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nTodd Bluedorn: Hi, Gautam. How are you?\nGautam Khanna: Doing well, thanks. Two questions. First, on the commercial side, I was wondering, Todd, if you could maybe give us some perspective on how quickly the deferred replacement from last year, with the commercial market down nearly 20%, how quickly that catches up and how much of it catches on?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. Our experience here after financial crisis, and in my experience, I was at Carrier after 9/11 is marble [ph] rolls off the table and plan replacement goes down dramatically. And sort of at the trough last year, we were down 50%, 60% year-over-year on plan replacement. And then it comes back strongly. And my experience is it's 18 to 24 months that it all comes back. And so over the next 18 to 24 months, assuming the environment remains benign, as I suggested, it might -- I would expect all the demand that we missed during that time period, the pent-up demand, if you will, to come back plus the normal plan replacement that was scheduled during the same time period. And so that's why we're pretty optimistic on the commercial end markets for next 18 to 24 months.\nGautam Khanna: Got it. In fact, that math would suggest the guidance might be a little low. I'm recognizing nobody knows. Okay. And then just secondly on resi, I was curious, did any competitors have any issues, production issues, COVID outbreaks, whatever that may have benefited Lennox's results that might be nonrecurring? We saw the Tyler roof collapse at Trane. Goodman had issues last year. Just wondering if anything stood out to you one way or the other?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. Our competitors \u2013 or better stated, Steve always gets worried when I bash competitors too much. So I actually have in my notes to say you can ask them. But I won't listen to Steve. I'll give a little bit more color. Look, our competitors had issues. When we talk to our customers, we hear about JCI having issues, we hear about Goodman still having issues. And again, I don't think about that as a one-off thing. I think it's when they aren't able to provide support, we step in and we win it, either by signing up new distributors who convert over to us in our Allied business or we win with our own dealers in the marketplace. So the competitors\u2019 dealers can't sell product, our dealers can. We win share, we win. And that's not a one-time thing. We sort of get it and we keep it and we keep moving.\nGautam Khanna: I appreciate you not sticking to the script on that. Thank you very much.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: And we have a question from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nChris Dankert: Hi. Good morning, Todd. Just thinking about R&D priorities, I guess where is the investment focus at the moment? Is it still controls and user experience? Is it efficiency? Is it footprint and noise reduction? I guess when you think about where you want to see the team\u2019s prioritizing investment, kind of any rank order there, any thoughts on the targeting of that spend?\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. I think you said some of them. I think number one is digitization of the business. We continue to make significant investments, both in product, on controls, but also significant investments in the e-commerce in the back end of the business and so significant investments. And we continue to make those investments, and that's driving the productivity in part that you see in our numbers. We continue to make investments in what I would call environmental sustainable product, and so having industry-leading energy efficiency. As we go through a refrigerant change that we're going to see over the next few years to lead the industry there and do it in the most effective and cost-effective manner to lower our greenhouse gas emissions is important. I think those are probably the two big areas, right? It's about digitization of the business and environmental sustainability of our product line. Those are the areas.\nChris Dankert: Got it. Yes, thanks so much for the color there. And again, second question, forgive me if you commented on this in the past, but thinking about the Mexico facility, will there be kind of a flexible construction to it in terms of will you have the ability to build everything from entry level on up to the Dave [ph] series there, or is it a little bit more focused?\nTodd Bluedorn: We don't quite build everything there. There are certain products that we only build in Marshalltown and some products that we only build in Orangeburg or in our Mississippi -- Grenade, Mississippi factory. But we continue to build our capabilities in Mexico; started as cooling, then went to furnace, then it was just entry level. Now it continues to be almost the full product line. So we continue to develop our capabilities in our Mexico facility.\nChris Dankert: Got it, makes sense. Just thinking about how having that ability to deflect the need was really brought to the fore just a couple of years ago. So thanks for the color. I appreciate it.\nTodd Bluedorn: Yes. And quite frankly, brought to the fore right now. I think one of the ways that we're able to battle against some of these issues around labor and/or absenteeism because of COVID is we have multiple factories that can -- that have significant overlap on what they produce, and we're able to sort of meet demands.\nChris Dankert: Absolutely.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in.\nTodd Bluedorn: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: I was just checking all the inventory in my garage. I have a bunch of different HVAC systems in my garage sitting there. I'm going to sell them for a higher price.\nTodd Bluedorn: And my guess is they're probably Trane and Carrier.\nSteve Tusa: Definitely not, JCI. So you mentioned that the Carrier businesses have gone out with price increases. Have you seen that across all their brands?\nTodd Bluedorn: What I have in front of me is we've seen it in the ICP brands.\nSteve Tusa: Okay.\nSteve Harrison: Carrier announced also, Todd.\nTodd Bluedorn: Carrier announced also? Yes. So Steve's helping me. He's in a different room for security reasons. But yes, so we've seen it in the Carrier brand also. So we've seen it in all our major competitors.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, got you. And then how do you kind of expect the kind of -- I know this is not a typical question, but obviously with what happened last year, how do you kind of expect the monthlies to play out in the second quarter?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think as you'd expect, right? So May was the nadir [ph] last year for the businesses. And so April will be up, May will be up. And I think June will be up. And again, it depends on the business, quite frankly. Residential didn't go as deep and came back relatively quickly. The commercial and refrigeration business was deep and stayed deep and didn't really start to come back until fourth quarter.\nSteve Tusa: Right. And I guess for sales in the second quarter, you mentioned the 55% EPS seasonality. Can you just maybe update us on what you expect kind of from a sales seasonality perspective on that front, whether it's resi or the total company?\nTodd Bluedorn: No. I quite frankly don't have it in front of me. I'm not going to give the revenue guide. We just want to give the EPS guide.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then just one last one. How much, I guess 2.5% of price for the total company, how much in resi should we assume a tick above that in resi, something in kind of the 3.5% range?\nTodd Bluedorn: No. I think if I was modeling, because we don't give segment price guide, I would assume 2.5% across the board. \nSteve Tusa: Okay.\nTodd Bluedorn: Resi is two-thirds of our business. So we give a guide and we don't delineate it then. I just assume resi is our guide.\nSteve Tusa: I don't think you guys have -- that's kind of like a record price number year-over-year, at least the data I have looking back 10 years, right? That's a pretty decent sized number looking back historically.\nTodd Bluedorn: We did 71 million in 2019. We did 72 million in 2018. Steve did have the number that went back I think in 2011, 2012 as a percentage because we were a lot smaller back then.\nSteve Harrison: Yes. \nTodd Bluedorn: I think we did close to 2.5%. But yes, we've done 2% as recent as twice, two years in a row. I would tell you the inflationary pressure people see and the headlines that they have on it and all our competitors are feeling is unlike anything I've seen, because it's just not in commodities. It's sort of across the board. And better stated, it's just not raw copper, steel and aluminum. It's across the board because everyone sort of has what I would call a COVID surcharge of inefficiencies that they\u2019re trying to pass on. So I feel very confident we'll pass it on. And again, the homeowner, it's opaque to them. They get a new unit once every 15 years, and half the price is labor and half is equipment. And so whether it's 2% or 2.5%, it doesn't matter. The question is, are competitors doing the same thing? And it looks like they are.\nSteve Tusa: And you're sure that there's no \u2013 you haven't heard any anecdotes about contractors not necessarily saying, hey, your price is going to go up 2% if you don't replace it today. But that they're saying last year, there were real availability concerns. The industry is extremely tight. There's a new regulation coming in a couple of years from now. You don't think any of those conversations are going on at the kitchen table?\nTodd Bluedorn: I think those conversations always take place at the kitchen table. So the way it works is there's a catastrophic failure. Compressor breaks, $3,000 to replace the compressor. The homeowner says, I'm not going to spend $6,000 for a new system. I'll just replace the compressor. You don't want to do that, and here's the seven reasons why you don't want to do that. Those are always conversations that take place. My point is, there isn't a bad -- there isn't a thermostat software issue that you go to the home and fix that and the system is working fine. You say, you should get a new system because there's a 2.5% price increase. That ain't never happening. What happens is if there's a catastrophic failure, there's a conversation. And I don't -- there's price increases every year, there's refrigerant changes, there's a minimum efficiency changes. All of that takes place year-after-year-after year. And whether it's a 2% price increase or a 2.5% price increase, doesn't change that conversation. So in '18 and '19, we had a 2% price increase. Now we have 2.5%. That doesn't tip people over to replacement units in a wholesale way than they did before. So the answer is no.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. I don't think it's the price. I would say availability is a bit more of a buzzword and a hot button issue these days than it's been in the past, but fair point.\nTodd Bluedorn: Our dealers have product. So they have it.\nSteve Tusa: Right. All right. Thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate the details as always.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks.\nOperator: And with no further questions, Mr. Bluedorn, I'll turn it back to you for any closing comments.\nTodd Bluedorn: Thanks. To wrap up, 2021 is off to a strong start and momentum continues in the second quarter. The company is executing well to capitalize on market growth and share gain opportunities and we look forward to a year of strong growth and profitability. Thanks again everyone for joining us today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter, starting with residential heating and cooling. In the quarter, revenue from residential heating and cooling was a first quarter record $606 million, up 37%, volume was up 32%, price was up 1% and mix was up 4%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Residential profit was a first quarter record $96 million, up 197%.  Segment margin expanded 850 basis points to 15.9%. Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price and mix, higher factory productivity, sourcing and engineering led cost reductions, distribution and freight savings and favorable foreign exchange. Partial offsets included higher commodity, warranty and other product costs and higher SG&A.  Now turning to our commercial heating and cooling business. In the first quarter, commercial revenue was a first quarter record $199 million, up 12%, volume was up 15%, price was flat and mix was down 4%. Foreign exchange had a positive 1% impact to revenue growth.  Commercial segment profit was a first quarter record $27 million, up 47%. Segment margin was a first quarter record 13.8%, which was up 330 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, lower material costs and lower SG&A. Partial offsets included unfavorable mix.  In refrigeration, revenue was $125 million, up 21%, volume was up 15%, price was up 1% and mix was up 1%. Foreign exchange had a positive 4% impact to revenue growth. Refrigeration segment profit was $8 million in the first quarter compared to $1 million in the prior quarter. Segment margin was 6.3%, up 560 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by higher volume, favorable price and mix, lower material costs and higher factory productivity. Higher SG&A was a partial offset.  Regarding special items in the first quarter, the company had net after tax charges of $2.7 million. That included a $2 million net charge for other tax items, a $1.9 million net charge in total for various other items and a $1.2 million benefit for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.  Corporate expenses were $16 million in the first quarter compared to $14 million in the prior quarter. Overall, SG&A was $145 million compared to $131 million in the prior quarter. SG&A was down as a percent of revenue to 15.6% from 18.1% in the prior quarter. In the first quarter, the company used $18 million in cash from operations compared to a usage of $99 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were approximately $24 million in the first quarter and in the prior quarter. Free cash flow was a negative $42 million in the first quarter compared to a negative $123 million in the prior quarter.  The company paid approximately $30 million in dividends in the quarter and repurchased $200 million of stock. Total debt was 1.17 billion at the end of the first quarter. And we ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.8. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $40 million at the end of the first quarter.  Now before I turn it over to Q&A, I'll review current market assumptions and our updated guidance points for 2021. We now expect the industry to see high single digit shipment growth in residential, commercial unitary and refrigeration markets in North America for the full year, up from our prior assumption of mid single digit growth in these end markets.  For the company, we are raising guidance for 2021 revenue growth from a 4% to 8% range to a new range of 7% to 11%, and we still expect foreign exchange to be neutral to revenue for the full year. We are raising guidance for 2021 GAAP EPS from continuing operations from a range of $10.55 to $11.15 to a new range of $11.33 to $11.93. And we are raising our 2021 adjusted EPS from continuing operations from $10.55 to $11.15 to a new range of $11.40 to $12.  Now, let me run through the key points in our guidance assumptions and the puts and takes for 2021. First, for the items that are changing. We have announced a second round of price increases and now expect a benefit of $90 million in price for the year, up from our prior guidance of $50 million. We now expect residential mix of $10 million, up from our prior guidance for neutral mix.  We expect a benefit of $15 million from sourcing and engineering led cost reduction actions, down from our prior guidance of $25 million. And this change reflects inflationary pressures from suppliers.  For commodities, we now expect a $55 million headwind, up from our prior guidance of $30 million. Corporate expenses are now expected to be approximately $95 million, up from prior guidance of $90 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation.  And now for the guidance items that remain the same. We still expect a $20 million benefit from factory productivity with 30 new Lennox stores planned for this year will be at a more normal run rate with distribution investments compared to last year. Freight is still expected to be a $5 million headwind and tariffs are also expected to be a $5 million headwind.  We are planning for SG&A to be up approximately 7% for the year or a headwind of about $45 million. Now within SG&A, we are making investments in R&D and our IT for continued innovation and leadership in products, controls, e-commerce and factory automation and productivity.  A few other guidance points. We still expect neutral foreign exchange. We still expect interest in pension expense to be approximately $35 million. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% on an adjusted basis for the full year.  We are still planning capital expenditures to be approximately $135 million this year, about $30 million of which is for the third plant at our campus in Mexico. We expect construction to be completed at the end of 2021 and have the plant fully operational by mid 2022. And we expect nearly 10 million in annual savings from the third plant.  Free cash flow is now targeted to be approximately $375 million for the full year, up from prior guidance of approximately $325 million on the strong earnings performance in the first quarter and our current outlook. And finally, we still expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between 37 million shares to 38 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase $400 million of stock this year.  And with that, let's go to Q&A. Hi, Tommy. If I'd put them in order, I think it would be inflationary pressure commodities, it would be the days impact. And then it would be -- I understand there's lots of questions about, and rightfully so about what we're doing on full year guidance. As you know, Julian, I've been doing this for 14 years. I don't think I've ever raised guidance after the first quarter. And so we raised guidance by $0.85 for the full year after first quarter. I said I'd never ever do that. We did it. Let's get through second quarter, then we'll see \u2013 we'll have a better clear view of what we should do for the full year guidance. Obviously, our guidance is our guidance right now. But let's go through second quarter and I think we'll have a better clearer view of second half of the year. Again, not to get too hung up on the math of things, you make the adjustment for days, its low single digits. It's a good number. It's not quite impressive as high single digits. And then it was multiple verticals. It certainly wasn't K-12. It was some of our retail customers. But maybe the largest driver was the distribution customers, people like Amazon, building new distribution. Thanks. Hi, Nicole."

            "name": "Todd Bluedorn",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Steve. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. In the first quarter we continued to see strong momentum in our residential business combined with strong improvement in commercial and refrigeration, as the overall company set new first quarter highs for revenue, profit and earnings per share.  Overall for the company, revenue was up 29% to a new first quarter record of $931 million. At constant currency, revenue was up 28%. GAAP operating income was a first quarter record 114 million, up 213%. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was a first quarter record $2.20, up 588%. Total segment profit rose 208% to a first quarter record of 116 million. Total segment margin expanded 720 basis points to 12.4% and adjusted EPS from continuing operations rose 305% to a first quarter record $2.27.  Looking at our business segments for the first quarter, we realized double digit revenue growth and margin expansion in all three businesses. In residential, we set new first quarter highs for revenue and profit. Residential revenue was up 37%, segment profit rose 197% and segment margin expanded 850 basis points to 15.9%. Replacement business is up more than 40% and new construction was up more than 25%. Breaking it down between our Lennox business and our Allied business, Lennox revenue was up about 25% and Allied was up about 70%, strong growth rates. Let me take a moment to unpack the strength we saw in residential in the quarter. First, with strong operational execution, our residential team is capitalizing on its ability to deliver to meet contractor and distributor demand and gain share. Post the 2018 tornado and initial 2020 pandemic impact, we are back on offense with production, distribution and executing our playbook for market share gains.  Second, residential benefited from the colder winter weather with heating degree days up 13% from the first quarter last year. You may recall we had a soft first quarter in 2020. Third, I'd like to note that we had six -- I would like to note that we had a 6% benefit to revenue for more days in the quarter this year than last year. That happens every four years as we reset the calendar.  Conversely, the fourth quarter will have a 6% headwind from fewer days in the quarter this year. This applies to residential as well as all our other businesses. Adjusting for the days, residential grew 31% with Lennox growing nearly 20% and Allied growing about 65%.  In addition for Allied, we had approximately 25 million of pull-forward in the first quarter from different distributor loading patterns this year than last year. Adjusted for both days and this pull-forward, Allied was up approximately 35% in the quarter. Working through all this math I gave adjusting for days and the pull-forward in our Allied business which sells independent distribution, overall residential segment revenue was up about 25%. We believe this compares to mid teens sell-through for the industry, driven in part by the favorable cold weather that I talked about. Our performance that is above that is due to market share gains.  As I mentioned earlier, we are back on the offense with production, distribution and executing our playbook for gaining share. The team has had strong operational execution to drive this outperformance and we are well positioned for the summer season and our largest seasonal quarters.  In commercial, revenue, segment profit and margin were all first quarter records. Revenue was up 12%. At constant currency, revenue was up 11%. Segment profit was up 47% and segment margin expanded 330 basis points at 13.8%. In the first quarter, we saw broad strength in commercial as year-over-year growth turned positive across all of our businesses.  At constant currency, commercial equipment revenue was up mid teens in the quarter. Within this, replacement revenue was up mid teens with plan replacement up mid teens and emergency replacement up high teens. New construction revenue was up high single digits.  Breaking out revenue another way, regional local business revenue was up mid teens. National account equipment revenue was also up mid teens. Our team won three new national account equipment customers in the quarter. On the service side, the next national accounts services revenue was up mid single digits. VRF revenue was up mid 30s percentage.  Some highlights to mention for commercial. Schools continue to be an area of focus for us. We have a dedicated sales force and product line that will drive a multiyear growth opportunity for us in this market. Today, K-12 schools are just a little under 10% equipment revenue for this segment. This business was up more than 20% for us in the first quarter.  And given the recent stimulus package that benefits HVAC indoor air quality spending for schools, we expect K-12 schools to be a growth vertical for us moving forward. Indoor air quality continues to be an important focus for us with our Building Better Air initiatives. Most interesting activity we're seeing are in this K-12 school segment where conversations are taking place with many customers across many industry verticals.  We have launched our new Model L Rooftop unit as we continue to lead the field in energy efficiency. The Model L features variable speed technology and an all new advanced control system. We're seeing high customer interest in this industry leading product for 2021 and beyond.  Overall for commercial entering the second quarter, momentum continues with backlog up double digits and strong order rates. In refrigeration for the first quarter, revenue was up 21%. At constant currency, revenue was up 17%. In North America, revenue was up more than 25%. Europe refrigeration revenue was up low single digits at constant currency. And Europe HVAC revenue was up mid single digits at constant currency. In refrigeration, segment margin expanded 560 basis points to 6.3% and segment profit rose to $8 million from $1 million in the prior year quarter. Like in commercial, momentum continues for refrigeration entering the second quarter, with backlog up double digits and strong order flow led by North America. With strong performance for the company overall in the first quarter and outlook for the second quarter and year, we are raising 2021 guidance. We now expect 7% to 11% revenue growth and adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $11.40 to $12. We are also raising free cash flow guidance to $375 million for the full year.  We now assume about 55% of earnings in the first half of the year compared to the prior guidance of about 50%. This reflects the strong first quarter performance and second quarter outlook. We repurchased $200 million of stock in the first quarter and plan on another 200 million for a total 400 million in our guidance for the year.  Now I'll turn it over to Joe. Hi, Jeff. For residential, it's just a positive benefit from the premium product. We're seeing traction on the new furnace line that we launched, which is our premium product now part of the ultimate comfort and we're coming out with 26-year residential units. So we feel good about the mix and we saw that in the quarter. I wouldn't read too much into commercial. That just has to do with the lumpiness of customers in the quarter. So we feel good about mix full year for commercial. The things we did well was we managed the factories in the face of lots of pressures on the supply chain and on labor because of COVID, managed the factories well. We executed on MCR. But there's some timing involved here obviously, Jeff, as you know. That's why you asked the question. We're getting the benefit of the price increase and we're getting benefit of lapping the SG&A cuts that we did in April of last year. But we don't have the full inflationary pressure set of commodities and components in the numbers yet. So the incrementals will soften as we go through the year, but it will still be overall for a full year basis. Nice, but they won't be as strong as they are in first quarter balance of the year. It will be second half of the year; third, fourth quarter. Good morning, Tommy. Well, we're certainly expecting to outperform the market. So I'll answer that question first. So we raised the market from mid to high for resi and for the other end markets. And our goal is always to gain share and we certainly have been gaining share, and we expect to do that for the full year. Now the point about being back on the offense is it seems like forever, certainly been since mid 2018, we had a tornado, then we had the pandemic. And so we've sort of been stalled on driving new business. And we talked about coming out of the tornado in 2019 right before the pandemic hit that we had won back the dealers, we were sort of gaining their business and that's a multiyear effect. You start to get the flywheel going on new business development that really helps. We had really -- we've had strong momentum in our Allied business where there it's not signing up dealers, it's signing up distributors. And then it just continues to be the flywheel effect of investments we continue to make in digital on our e-commerce initiatives and our ability to support our dealer contractors with our control systems. And then it continues to be investments in product. Our residential dealers are excited by our new ultimate home comfort system. They're excited by our new heat pump products. And we have a full product lineup and we're making significant investments to even make it better, and we're seeing the benefits of that. I don't know if the number will go higher just in terms of the lead time to find the real estate to put it in place. And the majority of the stores are second half of the year. We put a handful in first quarter. We'll put some in second quarter. But it's really third and fourth quarters once we get through the summer selling season that we really start to stack up the stores. Thanks. No, it's not commercial. A large part of it's the Allied reshuffling and that's sort of best expectations. It's replacement. So it's -- I think about it as replacement rather than new systems. But yes, they have older systems. They're now comfortable that they're going to have financing and available capital to upgrade it. So they're doing that. They're talking a lot about indoor air quality. That really isn't what moves the needle. What moves the needle is replacing the entire system, and then that has better efficiency, better ventilation, which leads to better indoor air quality. Thanks. Hi, Jeff. I did, but short answer there really isn't. The revenue would have dropped through on the normal margin line. So when I think about the margin expansion in residential, I would hang my hat on the pool -- I quite frankly would hang my hat on factory productivity, the SG&A cuts that we took at the end of last year, the ability to get price in the fact that commodities and inflationary pressures haven't worked their way into the numbers, Jeff. I think the second bite's already taken place, Jeff, right? So we announced the price increase -- a second price increase effective June 1. Trane's announced the second price increase, Daikin's announced a second price increase, Rheem's announced a second price increase, Goodman's announced a second price increase, Carrier businesses have announced a second price increase. So we've all announced second price increases. And we feel \u2013 as you know, we give price to offset commodities as recently as 2019, 2018. We got 2% of price and we're signing up for a little bit more this year, but inflationary pressures are greater this year. So we feel pretty good about the price increases. Thanks. Good morning, Nicole. Yes. I think the highest level message I would give is, you can see from our performance in Q1, we're delivering a lot of product and we're set up to deliver a lot of product in second quarter. We think we're as good or better shape than anyone else in the industry is what we hear from our customers. The areas that we're wrestling with, and I think everyone in our industry if not corporate America is wrestling with, is integrated circuits both on our own control systems, but integrated circuits that go in components that we buy from others. Steel and resin and sort of other raw commodities are under some pressure to make sure we get them. And then as -- since the pandemic started over a year ago, sort of a hopscotch around the globe of wherever the hotspot is, then you have pressure on a supply chain that comes from there. And right now, we think that's largely behind us, because we don't source much from India. But that's sort of has been the issue that we've wrestled with when Mexico was not going well, we had issues. And when U.S. was having some problems, we're having some issues. And then I think the final piece of it and we've talked about this over the years, it went away last year, it's now back. It's just shortage of direct labor that in our factories -- in our suppliers' factories making sure we have enough workers to build this high demand is something we continue to work through. And unemployment has snapped back or employment has snapped back nicely. And I'm all for the President's policies. I'm a Democrat, but I would observe when you pay people to stay at home, they're less likely to come to work. And we continue to wrestle with that. Yes. We think we're in really good position, as you know, but I'll say it for others on the phone call, 80% of our business is Lennox residential. And there that's when the homeowner decides to buy a product, the dealer replenishes the stock. And so we sort of have direct sell-through almost to the end customer. So dealers aren't carrying inventory. I saw one sell-side analyst note that suggested maybe because of price increases, homeowners were deciding to preemptively replace their systems. Ain't no way that's happening. People aren't going to do that because of a 2% price increase. For the portion of the market that we sell independent distribution, we talked about the 25 million pull forward. And we got that number broadly speaking by talking to our distributors understanding their inventory levels, and so one way of thinking about it is inventory levels are 25 million higher than last year. At this point in time it's a pull-forward inventory. Thanks. Good morning, Joe. We're set up to have a strong second quarter. So I hate the hypotheticals or any reason not -- yes, I come out with the reasons not, but we're set up for a strong second quarter and we obviously just need to execute. So let's try nuances [ph]. The guide's the guide, number one. So the guide's the guide. But as I said earlier, we never raise after first quarter. We raised $0.85 cents. I've learned many things since the tornado and the pandemic is things can change quickly. If we stay on the trend line we are in North America, because we're a North America business that we've looked the pandemic and we're back to normal economy with all the government investments in the economy. I have a nice run for a couple of years in all three of our businesses and we're prepared for that. So we feel good about 2021. Quite frankly, I feel good about 2022. But the guide's the guide is I guess the short answer. I think there may be some effects. There may be some effects, but I think it's -- distributors right now want to make sure they have enough to get through the summer selling season. And they're willing -- they're going to pay what they need to do to make that happen. So I think they will be some pull forward. But again, it's sort of the demand levels we're at. We may not have all the product when they want the product to load the barns [ph] early, they may just have the product when they need the product. And so we'll continue to work through what will happen and there may be some pull forward. But again, that's 20% of our business. I don't think it'll be a material impact to us. Thanks. Hi, John. We can always continue to manage capacity versus demand. And we make them on the same line. So when we talk about adding a third factory in Saltillo, that's adding overall capacity to heat pumps and every other product line that we do. So heat pump continues to be a growing market for us. We came out with a high -- excuse me, cold weather heat pump that allows us to play north of the Mason-Dixon line, be very competitive in northern climates and we think that's a growing market. And I would have said five years ago, we lagged the competitors in our heat pump offering. I'd say now we're on par with the big boys' carrier and training and further ahead of our other competitors. And so we like that market and we're well positioned to compete there. Yes, I'm not breaking any news. I would think about it and I'll say for others, I know you know this is we don't want to delever. So we'll do something with the cash. And we'll have dividends grow with earnings. And we will invest in the business. And we'll do type of M&A we've spoken about, but we've done one deal of any size since I've been here and then the balance will give back a share buyback. Thanks. Hi, Nigel. The 25 million is our best guess at the extent to the inventory. The 35 million is ex any pre-buy. It is. The 35 versus say the 15 or that I said was sell-through, the difference is we're winning new distributors. And when you win new distributors, you have a big sort of wash of volume that flows through your business. So it's not necessarily winning at the dealer level, it's winning at the distributor level. We're converting dealers from our competitors. And when we convert them, we get a slug of new volume. It's primarily the demand. Look, I knew we were out [ph] first quarter. I didn't think resi was going to be up 37% six months ago. And so I think that's a primary issue. And then once you see the white of their eyes, if you will, and you see the demand rising, then you try and ramp up production to catch up with it. And then when you start to ramp up production, then you run into some of the issues that I talked about, which is if you're going to try and raise production 50%, 60% to get ahead of everything, then you run into integrated circuits and you're running away, but then you run into other things. So, look, I've said we're doing as well or better than anyone in the industry. But everyone, when you have this kind of demand levels, you're sort of not grinding gears, but you're running hot. And we're running hot. Thanks. I understand the question. I'll be honest with you. We haven't really modeled it in any great detail. I've seen some of the sell-side notes, including yours, sort of take cracks at it. We think it could be a material opportunity for us and I know people are modeling it externally. I just want to give the number that's about 10% of our segment revenue. And so whatever growth rate others are modeling looking at the stimulus number, 10% of our business will grow at that same speed. I think it's full steam ahead. I think the only moderation is trades. The employment issues I spoke about, it impacts builders also. And then inflationary pressures, but I don't think inflationary pressures will slow things down right now. I think people need homes. And there's not much inventory on used or existing homes right now. And so builders are trying to build. We feel pretty good about new construction for the balance of the year. Thanks. Good morning, Josh. I wouldn't read too much long-term macro. And so I'd tell you what I might read into it is our highest margin business as far as we had a warm winter last year, we had a cold winter this year, guess what furnace sales grew probably fast. I don't have exact numbers in front of me. But furnace sales grew strongly in the quarter and that helped the mix of business. So I think that's the biggest driver. That combined with -- we've launched some new product that's helped us. But saying that we're going to be up full year 10 million of mix, that's sort of a normal guide. I think the bigger question was, why were we guiding flat in mix for a full year in resi? And the reason we are guiding flat was because we had uncertainty of what was happening with the pandemic, and whether people are just going to buy entry level product, because they were concerned economically. That's now behind us and we feel confident for the full year. And again, you know this, Josh, I'll say for others, 80% of our business we're selling to dealers. They don't think that way. They're not stocking up inventory. They're not getting ready. They see demand, they sell demand, they buy some more. And some of them may have a week to really -- well capitalized dealers may have a couple of weeks, but that's not how that works. For the independent distribution, the order rates remain strong. They still want inventory and they're still selling product right now, and demand is still high at the dealer -- excuse me at the homeowner level. And so they're coming out of a very good first quarter and they want more inventory and we're selling it to them. Yes, I don't have a map in front of me because I tend not to think about same stores. I know our internal people do within those businesses. I don't have that number in front of me. We're also focused on existing distributors, getting them to grow. My guess would be the existing distributors who were selling to dealers, they were buying at 15%, 20% also, if that's what the end markets were growing. Thanks. Hi, Gautam. How are you? Yes. Our experience here after financial crisis, and in my experience, I was at Carrier after 9/11 is marble [ph] rolls off the table and plan replacement goes down dramatically. And sort of at the trough last year, we were down 50%, 60% year-over-year on plan replacement. And then it comes back strongly. And my experience is it's 18 to 24 months that it all comes back. And so over the next 18 to 24 months, assuming the environment remains benign, as I suggested, it might -- I would expect all the demand that we missed during that time period, the pent-up demand, if you will, to come back plus the normal plan replacement that was scheduled during the same time period. And so that's why we're pretty optimistic on the commercial end markets for next 18 to 24 months. Yes. Our competitors \u2013 or better stated, Steve always gets worried when I bash competitors too much. So I actually have in my notes to say you can ask them. But I won't listen to Steve. I'll give a little bit more color. Look, our competitors had issues. When we talk to our customers, we hear about JCI having issues, we hear about Goodman still having issues. And again, I don't think about that as a one-off thing. I think it's when they aren't able to provide support, we step in and we win it, either by signing up new distributors who convert over to us in our Allied business or we win with our own dealers in the marketplace. So the competitors' dealers can't sell product, our dealers can. We win share, we win. And that's not a one-time thing. We sort of get it and we keep it and we keep moving. Thanks. Yes. I think you said some of them. I think number one is digitization of the business. We continue to make significant investments, both in product, on controls, but also significant investments in the e-commerce in the back end of the business and so significant investments. And we continue to make those investments, and that's driving the productivity in part that you see in our numbers. We continue to make investments in what I would call environmental sustainable product, and so having industry-leading energy efficiency. As we go through a refrigerant change that we're going to see over the next few years to lead the industry there and do it in the most effective and cost-effective manner to lower our greenhouse gas emissions is important. I think those are probably the two big areas, right? It's about digitization of the business and environmental sustainability of our product line. Those are the areas. We don't quite build everything there. There are certain products that we only build in Marshalltown and some products that we only build in Orangeburg or in our Mississippi -- Grenade, Mississippi factory. But we continue to build our capabilities in Mexico; started as cooling, then went to furnace, then it was just entry level. Now it continues to be almost the full product line. So we continue to develop our capabilities in our Mexico facility. Yes. And quite frankly, brought to the fore right now. I think one of the ways that we're able to battle against some of these issues around labor and/or absenteeism because of COVID is we have multiple factories that can -- that have significant overlap on what they produce, and we're able to sort of meet demands. Thanks. Good morning, Steve. And my guess is they're probably Trane and Carrier. What I have in front of me is we've seen it in the ICP brands. Carrier announced also? Yes. So Steve's helping me. He's in a different room for security reasons. But yes, so we've seen it in the Carrier brand also. So we've seen it in all our major competitors. I think as you'd expect, right? So May was the nadir [ph] last year for the businesses. And so April will be up, May will be up. And I think June will be up. And again, it depends on the business, quite frankly. Residential didn't go as deep and came back relatively quickly. The commercial and refrigeration business was deep and stayed deep and didn't really start to come back until fourth quarter. No. I quite frankly don't have it in front of me. I'm not going to give the revenue guide. We just want to give the EPS guide. No. I think if I was modeling, because we don't give segment price guide, I would assume 2.5% across the board. Resi is two-thirds of our business. So we give a guide and we don't delineate it then. I just assume resi is our guide. We did 71 million in 2019. We did 72 million in 2018. Steve did have the number that went back I think in 2011, 2012 as a percentage because we were a lot smaller back then. I think we did close to 2.5%. But yes, we've done 2% as recent as twice, two years in a row. I would tell you the inflationary pressure people see and the headlines that they have on it and all our competitors are feeling is unlike anything I've seen, because it's just not in commodities. It's sort of across the board. And better stated, it's just not raw copper, steel and aluminum. It's across the board because everyone sort of has what I would call a COVID surcharge of inefficiencies that they're trying to pass on. So I feel very confident we'll pass it on. And again, the homeowner, it's opaque to them. They get a new unit once every 15 years, and half the price is labor and half is equipment. And so whether it's 2% or 2.5%, it doesn't matter. The question is, are competitors doing the same thing? And it looks like they are. I think those conversations always take place at the kitchen table. So the way it works is there's a catastrophic failure. Compressor breaks, $3,000 to replace the compressor. The homeowner says, I'm not going to spend $6,000 for a new system. I'll just replace the compressor. You don't want to do that, and here's the seven reasons why you don't want to do that. Those are always conversations that take place. My point is, there isn't a bad -- there isn't a thermostat software issue that you go to the home and fix that and the system is working fine. You say, you should get a new system because there's a 2.5% price increase. That ain't never happening. What happens is if there's a catastrophic failure, there's a conversation. And I don't -- there's price increases every year, there's refrigerant changes, there's a minimum efficiency changes. All of that takes place year-after-year-after year. And whether it's a 2% price increase or a 2.5% price increase, doesn't change that conversation. So in '18 and '19, we had a 2% price increase. Now we have 2.5%. That doesn't tip people over to replacement units in a wholesale way than they did before. So the answer is no. Our dealers have product. So they have it. Thanks. Thanks. To wrap up, 2021 is off to a strong start and momentum continues in the second quarter. The company is executing well to capitalize on market growth and share gain opportunities and we look forward to a year of strong growth and profitability. Thanks again everyone for joining us today."

All lines are currently in a listen only mode, and there will be a question and answer session at the end of the presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Alok Maskara, CEO. Alok, please go ahead.\nAlok Maskara: Thank you, Ashley. Good morning, and welcome. I hope everyone is having a good start to 2023. It was nice to meet many of you face-to-face during the Investor Day on December 14th. Thanks for attending and sharing your feedback. Turning to Slide 2, a reminder that during today's call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as outlined on this page. Please refer to our SEC filings available on our Web site for additional details. Before we begin, I want to express my gratitude and appreciation to all of our employees who enabled us to deliver record financial results in 2022. Last year, our dedicated employees improved our customer experience while facing significant supply chain disruptions. This enabled us to reestablish our cadence of gaining residential market share. I want to take this opportunity to also thank our dealers and customers for their loyalty to Lennox. We will continue to improve our service levels while maintaining the best HVACR products and solution in North America so that we can continue gaining share in the future. Now please turn to Slide 3 where I want to highlight four key messages. First, we are proud to report solid fourth quarter results that capped off another record year for Lennox. Q4 revenues of $1.1 billion and full year revenues of $4.7 billion were both up 13% year-over-year. Strong price execution and continued volume growth enabled us to set new records for both quarterly and full year revenues. Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $2.63 and full year EPS of $14.07 both grew 12%, establishing a new record of full year EPS. Second, we successfully transitioned our product portfolio to meet the new minimum regional efficiency regulation that went into effect on January 1, 2023. We believe that our superior design and solid execution has put us in a strong position to win share during and after the transition. Third, we ended the year with fully replenished finished goods inventory levels to support our customers through the SEER transition. In addition, we are also carrying higher level of raw material safety stock to mitigate the impact of ongoing supply chain disruptions. Given this, our 2022 free cash flow was $203 million, which was below our expectations. We are undertaking countermeasures to improve our cash flow forecasting and remain committed to converting 90% to 100% of our net income into free cash over the long term. Fourth, our 2023 full year outlook remains unchanged, and we still expect revenue growth of 0% to 4% and an EPS range of $14.25 to $15.25. Now please turn to Slide 4 to discuss business updates as a follow-up to our dialogue during the Investor Day. In terms of end market update, as we approach February, our order rates remain consistent with our prior expectations. While we are noticing signs of a slowdown, we remain confident in our dealer networks' ability to continue driving both replacement and new construction sales, especially as equipment lead times normalize. We do anticipate some channel destocking in our two step distribution businesses like Allied Air, ADP and Heatcraft. We are maintaining solid communication with our distribution partners to effectively manage channel inventory levels. In addition to successful execution during the SEER transition, we are pleased to report that we remain on track to transition our portfolio to comply with the upcoming 2025 low GWP regulation. In terms of order updates on our innovation road map, we recently launched our next generation thermostat controller, the Lennox S40, which has built-in indoor air quality monitoring capabilities and improved connectivity to further improve the experience of our customers and our dealers. We also continue to make progress on accelerating our heat pump growth, and we're a proud recipient of the good design award for our Dave Lennox signature series collection heat pump. Switching gears. As part of our commercial recovery effort, the construction of our new commercial factory in Saltillo has started and will be complete by the end of 2024. Lastly, on this page, the formal process for divesting our European assets has started and our internal segment consolidation is complete. We expect to close the European divestiture sometime this year. With that, let me hand the call over to Joe, who will provide you a more detailed view of our financial performance.\nJoe Reitmeier: Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. Looking at the quarter for Lennox overall, the company posted strong revenue and profit growth. Revenue was a record $1.1 billion, up 13% as reported and up 14% at constant currency, with the growth driven by volume and price. Total segment profit increased $30 million or 30% versus prior year as pricing gains more than offset cost inflation, and all three segments contributed to profit growth. Total segment margin was 12.1%, up 150 basis points as price gains outpaced cost inflation and Commercial margins improved due to higher factory output. GAAP EPS of $2.65 was up 17% and adjusted EPS rose 12% to $2.63. Regarding special items, the company had an $800,000 adjustment for the fourth quarter and $6.6 million for the full year. Corporate expenses were $34 million in the fourth quarter and $91 million for the full year. Overall, SG&A was $155 million in the fourth quarter or 14.2% of revenue, down from 15.7% in the prior year quarter. And for the full year, SG&A was $627 million or 13.3% of revenue, down from 14.3% in the prior year. Our full year 2022 income tax rate was 19.3%, which was up from the 17.2% last year, the result of higher tax benefits from share based compensation and the finalization of our prior year tax obligations with taxing authorities. For 2022, the company generated cash from operations of $302 million compared to $516 million in the prior year. The reduction in cash flow was primarily due to inventory cost inflation and investments to both minimize supply chain disruptions and prepare for the minimum efficiency regulatory change that took effect January 1, 2023. Capital expenditures were approximately $101 million for the full year compared to $107 million in the prior year. Free cash flow was $203 million for the year compared to $410 million in the prior year. In 2022, the company paid approximately $142 million in dividends and repurchased $300 million of the company's stock. Total debt was $1.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and we ended the year with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.1. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments were $61 million at the end of the year. Moving to the business segments, starting on Slide 6. Our Residential segment delivered record fourth quarter revenue and profit. Residential revenue grew 13% to $703 million, vwolume was up 5%, price and mix were up 9% and foreign exchange had a negative 1% impact. Residential segment profit rose 8% to $119 million. Segment margin contracted 90 basis points to 16.9%, primarily due to incremental costs associated with supply chain disruptions and the factory changeover for the new 2023 minimum efficiency standard products. For the full year, Residential segment revenue was a record $3.2 billion, up 15%. Volume was up 4%, price was up 11% and product mix was flat for the full year. For the full year, Residential profit was a record $597 million, up 10%. Segment margin was 18.7%, down 80 basis points, primarily the result of supply chain challenges, which drove manufacturing inefficiencies and unfavorable product mix with reduced production output for higher end products. Now turning to Slide 7 and our Commercial business. Revenue was $241 million in the quarter, which was up 19%. Commercial price and mix was up 17%. Volume was up 3%, and foreign exchange had an unfavorable 1% impact. Commercial segment profit was up 79%, and segment margin expanded 390 basis points to 11.6%. Commercial demand and backlog remains solid, and our Arkansas factory recovery is progressing well. Staffing in the plant is at our desired levels with productivity progressing and production output increasing. For the full year, Commercial revenue was $901 million, up 4%. Price and mix were up 13% and volume was down 9%. For the full year, segment profit was $81 million, down 27%. Segment margin was 9%, down 380 basis points. Looking at our Refrigeration business on Slide 8. Revenue was $150 million for the fourth quarter, up 5% as reported and up 10% at constant currency. Price and mix were up 21%, volume down 11% and foreign exchange had a negative 5% impact. Revenue growth was led by our North American business with price and mix, which was up more than 20%. Europe revenue was up 9% as reported and up 22% at constant currency. Overall, the Refrigeration segment profit rose 42% to $19 million and segment margin expanded 330 basis points to 12.5%. Refrigeration demand, order rates and backlog remain strong. For the full year, Refrigeration revenue was $619 million, up 12%. Volume was up 3%, price and mix was up 14% and foreign exchange had an unfavorable 5% impact. Segment profit was $79 million, which was up 60% and segment profit was 12.7%, up 380 basis points. Turning to Slide 9 for a free cash flow update. Free cash flow was $203 million and was impacted by inventory replenishment to get our distribution network back to effective levels to serve our customers, along with inventory investment to buffer the supply chain to support demand for the new minimum efficiency standards that became effective January 1st. As we look to 2023 and free cash flow, we expect cash from operations to increase as we work to optimize inventory levels while we prepare for the next regulatory change to take effect in 2025 for the new low GWP refrigerants and minimize supply chain disruptions. Our capital expenditures in 2023 will be approximately $250 million and includes investments for a second commercial factory and investments necessary to prepare us for the 2025 refrigerant change. Free cash flow in 2023 is planned within a range of $250 million to $350 million, including increased capital spending to support regulatory change and growth initiatives, including factory capacity. Free cash flow in 2023 is planned within a range of $250 million to $350 million, including increased capital spending to support regulatory and growth initiatives, including factory capacity. Now turning to Slide 10. Let's review our 2023 full year guidance. Our outlook collectively for the end markets we serve remains unchanged. We expect revenue to be flat to up 4% for the year. There is no change to our EPS guidance of $14.25 to $15.25 that we shared with you during our Analyst Day. Free cash flow is targeted within the range of $250 million to $350 million, as I mentioned. And we are planning capital expenditures of $250 million that includes the necessary investments in a second factory, as I mentioned, and investments related to the refrigerant transition that take effect in 2025. Price benefit, including price associated with the 2023 SEER transition is now expected to be within a range of $150 million to $175 million. Now turning to the cost side of the equation. We expect net material cost to be a $35 million headwind in 2023. That material cost headwind is driven by component cost inflation of $100 million, net of $30 million in savings from sourcing and engineering initiatives, along with a $35 million commodity cost benefit. Corporate expenses are still targeted at $80 million. We will manage SG&A tightly while continuing to make the necessary investments in the businesses to support growth initiatives and to drive productivity. And finally, we expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between 35 million to 36 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase $100 million to $200 million of the company's stock this year. With that, let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll hand it back over to Alok.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks, Joe. Summarizing our financial results and providing an update on the assumptions behind our 2023 fiscal guidance. Please turn to Slide 11 for the key success factors for Lennox this year that are summarized on this page. While we have little control over the industry unit shipments in 2023 that are still expected to decline year-over-year. Given that, we are focusing our effort on the three controllable factors to grow our revenues and expand our margins. First, to offset inflation, we are maintaining and expanding our pricing initiatives. We have already implemented price increases for 2023 and are confident in our ability to offset cost inflation with pricing. Second, on the heel of a strong Q4 performance, we continue to maintain focus on commercial profit recovery. As Joe mentioned earlier, staffing levels are stable and the Stuttgart plant has switched over to the 2023 SEER standards while simplifying our product portfolio. Our new commercial product lineup provides greater value to our customers and we intend to share part of that value through pricing and contract negotiations. Third, Lennox is now well positioned to start gaining share again. As you may recall, our service levels suffered after the Marshalltown tornado in 2018 and we were unable to fully restore the service levels during the COVID years. Now, the Marshalltown reconstruction is complete, our finished good inventory levels have been replenished, Saltillo continues to add capacity, and our commercial lead times are approaching competitive levels. The improved service levels, along with recently introduced new products, put us in a strong position to relaunch our share gain programs. Even during a period of economic uncertainty, our confidence in executing on the three controllable key success factors makes us cautiously optimistic for 2023. Again, I want to thank our employees who are working hard to sustain and improve our customer service levels. Now please turn to Slide 12 for some final thoughts before Q&A. I would like to close our prepared remarks by summarizing why I believe LII is an attractive investment opportunity. Lennox is narrowly focused leader in energy efficient, environmentally friendly climate controlled solutions. We operate in high growth end markets with strong replacement demand that provides us with resiliency even during periods of economic uncertainty. The company has a unique direct to dealer network, which creates a sustainable competitive advantage. And finally, we have a history of robust execution with disciplined capital allocation. Thank you for listening. Joe and I will be happy to take your questions. Ashley, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. We'll go next to Gautam Khanna with Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: It's Gautam here. I was just curious if you could elaborate on your opening remarks about seeing some channel or seeing some pressure on volumes. Just if you could talk about the Allied versus the Lennox brand, if you're seeing -- what you're seeing in terms of destocking, if any? And how -- maybe you think it's just maybe an early read on Q1 based on what you're seeing on resi.\nAlok Maskara: So I guess, first of all, as you know, majority of our sales are direct to dealers. And we highlighted Allied, ADP and Heatcraft as the three business units that do go through two step distribution model. Each of them are in a different cycle stage on distributor inventory levels. For something like Heatcraft, we saw some destocking already occur and we might be back to more normal levels. For Allied and ADP, as we talk to our channel partners, we believe there's some destocking that's going to occur this year, which frankly puts our Lennox brand in a strong position. That all is baked into our guidance as we look at 0% to 4% revenue growth. While we don't give quarterly guidance, Gautam, as you know, I mean, so far, I mean, as we said, the Q1 order rates are consistent with our expectations. And I don't see anything falling off a cliff or so, but we do see gradual slowdown that we have talked about in the past.\nGautam Khanna: And then if you could just comment on the recovery on the high end product, Lennox products. Sort of where are we in that journey, and do you expect to be a full participant in the summer selling season with that product line that was impacted last year?\nAlok Maskara: Yes, Gautam, now since Marshalltown tornado, this would be the year, 2023, we have all the inventory levels needed to launch our programs, to recapture our position on the high end, especially as we look at some of the new products like the Dave Lennox Signature series heat pumps and the new higher efficiency furnaces. So we feel good going into the year to be able to capture our fair share of market and higher than growth in 2022 on the higher end products.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: So I was a little bit late joining the call. So I just wondered, could you give any color in terms of the order activity in 1Q? I'm guessing not, but if it did, it'd be helpful to hear that. But just my broader question is, how has the SEER transition from a market perspective and obviously, asset, how has that gone versus expectations and has it caused any sort of air pocket post the year end?\nGautam Khanna: So we didn't give any numbers on Q1 but we did talk about that January order rates were consistent with our expectations and outlook. So no change, it went as we expected. On the SEER change, overall, I think it went fine for the industry. The industry has gotten used to these changes. You know we think our design has got the winning formula in terms of -- we talked about in the last call, we don't need to change some of the indoor units. We can only change the outdoor unit. So we think we did quite well and we'll wait for some of the industry numbers to compare our share. But in general, I think the industry is used to it. I think us and majority of other industry players had a seamless SEER transition. Some of the smaller players may have had hiccups. But overall, I think it went as good or better than expected for the industry.\nNigel Coe: And then my follow-on is on inventories. You built inventory into 4Q versus 3Q, quite unusual from a [seasonal] perspective. But I'm curious, was that planned or were there some issues that caused that build?\nAlok Maskara: I think the inventory build was very planned. We wanted to make sure of two things. One is that we have sufficient high end products in stock, even though that's not selling until the summer season given the challenges we had. Second is given the SEER change, we wanted to make sure that we have sufficient inventory of the new SEER product as we went into the new year. So I think that was planned. I think where we fell short, honestly, was more appropriate forecasting and where we landed up on some of the raw material side where I think our supply chains normalize, we should have opportunity to convert more of that inventory into cash. So [Indiscernible] at this stage been complete with inventory build.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Alok, can we just maybe just talk about the Commercial business for a second? It sounded like pretty positive comments on the hiring front. I guess just where does production stand relative to normal levels? And then maybe just talk about how you're seeing that business from a share gain perspective. It sounds like you're starting to recover some gains or recovering some share that you may have lost previously.\nAlok Maskara: So first of all, we are pleased with the recovery in Commercial and remain committed to $100 million EBIT improvement in Commercial over the planning period. We had a strong Q4, as you saw from numbers slightly better than expected, and that was kind of the prime driver of why we came to the higher end of our guidance. The recovery was driven by very stable levels of staffing. I mean at this stage, we're hiring as much as we are losing and that's kind of back to normal levels. I think the team has done a good job making sure that the output has come back up compared to the lows of the year, but we are still not back to normal. I would say we are probably still about 20% below normal on factory output where we could get there just with this factory even before the next factory comes online. So we remain pleased with the efforts in Q4. Q1, that's going to go through SEER transition. And obviously, that's something we are very excited about given the change in product lineup. So net-net, excited about the new Commercial segment. We will continue delivering and focusing. And even as we take a step into '24, '25, the new factory will give us more productivity, more capacity. And the last question you have is, yes, we did lose share in Commercial despite all the things I said earlier. Most of that was earlier in the year. Towards the end of the year, we started recovering shares and we did a little better. And we think that trend will continue because the industry lead times remain extended and ours are now getting to very competitive levels within the industry.\nJoe Reitmeier: And just to elaborate a little bit on what Alok mentioned, where we lost share was in the emergency replacement segment of the market. And as productivity and output improves, it'll enable us to replenish our distribution channels with that stockable product and then you should really see the share gain gain traction. Once again, we're able to reengage in the emergency replacement side of the market.\nJoe Ritchie: I guess my one follow-up question. Residential volumes are continuing to stay positive, I know that you're expecting a decline in the year, and I know that you don't give quarterly guidance. But I guess just based on what you see with inventory levels today, I mean, are you expecting things to turn negative at the start of the year? Is that something that maybe happens later on in the year? I'm just -- any color that you can give on like the seasonality as we progress through 2023 would be helpful.\nAlok Maskara: First of all, there\u2019s significant uncertainty remains and at some stage, your guess is going to be as good as ours. January met expectations. Because majority of our business is dealer direct, the impact of channel destocking would be minimal. But for the industry, I do saw it happening more in the first half versus the second half. So I think the industry will see some decline in sales to distributors that distributors pull back orders, just to get the inventory rightsized. I think the seasonality, as we typically expect as in the summer seasonality, still remains. So I would say, yes, there's going to be some channel destocking impact in the industry in the first half. It's going to impact us less. But beyond that, it's going to be watching all the numbers that you would watch, consumer confidence, interest rates, new home starts and see where we come up. Because the new home starts that fell in second half of 2022 will have an impact in 2023 at those come up for completion, because our new home business did well in Q4 that's lower margin, as you know. But going into '23, we expect that to slow down for sure.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tusa Steve with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: So just on the Allied side, what was the growth rate, the difference between Allied and your -- the Lennox brands in the fourth quarter?\nAlok Maskara: I don't have it in front of me, and I think it was pretty consistent\u2026\nJoe Reitmeier: I'll be honest with you, Steve, I don't think it was radically different than what we saw in the direct to dealer business because we had a [really solid] and we had a record year in our Allied business, they did a tremendous job. They gained more than 100 basis points of share, along with our Lennox business. So it was a pretty good quarter for both businesses.\nSteve Tusa: So when you kind of roll forward into the first half, and you talk about some destocking, what kind of split would you expect here in the -- how is it trending in January? And then what kind of split would you expect as this destock cycle move into the first half?\nAlok Maskara: Yes, in the Allied business, we would expect a slower start because, as Joe said, I mean, they had a good year. I mean in Q4, they grew very well, Lennox grew well as well. Allied grew faster than Lennox in Q4. And as we take this forward, I would expect 20% of our business, which is on through two step distribution to have a slower start to the year versus the rest of our business, which is dealer direct.\nSteve Tusa: Can you just provide a little bit of color on that? So is it like -- is it a 10% difference, at 20%? I mean there's there's just a lot of moving parts here, so it'd be helpful to figure out just roughly what kind of split you would expect there between -- effectively between sell through and sell in we're asking for the industry, if you even want to put it that way.\nAlok Maskara: I think that's a fair question and we are wondering the same questions in that. I mean, 30 days in, we haven't noticed a huge difference between the two. So like time will tell. Some of it also comes down to how distributors are thinking of the year and what kind of signals and tea leaves they are reading about demand this year. But sometimes when these air pockets come in, in the two step model, they last a few weeks. We haven't started experiencing that yet. We're just prepared to experience that. Unfortunately, we don't have any numbers. And your guess is going to be as good as mine, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: And then one last one. What was the actual, like -- just what were the inefficiencies from this year changeover, what exactly was that?\nAlok Maskara: Quite a bit, I mean when we -- so I guess get three different areas, right? First is in our factories, we had to turn over different lines, which means there was work stoppage at different lines at different times. We did that on a rotating basis. But clearly, there was labor inefficiency and underutilization as we went through that. Second, we had to air freight and look at some prebuy of components at elevated prices just to make sure we met all the deadlines and pull that together. And I think finally, within our own distribution network, we have to spend extra because we had to manage old SEER, new SEER, different freights, move it around. So I mean those would be the three different things that we looked at, right, is just air freight and component costs, factory and efficiency and then additional distribution cost.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: I wanted to check on the Commercial business, not so much the sort of internal self help initiatives. We can see that clear green light on Slide 11 for that, but more just on the sort of the market as you see it. Classically, there was a lag, but a relationship from Residential trends to light Commercial unitary, just wondered how you see that dynamic playing out this time, if you have seen any more kind of choppiness in project activity or so forth amidst higher interest rates and weaker housing starts activity.\nAlok Maskara: So Julian, you're right. Historically, there has been a lag with the correlation. If there is one this time, I think it's going to be extended because the industry has such long lead times, and there's still a pent-up demand because of number of replacements that were converted into repair over the past few years. So if a unit broke, historically, they could have replaced it, but they chose to repair it. So when we talk to our larger customers, we don't notice any change in their replacement plans, their spend plan, their capital. Now that could change. But so far, we haven't noticed that. We see a lot of customers still talking about 2025 and how they plan to significantly upgrade their facilities and HVAC system with the low GWP refrigerants to meet their carbon footprint goals and get better ESG values out of it. So we have not noticed anything in the short term. The lead times are still anything from 24 to 52 weeks. And then we start hitting 2025, which we do expect a lot of the key accounts to start ordering more and planning for 2025 replacement. But we're watching it closely, the same data that you would look at, Julian, from -- everything from ABI to other indexes. But so far, it's more lead time and supply constrained, not demand constrained.\nJulian Mitchell: And then just looking at Slide 10, you laid out some of those moving pieces below the top line around the net material cost inflation. So I noticed, I think the components headwind that you expect went up a bit from what you'd said in December, any more color around that? And when you're looking at that net material cost inflation of sort of minus $35 million, what are the latest thoughts on how that headwind is weighted sort of first half versus second half? Are you getting a good tailwind in the back half or it's closer to flat?\nAlok Maskara: We get some tailwind in the back half. I mean, it's right now heavily weighted but at the same time, we haven't locked in the commodities for the second half yet. So some variability still exist in that. The component piece is higher and we wanted to be upfront. It\u2019s higher than what we thought. But some of the items such as compressors, variable speed motor, given the supply constraints that everybody is facing, I think vendors have decided to charge higher, and we clearly had to play a part in that. So yes, the component costs are higher and that just puts more onus to get pricing. That's why you see pricing, we increase our range and talk about 1.50 to 1.75 versus just a flat number of 1.50. So different moving pieces. We'll remain committed to offsetting material costs with pricing and keep doing our best to bring components down. And if commodities ease in the second half, the number could get better.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.\nJeff Hammond: So really just want to dig in a little bit more on kind of share gain momentum. One, on the Commercial, I think you said you're kind of getting back into that emergency replacement. I'm just wondering, one, how easy it is to kind of gain back share and kind of gain dealer distributor trust? And then on the Residential side, I think you mentioned like you're -- for the first time in a while, you're positioned for share gain. Just maybe elaborate a little bit around, is it just kind of having everything together organizationally and with the plants or is it, hey, you think you got better products, better availability, et cetera?\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes, I think on the emergency replacement side, Jeff, I think it's very difficult to distinguish. Where you compete there is on availability and price and we've got the distribution network, we've got the people who sell it. In 2022, we're just short of product. So it's a matter of once again, I'm just replenishing those distribution channels such that we have the product available, and we feel we're back in the game on emergency replacement and we expect that to happen over the course of 2023.\nAlok Maskara: And if I could just answer the Residential piece, Jeff. We have been constrained in '18 on the appropriate product mix, the appropriate inventory. And we are excited about the new leadership there. We're excited about being back with fully stocked warehouses. We are -- I think put some specific efforts around sales excellence. I mean all of those efforts are coming to fruition. So historically, as we go back through regulatory transitions, we do always win more share because at least we believe that our products are superior and our current design is going to lead us to greater benefits. So I think that's what gives us confidence on the Residential side.\nJeff Hammond: And then I don't know if I missed this. But any kind of update on the noncore divestiture and when you think that might be complete?\nJoe Reitmeier: Jeff, we just kicked off a process literally this week, the teasers went out. So we're waiting for, once again, the NDAs to flow in and engagement to take place with potential suitors. We should have more news for you on the first quarter call, but we're out of the gate with the process. And we're excited about what lies in front of us with the portfolio of businesses that we have in 2023.\nOperator: There are no further questions, and this concludes Lennox fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. The earnings release with GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, today's presentation slides and the webcast link for today's call are available on our Web site at www.lennoxinternational.com.

            "name": "Alok Maskara",
            "content": "Thank you, Ashley. Good morning, and welcome. I hope everyone is having a good start to 2023. It was nice to meet many of you face-to-face during the Investor Day on December 14th. Thanks for attending and sharing your feedback. Turning to Slide 2, a reminder that during today's call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as outlined on this page. Please refer to our SEC filings available on our Web site for additional details. Before we begin, I want to express my gratitude and appreciation to all of our employees who enabled us to deliver record financial results in 2022. Last year, our dedicated employees improved our customer experience while facing significant supply chain disruptions. This enabled us to reestablish our cadence of gaining residential market share. I want to take this opportunity to also thank our dealers and customers for their loyalty to Lennox. We will continue to improve our service levels while maintaining the best HVACR products and solution in North America so that we can continue gaining share in the future. Now please turn to Slide 3 where I want to highlight four key messages. First, we are proud to report solid fourth quarter results that capped off another record year for Lennox. Q4 revenues of $1.1 billion and full year revenues of $4.7 billion were both up 13% year-over-year. Strong price execution and continued volume growth enabled us to set new records for both quarterly and full year revenues. Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $2.63 and full year EPS of $14.07 both grew 12%, establishing a new record of full year EPS. Second, we successfully transitioned our product portfolio to meet the new minimum regional efficiency regulation that went into effect on January 1, 2023. We believe that our superior design and solid execution has put us in a strong position to win share during and after the transition. Third, we ended the year with fully replenished finished goods inventory levels to support our customers through the SEER transition. In addition, we are also carrying higher level of raw material safety stock to mitigate the impact of ongoing supply chain disruptions. Given this, our 2022 free cash flow was $203 million, which was below our expectations. We are undertaking countermeasures to improve our cash flow forecasting and remain committed to converting 90% to 100% of our net income into free cash over the long term. Fourth, our 2023 full year outlook remains unchanged, and we still expect revenue growth of 0% to 4% and an EPS range of $14.25 to $15.25. Now please turn to Slide 4 to discuss business updates as a follow-up to our dialogue during the Investor Day. In terms of end market update, as we approach February, our order rates remain consistent with our prior expectations. While we are noticing signs of a slowdown, we remain confident in our dealer networks' ability to continue driving both replacement and new construction sales, especially as equipment lead times normalize. We do anticipate some channel destocking in our two step distribution businesses like Allied Air, ADP and Heatcraft. We are maintaining solid communication with our distribution partners to effectively manage channel inventory levels. In addition to successful execution during the SEER transition, we are pleased to report that we remain on track to transition our portfolio to comply with the upcoming 2025 low GWP regulation. In terms of order updates on our innovation road map, we recently launched our next generation thermostat controller, the Lennox S40, which has built-in indoor air quality monitoring capabilities and improved connectivity to further improve the experience of our customers and our dealers. We also continue to make progress on accelerating our heat pump growth, and we're a proud recipient of the good design award for our Dave Lennox signature series collection heat pump. Switching gears. As part of our commercial recovery effort, the construction of our new commercial factory in Saltillo has started and will be complete by the end of 2024. Lastly, on this page, the formal process for divesting our European assets has started and our internal segment consolidation is complete. We expect to close the European divestiture sometime this year. With that, let me hand the call over to Joe, who will provide you a more detailed view of our financial performance. Thanks, Joe. Summarizing our financial results and providing an update on the assumptions behind our 2023 fiscal guidance. Please turn to Slide 11 for the key success factors for Lennox this year that are summarized on this page. While we have little control over the industry unit shipments in 2023 that are still expected to decline year-over-year. Given that, we are focusing our effort on the three controllable factors to grow our revenues and expand our margins. First, to offset inflation, we are maintaining and expanding our pricing initiatives. We have already implemented price increases for 2023 and are confident in our ability to offset cost inflation with pricing. Second, on the heel of a strong Q4 performance, we continue to maintain focus on commercial profit recovery. As Joe mentioned earlier, staffing levels are stable and the Stuttgart plant has switched over to the 2023 SEER standards while simplifying our product portfolio. Our new commercial product lineup provides greater value to our customers and we intend to share part of that value through pricing and contract negotiations. Third, Lennox is now well positioned to start gaining share again. As you may recall, our service levels suffered after the Marshalltown tornado in 2018 and we were unable to fully restore the service levels during the COVID years. Now, the Marshalltown reconstruction is complete, our finished good inventory levels have been replenished, Saltillo continues to add capacity, and our commercial lead times are approaching competitive levels. The improved service levels, along with recently introduced new products, put us in a strong position to relaunch our share gain programs. Even during a period of economic uncertainty, our confidence in executing on the three controllable key success factors makes us cautiously optimistic for 2023. Again, I want to thank our employees who are working hard to sustain and improve our customer service levels. Now please turn to Slide 12 for some final thoughts before Q&A. I would like to close our prepared remarks by summarizing why I believe LII is an attractive investment opportunity. Lennox is narrowly focused leader in energy efficient, environmentally friendly climate controlled solutions. We operate in high growth end markets with strong replacement demand that provides us with resiliency even during periods of economic uncertainty. The company has a unique direct to dealer network, which creates a sustainable competitive advantage. And finally, we have a history of robust execution with disciplined capital allocation. Thank you for listening. Joe and I will be happy to take your questions. Ashley, let's go to Q&A. So I guess, first of all, as you know, majority of our sales are direct to dealers. And we highlighted Allied, ADP and Heatcraft as the three business units that do go through two step distribution model. Each of them are in a different cycle stage on distributor inventory levels. For something like Heatcraft, we saw some destocking already occur and we might be back to more normal levels. For Allied and ADP, as we talk to our channel partners, we believe there's some destocking that's going to occur this year, which frankly puts our Lennox brand in a strong position. That all is baked into our guidance as we look at 0% to 4% revenue growth. While we don't give quarterly guidance, Gautam, as you know, I mean, so far, I mean, as we said, the Q1 order rates are consistent with our expectations. And I don't see anything falling off a cliff or so, but we do see gradual slowdown that we have talked about in the past. Yes, Gautam, now since Marshalltown tornado, this would be the year, 2023, we have all the inventory levels needed to launch our programs, to recapture our position on the high end, especially as we look at some of the new products like the Dave Lennox Signature series heat pumps and the new higher efficiency furnaces. So we feel good going into the year to be able to capture our fair share of market and higher than growth in 2022 on the higher end products. I think the inventory build was very planned. We wanted to make sure of two things. One is that we have sufficient high end products in stock, even though that's not selling until the summer season given the challenges we had. Second is given the SEER change, we wanted to make sure that we have sufficient inventory of the new SEER product as we went into the new year. So I think that was planned. I think where we fell short, honestly, was more appropriate forecasting and where we landed up on some of the raw material side where I think our supply chains normalize, we should have opportunity to convert more of that inventory into cash. So [Indiscernible] at this stage been complete with inventory build. So first of all, we are pleased with the recovery in Commercial and remain committed to $100 million EBIT improvement in Commercial over the planning period. We had a strong Q4, as you saw from numbers slightly better than expected, and that was kind of the prime driver of why we came to the higher end of our guidance. The recovery was driven by very stable levels of staffing. I mean at this stage, we're hiring as much as we are losing and that's kind of back to normal levels. I think the team has done a good job making sure that the output has come back up compared to the lows of the year, but we are still not back to normal. I would say we are probably still about 20% below normal on factory output where we could get there just with this factory even before the next factory comes online. So we remain pleased with the efforts in Q4. Q1, that's going to go through SEER transition. And obviously, that's something we are very excited about given the change in product lineup. So net-net, excited about the new Commercial segment. We will continue delivering and focusing. And even as we take a step into '24, '25, the new factory will give us more productivity, more capacity. And the last question you have is, yes, we did lose share in Commercial despite all the things I said earlier. Most of that was earlier in the year. Towards the end of the year, we started recovering shares and we did a little better. And we think that trend will continue because the industry lead times remain extended and ours are now getting to very competitive levels within the industry. First of all, there's significant uncertainty remains and at some stage, your guess is going to be as good as ours. January met expectations. Because majority of our business is dealer direct, the impact of channel destocking would be minimal. But for the industry, I do saw it happening more in the first half versus the second half. So I think the industry will see some decline in sales to distributors that distributors pull back orders, just to get the inventory rightsized. I think the seasonality, as we typically expect as in the summer seasonality, still remains. So I would say, yes, there's going to be some channel destocking impact in the industry in the first half. It's going to impact us less. But beyond that, it's going to be watching all the numbers that you would watch, consumer confidence, interest rates, new home starts and see where we come up. Because the new home starts that fell in second half of 2022 will have an impact in 2023 at those come up for completion, because our new home business did well in Q4 that's lower margin, as you know. But going into '23, we expect that to slow down for sure. I don't have it in front of me, and I think it was pretty consistent... Yes, in the Allied business, we would expect a slower start because, as Joe said, I mean, they had a good year. I mean in Q4, they grew very well, Lennox grew well as well. Allied grew faster than Lennox in Q4. And as we take this forward, I would expect 20% of our business, which is on through two step distribution to have a slower start to the year versus the rest of our business, which is dealer direct. I think that's a fair question and we are wondering the same questions in that. I mean, 30 days in, we haven't noticed a huge difference between the two. So like time will tell. Some of it also comes down to how distributors are thinking of the year and what kind of signals and tea leaves they are reading about demand this year. But sometimes when these air pockets come in, in the two step model, they last a few weeks. We haven't started experiencing that yet. We're just prepared to experience that. Unfortunately, we don't have any numbers. And your guess is going to be as good as mine, Steve. Quite a bit, I mean when we -- so I guess get three different areas, right? First is in our factories, we had to turn over different lines, which means there was work stoppage at different lines at different times. We did that on a rotating basis. But clearly, there was labor inefficiency and underutilization as we went through that. Second, we had to air freight and look at some prebuy of components at elevated prices just to make sure we met all the deadlines and pull that together. And I think finally, within our own distribution network, we have to spend extra because we had to manage old SEER, new SEER, different freights, move it around. So I mean those would be the three different things that we looked at, right, is just air freight and component costs, factory and efficiency and then additional distribution cost. So Julian, you're right. Historically, there has been a lag with the correlation. If there is one this time, I think it's going to be extended because the industry has such long lead times, and there's still a pent-up demand because of number of replacements that were converted into repair over the past few years. So if a unit broke, historically, they could have replaced it, but they chose to repair it. So when we talk to our larger customers, we don't notice any change in their replacement plans, their spend plan, their capital. Now that could change. But so far, we haven't noticed that. We see a lot of customers still talking about 2025 and how they plan to significantly upgrade their facilities and HVAC system with the low GWP refrigerants to meet their carbon footprint goals and get better ESG values out of it. So we have not noticed anything in the short term. The lead times are still anything from 24 to 52 weeks. And then we start hitting 2025, which we do expect a lot of the key accounts to start ordering more and planning for 2025 replacement. But we're watching it closely, the same data that you would look at, Julian, from -- everything from ABI to other indexes. But so far, it's more lead time and supply constrained, not demand constrained. We get some tailwind in the back half. I mean, it's right now heavily weighted but at the same time, we haven't locked in the commodities for the second half yet. So some variability still exist in that. The component piece is higher and we wanted to be upfront. It's higher than what we thought. But some of the items such as compressors, variable speed motor, given the supply constraints that everybody is facing, I think vendors have decided to charge higher, and we clearly had to play a part in that. So yes, the component costs are higher and that just puts more onus to get pricing. That's why you see pricing, we increase our range and talk about 1.50 to 1.75 versus just a flat number of 1.50. So different moving pieces. We'll remain committed to offsetting material costs with pricing and keep doing our best to bring components down. And if commodities ease in the second half, the number could get better. And if I could just answer the Residential piece, Jeff. We have been constrained in '18 on the appropriate product mix, the appropriate inventory. And we are excited about the new leadership there. We're excited about being back with fully stocked warehouses. We are -- I think put some specific efforts around sales excellence. I mean all of those efforts are coming to fruition. So historically, as we go back through regulatory transitions, we do always win more share because at least we believe that our products are superior and our current design is going to lead us to greater benefits. So I think that's what gives us confidence on the Residential side."

            "name": "Joe Reitmeier",
            "content": "Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. Looking at the quarter for Lennox overall, the company posted strong revenue and profit growth. Revenue was a record $1.1 billion, up 13% as reported and up 14% at constant currency, with the growth driven by volume and price. Total segment profit increased $30 million or 30% versus prior year as pricing gains more than offset cost inflation, and all three segments contributed to profit growth. Total segment margin was 12.1%, up 150 basis points as price gains outpaced cost inflation and Commercial margins improved due to higher factory output. GAAP EPS of $2.65 was up 17% and adjusted EPS rose 12% to $2.63. Regarding special items, the company had an $800,000 adjustment for the fourth quarter and $6.6 million for the full year. Corporate expenses were $34 million in the fourth quarter and $91 million for the full year. Overall, SG&A was $155 million in the fourth quarter or 14.2% of revenue, down from 15.7% in the prior year quarter. And for the full year, SG&A was $627 million or 13.3% of revenue, down from 14.3% in the prior year. Our full year 2022 income tax rate was 19.3%, which was up from the 17.2% last year, the result of higher tax benefits from share based compensation and the finalization of our prior year tax obligations with taxing authorities. For 2022, the company generated cash from operations of $302 million compared to $516 million in the prior year. The reduction in cash flow was primarily due to inventory cost inflation and investments to both minimize supply chain disruptions and prepare for the minimum efficiency regulatory change that took effect January 1, 2023. Capital expenditures were approximately $101 million for the full year compared to $107 million in the prior year. Free cash flow was $203 million for the year compared to $410 million in the prior year. In 2022, the company paid approximately $142 million in dividends and repurchased $300 million of the company's stock. Total debt was $1.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and we ended the year with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.1. Cash, cash equivalents and short term investments were $61 million at the end of the year. Moving to the business segments, starting on Slide 6. Our Residential segment delivered record fourth quarter revenue and profit. Residential revenue grew 13% to $703 million, vwolume was up 5%, price and mix were up 9% and foreign exchange had a negative 1% impact. Residential segment profit rose 8% to $119 million. Segment margin contracted 90 basis points to 16.9%, primarily due to incremental costs associated with supply chain disruptions and the factory changeover for the new 2023 minimum efficiency standard products. For the full year, Residential segment revenue was a record $3.2 billion, up 15%. Volume was up 4%, price was up 11% and product mix was flat for the full year. For the full year, Residential profit was a record $597 million, up 10%. Segment margin was 18.7%, down 80 basis points, primarily the result of supply chain challenges, which drove manufacturing inefficiencies and unfavorable product mix with reduced production output for higher end products. Now turning to Slide 7 and our Commercial business. Revenue was $241 million in the quarter, which was up 19%. Commercial price and mix was up 17%. Volume was up 3%, and foreign exchange had an unfavorable 1% impact. Commercial segment profit was up 79%, and segment margin expanded 390 basis points to 11.6%. Commercial demand and backlog remains solid, and our Arkansas factory recovery is progressing well. Staffing in the plant is at our desired levels with productivity progressing and production output increasing. For the full year, Commercial revenue was $901 million, up 4%. Price and mix were up 13% and volume was down 9%. For the full year, segment profit was $81 million, down 27%. Segment margin was 9%, down 380 basis points. Looking at our Refrigeration business on Slide 8. Revenue was $150 million for the fourth quarter, up 5% as reported and up 10% at constant currency. Price and mix were up 21%, volume down 11% and foreign exchange had a negative 5% impact. Revenue growth was led by our North American business with price and mix, which was up more than 20%. Europe revenue was up 9% as reported and up 22% at constant currency. Overall, the Refrigeration segment profit rose 42% to $19 million and segment margin expanded 330 basis points to 12.5%. Refrigeration demand, order rates and backlog remain strong. For the full year, Refrigeration revenue was $619 million, up 12%. Volume was up 3%, price and mix was up 14% and foreign exchange had an unfavorable 5% impact. Segment profit was $79 million, which was up 60% and segment profit was 12.7%, up 380 basis points. Turning to Slide 9 for a free cash flow update. Free cash flow was $203 million and was impacted by inventory replenishment to get our distribution network back to effective levels to serve our customers, along with inventory investment to buffer the supply chain to support demand for the new minimum efficiency standards that became effective January 1st. As we look to 2023 and free cash flow, we expect cash from operations to increase as we work to optimize inventory levels while we prepare for the next regulatory change to take effect in 2025 for the new low GWP refrigerants and minimize supply chain disruptions. Our capital expenditures in 2023 will be approximately $250 million and includes investments for a second commercial factory and investments necessary to prepare us for the 2025 refrigerant change. Free cash flow in 2023 is planned within a range of $250 million to $350 million, including increased capital spending to support regulatory change and growth initiatives, including factory capacity. Free cash flow in 2023 is planned within a range of $250 million to $350 million, including increased capital spending to support regulatory and growth initiatives, including factory capacity. Now turning to Slide 10. Let's review our 2023 full year guidance. Our outlook collectively for the end markets we serve remains unchanged. We expect revenue to be flat to up 4% for the year. There is no change to our EPS guidance of $14.25 to $15.25 that we shared with you during our Analyst Day. Free cash flow is targeted within the range of $250 million to $350 million, as I mentioned. And we are planning capital expenditures of $250 million that includes the necessary investments in a second factory, as I mentioned, and investments related to the refrigerant transition that take effect in 2025. Price benefit, including price associated with the 2023 SEER transition is now expected to be within a range of $150 million to $175 million. Now turning to the cost side of the equation. We expect net material cost to be a $35 million headwind in 2023. That material cost headwind is driven by component cost inflation of $100 million, net of $30 million in savings from sourcing and engineering initiatives, along with a $35 million commodity cost benefit. Corporate expenses are still targeted at $80 million. We will manage SG&A tightly while continuing to make the necessary investments in the businesses to support growth initiatives and to drive productivity. And finally, we expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between 35 million to 36 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase $100 million to $200 million of the company's stock this year. With that, let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll hand it back over to Alok. And just to elaborate a little bit on what Alok mentioned, where we lost share was in the emergency replacement segment of the market. And as productivity and output improves, it'll enable us to replenish our distribution channels with that stockable product and then you should really see the share gain gain traction. Once again, we're able to reengage in the emergency replacement side of the market. I'll be honest with you, Steve, I don't think it was radically different than what we saw in the direct to dealer business because we had a [really solid] and we had a record year in our Allied business, they did a tremendous job. They gained more than 100 basis points of share, along with our Lennox business. So it was a pretty good quarter for both businesses. Yes, I think on the emergency replacement side, Jeff, I think it's very difficult to distinguish. Where you compete there is on availability and price and we've got the distribution network, we've got the people who sell it. In 2022, we're just short of product. So it's a matter of once again, I'm just replenishing those distribution channels such that we have the product available, and we feel we're back in the game on emergency replacement and we expect that to happen over the course of 2023. Jeff, we just kicked off a process literally this week, the teasers went out. So we're waiting for, once again, the NDAs to flow in and engagement to take place with potential suitors. We should have more news for you on the first quarter call, but we're out of the gate with the process. And we're excited about what lies in front of us with the portfolio of businesses that we have in 2023."

Turning to Slide 2, I would like to remind everyone that in the course of this call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. For information concerning these risks and uncertainties, see Lennox International's publicly available filings with the SEC. Before I turn the call over to Alok, let me remind everyone of our upcoming annual investor day on Wednesday, December 14, when we will discuss specific guidance for 2023 and our three-year outlook as well as provide an update on our strategy. Now, let me turn the call over to CEO, Alok Maskara.\nAlok Maskara: Good morning and welcome everyone. I want to start by thanking all our employees who are working exceptionally hard, given the ongoing supply chain disruptions to better serve our customers. As a result of their efforts, Lennox was able to deliver another record quarter while improving our customer service level. On Slide 3, I want to start by highlighting four key messages. First, our record third quarter financial results included double-digit revenue growth in all three of our business segments. Overall company revenues were up 17% to a third quarter record of $1.24 billion. Adjusted earnings grew 21% to a third quarter record of $4.10. Second, we are prepared for the upcoming minimum efficiency regulation to be effective on January 1, 2023. As part of the preparation, we are replenishing inventory levels, which will also help us increase supply chain resiliency. Given our inventory build cash from operations was $171 million in the quarter, down $51 million from a year ago. Third, the recovery in our commercial business segment is progressing well, and the daily output from a factory in Stuttgart is steadily increasing. Third quarter commercial segment profit was up 72% sequentially, and up 31% year-over-year. Today, we are also announcing investment in a second commercial factory to be built in Mexico. The total capital required for the new commercial factory is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $150 million over the next two years. The new commercial factory will provide us the much-needed additional manufacturing capacity, while enabling margin expansion. Fourth, given persistent supply chain inefficiencies, and the adverse mix impact driven by shortage of components for high-end residential products, we are revising our full year EPS guidance range to the lower end of the prior range. Now, please turn to Slide 4 to discuss our preparedness for the minimum efficiency regulatory changes. In our residential and commercial end markets in the U.S. and Canada, the new required minimum cooling efficiency level for air conditioners, heat pumps and rooftop units is increasing on January 1, 2023. For air conditioners in the south and southwest regions, the change is based on date of installation. While for air conditioners in the north regions, and for all heat pumps and rooftop products, the change is based on date of manufacture. For the new 2023 compliant units, we expect a double-digit benefit of price and mix to more than offset the higher costs of the units. For residential products, our competitive design includes single stage compression, more efficient aluminum coils and an optimized external footprint. This design approach achieves higher efficiency standards without having to change indoor units, making our solution better for dealers and end users. Lennox historically has done very well competitively during these minimum efficiency transitions, and we believe we are well positioned to do so again. Now please turn to Slide 5 for an update on a commercial profit recovery efforts. At our existing Arkansas manufacturing facility, we have met our targets for hiring and retaining talent, resulting in staffing levels reaching normalcy, which is up 30% since April. Since achieving normal staffing levels, we are systematically increasing our daily output, which is now up 15% since April. Higher output is improving service for our customers who have been mostly understanding of our challenges given industry-wide supply shortages. We are grateful for our customers loyalty and patience and want to assure them that we are doing our utmost to increase capacity and reduce lead times. We are deploying additional talent and working closely with our suppliers to satisfy current demand levels and remain committed to delivering additional manufacturing output and productivity from the existing factory. However, in the fourth quarter, we are expecting sequentially lower manufacturing efficiency and output as we transition our product lines to build our newly launched Enlight, and Xion products that meet or exceed the new minimum efficiency standards. Similar to residential, price positioning of the higher efficiency commercial products will enable us to more than offset the associated higher cost. Looking ahead, we have decided to invest in a second commercial factory in Saltillo, Mexico near our existing residential operations. The new factory will increase our capacity to support our customers forecasted demand, and it will also position us to regain lost share, especially in the emergency replacement market. We expect an 80% lower hourly labor cost at this new facility, although some of those savings will be offset by higher freight cost. Overall, as commercial production continues to recover, we expect $100 million segment profit improvement within the next three years. With that, I will hand the call over to Joe on Slide 6 to discuss full quarter financials and guidance for the full year.\nJoe Reitmeier: Thank you, Alok and good morning, everyone. Looking at the quarter for Lennox International overall, the company posted record third quarter revenue and profit. Revenue was $1.24 billion up 17% as reported and up 18% at constant currency primarily driven by volume growth and price. GAAP operating income was a third quarter record $186 million up 14%, and in the chart, you see the total segment profit rose 15% to a third quarter record $189 million. Total segment margin was 15.2% down 30 basis points primarily due to supply chain inefficiencies and lower mix driven by manufacturing constraints on higher end products. GAAP EPS was up 17% to a third quarter record $3.99 and adjusted EPS rose 21% to a third quarter record $4.10. Now moving to the business segments starting on Slide 7, you see a record third quarter for residential in revenue in profit. Residential revenue grew 17% to $835 million. Volume was up 7%, price was up 10% in the quarter. Residential replacement and new construction sales were both up high teens with new construction growing faster. Residential segment profit rose 7% to $154 million. Segment margin contracted 190 basis points to 18.4% due to lower mix as we were unable to increase output of hiring units due to the component shortages. Regarding Lennox Stores, we opened four new locations in the third quarter to bring our total store count to 239. We expect to end the year with approximately 245 stores. Now turning to Slide 8 in commercial business, revenue was $253 million in the quarter up 20% led by strong growth in national account business. Commercial price was up 9% and mix was up 11%. Commercial segment profit was up 31% and segment margin expanded 100 basis points to 11.7%. Commercial demand and backlog remain strong and our Arkansas factory recovery continues to progress well. We have recruited and hired the number of employees we need for the factory. The daily output is increasing and we continue to make progress on improving processes and productivity. Now turning to Slide 9 in our refrigeration business. Revenue was $157 million for the third quarter up 14% as reported, and up 21% at constant currency. Price was up 16%, volume was up 5%, foreign exchange had a negative 7% impact. Revenue growth was led by North America up more than 20%, Europe revenue was up 2% as reported and up 20% at constant currency. Overall for the refrigeration segment profit rose 54% to $22 million and segment margin expanded 370 basis points to 14.3%. Refrigeration demand and backlogs remain strong. Turning to Slide 10, let's review our 2022 full year guidance. We now expect revenue growth for the full year of 12% to 15% compared to the prior range of 10% to 15%. For the industry, we continue to assume low single digit shipment growth in North American residential markets, and mid-single digit shipment growth in North American commercial unitary and refrigeration markets. We are updating our guidance for GAAP and adjusted EPS for the full year to a range of $13.80 to $14.20, compared to the prior range of $13.80 to $14.50. Now looking at the puts and takes that are changing. Price is now expected to be a $425 million benefit for the year, a yield of 10%, which is up $25 million from our prior guide $400 million. Residential mix is now expected to be a $45 million headwind for the full year compared to our prior guidance of a $25 million headwind. The mix headwind is attributed to the shortage of higher end products as supply chain constraints continue to limit production of our Dave Lennox Signature Series. Commodity cost inflation is now expected to be $120 million, down $10 million from our prior guidance of $130 million. However, we are still seeing inflationary pressures on components and other materials and now expect $120 million headwind compared to prior guidance of a $100 million headwind. Supply related factory disruptions are now expected to be a $25 million headwind compared to prior guidance of a $15 million headwind. Interest and pension expense guidance is now $40 million, up from our prior guidance of $35 million. And as we invest more in inventory for supply chain resiliency, buying ahead of continued component price increases and the minimum efficient regulatory transition, free cash flow is now expected to be approximately $300 million for the year, compared to prior guidance of $400 million. And stock repurchase guidance is now $300 million for the year, which has been completed, compared to our prior guidance of $400 million. The effective tax rate will be approximately 19% for the full year. Now for the guidance points that are not changing. Freight costs are still expected to be a $20 million headwind. We still expect corporate expenses to be $95 million. And we are still planning for $125 million of capital spending. And we still expect a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 36 million shares for the full year. And with that, let's turn to Slide 11. And I'll turn it back over to Alok to talk to you about our thoughts on 2023 at this time.\nAlok Maskara: Thank you, Joe. While we will be giving specific guidance on 2023 at our Investor Day in mid-December, I wanted to spend a few minutes today on the different headwinds and tailwinds that are guiding our 2023 outlook. On the headwind side, we are prepared for a decline in residential unit shipments due to the downturn and single-family new housing starts, as well as possible impact on replacement units from rising interest rate environment and broader economic slowdown. On the cost headwind side, we expect the first half of 2023 to continue seeing component inflation. And we also expect some of the current supply chain disruptions to persist in the first half of 2023. For the 2023 tailwinds, we expect to see a price and mixed benefits from minimum efficiency regulatory increase in both residential and commercial. We also see significant carryover and annual price increased benefit. Our 2023 margins will also be favorably impacted by commercial manufacturing, recovery and easing commodity cost. In addition our material cost reduction pipeline will provide meaningful savings as we expect that most of the supply chain inefficiencies will be behind us by the middle of the year. Our commercial and refrigeration businesses have strong demand and backlog into 2023. And all our businesses have shared gain opportunities ahead of us. Bottom-line, even if residential units are down, new construction and macroeconomic softness, we still expect revenue, margin and EPS growth for LII in 2023. Please turn to Slide 12. For some final thoughts before Q&A. I would like to close our prepared remarks by summarizing why I joined Lennox and why I believe LII is an attractive investment opportunity. Lennox is narrowly focused leader in energy efficient, environmentally friendly, climate-controlled solutions. Our innovative products continually reduce global warming potential. We operate in high growth end markets with strong replacement demand that provides us resiliency even during economic uncertainties. The company has a unique direct to dealer network, providing a strong sustainable, competitive advantage. And we have a history of robust execution with discipline capital deployment. In summary, I believe LII is a compelling investment opportunity as we look at 2023 and beyond, and that our best days are ahead. Thank you. Joe, and I will be happy to take your questions now. Operator, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Gautam Khanna. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. Hey, thank you guys. Couple of questions. First, I was wondering on the commercial side, as we think about supply chain and get to the root cause of what's happening there. Is there any evidence of well, a, is it getting better? And likewise on the on the high-end residential product? And b, are you seeing anything where maybe you guys aren't getting as strong an allocation from certain suppliers relative to some of your competitors? Is there any evidence of that? And then, lastly, if you could just talk about the CapEx required to build the new commercial facility and the timeline? Thanks.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. Gautam, good morning. So on the supply chain side, both for residential and commercial, yes, it is getting better. But I've said this a few times and then something hits like COVID hit once and the Ukraine crisis hit as well. But so far everything that we are seeing things are getting better, maybe not fast enough but they are. Second, we have no concerns or have no evidence to show that the allocation issue is impacting our supply chain performance. We have long, lengthy relationship with our core suppliers. And we believe that, through a lot of the challenges we are facing, are exactly the same as other industry players. So we are not concerned about any of the allocations. On the capital spend, we highlighted for the new factory, it's about $125 million to $150 million. We would for now planning purposes, assume that to be like, evenly split between the two years. But we can give you more guidance on that when we are together for the Investor Day on December 14.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys. Just back on the residential supply chain, like you kind of commented that it's getting better, but it feels like it's getting worse. And I'm just wondering, if there's anything with how you use your supply chain, and a little bit more sourcing from Asia is creating a little bit of a lag or just want to understand, because it just seems like across the board, people are saying things are getting better. And this seems kind of seemed worse.\nAlok Maskara: I think I would separate the supply chain situation with the Q3 residential margins. Because if you look purely at the margins year-over-year, you could reach a conclusion that it's getting worse. But frankly, like a few decisions we made in Q3 to expedite materials and spot buy to make sure that we could serve our customers well. And I wouldn't look at our Q3 margins as a indicator, especially the year-over-year change in Q3 margin as a indicator of supply chain. Our inventory levels are getting healthier, our lead times are improving, there is pockets of challenges remaining, especially on the high-end products, which are more dependent on microelectronics and semiconductors. But overall, things are getting better. And I think our guide implies that our Q4 margins on a year-over-year basis will be down less, significantly less than what we saw in q3. So I look at Q3 as a one-time impact of multiple different factors. So I would come back and reiterate Jeff that, no, our supply chains are getting better. Unless another shoe drops that we aren't aware of, we would expect most of the supply chain inefficiencies to be behind us no later than kind of mid next year.\nJeff Hammond: Okay, helpful. And then, we started to hear kind of about the pricing changes associated with the regulatory change. Can you just speak to what you're seeing there. And then just as we look at headwinds and tailwinds into next year, it just seems like the tailwinds are much more meaningful than the kind of lingering headwinds maybe just give us a better frame for -- if that's the right way to look at it. Thanks.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So the pricing for the new minimum efficiency products, I mean, when we talked about a double-digit benefit. And clearly, we're going to do our best to make sure that we get the appropriate price benefits. Currently, we remain very confident that will more than recover the additional costs associated with that. Clearly there are nuances which I won't get into in the call on which product series and what. But we remain confident that it's going to be a double-digit increase. And that's consistent with the higher costs and what we're hearing, like acceptable levels from our customers and channel partners. On the second side, yes, I mean, that's a good takeaway. I thought if I put three bullets on the headwind and eight bullets on the tailwind, I would naturally drive everybody to that conclusion that there are more tailwinds than headwinds. The biggest unknown there, Jeff, which we have talked about in the past is, how well is the replacement demand going to hold? We think it's going to hold well. We think the replacement versus repair equation is going to tilt more towards replacement, given the various dynamics, including higher labor costs for repair, and including the Inflation Reduction Act and other pieces that naturally drive people towards replacement. But yes, we'll give you more details in December. But I think that's a fair way to interpret what we said.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. Great color, Alok. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNicole DeBlase: Maybe we could start with pricing questions. So maybe putting a finer point on like attempting to loosely quantify the pricing tailwind in 2023. Alok, can you talk about like when you combine the impact of the double-digit improvement due to SEER standard change? And then, think about just the price carryover from the actions that you guys took throughout 2022 that lead into 2023 as that is annualized, is there a sense of how much of a pricing benefit that can be in percentage terms for next year?\nAlok Maskara: From a percentage terms, we could probably give you a lot more color in December, as we finished launching all the higher SEER product change. But I mean, we do expect that number to be meaningful, in the first half of the year, we obviously will have a significant carryover benefit on pricing that comes through, and for the full year, there will be annual price increases, and there will be the mix and price benefits from regulatory changes. But at this point, Nicole, I would say I think it's best for us to wait until December, before we can give you like a range of price number. But what we are indicating is that it will be more than any volume decline that we are expecting at this stage on the financial side.\nJoe Reitmeier: I will also add to that. Nicole, we expect to be more price cost positive than we were here in 2022.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay. Got it. That's really helpful. And then maybe just anything you guys are seeing with respect to channel inventory dynamics, obviously, there's a lot of questions about this from investors. And I think that it's especially tough to understand the level of inventory and the channel right now, with what's going on with this SEER standard change. So how do you guys feel about where inventory is in your own distribution as well as allied things?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So in our own distribution, which is where majority of our sales come from/ I think the inventory level is getting healthier, but we're still short on some of the higher end products. And, if we could, we would actually maintain more inventory to ensure that we have all the products that our customers need as they go into the SEER change, which does make it messy. On the independent distribution, which majority of the industry uses, we think inventory levels are getting healthier. In those areas, I do worry about an air pocket, sometime in the near future, driven by lead time improvements, and driven by sort of like the post minimum efficiency change, people may try and resize, the inventory. But I think that's not something we are experiencing now. And that air pocket probably going to be in early next year, as most people are being cautious and will want to keep inventory, sufficient inventory for the SEER change.\nJoe Reitmeier: And just to make one more point, the air pocket is more attributable to those that go through to step distribution versus our direct to dealer model.\nAlok Maskara: We think that impacts us very little.\nJoe Reitmeier: Right.\nNicole DeBlase: Thank you, guys. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to start off with a sort of a question about the fourth quarter. So just wanting to understand is the sort of assumption at the midpoint that you've got, mid high teens, sales growth in Q4, not too different total or across the segments than what you saw in Q3. And then, it's kind of a flattish margin year-on-year in the fourth quarter. So a little bit better year-on-year and that's because of resi. Is that the right way to think about it and kind of still single digit growth in resi volumes in Q4?\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes. When I sort of step away and look at things year-over-year, particularly in the fourth quarter, I think what we're going to see is more of an impact on the commercial business and fourth quarter margins. We had better margins last year in the fourth quarter. And because of the challenges we have in that business, that's going to be the biggest drag in the fourth quarter on margins. The challenges in the residential business, we intentionally made some investments, to procure inventory to make sure we can serve our customers. And that simply came at a higher cost, which we don't expect to repeat in the fourth quarter of the same degree. And then, our refrigeration business continues to do very well. Net-net, we expect margins for the fourth quarter, even though we typically don't give guidance. I'll give you a little bit insight here, flattish to up slightly in the fourth quarter.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much Joe. And then maybe my follow up would be around kind of cash flow and cash uses. So I think yes, this year you're running at about 60% free cash flow conversion from adjusted net and understood it's because of the supply chain constraints. And then, you have the sort of the CapEx for the new plan the next couple of years. So are we thinking it's, cashflow conversion, headline wise probably doesn't get back to 100% for two or three years. Just wanted to check that's the right way to think about it. And also any context as to the reduction in the buyback guide. Thank you.\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes, I'll start with the reduction and the buyback. What we did in over the last few months is continue to evaluate what we need production wise to meet end market demand, and continue to look for opportunities to create slack in our supply chain, and also fend off component price increases that will stick come January 1. So we made additional investments in inventory, in lieu with share repurchases, to make sure that we had adequate supply to support our customers going into critically important time in 2023. So that's the trade-off there. And we'll continue to do things with -- the share repurchases to target our desired leverage points of between one and two. We've talked historically about targeting between 1.5 and 2. I think we want to be closer to the midpoint as we embark on 2023. And with respect to free cash flow conversion going forward, the way that I would do it, Julian, is start with the assumption that we're going to deliver free cash flow that approximates net income, and then take the incremental spend of the new manufacturing facility for commercial and adjust cash flow accordingly for that, and that should give you a pretty good proxy, what the next two years cash flow looks like.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Look, maybe first on the new commercial plant, can you give us some sense of the increase in productive capacity that comes with this plant in terms of whether it's square footage or potential revenue outputs, something that kind of frame the size of this increase relative to the current base?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. I think, listen, we are working through all the details. And what we did is work backwards from our customers forecast and looked at how much capacity we would need five years from now, 10 years from now and work backwards through that. So the plant may start out with lower capacity, but it will be very much matched to the customer's demand. Other thing, remember, in Stuttgart, we are running much lower than nameplate capacity, given the local challenges and the labor availability. So at this stage, I don't want to give a number. But if it's sufficient to say this plant will give us capacity, at least for the next five to 10 years to keep serving our customers with the forecast they need. Our customers and us, both remain pretty optimistic about commercial replacement demand, especially as, they know the new regulations come in and the ESG benefits that the customers receive. But given a lot of sensitivities around construction timelines, and the impact on our existing facilities, I would rather not give exact details. But rest assured, we have a fairly detailed plan that will execute on within the next two years to make sure we can ramp and start production by the end of 2024 at the new facility.\nJeff Sprague: Understood. And then, just thinking about the SEER change again, and kind of the mix impacts. As you as you exit 22, what percent of the business was at minimum SEER levels across the country in 2022 and, therefore, subject to the mandatory step up?\nAlok Maskara: We've always talked about is more than 50%. I mean, the industry number typically hovers about 60%, 65% and we are in a similar range. That number is probably a little higher in 22. Just because the higher end products use more microelectronics and they remain in somewhat short supply but I would use a number of around 60 which is the industry average and that'll apply to us as well.\nJeff Sprague: Great. And then, maybe just one last one just the comment about higher end componentry and the like, is that causing any friction on the new SEER unit so you're talking more 18, 20 SEER kind of up in there where you're having kind of components supply issues?\nAlok Maskara: 20, 24, 28, remember we make the highest SEER units and are very well known for that on those that typically go as part of our signature series products. That's where we are seeing shortages, which, unfortunately, like forces a dealer, not to be able to upsell. I mean, our dealers are really good at upselling and getting customers more energy efficient products. And we have just been constrained on that. But we do see that easing as well as we get into 2023.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks for the caller.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: First off, you mentioned being prepared for the SEER change. How does your equipment lineup look competitively with the other brands?\nAlok Maskara: Ryan, as a CEO, I always believe we are the best in this, right? So listen, a lot of the changes are still being unveiled. We believe that our design with a, keep the box size the same. So the footprint remains optimized. We believe as we have put single stage technology that gives us competitive advantage. We believe our aluminum [heat] [ph] exchangers are better. But I think the most important difference is that for our products, a dealer does not have to change the indoor unit. And just by changing the outdoor unit, they can meet the higher efficiency standard. For many of our competitors, they got to change the indoor unit and the outdoor unit. So listen, I'm biased, but I think we've got a great solution. I think our dealers and end users are going to be well positioned. And we are looking forward to getting some share through the transition.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Thanks for that. And then nice job on commercial. I'm curious what inning are we in for increasing production? And then, did you say that in mid-23, you'd be at full production for commercial?\nAlok Maskara: While if you follow cricket that we are in the first inning, if you follow baseball, we are probably in the second or third inning on that one. Listen, we are in early innings, labor was a big challenge, we got that. But we're still no way close to meeting our customers full demand or the natural lead time. At minimum, our production should go up another 15%, 20% in the near future. And improving our manufacturing processes is a big deal. I mean, this is not acceptable level of productivity. And finally, now our suppliers have to ramp up with us and these are often smaller suppliers that we have led down in the past few years. So we are working through that. But early innings, probably the second or third inning on a baseball terminology.\nRyan Merkel: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: The 2023 early peak was helpful. I wanted to follow up on one of the comments that you made around resi replacement for next year. Specifically, where you talked about the potential for some volume pressure there in the context of an economic slowdown. How much of that, in your mind is just a repair versus replace dynamic? Or are you also hinting at some discretion with respect to the timing of when a homeowner decides to spend, like, for example, in the context of a existing home sale?\nAlok Maskara: No, I think pretty much all of it is a balance between repair and replacement. We continue to believe that this is a non-discretionary spend. Now, would there be a small percentage that people will choose to live with a broken air conditioner, that always there but I think that's negligible. When we think it's purely a repair versus replacement, we're still working through the analysis. We have looked at other recessions and economic uncertain environments in the past. And we think this time around, if there is a softness, the repair versus replacement, will still turn more favorably towards replacement. So I think we continue to believe it's all non-discretionary, and answer that nobody knows. And we just have scenarios around it, is how much of repairs versus replacement trade-off is going to change in a time of economic uncertainty. And we'll do our best to dive it more towards replacement.\nTommy Moll: Yes. Okay. I think that's helpful.\nJoe Reitmeier: I think there's also some other variables in play that point things toward -- more towards a replacement versus repair scenario, one is the ultimate 22 dynamic where, there's still a significant number of our 22 units installed, where it's going to be difficult if not punitive to find that refrigerant. Should that be unnecessary repair? Secondly is the minimum efficiency change. So I think that will help us a little bit. And then also, incentives for heat pumps, electrification and all that with government incentives, I think all of that points towards maybe a lower price tag for a replacement scenario, compared to escalating costs in a repair situation. So I think those dynamics are more closely aligned than they were in previously, economic tough times.\nTommy Moll: And as one of your analysts with an R22 system, I'm keenly aware of these dynamics, so personally know all the contexts there. We'll circle back after the call there, for sure. Joe, I did want to ask about interest expense for next year, I know some of your debt is floating rate, is there any way that you could frame based on the information you have now or maybe the rate curve, what the headwind in terms of interest expense might look like next year?\nJoe Reitmeier: I'm going to wait until December to clarify that for you, if you don't mind. We still have a lot of work to do on our plan, et cetera, in all of that. So there's lots of moving pieces, various scenarios that we're whittling down at this time. So I don't think it'll be significantly different than wanting to stay will be higher, but it won't be significantly higher than that where it is today.\nTommy Moll: Okay. We'll talk again in December, and thanks for everything. I'll turn it back.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJoe O'Dea: I wanted to start on the cost side. And if I heard you correctly, I think part of inventory investment might have been sort of an anticipation of seeing component costs go up, but maybe you can clarify that. And then related to that, when you think about sort of the -- within COGS, the raw materials versus the sort of source components exposure that you have, kind of the balance of that. So I mean, likely seeing, I guess, raw materials come down. But what is your anticipation in terms of some of the sourced components? Do you think you see price coming down there? Would you expect that to sort of be flat or even moving higher as we move forward?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. Let me start with the inventory piece. Listen, I mean, as we go forward, I mean, we will probably shift that mix a little bit. So we'll have more fixed, more final finished goods, and less raw material. Right now we have higher raw material, given the supply chain lead times -- our own supply chain lead times. So I think that's going to shift a little bit. But overall, we are reaching fairly normal inventory levels. So I think majority of the buildup we have was returning back to normal finish go to level. And in future, we would see that trending in the same way. And in my factories, we always challenged them to say, hey, we will have less raw material, and our warehouses need more finished goods to serve our customers better. But I don't think we break it out historically. And we won't do that right now. Second one, on the component cost side, we are expecting inflation, and we will continue expecting inflation for a few months, they always lag commodities. And our supply team, in some cases, has negotiated some excellent contracts, which means that there's no pricing for next year, maybe index to commodity pricing this year. I mean, that always creates a six to 12-month lag. I think based on that we would expect components to continue being inflationary. But if we take components, commodities, our material cost reduction initiative, put it all together. next year, that will be a positive versus a negative this year. So, this year that was in a net negative in terms of headwind to us. Next year, putting the whole package together will be a tailwind to us and we'll break that out for you in December.\nJoe O'Dea: That's all really helpful. And then, I wanted to circle back on minimum efficiency pricing and just so that we kind of do the right math in terms of how much of the portfolio that applies to and so and you talked about, like what percentage of the air conditioning and heat pumps would be at the minimum efficiency level but if we think about sort of total resi. I don't know that the right math is to just say 60% is going up 10% to 15% maybe just kind of help us step through that a little bit?\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes. A little more complicated than that given the way the transition is particularly on residential, where you can still sell 13 SEER in the North. It just had to be manufactured by December 31st of this year. So I think that's something that will scale that number back a bit. I'm not going to give you the math because I'm not certain of it. So I'm not going to lay it on the table. But I just want to play those dynamics back to you because once again, it is a very difficult thing to get our hands around roughly 50% of the revenue, 60% of the units are minimum efficiency. So you start there and then like I said, you need to consider the timing of the transition and the way that it's laid out in North versus South particularly on the residential side to come up with a tighter number around that. We may give you more color around that in December, but I'm not prepared to do that at this time.\nJoe O'Dea: Got it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Yes. Alok, on the commercial startup here with CO [ph] and then you mentioned you kind of hit a few milestones and stuck, what should we think about is sort of the increments along the way to restoring that $100 million of profitability you talked about because I think on one hand, the reasons that you guys decided for what drove the reduction, it sound like they'd been remedied. So I'm sort of wondering like, what's the next thing to watch and are there any sort of buckets of profit restorations that you would think about as correlating with that?\nAlok Maskara: Yes, right before the call, I met Joe Nassab, our President and COO of Commercial, and he said, we got to strike a balance. So I'm going to use his words on making sure we are demonstrating and celebrating progress but acknowledging that we have lots and lots of hard work still ahead of us. The improvements on $100 million is still going to be spread over the next two to three years. A lot of that\u2019s going to come with higher output because our output is still way below nameplate capacity at Stuttgart, a lot of that\u2019s going to come from just manufacturing efficiency. I mean, just our number shows that we have increased staffing by 30%, but output only by 15%. So we should be able to make 15% more products without adding any labor, just simple math on that. And then, there's a lot more benefit that comes from improving our manufacturing processes. I mean, you don't get to the state we got in April with robust manufacturing processes. So we need to establish those processes. And then, finally, as we take the step forward towards SEER change, the price mix benefit that we talked about in residential, also applies to commercial, where some of our national account contract had artificially constrained us on our pricing levels. Put it all together, I mean we are confident of the $100 million, we think it's going to be in three years or less, I hope to deliver it in two but we commit to delivering it in at least three.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's, helpful. And then, I apologize if you\u2019ve covered this earlier, I cut out a couple times during the prepared remarks. But on IRA and some of the heat pump points to watch, I think you guys probably lean a little bit more towards furnace than some of your peers out there. I would imagine that comes at the expense of heat pump. On the other hand though, heat pumps I think in terms of the incremental technology benefit might help you a little bit more in the North, than what they would have historically. I guess, how do you think about both product and channel positioning to maybe kind of execute on that opportunity here?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So you're correct that our heat pump exposure is less than some of our peers, mostly because we serve or have a higher share in the North versus the South. I look it as a huge opportunity for us to increase heat pump penetration. We had strong growth this quarter, just like previous few quarters in heat pumps. Our new cold climate heat pump technology gives us an edge over our competition as heat pump penetration goes from South to North. And I believe Inflation Reduction Act is going to make a meaningful difference for us to increase heat pump penetration and often use the Inflation Reduction Act to go with dual fuel system where you have a heat pump and a furnace in areas where heat pump may not work in the coldest few months but work very well for the remaining nine to ten months. So there are lot more opportunities ahead for us, love to talk and show more of some of these points during the Investor Day. But pretty exciting opportunity for us and the rest of the industry I think it gives us more favorable benefit given our low penetration and our cold climate, the heat pump technology.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Do you think you'll be able to quantify IRA or are we -- sort of ringfence the opportunity at Investor Day?\nAlok Maskara: Potentially going to still remain very hard, part of it is, it needs to flow down to states and each of the states come up with their own local regulation. We know it's positive. I don't know if any of us, our sort of peers can give you actual quantification. We can probably point to themes and I'm looking at Joe and he's kind of nodding it, yes, I think it's going to be hard to quantify the exact impact, just because it hasn't flown down to states and utilities and how it's actually going to be implemented.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Understood, appreciate it.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: So first of all, what was the independent channel, how did that perform for you in the quarter? I know it was up pretty big last quarter in resi.\nAlok Maskara: We serve mostly through the direct on the Lennox and then with Allied and Heatcraft we do go to the independent channel. I would say the growth was similar across the Board. We historically don't break it out but right now the growth was similar across the Board.\nSteve Tusa: I think it was breaking out in your 10-Q, or is that, no, you're not going to disclose that anymore?\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes, we do break it out in the 10-Q, what Alok was talking about is in our formal presentation and prepared remarks, that's what he's referring to.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Okay.\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes. To Alok\u2019s point, I think both channels performed almost on par with each other this quarter.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Okay.\nAlok Maskara: They're not meaningful enough for us to point it out here.\nSteve Tusa: Great. And then just one follow-up question. So I guess what everybody in the industry is now saying is that there's basically zero elasticity in the residential HVAC market. I mean, prices are up 30% to 35%, relative to a couple of years ago, you're going to get another kind of artificial price increase with basically zero return for the consumer in spending that much money and everybody is generally replacing today versus repairing. So you're just saying this market is kind of like, fundamentally bulletproof from elasticity perspective, is that kind of what I'm hearing on residential?\nAlok Maskara: No, I don't think we said that the market is pricing elastic. I think what we have to do as industry players, is make sure that we serve our customers best with the right solution. The repair was a replacement dynamics. I'm not saying there'll be no shift. In fact, earlier in the call, we did talk about that there may be a potential shift and what we are doing is preparing for that. I don't think any market ever 100% price in elastic. But the current dynamics do favor more replacement versus repair given some of the factors we talked about. I don't think those SEER change pricing is artificial. I mean, I think that's real. There is real costs associated with it, there's real benefits associated with it, it's driven by regulation that impacts the whole industry but there are lot of unknowns. Our job as leaders is to be prepared for those unknowns and react in the best interest of our shareholders as those different factors play on, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. I guess what I was just saying was that the consumer doesn't really care about regulation or any of that. So for them, that's just another 10% price increase, that are not and they\u2019re not worried about your increasing cost and there's really not a payback associated with it. So, just one more question for you. What in kind of the new efficiency systems, what is the average cost of install to replace one of these things now, in your view in the channel? It's kind of your average, as you look across your fleet. If I'm a consumer and I'm replacing, what is that average now, cost?\nAlok Maskara: So first of all, let me thanks for bringing up the cost of install, because to a consumer, the cost of equipment is often less than the cost of install. But that obviously depends on whether you are in Topeka, Kansas, or whether you're in New York City. I mean, that obviously varies substantially based on the cost of labor. But the cost of equipment on average is less than half of the total cost to the consumer, given the cost of installing and supplies and labor and other pieces that are put out on to that. We don't have a number, because it does vary so much to give you in terms of what's the average cost of install and the industry data that you can, I'm sure well aware of. But in our view that has gone up substantially as well over the past few years. And last thing I would say there is a benefit to the consumer with higher SEER changes as lower electricity cost. Most consumers may not see that on their daily bills or may not be fully aware of it, but there is a benefit to the consumer in terms of lower energy consumption that is meaningful when energy prices are at a record high sometimes.\nSteve Tusa: Great. That\u2019s the sort of color. I really appreciate it.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: So look, I think that you raised the point about the alternative pricing as a driver of replaced versus repair. I think this is a really important debate, because it's something that we hear a lot of debate about in the field. There are drop in refrigerants like [R-407, R-438] [ph] et cetera, that can replace an R-22 at much lower prices and have performance very similar. Are we not seeing that happening? I mean, you haven't got to pay R-20 prices at this point. So I'm just wondering what the view is on that?\nAlok Maskara: Specifically to the R-22 unit, you have to consider the cost of refrigerant along with many other factors such as the age of the equipment, the potential life left in the compressors and the motors. So you're right. I mean, it's not just that. I mean we look at that as a significant installed base, that's upcoming due for replacement anyway and the fact that the refrigerant cost is much higher gives our dealers an opportunity to talk to the homeowner about how it can be replaced with a more efficient unit, more environmentally friendly refrigerant with warranty, with potential benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act in terms of rebates. So I think it's a whole package, you got to look together. Yes, there is a huge debate, and we are part of that debate, in terms of repair versus replacement and I think you and I have talked about before -- nobody knows the answer, they're all different models. And our goal as a team to drive it towards replacement that's beneficial to the consumer, but be prepared towards any possibilities. If the consumer chooses repair, we want to make sure we provide them with the repair parts and then we'll talk to the -- if it shifts in that dynamic we'll come and talk to you all about here the shift we are seeing.\nNigel Coe: Right. And then just a quick one on the IRA, we beat this one to death. But you alluded a lot, this is, don't hold your breath, this is government thing, the COGS turn slowly, are we thinking here this as more of a 2024? I mean certainly, if you look at the disbursements and the budgets, CDO [ph] productions is much more 24 than 23. But when do you think your contractors and dealers can go out and actually start selling customers on these benefits?\nAlok Maskara: I think it starts in some states next year and in some of the states which are faster to roll this out and I do expect like the -- along the coast you might see it sooner. Some of it will be in 2024. I mean, it is a good piece for our dealers to be able to start talking about it now. I mean, if you see from press releases from us and all our competition, it's already being used and there are already some rebates available with utilities and states that are not tied to IRA. But this gives our dealer an opportunity to go talk to consumer about a rebate that may already be existing. But the actual impact of IRA, I think it starts in \u201823 and goes into \u201924 and it\u2019s just hard to quantify without knowing full details of the roll out yet.\nNigel Coe: Great. Well, thanks a lot. Appreciate that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: So I might have missed this earlier but can you parse out the commercial growth this quarter? How much pricing came through this quarter versus volumes? And then, also, if there's any commentary on commercial orders, that'd be helpful.\nAlok Maskara: Yes. I think we mentioned in the script that the pricing for commercial was 9%, the total growth was 20%, so you think of it 11% from core unit volume and 9% from pricing. We don't typically break out order information. But I mean the orders remain healthy and currently are at or above our sales rate. So our backlog continues to build and in addition to the backlog or a book, there's also anticipated demand as many of the key customers are working with us on planned replacements here as they need to meet their ESG criteria. And at least here there's a very sophisticated decision about repair versus replacement because through our national account service, we have huge insights into potential break down than replacements coming up. So it's all positive in terms of, I think pricing is picking up, volumes holding strong and we have good insights into orders on the book and future orders beyond what's in the book.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it, that's helpful. And then it was nice to see a lot of the margin expansion this quarter, both sequentially and I mean year-over-year basis in commercial. I know that there's some seasonality in the business of 4Q and 1Q tend to be seasonally lower quarters. I'm just curious, as you're kind of thinking through the margin progression from here, are these margins that can hold or do you expect the margins kind of take a step back at least from an absolute level sequentially because of the seasonality in the business?\nAlok Maskara: So a couple of things, right. Overall, for Lennox, our margins are going to go up in the future. So I think the current margin levels are lower than what I expect a year from now, two years from now or three years from now and we'll talk more about that on the Investor Day. Q4, specifically you're right, margins are seasonally low and quite a few of our manufacturing lines are going to go through a transition as we shift to minimum efficiency products, especially on the commercial side. Hence, we hinted that in Q4, the commercial margins may take a step back, but that\u2019s planned change over where our factories lines need to be just reworked and shut down to support the new products. But overall on margins, listen we were a little disappointed with the resi margins this quarter but we understand some of the one-time factors and the mix impact. We are cautiously guarded for Q4 but we are optimistic about margins in the future. Like as we look at 2023 and beyond.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. Thank you and one more quick one, just on the commercial facility that's coming online that you expect to be fully operational by, I think you said 2024. Right now commercial end markets to your point the orders are strong. Who knows where we're going to be in 2024? I guess the question I have for you is, you're adding capacity in that facility? How much leeway are you going to have to basically adjust to maybe changes in the market dynamics that -- if we're in a much different place on non-residential construction or commercial HVAC in 2024? What will you be able to do to kind of adjust your capacity to ensure that you're not taking significantly high decremental margins if the market will return?\nAlok Maskara: I know that that was part of the concern and the equation we went through. There may be a short-term softness two years from now which none of us would know. First of all, I think the new facility gives us a lot of flexibility. I mentioned in my script that the hourly labor costs at the new facility would be 80% lower than our hourly labor cost at our current facility. Also, the new facility is close to our residential facility, which gives us flexibility in moving labor around if we need to between an optimizing it collectively, as Lennox International. So yes, I think we will have significant flexibility to react as we have done in the past, in terms of ensuring that margin degradation is minimal as we go through any volume decline based on external factors. Having two facility will give us a lot more flexibility than if we only had one when things went south economically.\nJoe Reitmeier: In addition to that also remind you, I think everyone knows these are variable -- our costs are roughly 85% variable when it comes to product costs. So it's not a high capital-intensive business, where it would be catastrophic to decremental margins should volume decline.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We have reached our allotted time for Q&A. That was our last question. That concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alok Maskara",
            "content": "Good morning and welcome everyone. I want to start by thanking all our employees who are working exceptionally hard, given the ongoing supply chain disruptions to better serve our customers. As a result of their efforts, Lennox was able to deliver another record quarter while improving our customer service level. On Slide 3, I want to start by highlighting four key messages. First, our record third quarter financial results included double-digit revenue growth in all three of our business segments. Overall company revenues were up 17% to a third quarter record of $1.24 billion. Adjusted earnings grew 21% to a third quarter record of $4.10. Second, we are prepared for the upcoming minimum efficiency regulation to be effective on January 1, 2023. As part of the preparation, we are replenishing inventory levels, which will also help us increase supply chain resiliency. Given our inventory build cash from operations was $171 million in the quarter, down $51 million from a year ago. Third, the recovery in our commercial business segment is progressing well, and the daily output from a factory in Stuttgart is steadily increasing. Third quarter commercial segment profit was up 72% sequentially, and up 31% year-over-year. Today, we are also announcing investment in a second commercial factory to be built in Mexico. The total capital required for the new commercial factory is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $150 million over the next two years. The new commercial factory will provide us the much-needed additional manufacturing capacity, while enabling margin expansion. Fourth, given persistent supply chain inefficiencies, and the adverse mix impact driven by shortage of components for high-end residential products, we are revising our full year EPS guidance range to the lower end of the prior range. Now, please turn to Slide 4 to discuss our preparedness for the minimum efficiency regulatory changes. In our residential and commercial end markets in the U.S. and Canada, the new required minimum cooling efficiency level for air conditioners, heat pumps and rooftop units is increasing on January 1, 2023. For air conditioners in the south and southwest regions, the change is based on date of installation. While for air conditioners in the north regions, and for all heat pumps and rooftop products, the change is based on date of manufacture. For the new 2023 compliant units, we expect a double-digit benefit of price and mix to more than offset the higher costs of the units. For residential products, our competitive design includes single stage compression, more efficient aluminum coils and an optimized external footprint. This design approach achieves higher efficiency standards without having to change indoor units, making our solution better for dealers and end users. Lennox historically has done very well competitively during these minimum efficiency transitions, and we believe we are well positioned to do so again. Now please turn to Slide 5 for an update on a commercial profit recovery efforts. At our existing Arkansas manufacturing facility, we have met our targets for hiring and retaining talent, resulting in staffing levels reaching normalcy, which is up 30% since April. Since achieving normal staffing levels, we are systematically increasing our daily output, which is now up 15% since April. Higher output is improving service for our customers who have been mostly understanding of our challenges given industry-wide supply shortages. We are grateful for our customers loyalty and patience and want to assure them that we are doing our utmost to increase capacity and reduce lead times. We are deploying additional talent and working closely with our suppliers to satisfy current demand levels and remain committed to delivering additional manufacturing output and productivity from the existing factory. However, in the fourth quarter, we are expecting sequentially lower manufacturing efficiency and output as we transition our product lines to build our newly launched Enlight, and Xion products that meet or exceed the new minimum efficiency standards. Similar to residential, price positioning of the higher efficiency commercial products will enable us to more than offset the associated higher cost. Looking ahead, we have decided to invest in a second commercial factory in Saltillo, Mexico near our existing residential operations. The new factory will increase our capacity to support our customers forecasted demand, and it will also position us to regain lost share, especially in the emergency replacement market. We expect an 80% lower hourly labor cost at this new facility, although some of those savings will be offset by higher freight cost. Overall, as commercial production continues to recover, we expect $100 million segment profit improvement within the next three years. With that, I will hand the call over to Joe on Slide 6 to discuss full quarter financials and guidance for the full year. Thank you, Joe. While we will be giving specific guidance on 2023 at our Investor Day in mid-December, I wanted to spend a few minutes today on the different headwinds and tailwinds that are guiding our 2023 outlook. On the headwind side, we are prepared for a decline in residential unit shipments due to the downturn and single-family new housing starts, as well as possible impact on replacement units from rising interest rate environment and broader economic slowdown. On the cost headwind side, we expect the first half of 2023 to continue seeing component inflation. And we also expect some of the current supply chain disruptions to persist in the first half of 2023. For the 2023 tailwinds, we expect to see a price and mixed benefits from minimum efficiency regulatory increase in both residential and commercial. We also see significant carryover and annual price increased benefit. Our 2023 margins will also be favorably impacted by commercial manufacturing, recovery and easing commodity cost. In addition our material cost reduction pipeline will provide meaningful savings as we expect that most of the supply chain inefficiencies will be behind us by the middle of the year. Our commercial and refrigeration businesses have strong demand and backlog into 2023. And all our businesses have shared gain opportunities ahead of us. Bottom-line, even if residential units are down, new construction and macroeconomic softness, we still expect revenue, margin and EPS growth for LII in 2023. Please turn to Slide 12. For some final thoughts before Q&A. I would like to close our prepared remarks by summarizing why I joined Lennox and why I believe LII is an attractive investment opportunity. Lennox is narrowly focused leader in energy efficient, environmentally friendly, climate-controlled solutions. Our innovative products continually reduce global warming potential. We operate in high growth end markets with strong replacement demand that provides us resiliency even during economic uncertainties. The company has a unique direct to dealer network, providing a strong sustainable, competitive advantage. And we have a history of robust execution with discipline capital deployment. In summary, I believe LII is a compelling investment opportunity as we look at 2023 and beyond, and that our best days are ahead. Thank you. Joe, and I will be happy to take your questions now. Operator, let's go to Q&A. Sure. Gautam, good morning. So on the supply chain side, both for residential and commercial, yes, it is getting better. But I've said this a few times and then something hits like COVID hit once and the Ukraine crisis hit as well. But so far everything that we are seeing things are getting better, maybe not fast enough but they are. Second, we have no concerns or have no evidence to show that the allocation issue is impacting our supply chain performance. We have long, lengthy relationship with our core suppliers. And we believe that, through a lot of the challenges we are facing, are exactly the same as other industry players. So we are not concerned about any of the allocations. On the capital spend, we highlighted for the new factory, it's about $125 million to $150 million. We would for now planning purposes, assume that to be like, evenly split between the two years. But we can give you more guidance on that when we are together for the Investor Day on December 14. I think I would separate the supply chain situation with the Q3 residential margins. Because if you look purely at the margins year-over-year, you could reach a conclusion that it's getting worse. But frankly, like a few decisions we made in Q3 to expedite materials and spot buy to make sure that we could serve our customers well. And I wouldn't look at our Q3 margins as a indicator, especially the year-over-year change in Q3 margin as a indicator of supply chain. Our inventory levels are getting healthier, our lead times are improving, there is pockets of challenges remaining, especially on the high-end products, which are more dependent on microelectronics and semiconductors. But overall, things are getting better. And I think our guide implies that our Q4 margins on a year-over-year basis will be down less, significantly less than what we saw in q3. So I look at Q3 as a one-time impact of multiple different factors. So I would come back and reiterate Jeff that, no, our supply chains are getting better. Unless another shoe drops that we aren't aware of, we would expect most of the supply chain inefficiencies to be behind us no later than kind of mid next year. Sure. So the pricing for the new minimum efficiency products, I mean, when we talked about a double-digit benefit. And clearly, we're going to do our best to make sure that we get the appropriate price benefits. Currently, we remain very confident that will more than recover the additional costs associated with that. Clearly there are nuances which I won't get into in the call on which product series and what. But we remain confident that it's going to be a double-digit increase. And that's consistent with the higher costs and what we're hearing, like acceptable levels from our customers and channel partners. On the second side, yes, I mean, that's a good takeaway. I thought if I put three bullets on the headwind and eight bullets on the tailwind, I would naturally drive everybody to that conclusion that there are more tailwinds than headwinds. The biggest unknown there, Jeff, which we have talked about in the past is, how well is the replacement demand going to hold? We think it's going to hold well. We think the replacement versus repair equation is going to tilt more towards replacement, given the various dynamics, including higher labor costs for repair, and including the Inflation Reduction Act and other pieces that naturally drive people towards replacement. But yes, we'll give you more details in December. But I think that's a fair way to interpret what we said. From a percentage terms, we could probably give you a lot more color in December, as we finished launching all the higher SEER product change. But I mean, we do expect that number to be meaningful, in the first half of the year, we obviously will have a significant carryover benefit on pricing that comes through, and for the full year, there will be annual price increases, and there will be the mix and price benefits from regulatory changes. But at this point, Nicole, I would say I think it's best for us to wait until December, before we can give you like a range of price number. But what we are indicating is that it will be more than any volume decline that we are expecting at this stage on the financial side. Sure. So in our own distribution, which is where majority of our sales come from/ I think the inventory level is getting healthier, but we're still short on some of the higher end products. And, if we could, we would actually maintain more inventory to ensure that we have all the products that our customers need as they go into the SEER change, which does make it messy. On the independent distribution, which majority of the industry uses, we think inventory levels are getting healthier. In those areas, I do worry about an air pocket, sometime in the near future, driven by lead time improvements, and driven by sort of like the post minimum efficiency change, people may try and resize, the inventory. But I think that's not something we are experiencing now. And that air pocket probably going to be in early next year, as most people are being cautious and will want to keep inventory, sufficient inventory for the SEER change. We think that impacts us very little. Yes. I think, listen, we are working through all the details. And what we did is work backwards from our customers forecast and looked at how much capacity we would need five years from now, 10 years from now and work backwards through that. So the plant may start out with lower capacity, but it will be very much matched to the customer's demand. Other thing, remember, in Stuttgart, we are running much lower than nameplate capacity, given the local challenges and the labor availability. So at this stage, I don't want to give a number. But if it's sufficient to say this plant will give us capacity, at least for the next five to 10 years to keep serving our customers with the forecast they need. Our customers and us, both remain pretty optimistic about commercial replacement demand, especially as, they know the new regulations come in and the ESG benefits that the customers receive. But given a lot of sensitivities around construction timelines, and the impact on our existing facilities, I would rather not give exact details. But rest assured, we have a fairly detailed plan that will execute on within the next two years to make sure we can ramp and start production by the end of 2024 at the new facility. We've always talked about is more than 50%. I mean, the industry number typically hovers about 60%, 65% and we are in a similar range. That number is probably a little higher in 22. Just because the higher end products use more microelectronics and they remain in somewhat short supply but I would use a number of around 60 which is the industry average and that'll apply to us as well. 20, 24, 28, remember we make the highest SEER units and are very well known for that on those that typically go as part of our signature series products. That's where we are seeing shortages, which, unfortunately, like forces a dealer, not to be able to upsell. I mean, our dealers are really good at upselling and getting customers more energy efficient products. And we have just been constrained on that. But we do see that easing as well as we get into 2023. Ryan, as a CEO, I always believe we are the best in this, right? So listen, a lot of the changes are still being unveiled. We believe that our design with a, keep the box size the same. So the footprint remains optimized. We believe as we have put single stage technology that gives us competitive advantage. We believe our aluminum [heat] [ph] exchangers are better. But I think the most important difference is that for our products, a dealer does not have to change the indoor unit. And just by changing the outdoor unit, they can meet the higher efficiency standard. For many of our competitors, they got to change the indoor unit and the outdoor unit. So listen, I'm biased, but I think we've got a great solution. I think our dealers and end users are going to be well positioned. And we are looking forward to getting some share through the transition. While if you follow cricket that we are in the first inning, if you follow baseball, we are probably in the second or third inning on that one. Listen, we are in early innings, labor was a big challenge, we got that. But we're still no way close to meeting our customers full demand or the natural lead time. At minimum, our production should go up another 15%, 20% in the near future. And improving our manufacturing processes is a big deal. I mean, this is not acceptable level of productivity. And finally, now our suppliers have to ramp up with us and these are often smaller suppliers that we have led down in the past few years. So we are working through that. But early innings, probably the second or third inning on a baseball terminology. No, I think pretty much all of it is a balance between repair and replacement. We continue to believe that this is a non-discretionary spend. Now, would there be a small percentage that people will choose to live with a broken air conditioner, that always there but I think that's negligible. When we think it's purely a repair versus replacement, we're still working through the analysis. We have looked at other recessions and economic uncertain environments in the past. And we think this time around, if there is a softness, the repair versus replacement, will still turn more favorably towards replacement. So I think we continue to believe it's all non-discretionary, and answer that nobody knows. And we just have scenarios around it, is how much of repairs versus replacement trade-off is going to change in a time of economic uncertainty. And we'll do our best to dive it more towards replacement. Sure. Let me start with the inventory piece. Listen, I mean, as we go forward, I mean, we will probably shift that mix a little bit. So we'll have more fixed, more final finished goods, and less raw material. Right now we have higher raw material, given the supply chain lead times -- our own supply chain lead times. So I think that's going to shift a little bit. But overall, we are reaching fairly normal inventory levels. So I think majority of the buildup we have was returning back to normal finish go to level. And in future, we would see that trending in the same way. And in my factories, we always challenged them to say, hey, we will have less raw material, and our warehouses need more finished goods to serve our customers better. But I don't think we break it out historically. And we won't do that right now. Second one, on the component cost side, we are expecting inflation, and we will continue expecting inflation for a few months, they always lag commodities. And our supply team, in some cases, has negotiated some excellent contracts, which means that there's no pricing for next year, maybe index to commodity pricing this year. I mean, that always creates a six to 12-month lag. I think based on that we would expect components to continue being inflationary. But if we take components, commodities, our material cost reduction initiative, put it all together. next year, that will be a positive versus a negative this year. So, this year that was in a net negative in terms of headwind to us. Next year, putting the whole package together will be a tailwind to us and we'll break that out for you in December. Yes, right before the call, I met Joe Nassab, our President and COO of Commercial, and he said, we got to strike a balance. So I'm going to use his words on making sure we are demonstrating and celebrating progress but acknowledging that we have lots and lots of hard work still ahead of us. The improvements on $100 million is still going to be spread over the next two to three years. A lot of that's going to come with higher output because our output is still way below nameplate capacity at Stuttgart, a lot of that's going to come from just manufacturing efficiency. I mean, just our number shows that we have increased staffing by 30%, but output only by 15%. So we should be able to make 15% more products without adding any labor, just simple math on that. And then, there's a lot more benefit that comes from improving our manufacturing processes. I mean, you don't get to the state we got in April with robust manufacturing processes. So we need to establish those processes. And then, finally, as we take the step forward towards SEER change, the price mix benefit that we talked about in residential, also applies to commercial, where some of our national account contract had artificially constrained us on our pricing levels. Put it all together, I mean we are confident of the $100 million, we think it's going to be in three years or less, I hope to deliver it in two but we commit to delivering it in at least three. Sure. So you're correct that our heat pump exposure is less than some of our peers, mostly because we serve or have a higher share in the North versus the South. I look it as a huge opportunity for us to increase heat pump penetration. We had strong growth this quarter, just like previous few quarters in heat pumps. Our new cold climate heat pump technology gives us an edge over our competition as heat pump penetration goes from South to North. And I believe Inflation Reduction Act is going to make a meaningful difference for us to increase heat pump penetration and often use the Inflation Reduction Act to go with dual fuel system where you have a heat pump and a furnace in areas where heat pump may not work in the coldest few months but work very well for the remaining nine to ten months. So there are lot more opportunities ahead for us, love to talk and show more of some of these points during the Investor Day. But pretty exciting opportunity for us and the rest of the industry I think it gives us more favorable benefit given our low penetration and our cold climate, the heat pump technology. Potentially going to still remain very hard, part of it is, it needs to flow down to states and each of the states come up with their own local regulation. We know it's positive. I don't know if any of us, our sort of peers can give you actual quantification. We can probably point to themes and I'm looking at Joe and he's kind of nodding it, yes, I think it's going to be hard to quantify the exact impact, just because it hasn't flown down to states and utilities and how it's actually going to be implemented. We serve mostly through the direct on the Lennox and then with Allied and Heatcraft we do go to the independent channel. I would say the growth was similar across the Board. We historically don't break it out but right now the growth was similar across the Board. They're not meaningful enough for us to point it out here. No, I don't think we said that the market is pricing elastic. I think what we have to do as industry players, is make sure that we serve our customers best with the right solution. The repair was a replacement dynamics. I'm not saying there'll be no shift. In fact, earlier in the call, we did talk about that there may be a potential shift and what we are doing is preparing for that. I don't think any market ever 100% price in elastic. But the current dynamics do favor more replacement versus repair given some of the factors we talked about. I don't think those SEER change pricing is artificial. I mean, I think that's real. There is real costs associated with it, there's real benefits associated with it, it's driven by regulation that impacts the whole industry but there are lot of unknowns. Our job as leaders is to be prepared for those unknowns and react in the best interest of our shareholders as those different factors play on, Steve. So first of all, let me thanks for bringing up the cost of install, because to a consumer, the cost of equipment is often less than the cost of install. But that obviously depends on whether you are in Topeka, Kansas, or whether you're in New York City. I mean, that obviously varies substantially based on the cost of labor. But the cost of equipment on average is less than half of the total cost to the consumer, given the cost of installing and supplies and labor and other pieces that are put out on to that. We don't have a number, because it does vary so much to give you in terms of what's the average cost of install and the industry data that you can, I'm sure well aware of. But in our view that has gone up substantially as well over the past few years. And last thing I would say there is a benefit to the consumer with higher SEER changes as lower electricity cost. Most consumers may not see that on their daily bills or may not be fully aware of it, but there is a benefit to the consumer in terms of lower energy consumption that is meaningful when energy prices are at a record high sometimes. Specifically to the R-22 unit, you have to consider the cost of refrigerant along with many other factors such as the age of the equipment, the potential life left in the compressors and the motors. So you're right. I mean, it's not just that. I mean we look at that as a significant installed base, that's upcoming due for replacement anyway and the fact that the refrigerant cost is much higher gives our dealers an opportunity to talk to the homeowner about how it can be replaced with a more efficient unit, more environmentally friendly refrigerant with warranty, with potential benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act in terms of rebates. So I think it's a whole package, you got to look together. Yes, there is a huge debate, and we are part of that debate, in terms of repair versus replacement and I think you and I have talked about before -- nobody knows the answer, they're all different models. And our goal as a team to drive it towards replacement that's beneficial to the consumer, but be prepared towards any possibilities. If the consumer chooses repair, we want to make sure we provide them with the repair parts and then we'll talk to the -- if it shifts in that dynamic we'll come and talk to you all about here the shift we are seeing. I think it starts in some states next year and in some of the states which are faster to roll this out and I do expect like the -- along the coast you might see it sooner. Some of it will be in 2024. I mean, it is a good piece for our dealers to be able to start talking about it now. I mean, if you see from press releases from us and all our competition, it's already being used and there are already some rebates available with utilities and states that are not tied to IRA. But this gives our dealer an opportunity to go talk to consumer about a rebate that may already be existing. But the actual impact of IRA, I think it starts in \u201823 and goes into '24 and it's just hard to quantify without knowing full details of the roll out yet. Yes. I think we mentioned in the script that the pricing for commercial was 9%, the total growth was 20%, so you think of it 11% from core unit volume and 9% from pricing. We don't typically break out order information. But I mean the orders remain healthy and currently are at or above our sales rate. So our backlog continues to build and in addition to the backlog or a book, there's also anticipated demand as many of the key customers are working with us on planned replacements here as they need to meet their ESG criteria. And at least here there's a very sophisticated decision about repair versus replacement because through our national account service, we have huge insights into potential break down than replacements coming up. So it's all positive in terms of, I think pricing is picking up, volumes holding strong and we have good insights into orders on the book and future orders beyond what's in the book. So a couple of things, right. Overall, for Lennox, our margins are going to go up in the future. So I think the current margin levels are lower than what I expect a year from now, two years from now or three years from now and we'll talk more about that on the Investor Day. Q4, specifically you're right, margins are seasonally low and quite a few of our manufacturing lines are going to go through a transition as we shift to minimum efficiency products, especially on the commercial side. Hence, we hinted that in Q4, the commercial margins may take a step back, but that's planned change over where our factories lines need to be just reworked and shut down to support the new products. But overall on margins, listen we were a little disappointed with the resi margins this quarter but we understand some of the one-time factors and the mix impact. We are cautiously guarded for Q4 but we are optimistic about margins in the future. Like as we look at 2023 and beyond. I know that that was part of the concern and the equation we went through. There may be a short-term softness two years from now which none of us would know. First of all, I think the new facility gives us a lot of flexibility. I mentioned in my script that the hourly labor costs at the new facility would be 80% lower than our hourly labor cost at our current facility. Also, the new facility is close to our residential facility, which gives us flexibility in moving labor around if we need to between an optimizing it collectively, as Lennox International. So yes, I think we will have significant flexibility to react as we have done in the past, in terms of ensuring that margin degradation is minimal as we go through any volume decline based on external factors. Having two facility will give us a lot more flexibility than if we only had one when things went south economically."

            "content": "Thank you, Alok and good morning, everyone. Looking at the quarter for Lennox International overall, the company posted record third quarter revenue and profit. Revenue was $1.24 billion up 17% as reported and up 18% at constant currency primarily driven by volume growth and price. GAAP operating income was a third quarter record $186 million up 14%, and in the chart, you see the total segment profit rose 15% to a third quarter record $189 million. Total segment margin was 15.2% down 30 basis points primarily due to supply chain inefficiencies and lower mix driven by manufacturing constraints on higher end products. GAAP EPS was up 17% to a third quarter record $3.99 and adjusted EPS rose 21% to a third quarter record $4.10. Now moving to the business segments starting on Slide 7, you see a record third quarter for residential in revenue in profit. Residential revenue grew 17% to $835 million. Volume was up 7%, price was up 10% in the quarter. Residential replacement and new construction sales were both up high teens with new construction growing faster. Residential segment profit rose 7% to $154 million. Segment margin contracted 190 basis points to 18.4% due to lower mix as we were unable to increase output of hiring units due to the component shortages. Regarding Lennox Stores, we opened four new locations in the third quarter to bring our total store count to 239. We expect to end the year with approximately 245 stores. Now turning to Slide 8 in commercial business, revenue was $253 million in the quarter up 20% led by strong growth in national account business. Commercial price was up 9% and mix was up 11%. Commercial segment profit was up 31% and segment margin expanded 100 basis points to 11.7%. Commercial demand and backlog remain strong and our Arkansas factory recovery continues to progress well. We have recruited and hired the number of employees we need for the factory. The daily output is increasing and we continue to make progress on improving processes and productivity. Now turning to Slide 9 in our refrigeration business. Revenue was $157 million for the third quarter up 14% as reported, and up 21% at constant currency. Price was up 16%, volume was up 5%, foreign exchange had a negative 7% impact. Revenue growth was led by North America up more than 20%, Europe revenue was up 2% as reported and up 20% at constant currency. Overall for the refrigeration segment profit rose 54% to $22 million and segment margin expanded 370 basis points to 14.3%. Refrigeration demand and backlogs remain strong. Turning to Slide 10, let's review our 2022 full year guidance. We now expect revenue growth for the full year of 12% to 15% compared to the prior range of 10% to 15%. For the industry, we continue to assume low single digit shipment growth in North American residential markets, and mid-single digit shipment growth in North American commercial unitary and refrigeration markets. We are updating our guidance for GAAP and adjusted EPS for the full year to a range of $13.80 to $14.20, compared to the prior range of $13.80 to $14.50. Now looking at the puts and takes that are changing. Price is now expected to be a $425 million benefit for the year, a yield of 10%, which is up $25 million from our prior guide $400 million. Residential mix is now expected to be a $45 million headwind for the full year compared to our prior guidance of a $25 million headwind. The mix headwind is attributed to the shortage of higher end products as supply chain constraints continue to limit production of our Dave Lennox Signature Series. Commodity cost inflation is now expected to be $120 million, down $10 million from our prior guidance of $130 million. However, we are still seeing inflationary pressures on components and other materials and now expect $120 million headwind compared to prior guidance of a $100 million headwind. Supply related factory disruptions are now expected to be a $25 million headwind compared to prior guidance of a $15 million headwind. Interest and pension expense guidance is now $40 million, up from our prior guidance of $35 million. And as we invest more in inventory for supply chain resiliency, buying ahead of continued component price increases and the minimum efficient regulatory transition, free cash flow is now expected to be approximately $300 million for the year, compared to prior guidance of $400 million. And stock repurchase guidance is now $300 million for the year, which has been completed, compared to our prior guidance of $400 million. The effective tax rate will be approximately 19% for the full year. Now for the guidance points that are not changing. Freight costs are still expected to be a $20 million headwind. We still expect corporate expenses to be $95 million. And we are still planning for $125 million of capital spending. And we still expect a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 36 million shares for the full year. And with that, let's turn to Slide 11. And I'll turn it back over to Alok to talk to you about our thoughts on 2023 at this time. I will also add to that. Nicole, we expect to be more price cost positive than we were here in 2022. And just to make one more point, the air pocket is more attributable to those that go through to step distribution versus our direct to dealer model. Right. Yes. When I sort of step away and look at things year-over-year, particularly in the fourth quarter, I think what we're going to see is more of an impact on the commercial business and fourth quarter margins. We had better margins last year in the fourth quarter. And because of the challenges we have in that business, that's going to be the biggest drag in the fourth quarter on margins. The challenges in the residential business, we intentionally made some investments, to procure inventory to make sure we can serve our customers. And that simply came at a higher cost, which we don't expect to repeat in the fourth quarter of the same degree. And then, our refrigeration business continues to do very well. Net-net, we expect margins for the fourth quarter, even though we typically don't give guidance. I'll give you a little bit insight here, flattish to up slightly in the fourth quarter. Yes, I'll start with the reduction and the buyback. What we did in over the last few months is continue to evaluate what we need production wise to meet end market demand, and continue to look for opportunities to create slack in our supply chain, and also fend off component price increases that will stick come January 1. So we made additional investments in inventory, in lieu with share repurchases, to make sure that we had adequate supply to support our customers going into critically important time in 2023. So that's the trade-off there. And we'll continue to do things with -- the share repurchases to target our desired leverage points of between one and two. We've talked historically about targeting between 1.5 and 2. I think we want to be closer to the midpoint as we embark on 2023. And with respect to free cash flow conversion going forward, the way that I would do it, Julian, is start with the assumption that we're going to deliver free cash flow that approximates net income, and then take the incremental spend of the new manufacturing facility for commercial and adjust cash flow accordingly for that, and that should give you a pretty good proxy, what the next two years cash flow looks like. I think there's also some other variables in play that point things toward -- more towards a replacement versus repair scenario, one is the ultimate 22 dynamic where, there's still a significant number of our 22 units installed, where it's going to be difficult if not punitive to find that refrigerant. Should that be unnecessary repair? Secondly is the minimum efficiency change. So I think that will help us a little bit. And then also, incentives for heat pumps, electrification and all that with government incentives, I think all of that points towards maybe a lower price tag for a replacement scenario, compared to escalating costs in a repair situation. So I think those dynamics are more closely aligned than they were in previously, economic tough times. I'm going to wait until December to clarify that for you, if you don't mind. We still have a lot of work to do on our plan, et cetera, in all of that. So there's lots of moving pieces, various scenarios that we're whittling down at this time. So I don't think it'll be significantly different than wanting to stay will be higher, but it won't be significantly higher than that where it is today. Yes. A little more complicated than that given the way the transition is particularly on residential, where you can still sell 13 SEER in the North. It just had to be manufactured by December 31st of this year. So I think that's something that will scale that number back a bit. I'm not going to give you the math because I'm not certain of it. So I'm not going to lay it on the table. But I just want to play those dynamics back to you because once again, it is a very difficult thing to get our hands around roughly 50% of the revenue, 60% of the units are minimum efficiency. So you start there and then like I said, you need to consider the timing of the transition and the way that it's laid out in North versus South particularly on the residential side to come up with a tighter number around that. We may give you more color around that in December, but I'm not prepared to do that at this time. Yes, we do break it out in the 10-Q, what Alok was talking about is in our formal presentation and prepared remarks, that's what he's referring to. Yes. To Alok's point, I think both channels performed almost on par with each other this quarter. In addition to that also remind you, I think everyone knows these are variable -- our costs are roughly 85% variable when it comes to product costs. So it's not a high capital-intensive business, where it would be catastrophic to decremental margins should volume decline."

At the request of your host, all lines are currently in a listen-only mode. There will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Harrison, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSteve Harrison: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for this review of Lennox International's financial performance for the second quarter of 2022. I'm here today with CEO, Alok Maskara; and CFO, Joe Reitmeier. Alok will discuss the highlights from the quarter and key strategic developments and Joe will take you through the company's financial performance and outlook for 2022. After that, Alok will provide closing comments and take us into Q&A. To give everyone time to ask questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to a couple of questions or follow-ups and re-queue for any additional questions. The earnings release with GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, today\u2019s presentation slides, and the webcast link for today\u2019s conference call are available on our website at www.lennoxinternational.com. The webcast also will be archived on the site for replay. All comparisons mentioned today are against the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Turning to Slide 2, I would like to remind everyone that in the course of this call, to give you a better understanding of our operations, we will be making certain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. For information concerning these risks and uncertainties, see Lennox International's publicly available filings with the SEC. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Now, let me turn the call over to CEO, Alok Maskara.\nAlok Maskara: Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I have enjoyed meeting with many of you since I started on May 9 and I look forward to more conversations so that I can continue to get insights and perspectives from all our key shareholders. I'm happy to kick off my first Lennox earnings call by reporting a record quarter with record revenue, record EBIT, and record EPS driven by strong growth. Before I begin, I want to thank all our employees for their hard work towards improving service levels given the global supply chain disruptions. It is their hard work and perseverance that has enabled us to deliver record revenues and profits. Please turn to Slide 3, where I want to highlight four key messages. One, we had a record quarter driven by continued strong execution in our Residential and Refrigeration segments. Company revenue was a record at more than 1.3 billion, up 10%. Adjusted earnings per share was a record as well at $5 per share, up nearly 10%. Our turnaround efforts in our commercial factory in Stuttgart remains on track and we are pleased with the sequential improvement in our quarterly results. However, supply chain disruptions continue to constrain production and our ability to meet strong demand. Second, we continue our disciplined capital allocation strategy as we repurchased 100 million of stock and paid 33 million in dividends in the second quarter as we generated $97 million in cash from operations in the quarter. Third, the company continued to advance its strategic priorities with a focus on innovation and ESG. I will talk more about these in a moment, but we are the first company to complete the Department of Energy's Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge and we recently published our latest ESG report that includes the company's science based targets. Fourth, we are increasing our full-year revenue guidance and are also raising the low end of our full-year EPS guidance range. Now please turn to Slide 4 to discuss the company's recognition for being the first to achieve the objectives of the DOE Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge. Homeowners in colder climates have traditionally relied on fossil fuel heating for their homes. The DOE challenge was created to accelerate cold climate heat pump advancements for colder climates and revolutionized the HVAC industry with a solution that offers comfortable cooling and heating, while significantly lowering greenhouse gas emissions. In June, I was honored to host the Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, who traveled to the Dallas area to recognize the Lennox team for the accomplishments and advancements in affordable, clean and efficient heating and cooling solutions. Lennox takes great pride in designing, manufacturing, and delivering the most efficient climate controlled products on the market. Even before the challenge, the Lennox advanced technology team was already working on the development of a Cool Climate Heat Pump to add to our extensive line of best-in-class heat pump products already on the market. The cold climate heat pump represents our dedication as a company to accelerating environmental sustainability through ongoing product innovations, advances in efficiency gains, and greenhouse cat emission reduction targets. Turning to Slide 5, our 2021 ESG report has been published and is now available on our website. Beyond our leadership in heat pumps and dedication to decarbonization, our latest ESG report highlights that our emission reduction targets are now approved by the science based target initiative. This initiative is focused on climate action in-line with the goals of the Paris agreement to help prevent the worst impacts of climate change. The ESG report covers how we are meeting or exceeding our improvement targets in environmental, as well as the continual progress we are making in diversity and inclusion, and of course strong governance is fundamental and the bedrock of Lennox. I encourage all our stakeholders to read the report and continue following our ESG progress. Now, I will hand the call over to Joe to discuss the second quarter financials on Slide 6. \nJoe Reitmeier: Thank you, Alok, and good morning, everyone. Looking at the second quarter for Lennox International overall, the company posted record revenue of $1.37 billion, up 10% as reported and up 11% at constant currency. GAAP operating income was a record $227 million, up 5%, and in the chart, you see that total segment profit rose 4% to a new record $230 million. Total segment margin was 16.8%, down 110 basis points, primarily due to inflationary pressures, global supply chain disruptions, and factory inefficiencies. GAAP EPS was a record $4.96, up 10% and adjusted EPS was a record $5, up 9%. Moving to the business segments, starting on Slide 7, you will see a record quarter for residential in revenue and profit. Against the 30% prior year revenue growth comparison, residential revenue came in at a record $978 million, up 17%. Price was up 13% and volume was up 5%. Mix was down 1% as we still saw supply constraints on our high-end products in the second quarter and we expect this to be the case through the second half of the year.  Residential replacement sales were up mid-teens and new construction was up high-teens. Residential segment profit rose 14% to a record $216 million. Segment margin contracted 50 basis points to 22.1%. Cooling degree days were favorable in the prior year quarter in the Southeast and South Central regions in the U.S. but cooler elsewhere. We opened two new Lennox stores in the second quarter and are targeting 20 to 30 new stores this year [weighted] [ph] to the second half, and we now have 235 Lennox stores. Now, turning to Slide 8 in our commercial business. Revenue was $220 million, down 13%. Volume was down 22%, price was up 4%, and mix was up 5%. Commercial segment profit was down 62% to $17 million, and segment margin contracted 1,010 basis points to 7.8%. Commercial end market replacement demand remains strong and we have made significant progress in hiring factory direct labor at our factory in Arkansas to support that, but supply chain disruptions continue to significantly impact the equipment business. Commercial improved sequentially in the second quarter and we focused on prioritizing key national account customers and school business during the summer months. We announced a third commercial price increase of August 1 and continue to expect commercial improvement in the second half of the year. Looking at our Refrigeration business on Slide 9, you see second quarter record revenue and profit. Refrigeration revenue was $169 million, up 14% as reported, price was up 12%. Volume was up 9% and mix was down 1%. Foreign exchange had a negative 6% impact, so revenue growth at constant currency was 20%, led by more than 30% growth in North America. Order rates and backlog remained strong and in Europe, Refrigeration revenue was up high single digits at constant currency, Europe commercial HVAC was up mid-single-digits at constant currency. The geopolitical environment is weighing on the market regionally and supply chain disruptions continue to impact our European operations. Overall, for the Refrigeration segment, profit rose 73% to $23 million and segment margin expanded 470 basis points to 13.8%. Turning to Slide 10. Let's review our 2022 full-year guidance. We are raising revenue growth guidance to 10% to 15% up from a prior range of 7% to 11%. For the industry, we continue to assume low-single-digit shipment growth in the North American Residential market and mid-single-digit shipment growth in North American Commercial unitary and Refrigeration markets. We are raising the low-end of our guidance for GAAP and adjusted EPS to a range of $13.80 to $14.50, compared to the prior range of $13.50 to $14.50. Price is now expected to be a $400 million benefit for the year, which is a 9.5% yield and this is up from our prior guidance of $335 million in price. Residential mix is expected to be a $25 million headwind for the full-year, compared to the prior year guidance of being neutral. This is primarily due to continued supply disruptions that are impacting the high-end of our product lines. Commodity cost inflation is now expected to be $130 million, down from the prior guidance of $140 million. However, we are still seeing inflationary pressures on components and other materials and now expect a $100 million headwind, compared to prior guidance of a $70 million headwind for other components. Factoring efficiencies are now expected to be a $15 million headwind, compared to prior guidance of being neutral and freight costs are now expected to be a headwind of $20 million, up from prior guidance of $15 million. Interest and pension expense guidance is $35 million, down from prior guidance of $40 million. Other guidance points are not changing. We still expect corporate expense to be $95 million. The effective tax rate is still expected to be between 18% to 20% and foreign exchange is still expected to be neutral for the full-year. We are planning for $125 million capital expenditures, and then regarding free cash flow for this year, the third quarter has a solid start with continued hot weather, and as we get into the other side of the summer season, we have more of a read on macroeconomic \u2013 on the macroeconomic environment with rising interest rates, as well as the supply chain and our progress of converting raw materials and whip into finished goods and shipments, we will know more. We are maintaining free cash flow guidance of approximately $400 million this time for the full-year, as well as $400 million of total stock repurchases for the year with $300 million already completed. We still expect a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 36 million for the full-year. Now with that, let's turn to Slide 11 and I'll turn it back over to Alok.\nAlok Maskara: Thank you, Joe. Looking at the second half, we are mindful of a potential slowdown in the U.S. economy. And with interest rates rising, a potential decline in residential new construction. We are prepared and have contingency plans in place, but to be clear, that's not what we are seeing in our business today. Demand continues to run ahead of our ability to fully satisfy our customers as supply chain constraints persist. Due to the supply chain challenges, factory inefficiencies continue to impact performance, especially at our Arkansas factory for commercial. As we look ahead, we have a strong backlog and order rates across residential, commercial, and refrigeration.  Commodity inflation is easing and our ongoing productivity and material cost initiatives will positively impact the business and be evident as the supply chain normalizes. Before we go to Q&A, let me close our prepared remarks on Slide 12, by summarizing why I believe Lennox is a great company and what excites me most about being the CEO of Lennox. A company with 127 years of history and a [Technical Difficulty] value driven culture. We are the leader in energy efficient climate control solutions operating in high growth end market with strong replacement demand. We have an ESG mindset and are narrowly focused on HVACR. The company has innovative products with a unique direct to dealer network and we have a history of robust execution and disciplined capital deployment. Thank you for listening. Joe and I will be happy to take your questions now. Operator, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We're going to start question-and-answer with the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you very much and welcome, Alok. I hope it's been a smooth start so far. I suppose\u2026\nAlok Maskara: Thanks Julian. Good morning. Excited to be here.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning. Maybe just a first question around that commercial business and how you're thinking about the pace of margin improvement there as you go through the third and fourth quarters, it does sound like you're becoming more satisfied or less dissatisfied with the, sort of plant efficiency there. So, what kind of maybe margin exit rate could we see entering into 2023, for example, in the Commercial segment?\nAlok Maskara : Julian, great question. I would hate to give you a number now. We are still in the midst of a turnaround. And I was pleased to see sequential improvement and our long-term goal of getting that business to an 18% to 20% range in margin still remains valid, but given the shortage of components that \u2013 not just Lennox, the whole industry is facing right now, and the disruption in supply, I think it's a little early for us to give a specific number for Q3 and Q4. Our focus on commercial remains serving our customers, protecting our key accounts, serving our school based, and personally, I will be expecting small, but steady sequential improvements in the business going forward. But it's going to be slower than our like, slower than our shareholders would like, but we are making good steady progress, Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: That's good to hear. Thank you. And then maybe my second question just around the, sort of any sense of the weighting of earnings between Q3 and Q4, anything unusual this year because of price cost and in terms of how that plays out? And I guess to, sort of put a finer point on it, if we're looking at say Slide 10, you've got a very good summary on the right hand side that you ran through. If we're thinking about the price of [400] [ph] and the commodity cost of minus 130, how do we think about those in the second half versus the first half, those two numbers?\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes. Julian, I think you can almost mirror the price where we've got 400 million of price out there, 225 million we've already captured first half, 175 million second half. I would split the cost almost accordingly with respect to that, and then the cadence or seasonality of earnings, I think we're getting more and more close to what I would characterize as more routine or normal seasonality within our business. Last year it was a little bit disrupted given the strong first half we have when we were up significantly first half and then things seem to slow down second half. Things seem to be just the opposite this year, where we had a little bit slower start. The first half largely because of the tough comps, but that momentum continues in the second half. And I think once again, we'll get back to more normal earnings seasonality, if you were to look back to 2017, 2018 timeframe.\nAlok Maskara: And Julian, I would just add to that to remind that the second half pricing is going to appear to be lower just because we start lapping ourselves on price increases that we did last year. So, it doesn't mean we are giving back price or anything, like we are clearly going to hold price, right.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thanks Alok, and Joe.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: Good morning, guys.\nAlok Maskara: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Hammond: So, just back on commercial, how are you thinking about, kind of the balance between the headwinds being supply chain and the headwinds being labor and just, kind of update us on progress on recapturing the labor in Stuttgart? And any thoughts around, kind of diversifying production within commercial long-term?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So, I think commercial turnaround remains a huge focus of ours. On the labor situation, the actions we took earlier in the year are bearing fruit and we are now meeting our hiring goals and our retention goals. So, I think while you don't declare victory on that, I think labor situation is now under control and our biggest bottleneck at this stage remains availability of components and improving factory processes to get the right quality output. I guess from a going forward perspective, as I look at supply chain, clearly, we got to diversify our supply chain, get more than one supplier, but there are some industry wide part shortages that we are dealing with. And that remains our focus. On your longer-term question, Jeff, yes, I mean, listen, this is a growth industry. We have previously talked about our desire to have a second factory and we remain committed to that thought process. We're going to go a little slower than what we may have thought simply because if we take a factory with poor processes and replicate it, I will have two factories with poor processes. So, I think we're going to take our time to make the right decision, find the right location, and improve the processes, but be on the lookout. When we have the Investor Day in December, we'll give you more color on it, Jeff, but we remain committed to expanding capacity and winning back the share that we might have lost through this disruption.\nJeff Hammond: Okay, great. That's good color, Alok. Just on some of the early feedback on this seer and some of the regulatory changes and the cost price component into 2023 around that has been coming in higher. And I'm just \u2013 maybe just speak to one, your readiness for the change in kind of the redesigns you're doing and what you think the inflation around the regulatory changes into 2023 look like? Thanks.\nAlok Maskara : Sure. So, the answer is, we are 100% ready. This is a smaller change than what us and the industry have dealt with in the past. We went from 10 to 13 in the past. I mean, we are going from 13 to 14, not 14 to 15. So, I think we are 100% ready and I believe overall the whole industry is going to be ready. We are in the most inflationary time that we have ever seen in our careers, at least a few of us. So, clearly, I think this is a great opportunity for us and the industry to make sure that we capture the full value of the seer change in pricing. We intend to do so. So, I think if you're seeing indication in the industry that the price is going to be better, I think that's good discipline and that helps us to invest more in products that are environmentally friendlier and the newer technology. So, we are 100%. The value will be captured in price and if anything, I think the industry margin should expand because of the change. And I don't expect any huge stock up or pre-buy just because at least we still remain in a supply constrained environment, not a demand constrained environment.\nJeff Hammond : Okay. Good color. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the new role. Hello.\nAlok Maskara: Thank you.\nGautam Khanna: I have a couple of questions. First, I was curious if you could speak to \u2013 the long-term framework that the company has provided in the past for financial guidance has been somewhere around mid-single-digit sales growth of 30% incrementals. Do you agree \u2013 do you largely buy into that framework?\nAlok Maskara: I do. And the reason we didn't talk about long-term guidance this quarter because there is no change to it. So, there is no update and I think we have previously said that, I wouldn't expect any updates just because there's a new CEO. I mean, if we need to change things because of macroeconomic conditions or something else, but yes, I mean, I risk the incrementals of 35% and I'm looking at Joe is smiling as I say that, but no, there is no change or update to that Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And we've seen a dip in copper, aluminum, and steel costs. Could you update us on how quickly those could \u2013 the spot rates that we've seen in the last quarter can flow through the P&L and what you mentioned component costs are still rising? And so, just maybe if you could square the percentage of COGS that comes from [raws] [ph] versus components and how it all kind of could [nets] [ph] benefit next year, if at all?\nAlok Maskara : Sure. At this stage, as commodity cost ease, I mean, Joe already mentioned that we have reduced some of our guidance range from \u2013 by $10 million, if the cost is more, we might see slightly more benefits, but frankly, most of the benefit of any commodity easing is likely to be in 2023 because given the inventory we hold and the pre-buys, we all have done for locking in commodity pricing, the impact is going to be in the Q4 2023 timeframe. I'll let Joe talk about, sort of the walk between the different pieces, but keep in mind that beyond the commodity and the component costs, we have many other inflationary pressures such as labor costs, such as healthcare costs, such as real estate costs, but Joe, please feel free to add any more color to that.\nJoe Reitmeier : Yes, I think that's correct. We did take the commodity guide down 10 million and that's for the benefit of what we see in the second half of the year, net of our hedge positions. And if commodity costs remain where they're at today, what we'll see is we'll see a lift in the second half of 2023. Once again largely become [aware] [ph] prices were in the first half and then also where we have prices locked in with our hedge positions.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And just a last one. Have you seen any \u2013 if you could talk about the supply chain, where things still are \u2013 what your visibility is to things improving? Where are pinch points getting worse? Where they've been stable? Where are they getting better? Just if you could talk to that?\nAlok Maskara : Sure. So, I'll say for things such as freight and availability of freight, things are getting better. So, I think that's an industry wide phenomenon. We like that. If you look at availability of sort of components, it's a mixed bag. I think there are quite a few components, which is getting better, but in some commercial components, we seem to be facing industry wide shortages, right. So, I think that's something that we have to continue watching out for. The whole issue around semiconductor microchips, I mean, that remains our biggest pinch point right now. And despite redesigns, despite adding vendors, we still expect to see significant improvement only in early 2023 at this stage, but net-net, the positive here is that things are no longer getting worse. I mean for the longest time as we looked at it, we kept finding new things as we played [whack em' all] [ph]. So we're still playing a bit of [whack em' all] [ph], but it's on existing things and we don't see anything specifically getting worse. But every time I say something positive, I turn out to be wrong here. So, let's be cautious as we go forward. The team is working extremely hard. We have a very talented team that continuously watches and monitors the performance of our supplier base.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you and good morning, everyone.\nAlok Maskara: Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, Alok. Hey, Joe. A lot of ground code already. I'd be interested in a little bit more context from, kind of an overall portfolio thought process Alok. You expressed a lot of comfort and the fact that you like that the company is basically a pure play company. So, it doesn't sound like you have big strategic moves on your mind, but as you've settled in there a little bit and looked at the portfolio, do you see opportunities for bolt-ons in various areas? Also a lot of discussion about commercial, but I just wonder about refrigeration and what work you might need to do there that to get the margins on even better trajectory?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So Jeff, I think the view hasn't changed. We like being focused. We like being HVACR and we will continue doing so. So, yes, if your big strategic thing means if I'm going to go buy a smoke alarm company probably not. I mean, we're not going to be doing that. So, I think from that perspective, that's good. But being a smaller player in a larger industry, we have another lower market share among the Top 4 companies. We see tons of opportunities for bolt-on. Tons of opportunities for product expansion. Tons of opportunities for geographic expansions within U.S. and outside U.S. So, yes, I do see significant opportunities there. On Refrigeration, it's a good business. There are pockets that are better than others and that's a review that's ongoing for us as we look through it. Of course, our short-term focus is to improve the performance of the business. I believe every business unit within the Refrigeration segment has an opportunity to do better and that's what I want the team to focus on. As we look through the overall situation and come back and present to you in December on how we will take each of our business segments to a higher margin level. So, still remain very excited about the portfolio, still continue to evaluate lots of bolt-on and partnership opportunities, and yes, we would not be going into far adjacencies in any big bold strategic move because I think that's not who Lennox is.\nJeff Sprague: Great. And could you elaborate a little bit on how you're thinking about share gain or share recapture? I would assume it's maybe a, kind of a dealer oriented strategy, but I'll let you answer. Any color there would be appreciated.\nAlok Maskara: Sure, Jeff. I think the first thing for us is to be able to restore our supply and manner fracturing capability. We had a history of share gain or maintaining share. And ever since the Marshalltown tornado, we have struggled to recapture share or gain share. So, our first focus is going to be restoring our manufacturing capability. So, salespeople, instead of apologizing to dealers for not having products, are going to spend more time getting new dealers on board. So, I think that's our number one piece, right. Second for us is relying on our innovative new products. And we have quite a few, but again given supply conditions, we have not been able to fully market and launch those to gain share. Let's take heat pumps as an example that we talked about. Third one is just proven strategy, opening new stores. When we didn't have enough products, we didn't open new stores because those stores would be half empty, but as we get inventory to be in a better spot, you're going to go back to opening new stores. And yes, if I package it all together, of course, we need to add more dealers, of course, we got to get back into the commercial, the curbside replacement business, which we have, sort of walked away from. And of course, we got to expand our geographical footprint. There are pockets of U.S. where our market share is much lower just because of our historical footprint and no other reason. So, I'm very excited about the opportunity to gain share. We believe we have strong value propositions and our dealers love our value proposition that we are direct-to-market and don't have to go through a distributor all the time. So, I think there's lots of opportunities and we'll tell you more in December, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks. Good luck.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: Thanks. I wanted to go back to the question about the SEER change impact for 2023, how much are you raising prices on basis for 2023 because of the SEER change?\nAlok Maskara : Ryan, we haven't declared the price for our 2023 lineup yet, but at minimum if you think we are going from 13 to 14 or 14 to 15, you should think of that being baked into the price, right? This percentage SEER change baked into percentage price, but clearly, there are many more complicating factors and it depends also on where we are in the inflationary cycle, but yes, we do expect to capture that on price, but we haven't announced a price level for our 23 line [indiscernible], Ryan.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. And what percent of sales would this change impact?\nAlok Maskara: As you know, the lowest or sort of the base layer typically accounts to 50% to 60% of the industry sales and we expect the new SEER would be about the same. Now, we hope to use the opportunity to upsell the consumers on a higher SEER product because we still make the, like the highest SEER products in the industry. But I think a 50% to 60% number, Ryan, which has historically been true, will remain for the shutdown.\nRyan Merkel: Okay, makes sense. And then I will follow-up on commercial. There's a view that commercial could buffer potentially slower resi demand in Q3. So, how is quoting and booking trends looking? And do you have enough backlog that extends into [Technical Difficulty], such that there could be a buffer?\nAlok Maskara : April resi slows, which as we mentioned earlier, we haven't seen signs in our order book, but it could be masked because of the weather patterns we're having. Yes, I do think commercial should be a buffer. A, based on volume; b, for us also based on the margin opportunity, because remember our commercial margin opportunity is probably larger than others, given that our current state is challenging. The whole industry, not just us, at this point, we are sold out for 2022. So yes, we do have backlog for 2023 as well, but some of those backlog is still tentative as we work through pricing, availability, and design. In the short-term, we are extremely busy just in the 2022 order, but as residential slows, I agree with you, Ryan. I think commercial should give us buffering both from volume and from margin perspective.\nRyan Merkel: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning all and welcome to the call.\nAlok Maskara : Good morning, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Just want to follow-up on an earlier comment, Joe, that I think you made in terms of recognizing commodity deflation, really more in the second half of 2023 based on the hedges. I guess that sounds like, I don't know, couple of quarters later than history. And I guess as it pertains to steel, I'm kind of unaware that [mills] [ph] would let you lock out that far. So, just wondering if there's something, kind of unusual about this environment in terms of that duration, kind of driving that later than expected realization there?\nJoe Reitmeier: Not really, maybe earlier, Josh. Once again, it's pretty volatile at this time. Once again, it's the year-over-year comps that I was referring to. It does take a little bit of time for those components because we pre-build inventory earlier in the year to work their way through inventory into cost of sales or on the P&L and that's really the dynamic that I was counting on.\nJosh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then just second question\u2026\nAlok Maskara: Josh, that was just to know, you and I both would be happier if it falls through sooner, right? So, I think what Joe's saying, no later than second half, right. So, let's see where volatility takes us.\nJosh Pokrzywinski : Okay. Fair enough. Yes, I guess the last six months have probably humbled a lot of people trying to forecast input prices. On the SEER change and kind of price impacted that in the marketplace, look, if I look back to 2015 and the regional SEER standard that took over that year, I think price mix for a lot of the industry was like low-single-digit to best and probably no different than a normal year. I'm just wondering what's kind of unique about this point in time where you would think that would be higher, especially with some of the deflation coming in and a couple of folks having ceded share with supply chain interruptions?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. I mean, I could start by saying, I wasn't here in 2015, so maybe we didn't raise price as much. But I think in all seriousness, we are in an extremely inflationary environment globally on every product. And I think the discipline set of competition that we have, everybody is going to look at this opportunity, to make sure we capture the full value of it. I mean a consumer has to keep in mind that the equipment costs are less than half of the total cost that they are paying for and there\u2019s a strong replacement component, and there\u2019s an energy efficiency benefit. So, I can\u2019t answer the question on 2015, but in today's supply constrained environment where labor, material, all the inflation has been high, I would expect the SEER change to drive incremental price benefits for us and for the industry.\nJoe Reitmeier: And I would also add there, Josh, it's also going to come with a bit of a mix benefit as well. Remember, I believe the last SEER change only covered half the country. So, this one is the whole country. So, I think that will present a little bit different dynamic. And then once again, it will be a combination of both price and mix benefit in 2023 from the SEER conversion. \nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Appreciate it. Best of luck to you both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. By the way, I love the slides. So that's a nice innovation I guess. Just on the\u2026\nJoe Reitmeier: We did promise that in the last conference that we would have slide, Nigel. So, I'm glad you noticed.\nNigel Coe: There you go. There you go. I notice these things. It's good. But first of all, Alok nice to see you on board. So, the [Technical Difficulty] price for the full-year, I mean, how does that look by business? And the spirit of the question is, obviously commercial with 4% prices lagging behind. So, just wondering if we're going to see some catch up on price in the back half of the year? And maybe that could be a force for improving margins for commercial in the back half, but on the commercial business, I'm just wondering how we view normal margins for that business? And again, just thinking about the labor increases, the labor cost increases we've seen at the facility, does that in any way pinch longer-term margins for commercial?\nAlok Maskara: Yes, lots of good questions. So, let me start by talking about sort of pricing. So, I think your observation is correct. Commercial is lagging behind on pricing, but they are doing better than what they did in Q1. So, we are pleased with sequential improvement. That's a business, as you know, is heavily dependent on key accounts. So, as the key accounts negotiations continue, we are moving forward and we're getting more. And it was mentioned in the script that we have announced another price increase that goes into effect August 1. So, I would expect commercial to catch up on pricing. Additional thing to keep in mind is that the SEER change that's coming in 2023 would require a new set of products, which means there's an opportunity to establish new price levels since the current contracts do not describe price levels for the new product, which are necessary and mandated by 2023. So, I do expect a step change in price for commercial as we approach 2023? The labor cost is a unique thing. So, as we go through the math to your question, first of all, hourly labor is not a huge portion of our labor cost. So, that's one, right. Second, I think we are taking the opportunity to upskill our workforce and offset some of those increases based on higher quality, lower scrap, and also in the long-term looking at a second location, which is likely going to be in a lower labor location, lower labor cost location versus where we are now. So, in the short-term for a quarter or so, is it an headwind? Yeah. Is it material in the big scheme of things? No. I think there are other things such as just our scrap and over time, that all kills us more than the higher hourly wages. So, I don't have lots of detail probably more than you wanted, but yes, commercial needs to catch up on price and we are confident that we'll do better in the second half, and we're even more confident that we'll do better in 2023.\nNigel Coe: Okay. No, no, we like details. So, don't worry about that. But again, come back to [indiscernible] price for the full-year. And maybe just what are we [baked] [ph] into residential that number? Maybe if you could just clarify, does the SEER change? Is that baked in at all to that number? I think that's more of a mix in the price, but that's [split and has] [ph], but just want to make sure that's not in the numbers.\nJoe Reitmeier : Yes, we've got it all broken. We've not given price by segment, but it's probably not much different if you were to do the math on what you see in the first half of the year by each segment. Once again, we just instituted another price increase in commercial that will give us more of a lift in the back half of the year and going into 2023. But once again, I'm not going to breakdown price by business, but once again, we remain confident that we're going to deliver 400 plus million at a minimum.\nNigel Coe: Thanks Joe. Thanks Alok.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nAlok Maskara : Good morning, Steve.\nJoe Reitmeier: Hi, Steve. \nSteve Tusa: Congrats. on the post here and I echo \u2013 I agree with Nigel, great to see the slides and a little bit easier to absorb in a busy morning. Just on the free cash flow, how do we expect that to play out for 3Q and 4Q? Is that \u2013 I mean, I know 3Q is obviously seasonally heavier. So, should we expect more of it to come in 3Q or more of a flush in 4Q?\nJoe Reitmeier: I think it will be more of a flush in [4Q] [ph], to be honest with you Steve. Another thing that we're going to continue to keep our eye on is availability of raw materials. And if we have the opportunity to carry more raw materials than normal to prevent some of the disruptions we see in the supply chain, we may do that later in the year. They may have implications on free cash flow, but don't think it will be material, but we'll have to just keep an eye on that as well. But those are sort of the things that I would expect. Once again, probably getting back to what I would characterize as a more normal seasonality of our cash flow. Once again pre-tornado.\nSteve Tusa: And then as far as the seasonality of your earnings in the second half, should that be pretty normal, just remind us of what that split would be just at a roughly? \nJoe Reitmeier: Yes, I think if you were to invert the second and first quarter this year and the third and fourth quarter of this year, I think you'll come up pretty close.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, great. And then one last one. Where are you in terms of your independent channel and loading it for the new SEER products?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. As you know, in residential, most of our \u2013 majority of our sale or vast majority of our sales go direct to dealer. So, there's clearly no loading going on. Some of these guys may buy garage load or so, but they're not doing that. On the allied or the distribution channel, we remain in supply constrained world. So, we not currently have any plans to preload on a higher share basis, but that might change if demand slows and we get into Q4 and have more of an opportunity to do that, but we will be fully prepared. And if as you know, if needed we'll move units from south to north based on manufactured date versus all the other wonderful things that the industry is already used to doing. So, we're not concerned and living in a supply constrained world. We'll continue evolving, but we don't expect a significant amount of pe-build of pre-sale like in the previous SEER change.\nSteve Tusa: But I guess for the South, they have to have the product to start selling it on Jan 1. So, I would assume that kind of mix in has to happen there, maybe not a pre-buy, but like certainly a gradual transition in the channel. Am I right about that or not? Because that's an [installed base] [ph].\nAlok Maskara: Yes, you are absolutely right. And that was my comment around Q4. So, by the time Q4 comes in because most of our dealers and distributors are like, you know, they are turning inventory at least four times a year, right. So, like [Q4 times] [ph], we'll start shipping those. \nSteve Tusa: Yes. Great. Okay. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. Good luck.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Hi, good morning and welcome Alok. Congratulations.\nJoe Reitmeier : Good morning, Joe.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks Joe. Good morning.\nJoe Ritchie: Sorry if I missed this in your prepared comments, but I'm curious to the 17 points of growth you saw in resi this quarter, how much of that was volume?\nAlok Maskara : 5%.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, 5% volume. Did that 5% volume, [Technical Difficulty] Lennox or did one grow quicker than the other?\nJoe Reitmeier : Yes, we don't \u2013 and we've not broken that out. Once again, what I'll say is, we continue to see strong demand on both channels or in both channels.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. And then maybe just going back to the commercial margin, so clearly, obviously, it's been a difficult last few quarters and you guys, seemingly sounds like things are getting a little bit better. I'm just curious like if you kind of think about the margin improvement in that business for the second half of the year? Like how should we be thinking about kind of like the right margin for that business either sequentially or for the rest of the year?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. I think it's really hard when you're at turnaround situation to give exact numbers, but I would say, we were pleased that Q2 was better than Q1, even if it's modestly better, I would expect a similar pattern in Q3, Q4, but even if you have to take a hit for a quarter here and there, I mean, our long-term goal remains to protect our customers, serve the schools, make sure we go through the share dynamic. Our long-term goal is to get that business up to 18% to 20% margin. That might take us two years. I wish it\u2019s less than that, but that's where we focus on, but I think a small sequential improvement is what we would plan for rest of the year, but given the situation and still quite volatile, I wouldn't want to tie down to any specific numbers yet.\nJoe Ritchie: No, that makes a lot of sense, Alok. And I know maybe my in the last question, I know you're not seeing it in your business today, but I'm sure you guys have done some sensitivity analysis around what a resi downturn could look like? Maybe just help us with any type of framework that you guys would approach a potential downturn if we start to [see it in revenue] [ph]?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. Every time I read Wall Street Journal, I come to the office and say, oh, we are going to face a downturn. And then I look at the order rates and it turns out to be wrong. So, this has been going on ever since I started. The broader question that you asked is, clearly very seasoned team, we have run scenarios on all different aspects.  On the residential new construction, just based on slower housing starts, we can model that pretty effectively and we know how many months after a home starts, HVAC goes in. So that part is easy for us to model and we are doing that. We clearly are going to offset that with new programs to gain share and also remind everybody that 20% of our business, not 80%. On the 80%, which is replacement, we feel very good that very little of that will move from replacement to repair, especially given the part shortage, there's historical refrigerant changes, there's SEER changes. But then again, we have modeled that different aspects. What if 10% changes from replacement to repairs? And then, of course, our goal is to get value out of those repairs as well. So, that's the kind of scenarios we have dealt with. No two downturns are the same. And whatever comes through, our goal is to be prepared and deliver the best value for our shareholders. But we have run at least three, four different scenarios and we know what costs will need to take out. We know where we focus to gain share. And we know that like none of these downturns last very long in our industry.\nJoe Ritchie : That's helpful. Thanks for the color Alok.\nAlok Maskara: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is at Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nBrett Linzey: Hi, good morning and welcome to Alok.\nAlok Maskara : Good morning, Brett.\nBrett Linzey: Just want to come back to the commercial business. I appreciate some of the color on backlog. You noted you were sold out there. Just curious what you're seeing on the new order front and how that's been tracking and really specifically around the national account business and how those conversations are going given some of the slower consumer reads coming out of those customers?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. I mean, good question. We are not seeing any changes in the demand there. We could solve whatever we make right now. So, I think it's possible that there is an underlying weakness and none of us are seeing it because every manufacturer has extended lead time there. I think one thing that gives us some comfort on these national accounts is that the higher efficiency units have a very quick payback that\u2019s apparent and these are sophisticated buyers. So, despite the consumer slowdown, retailer will get significant energy benefits by replacing the HVAC units and a quicker payback. So, I think that's the piece that gives us some comfort in the commercial cycle is that there is apparent value and a willingness to pay for these upgrades. But we haven't seen any change. We'll keep watching it closely. but we don't expect larger customers to make any significant deviation from their current policy, which is a replacement every few years and get the value of energy efficiency.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, great. And just on the contingency plans, I think you made a comment on that in the opening remarks, but just curious how you would handle a more shallow downturn? Would you just ride down the decrementals and try to preserve the integrity of the organization? Would you get it cost pretty quickly? Just kind of high level, how would you think about attacking that?\nAlok Maskara: Every time we hit a downturn, if I knew it's going to last exactly for eight weeks, then yes, we will try and preserve the organization. But in reality, we never know. I mean, having lived through many downturns, no. I mean, I think our goal would be to minimize the decrementals like you take tough actions, take the opportunity, I mean, never waste a crisis. I mean, remember that. We will always look at this as an opportunity to strengthen the organization even if it's a smaller organization and take some of the tougher actions. So, no, we would try our best to minimize the decremental and offset it by G&A reduction, offset it by deferred investments, just because we don't know how long the downturn will last.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, great. Appreciate the thoughts.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning everyone and welcome Alok and appreciate the slides this quarter.\nAlok Maskara : Good morning, John. Thanks for the compliment. We\u2019ll try and keep the slides going.\nJohn Walsh: Yes. It's hard to take them away. We'll you won't get the praise next quarter if they're gone. You'll get complaints, but I guess\u2026\nAlok Maskara: Well being an ex-consultant John, as you can be imagined, I think better with PowerPoint in front of me. So, we do like the small set of 12 slides.\nJohn Walsh: Yes, yes. No. Just looking at the first half margin performance, I think last quarter you'd said that you could grow margins at the total company level, just curious when you think about your mid-point that's in the guidance range you have out there? I mean, what are total company margins doing?\nJoe Reitmeier: [Other down] [ph] slightly. Once again, it's just the pressures that we're continuing to feel in the back half of the year, while we have commodities easing, we're still combating inflation on the components and other input side. So, it's sort of the net-net there. All-in, I think margins for the full-year would be down roughly 40 basis points.\nJohn Walsh: Got you. Thank you for that. And then maybe just one follow-up. The Refrigeration incrementals have been pretty strong thus far in the first half about 40%. Do you think you guys can maintain this zip code or how are you thinking about just Refrigeration incrementals broadly? I know you don't give spot guidance.\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes, I think we're benefiting from a bit of a tailwind where we're catching up on price as well there and that's lifting it something north of what we would typically target will be 30%, which is what we do for the balance of the company as well.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Well, appreciate taking the calls at the end here. Thank you.\nAlok Maskara: Thank you.\nJoe Reitmeier: Thanks John.\nAlok Maskara: Okay. Thanks for all the questions. To wrap up, I just want to emphasize that the demand remains strong. We are raising guidance based on the strength of our residential and refrigeration business and expectations of continued improvements in commercial. Coming off a record second quarter, we look forward to the second half and will remain focused on enhancing shareholder value irrespective of the macroeconomic uncertainties. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our Lennox 's second quarter earnings call. Thank you.\nOperator: That does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Alok Maskara",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I have enjoyed meeting with many of you since I started on May 9 and I look forward to more conversations so that I can continue to get insights and perspectives from all our key shareholders. I'm happy to kick off my first Lennox earnings call by reporting a record quarter with record revenue, record EBIT, and record EPS driven by strong growth. Before I begin, I want to thank all our employees for their hard work towards improving service levels given the global supply chain disruptions. It is their hard work and perseverance that has enabled us to deliver record revenues and profits. Please turn to Slide 3, where I want to highlight four key messages. One, we had a record quarter driven by continued strong execution in our Residential and Refrigeration segments. Company revenue was a record at more than 1.3 billion, up 10%. Adjusted earnings per share was a record as well at $5 per share, up nearly 10%. Our turnaround efforts in our commercial factory in Stuttgart remains on track and we are pleased with the sequential improvement in our quarterly results. However, supply chain disruptions continue to constrain production and our ability to meet strong demand. Second, we continue our disciplined capital allocation strategy as we repurchased 100 million of stock and paid 33 million in dividends in the second quarter as we generated $97 million in cash from operations in the quarter. Third, the company continued to advance its strategic priorities with a focus on innovation and ESG. I will talk more about these in a moment, but we are the first company to complete the Department of Energy's Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge and we recently published our latest ESG report that includes the company's science based targets. Fourth, we are increasing our full-year revenue guidance and are also raising the low end of our full-year EPS guidance range. Now please turn to Slide 4 to discuss the company's recognition for being the first to achieve the objectives of the DOE Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge. Homeowners in colder climates have traditionally relied on fossil fuel heating for their homes. The DOE challenge was created to accelerate cold climate heat pump advancements for colder climates and revolutionized the HVAC industry with a solution that offers comfortable cooling and heating, while significantly lowering greenhouse gas emissions. In June, I was honored to host the Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, who traveled to the Dallas area to recognize the Lennox team for the accomplishments and advancements in affordable, clean and efficient heating and cooling solutions. Lennox takes great pride in designing, manufacturing, and delivering the most efficient climate controlled products on the market. Even before the challenge, the Lennox advanced technology team was already working on the development of a Cool Climate Heat Pump to add to our extensive line of best-in-class heat pump products already on the market. The cold climate heat pump represents our dedication as a company to accelerating environmental sustainability through ongoing product innovations, advances in efficiency gains, and greenhouse cat emission reduction targets. Turning to Slide 5, our 2021 ESG report has been published and is now available on our website. Beyond our leadership in heat pumps and dedication to decarbonization, our latest ESG report highlights that our emission reduction targets are now approved by the science based target initiative. This initiative is focused on climate action in-line with the goals of the Paris agreement to help prevent the worst impacts of climate change. The ESG report covers how we are meeting or exceeding our improvement targets in environmental, as well as the continual progress we are making in diversity and inclusion, and of course strong governance is fundamental and the bedrock of Lennox. I encourage all our stakeholders to read the report and continue following our ESG progress. Now, I will hand the call over to Joe to discuss the second quarter financials on Slide 6. Thank you, Joe. Looking at the second half, we are mindful of a potential slowdown in the U.S. economy. And with interest rates rising, a potential decline in residential new construction. We are prepared and have contingency plans in place, but to be clear, that's not what we are seeing in our business today. Demand continues to run ahead of our ability to fully satisfy our customers as supply chain constraints persist. Due to the supply chain challenges, factory inefficiencies continue to impact performance, especially at our Arkansas factory for commercial. As we look ahead, we have a strong backlog and order rates across residential, commercial, and refrigeration.  Commodity inflation is easing and our ongoing productivity and material cost initiatives will positively impact the business and be evident as the supply chain normalizes. Before we go to Q&A, let me close our prepared remarks on Slide 12, by summarizing why I believe Lennox is a great company and what excites me most about being the CEO of Lennox. A company with 127 years of history and a [Technical Difficulty] value driven culture. We are the leader in energy efficient climate control solutions operating in high growth end market with strong replacement demand. We have an ESG mindset and are narrowly focused on HVACR. The company has innovative products with a unique direct to dealer network and we have a history of robust execution and disciplined capital deployment. Thank you for listening. Joe and I will be happy to take your questions now. Operator, let's go to Q&A. Thanks Julian. Good morning. Excited to be here. Julian, great question. I would hate to give you a number now. We are still in the midst of a turnaround. And I was pleased to see sequential improvement and our long-term goal of getting that business to an 18% to 20% range in margin still remains valid, but given the shortage of components that \u2013 not just Lennox, the whole industry is facing right now, and the disruption in supply, I think it's a little early for us to give a specific number for Q3 and Q4. Our focus on commercial remains serving our customers, protecting our key accounts, serving our school based, and personally, I will be expecting small, but steady sequential improvements in the business going forward. But it's going to be slower than our like, slower than our shareholders would like, but we are making good steady progress, Julian. And Julian, I would just add to that to remind that the second half pricing is going to appear to be lower just because we start lapping ourselves on price increases that we did last year. So, it doesn't mean we are giving back price or anything, like we are clearly going to hold price, right. Good morning, Jeff. Sure. So, I think commercial turnaround remains a huge focus of ours. On the labor situation, the actions we took earlier in the year are bearing fruit and we are now meeting our hiring goals and our retention goals. So, I think while you don't declare victory on that, I think labor situation is now under control and our biggest bottleneck at this stage remains availability of components and improving factory processes to get the right quality output. I guess from a going forward perspective, as I look at supply chain, clearly, we got to diversify our supply chain, get more than one supplier, but there are some industry wide part shortages that we are dealing with. And that remains our focus. On your longer-term question, Jeff, yes, I mean, listen, this is a growth industry. We have previously talked about our desire to have a second factory and we remain committed to that thought process. We're going to go a little slower than what we may have thought simply because if we take a factory with poor processes and replicate it, I will have two factories with poor processes. So, I think we're going to take our time to make the right decision, find the right location, and improve the processes, but be on the lookout. When we have the Investor Day in December, we'll give you more color on it, Jeff, but we remain committed to expanding capacity and winning back the share that we might have lost through this disruption. Sure. So, the answer is, we are 100% ready. This is a smaller change than what us and the industry have dealt with in the past. We went from 10 to 13 in the past. I mean, we are going from 13 to 14, not 14 to 15. So, I think we are 100% ready and I believe overall the whole industry is going to be ready. We are in the most inflationary time that we have ever seen in our careers, at least a few of us. So, clearly, I think this is a great opportunity for us and the industry to make sure that we capture the full value of the seer change in pricing. We intend to do so. So, I think if you're seeing indication in the industry that the price is going to be better, I think that's good discipline and that helps us to invest more in products that are environmentally friendlier and the newer technology. So, we are 100%. The value will be captured in price and if anything, I think the industry margin should expand because of the change. And I don't expect any huge stock up or pre-buy just because at least we still remain in a supply constrained environment, not a demand constrained environment. Thank you. I do. And the reason we didn't talk about long-term guidance this quarter because there is no change to it. So, there is no update and I think we have previously said that, I wouldn't expect any updates just because there's a new CEO. I mean, if we need to change things because of macroeconomic conditions or something else, but yes, I mean, I risk the incrementals of 35% and I'm looking at Joe is smiling as I say that, but no, there is no change or update to that Gautam. Sure. At this stage, as commodity cost ease, I mean, Joe already mentioned that we have reduced some of our guidance range from \u2013 by $10 million, if the cost is more, we might see slightly more benefits, but frankly, most of the benefit of any commodity easing is likely to be in 2023 because given the inventory we hold and the pre-buys, we all have done for locking in commodity pricing, the impact is going to be in the Q4 2023 timeframe. I'll let Joe talk about, sort of the walk between the different pieces, but keep in mind that beyond the commodity and the component costs, we have many other inflationary pressures such as labor costs, such as healthcare costs, such as real estate costs, but Joe, please feel free to add any more color to that. Sure. So, I'll say for things such as freight and availability of freight, things are getting better. So, I think that's an industry wide phenomenon. We like that. If you look at availability of sort of components, it's a mixed bag. I think there are quite a few components, which is getting better, but in some commercial components, we seem to be facing industry wide shortages, right. So, I think that's something that we have to continue watching out for. The whole issue around semiconductor microchips, I mean, that remains our biggest pinch point right now. And despite redesigns, despite adding vendors, we still expect to see significant improvement only in early 2023 at this stage, but net-net, the positive here is that things are no longer getting worse. I mean for the longest time as we looked at it, we kept finding new things as we played [whack em' all] [ph]. So we're still playing a bit of [whack em' all] [ph], but it's on existing things and we don't see anything specifically getting worse. But every time I say something positive, I turn out to be wrong here. So, let's be cautious as we go forward. The team is working extremely hard. We have a very talented team that continuously watches and monitors the performance of our supplier base. Hi, Jeff. Sure. So Jeff, I think the view hasn't changed. We like being focused. We like being HVACR and we will continue doing so. So, yes, if your big strategic thing means if I'm going to go buy a smoke alarm company probably not. I mean, we're not going to be doing that. So, I think from that perspective, that's good. But being a smaller player in a larger industry, we have another lower market share among the Top 4 companies. We see tons of opportunities for bolt-on. Tons of opportunities for product expansion. Tons of opportunities for geographic expansions within U.S. and outside U.S. So, yes, I do see significant opportunities there. On Refrigeration, it's a good business. There are pockets that are better than others and that's a review that's ongoing for us as we look through it. Of course, our short-term focus is to improve the performance of the business. I believe every business unit within the Refrigeration segment has an opportunity to do better and that's what I want the team to focus on. As we look through the overall situation and come back and present to you in December on how we will take each of our business segments to a higher margin level. So, still remain very excited about the portfolio, still continue to evaluate lots of bolt-on and partnership opportunities, and yes, we would not be going into far adjacencies in any big bold strategic move because I think that's not who Lennox is. Sure, Jeff. I think the first thing for us is to be able to restore our supply and manner fracturing capability. We had a history of share gain or maintaining share. And ever since the Marshalltown tornado, we have struggled to recapture share or gain share. So, our first focus is going to be restoring our manufacturing capability. So, salespeople, instead of apologizing to dealers for not having products, are going to spend more time getting new dealers on board. So, I think that's our number one piece, right. Second for us is relying on our innovative new products. And we have quite a few, but again given supply conditions, we have not been able to fully market and launch those to gain share. Let's take heat pumps as an example that we talked about. Third one is just proven strategy, opening new stores. When we didn't have enough products, we didn't open new stores because those stores would be half empty, but as we get inventory to be in a better spot, you're going to go back to opening new stores. And yes, if I package it all together, of course, we need to add more dealers, of course, we got to get back into the commercial, the curbside replacement business, which we have, sort of walked away from. And of course, we got to expand our geographical footprint. There are pockets of U.S. where our market share is much lower just because of our historical footprint and no other reason. So, I'm very excited about the opportunity to gain share. We believe we have strong value propositions and our dealers love our value proposition that we are direct-to-market and don't have to go through a distributor all the time. So, I think there's lots of opportunities and we'll tell you more in December, Jeff. Thanks. Ryan, we haven't declared the price for our 2023 lineup yet, but at minimum if you think we are going from 13 to 14 or 14 to 15, you should think of that being baked into the price, right? This percentage SEER change baked into percentage price, but clearly, there are many more complicating factors and it depends also on where we are in the inflationary cycle, but yes, we do expect to capture that on price, but we haven't announced a price level for our 23 line [indiscernible], Ryan. As you know, the lowest or sort of the base layer typically accounts to 50% to 60% of the industry sales and we expect the new SEER would be about the same. Now, we hope to use the opportunity to upsell the consumers on a higher SEER product because we still make the, like the highest SEER products in the industry. But I think a 50% to 60% number, Ryan, which has historically been true, will remain for the shutdown. April resi slows, which as we mentioned earlier, we haven't seen signs in our order book, but it could be masked because of the weather patterns we're having. Yes, I do think commercial should be a buffer. A, based on volume; b, for us also based on the margin opportunity, because remember our commercial margin opportunity is probably larger than others, given that our current state is challenging. The whole industry, not just us, at this point, we are sold out for 2022. So yes, we do have backlog for 2023 as well, but some of those backlog is still tentative as we work through pricing, availability, and design. In the short-term, we are extremely busy just in the 2022 order, but as residential slows, I agree with you, Ryan. I think commercial should give us buffering both from volume and from margin perspective. Good morning, Josh. Josh, that was just to know, you and I both would be happier if it falls through sooner, right? So, I think what Joe's saying, no later than second half, right. So, let's see where volatility takes us. Sure. I mean, I could start by saying, I wasn't here in 2015, so maybe we didn't raise price as much. But I think in all seriousness, we are in an extremely inflationary environment globally on every product. And I think the discipline set of competition that we have, everybody is going to look at this opportunity, to make sure we capture the full value of it. I mean a consumer has to keep in mind that the equipment costs are less than half of the total cost that they are paying for and there's a strong replacement component, and there's an energy efficiency benefit. So, I can't answer the question on 2015, but in today's supply constrained environment where labor, material, all the inflation has been high, I would expect the SEER change to drive incremental price benefits for us and for the industry. Yes, lots of good questions. So, let me start by talking about sort of pricing. So, I think your observation is correct. Commercial is lagging behind on pricing, but they are doing better than what they did in Q1. So, we are pleased with sequential improvement. That's a business, as you know, is heavily dependent on key accounts. So, as the key accounts negotiations continue, we are moving forward and we're getting more. And it was mentioned in the script that we have announced another price increase that goes into effect August 1. So, I would expect commercial to catch up on pricing. Additional thing to keep in mind is that the SEER change that's coming in 2023 would require a new set of products, which means there's an opportunity to establish new price levels since the current contracts do not describe price levels for the new product, which are necessary and mandated by 2023. So, I do expect a step change in price for commercial as we approach 2023? The labor cost is a unique thing. So, as we go through the math to your question, first of all, hourly labor is not a huge portion of our labor cost. So, that's one, right. Second, I think we are taking the opportunity to upskill our workforce and offset some of those increases based on higher quality, lower scrap, and also in the long-term looking at a second location, which is likely going to be in a lower labor location, lower labor cost location versus where we are now. So, in the short-term for a quarter or so, is it an headwind? Yeah. Is it material in the big scheme of things? No. I think there are other things such as just our scrap and over time, that all kills us more than the higher hourly wages. So, I don't have lots of detail probably more than you wanted, but yes, commercial needs to catch up on price and we are confident that we'll do better in the second half, and we're even more confident that we'll do better in 2023. Good morning, Steve. Sure. As you know, in residential, most of our \u2013 majority of our sale or vast majority of our sales go direct to dealer. So, there's clearly no loading going on. Some of these guys may buy garage load or so, but they're not doing that. On the allied or the distribution channel, we remain in supply constrained world. So, we not currently have any plans to preload on a higher share basis, but that might change if demand slows and we get into Q4 and have more of an opportunity to do that, but we will be fully prepared. And if as you know, if needed we'll move units from south to north based on manufactured date versus all the other wonderful things that the industry is already used to doing. So, we're not concerned and living in a supply constrained world. We'll continue evolving, but we don't expect a significant amount of pe-build of pre-sale like in the previous SEER change. Yes, you are absolutely right. And that was my comment around Q4. So, by the time Q4 comes in because most of our dealers and distributors are like, you know, they are turning inventory at least four times a year, right. So, like [Q4 times] [ph], we'll start shipping those. Thanks. Thanks Joe. Good morning. 5%. Yes. I think it's really hard when you're at turnaround situation to give exact numbers, but I would say, we were pleased that Q2 was better than Q1, even if it's modestly better, I would expect a similar pattern in Q3, Q4, but even if you have to take a hit for a quarter here and there, I mean, our long-term goal remains to protect our customers, serve the schools, make sure we go through the share dynamic. Our long-term goal is to get that business up to 18% to 20% margin. That might take us two years. I wish it's less than that, but that's where we focus on, but I think a small sequential improvement is what we would plan for rest of the year, but given the situation and still quite volatile, I wouldn't want to tie down to any specific numbers yet. Sure. Every time I read Wall Street Journal, I come to the office and say, oh, we are going to face a downturn. And then I look at the order rates and it turns out to be wrong. So, this has been going on ever since I started. The broader question that you asked is, clearly very seasoned team, we have run scenarios on all different aspects.  On the residential new construction, just based on slower housing starts, we can model that pretty effectively and we know how many months after a home starts, HVAC goes in. So that part is easy for us to model and we are doing that. We clearly are going to offset that with new programs to gain share and also remind everybody that 20% of our business, not 80%. On the 80%, which is replacement, we feel very good that very little of that will move from replacement to repair, especially given the part shortage, there's historical refrigerant changes, there's SEER changes. But then again, we have modeled that different aspects. What if 10% changes from replacement to repairs? And then, of course, our goal is to get value out of those repairs as well. So, that's the kind of scenarios we have dealt with. No two downturns are the same. And whatever comes through, our goal is to be prepared and deliver the best value for our shareholders. But we have run at least three, four different scenarios and we know what costs will need to take out. We know where we focus to gain share. And we know that like none of these downturns last very long in our industry. You're welcome. Good morning, Brett. Sure. I mean, good question. We are not seeing any changes in the demand there. We could solve whatever we make right now. So, I think it's possible that there is an underlying weakness and none of us are seeing it because every manufacturer has extended lead time there. I think one thing that gives us some comfort on these national accounts is that the higher efficiency units have a very quick payback that's apparent and these are sophisticated buyers. So, despite the consumer slowdown, retailer will get significant energy benefits by replacing the HVAC units and a quicker payback. So, I think that's the piece that gives us some comfort in the commercial cycle is that there is apparent value and a willingness to pay for these upgrades. But we haven't seen any change. We'll keep watching it closely. but we don't expect larger customers to make any significant deviation from their current policy, which is a replacement every few years and get the value of energy efficiency. Every time we hit a downturn, if I knew it's going to last exactly for eight weeks, then yes, we will try and preserve the organization. But in reality, we never know. I mean, having lived through many downturns, no. I mean, I think our goal would be to minimize the decrementals like you take tough actions, take the opportunity, I mean, never waste a crisis. I mean, remember that. We will always look at this as an opportunity to strengthen the organization even if it's a smaller organization and take some of the tougher actions. So, no, we would try our best to minimize the decremental and offset it by G&A reduction, offset it by deferred investments, just because we don't know how long the downturn will last. Good morning, John. Thanks for the compliment. We'll try and keep the slides going. Well being an ex-consultant John, as you can be imagined, I think better with PowerPoint in front of me. So, we do like the small set of 12 slides. Thank you. Okay. Thanks for all the questions. To wrap up, I just want to emphasize that the demand remains strong. We are raising guidance based on the strength of our residential and refrigeration business and expectations of continued improvements in commercial. Coming off a record second quarter, we look forward to the second half and will remain focused on enhancing shareholder value irrespective of the macroeconomic uncertainties. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our Lennox 's second quarter earnings call. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Alok, and good morning, everyone. Looking at the second quarter for Lennox International overall, the company posted record revenue of $1.37 billion, up 10% as reported and up 11% at constant currency. GAAP operating income was a record $227 million, up 5%, and in the chart, you see that total segment profit rose 4% to a new record $230 million. Total segment margin was 16.8%, down 110 basis points, primarily due to inflationary pressures, global supply chain disruptions, and factory inefficiencies. GAAP EPS was a record $4.96, up 10% and adjusted EPS was a record $5, up 9%. Moving to the business segments, starting on Slide 7, you will see a record quarter for residential in revenue and profit. Against the 30% prior year revenue growth comparison, residential revenue came in at a record $978 million, up 17%. Price was up 13% and volume was up 5%. Mix was down 1% as we still saw supply constraints on our high-end products in the second quarter and we expect this to be the case through the second half of the year.  Residential replacement sales were up mid-teens and new construction was up high-teens. Residential segment profit rose 14% to a record $216 million. Segment margin contracted 50 basis points to 22.1%. Cooling degree days were favorable in the prior year quarter in the Southeast and South Central regions in the U.S. but cooler elsewhere. We opened two new Lennox stores in the second quarter and are targeting 20 to 30 new stores this year [weighted] [ph] to the second half, and we now have 235 Lennox stores. Now, turning to Slide 8 in our commercial business. Revenue was $220 million, down 13%. Volume was down 22%, price was up 4%, and mix was up 5%. Commercial segment profit was down 62% to $17 million, and segment margin contracted 1,010 basis points to 7.8%. Commercial end market replacement demand remains strong and we have made significant progress in hiring factory direct labor at our factory in Arkansas to support that, but supply chain disruptions continue to significantly impact the equipment business. Commercial improved sequentially in the second quarter and we focused on prioritizing key national account customers and school business during the summer months. We announced a third commercial price increase of August 1 and continue to expect commercial improvement in the second half of the year. Looking at our Refrigeration business on Slide 9, you see second quarter record revenue and profit. Refrigeration revenue was $169 million, up 14% as reported, price was up 12%. Volume was up 9% and mix was down 1%. Foreign exchange had a negative 6% impact, so revenue growth at constant currency was 20%, led by more than 30% growth in North America. Order rates and backlog remained strong and in Europe, Refrigeration revenue was up high single digits at constant currency, Europe commercial HVAC was up mid-single-digits at constant currency. The geopolitical environment is weighing on the market regionally and supply chain disruptions continue to impact our European operations. Overall, for the Refrigeration segment, profit rose 73% to $23 million and segment margin expanded 470 basis points to 13.8%. Turning to Slide 10. Let's review our 2022 full-year guidance. We are raising revenue growth guidance to 10% to 15% up from a prior range of 7% to 11%. For the industry, we continue to assume low-single-digit shipment growth in the North American Residential market and mid-single-digit shipment growth in North American Commercial unitary and Refrigeration markets. We are raising the low-end of our guidance for GAAP and adjusted EPS to a range of $13.80 to $14.50, compared to the prior range of $13.50 to $14.50. Price is now expected to be a $400 million benefit for the year, which is a 9.5% yield and this is up from our prior guidance of $335 million in price. Residential mix is expected to be a $25 million headwind for the full-year, compared to the prior year guidance of being neutral. This is primarily due to continued supply disruptions that are impacting the high-end of our product lines. Commodity cost inflation is now expected to be $130 million, down from the prior guidance of $140 million. However, we are still seeing inflationary pressures on components and other materials and now expect a $100 million headwind, compared to prior guidance of a $70 million headwind for other components. Factoring efficiencies are now expected to be a $15 million headwind, compared to prior guidance of being neutral and freight costs are now expected to be a headwind of $20 million, up from prior guidance of $15 million. Interest and pension expense guidance is $35 million, down from prior guidance of $40 million. Other guidance points are not changing. We still expect corporate expense to be $95 million. The effective tax rate is still expected to be between 18% to 20% and foreign exchange is still expected to be neutral for the full-year. We are planning for $125 million capital expenditures, and then regarding free cash flow for this year, the third quarter has a solid start with continued hot weather, and as we get into the other side of the summer season, we have more of a read on macroeconomic \u2013 on the macroeconomic environment with rising interest rates, as well as the supply chain and our progress of converting raw materials and whip into finished goods and shipments, we will know more. We are maintaining free cash flow guidance of approximately $400 million this time for the full-year, as well as $400 million of total stock repurchases for the year with $300 million already completed. We still expect a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 36 million for the full-year. Now with that, let's turn to Slide 11 and I'll turn it back over to Alok. Yes. Julian, I think you can almost mirror the price where we've got 400 million of price out there, 225 million we've already captured first half, 175 million second half. I would split the cost almost accordingly with respect to that, and then the cadence or seasonality of earnings, I think we're getting more and more close to what I would characterize as more routine or normal seasonality within our business. Last year it was a little bit disrupted given the strong first half we have when we were up significantly first half and then things seem to slow down second half. Things seem to be just the opposite this year, where we had a little bit slower start. The first half largely because of the tough comps, but that momentum continues in the second half. And I think once again, we'll get back to more normal earnings seasonality, if you were to look back to 2017, 2018 timeframe. Yes, I think that's correct. We did take the commodity guide down 10 million and that's for the benefit of what we see in the second half of the year, net of our hedge positions. And if commodity costs remain where they're at today, what we'll see is we'll see a lift in the second half of 2023. Once again largely become [aware] [ph] prices were in the first half and then also where we have prices locked in with our hedge positions. Not really, maybe earlier, Josh. Once again, it's pretty volatile at this time. Once again, it's the year-over-year comps that I was referring to. It does take a little bit of time for those components because we pre-build inventory earlier in the year to work their way through inventory into cost of sales or on the P&L and that's really the dynamic that I was counting on. And I would also add there, Josh, it's also going to come with a bit of a mix benefit as well. Remember, I believe the last SEER change only covered half the country. So, this one is the whole country. So, I think that will present a little bit different dynamic. And then once again, it will be a combination of both price and mix benefit in 2023 from the SEER conversion. We did promise that in the last conference that we would have slide, Nigel. So, I'm glad you noticed. Yes, we've got it all broken. We've not given price by segment, but it's probably not much different if you were to do the math on what you see in the first half of the year by each segment. Once again, we just instituted another price increase in commercial that will give us more of a lift in the back half of the year and going into 2023. But once again, I'm not going to breakdown price by business, but once again, we remain confident that we're going to deliver 400 plus million at a minimum. Hi, Steve. I think it will be more of a flush in [4Q] [ph], to be honest with you Steve. Another thing that we're going to continue to keep our eye on is availability of raw materials. And if we have the opportunity to carry more raw materials than normal to prevent some of the disruptions we see in the supply chain, we may do that later in the year. They may have implications on free cash flow, but don't think it will be material, but we'll have to just keep an eye on that as well. But those are sort of the things that I would expect. Once again, probably getting back to what I would characterize as a more normal seasonality of our cash flow. Once again pre-tornado. Yes, I think if you were to invert the second and first quarter this year and the third and fourth quarter of this year, I think you'll come up pretty close. Good morning, Joe. Yes, we don't \u2013 and we've not broken that out. Once again, what I'll say is, we continue to see strong demand on both channels or in both channels. [Other down] [ph] slightly. Once again, it's just the pressures that we're continuing to feel in the back half of the year, while we have commodities easing, we're still combating inflation on the components and other input side. So, it's sort of the net-net there. All-in, I think margins for the full-year would be down roughly 40 basis points. Yes, I think we're benefiting from a bit of a tailwind where we're catching up on price as well there and that's lifting it something north of what we would typically target will be 30%, which is what we do for the balance of the company as well. Thanks John."

At the request of your host, all lines are currently in a listen-only mode. There will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Harrison, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSteve Harrison: Thank you, and it sounds like we have some music okay, we're good. All right, good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for this review of Lennox International's financial performance for the first quarter of 2022. I'm here today with Chairman and Interim CEO, Todd Teske and CFO, Joe Reitmeier. Todd will review key points for the quarter, and Joe will take you through the company's financial performance and outlook for 2022. To give everyone time to ask questions during the Q&A, please limit yourself to a couple of questions or follow-ups and re-queue for any additional questions. In the earnings release we issued this morning, we have included the necessary reconciliation of the non - GAAP financial measures that will be discussed to GAAP measures. All comparisons mentioned today are against the prior year period. You can find a direct link to the webcast of today's conference call on our website at www.lennoxinternational.com. The webcast will be archived on the site for replay. I would like to remind everyone that in the course of this call, to give you a better understanding of our operations, we will be making certain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. For information concerning these risks and uncertainties, see Lennox International's publicly available filings with the SEC. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Now, let me turn the call over to Todd Teske.\nTodd Teske: Good morning and thank you for joining us. It's great to be here on the earnings call today to review the quarter with Joe during the short interim period until Alok Maskara's start date as Lennox International's new CEO on May 9. Many of you already know Alok across his career from McKinsey to GE, to Pentair and then as the CEO of Luxfer. In the coming weeks and months you'll have an opportunity to reconnect with him or to make introductions. We are excited to have Alok join us to lead the company as we continue to focus on driving growth and profitability to maximize shareholder value. Along with his impressive experience and proven track record of successfully operating businesses through various economic challenges over 25 years, we see Alok as a great fit with the performance culture of Lennox. With his background and experience, Alok was the candidate during the search process that rose to the top of an outstanding slate of candidates. Alok recognizes the firm foundation that's been built at Lennox, and I think Todd Bluedorn was 15 years leading the company, and we will look forward to the next chapter in the company's history. Turning to the near-term, let me start with some highlights on the first quarter of 2022, a record first quarter for revenue and earnings per share. Company revenue in the quarter was up 9% to a first quarter record of $1.01 billion. GAAP operating income was $112 million, down 2%. GAAP EPS was a first quarter record of $2.29, up 4%. Total segment profit for the first quarter was $115 million, down 1% and total segment margin was 11.3%, down 110 basis points. Adjusted EPS was first quarter record of $2.36 up 4%. The record first quarter for Lennox International was driven by our Residential and Refrigeration businesses, which both set new first quarter highs for segment revenue and profit. In Residential revenue was up 11% to a first quarter record of $682 million. Replacement and new construction were both up double digits. Residential segment profit was up 12% to our first quarter record $108 million. Segment margin was down 10 basis points to 15.8%. In Refrigeration, revenue was $144 million, a first quarter record adjusted for historical divestitures. Revenue grew 15% as reported an 18% at constant currency led by more than 20% growth in North America. European refrigeration revenue was up low single digits as reported and up low double digits at constant currency. And Europe HVAC revenue was up high single digits as reported and up mid teens at constant currency. Refrigeration segment profit rose 78% to $14 million our first quarter record adjusted for historical divestitures. Segment margin expanded 350 basis points to 9.8%. Turning to our Commercial business. Demand remained strong, but our commercial operations continued to be impacted in production by labor constraints and global supply chain disruptions. Commercial revenue was down 6%. Segment profit was down 77% and segment margin contracted 1040 basis points to 3.4%. More about this in a moment, but further breaking out revenue. Commercial equipment revenue was down low double digits. Within this Replacement revenue was up low single digits with planned Replacement up more than 20% and emergency Replacement down more than 35%. New construction revenue was down more than 30% in the quarter. Breaking out revenue another way, regional and local business was down mid teens. National account equipment revenue was down mid single digits. On the service side Lennox National Account Services revenue was up high single digits. A few points to make on the performance of our Commercial business. Given the business mix to national account customers in a constrained environment, mix was up as was price. But price increases took longer to work through given contractual obligations, causing inflation to run ahead of the price benefit in the commercial business currently. We announced another price increase of up to 9% for our Commercial business effective May 2 and we will continue to layer in additional price this year. We continue to see additional inflationary pressures in commodities, components and freight, and the global supply chain disruptions continue to create factory inefficiencies along with lingering labor constraints. Our Commercial business continues to be challenged by supply chain disruptions that has adversely impacted production more than our other business. There are unique components in the commercial equipment, primarily electronics and controls to name just a few that distinguish it from our other businesses where we have experienced abnormal delays even for these times. For all of our businesses lead times in the supply chain continue to lengthen. However, they have been especially disruptive in commercials configure to order environment.  We do not know all the components required for a units production until you get all of the specifications of the products configuration from the customer. Our sourcing, engineering and manufacturing teams continue to collectively address supply chain disruptions by working closely with our suppliers and assisting them in addressing their delays, increasing safety stock, rapidly qualifying new suppliers and expanding the supply base along with in-sourcing and substitution where feasible. Even with the actions we continue to take, there are still unavoidable extended lead times for our commercial configured to order products due to delays in the supply chain for certain components. With respect to labor constraints in Stuttgart, Arkansas and surrounding areas where we draw for from for direct labor, unemployment is at historical lows 3% or less. We have been experiencing unprecedented employee turnover in our commercial factory. Part of the turnover stems from late last year and early this year as we navigated the COVID-related disruptions affecting our commercial facility, many COVID exposed employees elected not to return to work at the factory. In addition, our utilization of overtime to overcome production disruptions also impacted employee retention. To ease labor constraints at our Arkansas factory, we have raised wages to attract a broader pool of talent in a very tight market and make Lennox the employer of choice in that area. In addition to raising wages, we have instituted static scheduling in the factory that will ease demands for significant overtime on direct labor and create a better work-life balance for our factory employees. We expect the actions we've taken in the factory of increasing wages and stabilizing the work schedules for our factory employees to significantly reduce absenteeism and improve employee retention easing the labor constraint that along with supply chain disruptions is resulting in commercial manufacturing delays. Our commercial team continues to work diligently to overcome these disruptions with the primary focus taking care of our customers. For the company overall price was pacing ahead of commodity, component and freight pressures, and we expect that to continue through the year. In the first quarter, the company captured $85 million of price for a 9% yield compared to $58 million of material and freight headwind in the quarter. Joe will talk more about it in the 2022 guidance, but we now plan to capture approximately $335 million of price this year, compared to prior guidance of $235 million, with a focus on staying ahead of inflationary pressures. For the company overall in 2022, we are raising revenue growth guidance from 5% to 10%, to a new range of 7% to 11% and we are reiterating EPS guidance of $13.50 to $14.50 for the full year. We are reiterating plans for $400 million of stock repurchases in 2022 as we drive towards another record year led by the strength in our Residential and Refrigeration businesses. Now I'll turn it over to Joe for more detail on the first quarter and our outlook.\nJoseph Reitmeier: Thank you, Todd and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter starting with Residential heating and cooling. In the first quarter revenue from Residential heating and cooling was a first quarter record $682 million, up 13%. Volume was flat. Price was up 11% and mix was up 2%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Residential profit was a first quarter record $108 million, up 12%. Segment margin was 15.8%, down 10 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by favorable price and mix. Partial offsets included higher material, freight and warranty costs, global supply chain disruptions, and factoring efficiencies, lower joint venture income distribution investments and higher SG&A. Now turning to our Commercial heating and cooling business, in the first quarter commercial revenue was $188 million, down 6%. Volume was down 16%. Price was up 3% and mix was up 7%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Commercial segment profit was $6 million, down 77% and segment margin was 3.4%, down 1040 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by lower volume and factory inefficiencies due to labor constraints and global supply chain disruptions, higher material freight distribution and other product costs, and higher SG&A. Partial offsets included favorable price and mix. In Refrigeration revenue was up 15% to $144 million, a first quarter record adjusted for historical divestitures. Volume was up 11% and price was up 8%. Mix was down 1%. Foreign exchange had a negative 3% impact on revenue. Refrigeration segment profit rose 78% to $14 million, also a first quarter record adjusted for historical divestitures. Segment margin expanded 350 basis points to 9.8%. Segment profit was positively impacted by higher volume and favorable price than a year ago. Partial offsets include unfavorable mix, global supply chain disruptions and higher material, freight and SG&A costs. Corporate expenses were $13 million in the first quarter compared to $16 million dollars in the prior quarter. Overall, SG&A was $155 million in the first quarter, or 15.3% of revenue, down from 15.6% of revenue in the prior quarter. Regarding special items, the company had net after tax charges of $2.5 million dollars in the quarter. Net cash used in operations in the first quarter was $98 million, compared to $18 million in the prior quarter as working capital increase primarily due to sales growth, increasing accounts receivable, as well as inventory increasing due to mitigation strategies to combat supply chain disruptions, along with inflationary effects year-over-year on product costs. Capital expenditures were approximately $25 million in the first quarter, compared to $24 million in the prior year quarter. Free cash flow was a use of $123 million for the quarter, compared to a use of $42 million in the prior quarter. And seasonally, we tend to use cash in the first half of the year and generate cash in the second half. The company paid approximately $34 million in dividends and repurchased $200 million of company stock in the first quarter. Total debt was $1.61 billion at the end of the first quarter, and we ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.4. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $40 million at the end of the quarter. Before I turn it over to Q&A, I'll review our outlook for 2022. Our underlying market assumptions for the year remain the same. We expect the industry to see low single digit shipment growth in Residential and mid single digit shipment growth in Commercial unitary and Refrigeration markets in North America. We are raising 2022 revenue guidance from 5% to 10% to a new range of 7% to 11% with neutral foreign exchange. And we are reiterating our guidance for GAAP and adjusted EPS of $13.50 to $14.50. Let me now run through some of the other key points in our guidance assumptions and the puts and takes for 2022. First, for the items that are changing. With a second round of price increases announced for 2022, we now expect price to be a benefit of $335 million for the year and 8% yield and this is up from our prior guidance of $235 million. Some headwinds that have increased in our guidance, we now expect approximately a $140 million headwind from commodities, which is up from $110 million previously. We now expect a net headwind of approximately $70 million from components, up from a net headwind of $30 million previously. And guidance for factory productivity is slipping from a benefit of $20 million to flat for 2022. And freight is now expected to be a $15 million headwind for the full year, up from a $5 million headwind previously. Tariffs are now expected to be a $5 million headwind compared to prior guidance to be neutral and we expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be at the low end of our prior guidance at approximately 36 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase a total of $400 million of stock this year. Now for the guidance items that are remaining the same, we are guiding for Residential mix to be neutral and we will assume neutral foreign exchange. We will be at a more normal run rate with distribution investments this year with 30 new Lennox stores planned and SG&A is still expected to be up $45 million this year, including our investments in R&D and IT. Now for a few final guidance points, corporate expenses are still targeted at $95 million. We still plan for capital expenditures to be approximately $125 million this year. And finally, free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $400 million. And with that, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll to first to the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nTodd Teske: Hi Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: Can you hear me now?\nTodd Teske: We can hear you now, thank you.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay, cool. So maybe just starting with the challenges that you faced in Commercial factoring in the quarter, I guess you've provided some color around what you've done to fix the margins. But how quickly can we start to see that come through with a very, like rapid snapback in margin performance starting in 2Q or do you think it will take time to kind of execute and return to prior margin levels, like throughout the year?\nTodd Teske: Yes, I think it's going be a couple, you know, it's probably going to take a little bit more time, Nicole, but you know, we're battling things on two fronts. One is the supply chain, which, you know, obviously, everyone's challenged across the industry and we'll continue to do what we need to do there to make sure that we're taking appropriate steps and minimizing the disruptions in the factory. The second is more in our control and that's the recruiting necessary to get our direct labor headcount to a level where we can continue to increase production. And quite frankly, in the first quarter, that was a limitation on the commercial business, which was getting product out of the commercial factories. We have more products coming out of the factory, we will be able to fix it. What we would expect to see would probably be improvement by the end of the second quarter, because it will take a little while to get those folks in the factory trained and productive on the factory floor. So once we're on the other side of that, it will lend itself to hopefully, what we're expecting is improved profitability in the second half of the year, and back on the trajectory of achieving their three-year long-term target margins.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, the really strength that you guys saw in the quarter, obviously getting a lot of questions from investors about the sustainability of that, is there anything you can share with respect to order activity, later in the quarter and into 2Q to give some confidence that this isn't just a pull forward of channel inventory restock?\nTodd Teske: Yes Nicole, I think the overarching comment that I would make about Residential is continued strength. Early in the quarter, we were challenged even on our Residential business, with component shortages. Now that improved as we got through the quarter, and March was an exceptionally strong quarter for us. We do expect that momentum to continue. What we see in our order rates and our backlog to the extent that you can have a backlog in Residential is ordered demand, very strong. And we're also coming off of a very tough comp last year, where we were up 37% in that business. So, overall record start to the quarter, it is seasonally our latest quarter. We're over a hill, but we have the mountain in front of us, but we still expect to see strength in Residential and quite frankly, also Refrigeration for the balance of the year.\nNicole DeBlase: Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning, and thanks, Todd, for the interim update. In terms of, I suppose just a question around kind of the cadence of earnings through the year, the operating margins I think for the year as a whole are guided to grow slightly, and they were down 110 bps in the first quarter year on year. So just trying to understand operating margins, do we assume they're down again year on year Q2, and then you get sort of 30% plus leverage in the second half to get the operating revenues up for the year overall. And when you're thinking about earnings kind of seasonality or EPS seasonality, are we thinking of sort of a 50/50 type first half or second half split?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes, as you know, Julian, it's been a while since we've had a normal year, going back to the tornado and then, you know, right into the pandemic and here we are today. So I think you nailed it. I think when you look at our earnings seasonality, what we expect this year is going be closer to 50/50. You know, we had an extremely strong start last year in the first half where we were up more than 30% in our Residential business for instance. Margins continued to grow and then things became more challenging in the second half. So comps in the second half of the year should ease a bit. But we would expect margins to be up for the full year.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much, Joe. And then just a follow up, you know, maybe on that point around the resi market overall, I guess, depending on which macro data you look at, some of it suggests there is a lot of inventory out there, not necessarily in Lennox's channels, but perhaps more broadly in the market, their own inventory, and the cash flow statement had a big outflow in Q1, I suppose, because of the anticipation of further good volume demand in Q2, but just wondered your assessment of that, the aggregate sort of selling sell through dynamics kind of in the marketplace, your own channels may look quite lean, but are you worried about the broader kind of inventory pressures out there?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes, when I talk to the folks in our Residential business, what we are hearing is that distributors are hoarding a little bit of inventory for fear that they will not be able to meet end market demand and eventually be able to sell that product regardless. And then, dealers quite frankly, aren't hoarding as much inventory, typically the let distributions more than inventory levels. And we think that they're adequately supplied at this point. Our inventories still remain lean. As you know, as we entered enter this year we were pretty well depleted of finished goods inventory in our Residential business, because of strong demand, so high quality problem. We're addressing that as well. So, looking forward I think inventory in the channel, depending on which channel you look in, once again, with two-step distribution, distributors continue to take on additional inventory, and dealers are more at a, you know, what I would characterize as a normal level of inventory for what they need.\nJulian Mitchell: Great, thank you, Joe.\nJoseph Reitmeier: You are welcome.\nOperator: And we'll go to the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys.\nTodd Teske: Good morning, Jeff.\nJoseph Reitmeier: Good morning.\nJeff Hammond: So, just on the, just back on the Commercial business, I guess, anything you're thinking about doing different structurally for this business? It just seems like, yes the labor issues have kind of ebbed and flowed for multiple years now and I'm just wondering if you don't make sense to diversify, beyond Stuttgart or how to think about that business differently long-term?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes, great question, Jeff. You know, we routinely evaluate our business strategies, and that includes our manufacturing footprint, specifically in our Commercial business where we have one physical manufacturing location. We believe that a multi-location manufacturing strategy could be beneficial to add capacity to support growth, provide manufacturing flexibility, as you mentioned, and with costs in line, quite frankly, add to profitability going forward. So given the current challenges in our Stuttgart facility, and expected growth of the commercial land markets, our Commercial manufacturing strategy is definitely on the table. So I would just encourage you to stay tuned on that front.\nJeff Hammond: Okay, great. And then, you guys always give the market color, and I think the trend has been, you guys are kind of been outperformers, but I know you've taken a pause on kind of new store growth until this year, and some of the issues around Commercial, but maybe just relative to low single digits units in resi and the mid single digit growth in Commercial just level set us on maybe how you think you perform in line or underperform, those kind of market metrics?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes, when I talked to the folks once again in our Residential business and look at the industry data that we have to date, it looks like we're relatively flat on share. So, I wouldn't read into the first quarter dynamics too much other than the fact that we're able to get price. We continue to combat the supply chain challenges, but we're more effective in that in our Residential side of the business. And as far as end market growth, as I mentioned previously, it remains strong when you look at the order rates that we're continuing to see, both in our direct to dealer business along with our two-step business, both were up, quite frankly, Lennox was up, revenue wise, low teens, as I mentioned, but our allied business was up high teens, once again, getting back to the comments that I made about the differences of inventory levels in each of those channels. But overall, for the commercial business, we continue to see steady demand. We're not seeing any of the indications of end market challenges like you might see if the market was ready to turn, meaning a mixed out in our equipment business or product and supplies that outpaced equipment growth. So all the indicators of continued strength in Residential remain intact. And once again, we're excited about our record setting first quarter start, and what lies ahead for us in the balance of the year in our Residential business.\nJeff Hammond: Okay, I appreciate it, guys.\nJoseph Reitmeier: You bet.\nOperator: And we'll go to Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Hey, thank you. Good morning, guys.\nTodd Teske: Good morning, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: Joe, you made a comment. Good morning, guys. You made a comment with respect to potential changes over time in the Commercial manufacturing footprint. But I was wondering maybe just more broadly, if you guys could talk to any changes you expect under the new leadership? And whether it's portfolio, whether it's strategy, anything else? I mean, it's a well run company. It's okay to say that you're not expecting much. But I'd love your opinion on that. And then the second thing, just on the transition of CEO where Todd left before Alok could join, was that, was that the plan all along? And is there any risks that we should be thinking about? Because that's a question we've gotten from investors, but there hasn't been much, there isn\u2019t an overlap. So, just wondering how we should think about that?\nTodd Teske: So let me take, sure. I appreciate that question. Let me take the second question, the second half of your question first, and then we'll go back to the first. So essentially, we did not -- we did plan to have some overlap. However, the way the timing all worked out with the search, and ultimately with Todd, he had another opportunity that I think some of you may have seen now, got announced several weeks ago. And that's really what drove the situation with me being Interim and then not having a lot of overlap with Alok. However, I would tell you that even though Todd is now somewhere else, the fact is, is I have his phone number, and I'll give his phone number to Alok and he made it abundantly clear that he is happy to take any questions or help in any way he can, with the transition of Alok coming in. So, ultimately we hadn't planned it that way, but given timing and personal commitments, that's ultimately the way it shook out. I think at the end of the day, it's everything is working out well. The team here is exceptionally strong. And so I think I know Alok rolling into a very solid situation, a team that is high performing, and as you point out, has really executed well over time. With regards to the first part of your question, and should you expect any changes, as we went through the whole search process, the one thing we made sure, we want to make sure of, is a couple of things. One is culture. The culture here is a really high performing culture and we did not want to lose that at all. And so one of the things that was really important to us as we interview candidates, interviewed candidates was how will they fit with the culture. And Alok clearly rose to the top as it relates to that. We also wanted to make sure that there was experience at scale. And you know Luxfer is a smaller company, but certainly Alok's experience at Pentair running over $1 billion business provided experience at scale. And so those two things along with now, what we've asked him to do when he gets here on May 9 is, take the first 100 days and learn. This company is operating very well. Obviously, we've got some challenges in Commercial, but the team is well aware and is executing on those challenges to alleviate those challenges. And so ultimately, we want to make sure that we're taking a fresh look at the various opportunities that might be out there without losing the foundation of what we've built. And so ultimately, it will be up to Alok to come in, do a review of the business, come back to the Board and give his observations, recommendations, and then ultimately figure out what the next chapter for Lennox is going to be. And so we're really excited. I'm very excited about Alok coming in and joining the company, and ultimately look forward to what the next chapter is. Is there anything imminent, that's a significant shift? Of course not, because Alok has to come in and ultimately learn the business even better than he has already. He's done a lot of homework already and come back and give us his observations and his recommendations.\nGautam Khanna: I appreciate that, thank you. And Joe, just to follow up on an earlier comment you made. You haven't seen any erosion in mix despite the price hikes and all that. Has there been any improvement in the mix, i.e. the bill, I know you've mentioned in past quarters the electronic components are more sophisticated on the higher SEER units as the bottlenecks in that part of the portfolio subsided a bit. Did you actually see a better mix in Q1?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes, Residential mix was up modestly, roughly 1%, but we're not seeing the erosion. One of the things, as you mentioned, Gautam, we're limited because of production on the high end. The more sophisticated electrical components are more difficult to get, and that's limiting availability for instance of 28 SEER, and obviously our commercial products. So that's where we're seeing some of the constraints, but mix overall was slightly up when you look at it year-over-year.\nGautam Khanna: Thanks guys.\nJoseph Reitmeier: You bet.\nOperator: And we'll go to the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Please go ahead.\nTim Wojs: Yes, hey everybody, good morning.\nTodd Teske: Hi, Tim good morning.\nTim Wojs: Hey, maybe just on price, I guess as you think about the pricing contribution between the different segments, how would you kind of distribute, I guess, both the incremental price and just maybe kind of the pricing contribution by segment for the entire year?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes, I think as you would expect, it's more heavily tilted towards the Residential segment. I would expect their yield to be slightly higher than the company average. Company average will be closer to 8. I would expect Residential to be north of that 9. I expect Refrigeration to be on par with that. And then Commercial, given some of the challenges we're experiencing there and the typical time delays of acquiring price versus cost actions, I expect that to be slightly below the company average.\nTim Wojs: Okay. And then what would the carryover impact for next year be? Do you have that number?\nJoseph Reitmeier: I'm trying to get through the first quarter, or excuse me, the second quarter now, Tim, to be honest with you. So we haven't really figured that out. But similar to what we'd experienced this year, there certainly will be some carryover pricing. The price increase that we just announced will be effective early May.\nTim Wojs: Okay, good. And then just as you think about the transition with the SEER regulations in 2023, I mean, what are some of the kind of internal activities that Lennox is doing just to make sure you're kind of ready for that transition when it snaps the line at the end of the year?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes, those things have already been executed, and we're ready to roll, quite frankly. And it's the 2023 -- yes, the 2023 regulatory change that affect both Commercial and Residential. I think one of the unique dynamics we have this year is with the challenges with the supply chain, I think most OEMs are going to shift towards the new minimum efficiency product and probably make minimal investments in those units that are being phased out. And it's different depending on where you're at. For instance, on Residential, in the north, it's on the manufacturer date. In the south, it's on the installed date. And then with Commercial, it's on the manufacturing date as well. So we do have some flexibility there, but I think there's some limiting things that will affect the way that OEMs behave, given the supply chain challenges.\nTim Wojs: Okay, good. Well, good luck on rest of the year. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Brett Linzey with Mizuho Americas. Please go ahead.\nBrett Linzey: Hi, good morning all.\nTodd Teske: Good morning.\nJoseph Reitmeier: Good morning.\nBrett Linzey: Hey, just wanted to come back to the Commercial business and just trying to reconcile some of the pieces there underpinning the activity in the quarter. And specifically, the new construction, down 30% and I would think the system configuration is similar in terms of procuring parts. So I'm just curious what's driving the weakness there? Are you seeing any share shift projects moving around? Any color on that new construction pocket?\nTodd Teske: Yes. I think it's a conscious effort to focus on our national account customers and their planned replacement activities and also the verticals that we're serving. So it's a situation where we've concentrated our efforts in production and making sure that we're preserving the core of the business and protecting the share that is most sticky. And quite frankly, I think that's lending itself to the Commercial new construction numbers being down as significantly as it was. So I don't know if it's necessarily a market dynamic more than it is a conscious effort on our part to preserve the core of our Commercial business.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, understood. And I appreciate the moving pieces on the cost inputs, but at the segment level on a full year basis, what are the incremental margins you're assuming for Residential and Refrigeration?\nTodd Teske: Yes, we don't give specific business unit guidance, so I'm not going to go down that path.\nBrett Linzey: Okay, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks a lot.\nTodd Teske: Thanks, Brett.\nOperator: And next, we will go to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. So on the share losses in emergency replacement and Commercial, and it feels like some of the component shortages are getting to some of the share in Residential as well. How confident are you that once you get beyond these constraints that you can regain that share?\nTodd Teske: Yes, once again, I think our strategy has been to protect the core of the business where the share is most sticky, and that's with our national account customer base. We feel provided the success factors in emergency replacement are having the right product at the right place, at the right price. And once we are able to get through these challenges of direct labor in the factory and then hopefully, improvement in the supply chain, we think we can regain that share pretty quickly. So that will be it. We'll aggressively attack share once we've navigated some of the challenges that we have in the factory and we get more product out of that factory.\nNigel Coe: Okay, great. And then the inventory buildup, I know we've touched on this in the Q&A already, but I'm sure that was by design, you've been running a little bit lower inventory through 2021. Was that buildup really in, mainly in components, so work in progress, finished goods? I mean, any sense, any color on that?\nTodd Teske: Yes, it was really across the board, but to varying degrees. And what I mean by that is, when you look at our raw materials, there's two things in that number. One is slightly more volume, but also the value or inflationary effects have impacted that as well. And then with some of the challenges that we've had in our commercial business, we have a higher work in process category than normal where we've got goods that have been semi-finished and we're waiting for final components to come in so we can finish that. And that's driving some of the build that you see in the inventory numbers, specifically in the commercial business.\nNigel Coe: Right, right. And then just housekeeping, the labor inflation that you talked about, is that in the productivity bucket in your guidance bridge? Would that be elsewhere?\nTodd Teske: No, it's in the productivity. Yes.\nNigel Coe: Good, thank you. Thank you.\nTodd Teske: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning and I appreciate you taking the questions.\nTodd Teske: Good morning, John.\nJohn Walsh: Thank you. Maybe the first question, we've talked a little bit about the manufacturing strategy at Commercial. I'm just curious, you've obviously done some automation in your residential factories, I think particularly down in some of your Mexico facilities. But can you just talk about, is there a difference between Resi and Commercial and how much you can actually automate versus actually requiring a higher labor component to build the unit?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes. I think when you look at our conversion costs, it's typically 15% or less of cost of goods manufactured and the labor component is roughly half of that number. It's fairly consistent when you look at Residential and Commercial, might be a little bit more in Commercial given the configure-to-order nature of the product versus the homogeneous products that we manufacture in Residential. But there's opportunity for us to do more with automation really across the entire portfolio. It's just a matter of us selecting and prioritizing those investments. And we've done things along the lines of auto raising, so certain high impact manufacturing activities, we've tried to make investments in to improve quality and throughput. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to do that along with examining our geographic footprint.\nTodd Teske: And John, the only thing I would add also is that what the company has been very good at is balancing off capital versus labor. Obviously, capital is fixed. Labor is not necessarily fixed. And so one of the things that becomes important at -- and we've got some really great manufacturing engineers in this company that as labor inflation continues, wage inflation continues, obviously the robotics side of things, and the automation side of things, the trade-off may become more balanced to automation and robotics and things like that. Again, not assuming that the inflation doesn't continue to ramp up in that area as well. And so the team is always looking for opportunities to deploy the right amount of capital and maintain the right amount of fixed versus variable in the business so that we don't become imbalanced.\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes, the punch line is John, yes we'll continue to expose opportunities, and there are additional opportunities for automation among other things in our manufacturing strategy.\nJohn Walsh: Great. And then maybe just a housekeeping here. Can you talk about the furnace sales and if that helped the mix in Residential? And then lastly, just heat pumps, as those roll through, does that impact your mix or does that impact your price when you give the -- thank you?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes, it could affect both because we've raised prices on it, so there will be a price element. And then furnaces are some of our higher-margin products. So yes, it will affect the mix favorably as well.\nJohn Walsh: Great, thank you.\nJoseph Reitmeier: You're welcome.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hey guys. Good morning. How are you?\nTodd Teske: Good morning Steve. Doing well thank you.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. I guess I'll save the spirited debate on the cycle for the new CEO. I'll spare you, Joe. So just on the pricing on Resi, any major difference between the independent and the captive on the realized price side?\nJoseph Reitmeier: No, we are able to capture price almost at the same level in both of those channels.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. That's helpful. On the Commercial new construction, what do you think the market actually was there in the quarter? You guys were down 30. I don't think the market was down. Was the market actually up in the quarter on Commercial?\nJoseph Reitmeier: No. Once again, I think commercial new construction may have been flat to slightly down, I think, for the quarter. Once again, Steve, this is for the verticals that we serve. So that's what we saw was it flat to slightly down. We were down more significantly once again due to the conscious effort to focus in other areas of the business.\nSteve Tusa: Right. I just wanted to make sure I had a kind of magnitude there. And then just on the labor inflation side, what is it actually like taking to get people into the factories? Like what kind of cost increases are you having to -- and then benefits you're having to kind of like provide to kind of get people to come to work? I'm curious from more of a not necessarily a Lennox perspective, maybe just more macro. What is that actually taking to get people to come?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes. And it's a bit of a unique situation in the area of Arkansas, where we do business because it's a geography with a declining population and unemployment of 3% or less. So it's a situation where you've got a very tight labor market to begin with. Our wages historically have been at market. But as you can imagine, working in a manufacturing facility and the demands of overtime have resulted in us having more volatile employee schedules than I think our employees have a tolerance for. And then the demographics of the folks that we were hiring more recently have been those that had less than five years' work experience, and most of them were unemployed. So we had to raise wages above market. We went as high in certain areas as high as 25% above where we were previously with the expectation that that would open up a broader pool of candidates for our Arkansas facility. And early reads are, when you look at the demographics of the folks that are now applying for jobs in that facility, those folks have more than five years' work experience and a lot of them are currently employed. So it's doing exactly what we wanted it to do was to broaden the pool of talent that we can pull from and hire folks with a little bit more experienced and probably a little bit more career-minded folks in our manufacturing facility there. So those are the steps we've taken. They came with the -- once again with a price, but we think over time, we'll cover that with productivity initiatives in the factory along with incremental price increases over time.\nTodd Teske: And Joe, you're talking specific to Arkansas. The broader question, Steve, basically, we're not at those kind of levels in the rest of the organization. So what we're seeing is typically what the others are seeing in the market. And we are at market in the rest of our operations. And so we're not seeing anywhere near what we had to do down in Arkansas. That was really specific to that Arkansas plant.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. That's too bad for Joe and Steve. On -- one last one for you, Todd. I think this is kind of a fair question to ask, given you're on the Board here and obviously, overseeing strategy. Does the new CEO have -- I think he took a pretty big swing at his prior employer early on strategically kind of with the portfolio. I mean, does he have kind of a green light to do something major strategic or is Lennox still going to be really just a core HVAC business and putting refrigeration aside, is there kind of a green light strategically here to do something material?\nTodd Teske: So let me go to the premise of your question, Steve. And I'm not totally familiar with everything that happened at Luxfer, but explaining someone else's business is always fun. The -- when you go back to Luxfer, when Alok took over, he needed to take a big swing. The company needed a lot of work. It was really a transformation and there was restructuring and everything else from what I understand that needed to be done. That's very different from where we are here at Lennox. So the fact that he took a big swing shows that he's got the courage to do what needs to be done. At the same time, I would tell you that as he comes in and learns and really immerses himself and assimilates himself into the industry, the company and obviously our team, we want his unvarnished observations and his recommendations. And so, over time, the company has talked, and I know we've -- there's been a lot of discussion at conferences and whatnot with regards to industry consolidation and those sorts of things. We're open to it, but first and foremost, it has to create shareholder value. And as it relates to anything outside of industry consolidation, we're open to it as a Board, as long as it creates shareholder value. And so ultimately, we are not going to put any constraints on Alok from the standpoint that he can't look at this or that or has to look overly in these areas. We want him to take a very broad view of things. And so that's what we're looking forward to and that's ultimately where we are going to get to after he's had a chance to digest and move forward.\nSteve Tusa: Understood, thank you.\nOperator: Next, we can go to the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks, good morning.\nTodd Teske: Hi, Joe.\nJoseph Reitmeier: Hi Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Maybe just following up on Steve's question, so in Resi if the pricing was comparable and Lennox versus Allied, what is volume -- what did volumes spike this quarter? Was volume down in the Lennox business?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Our volume was flat in the Lennox business is the way I would characterize it, and it was up probably mid-single digits and maybe slightly more when you layer in the price on the Allied or two-step business.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, all right, great. Maybe touching base on price in the $335 million you've described and know that the pricing increases are coming in May, does that, -- so the $335 million, is that once you put these pricing increases in May, where that should account for all $335 million or does that contemplate future increases? I'm just trying to understand that a little bit better.\nJoseph Reitmeier: No, that would incorporate just all announced price increases, and then we'll continue to do what we always do. And if inflation continues to run at the pace it does and we need more price work, we'll go out with more prices.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. That makes sense. And then just another real quick one on the Commercial side of the business. We've talked about, obviously, since some of the pressure that you felt this quarter, it seems like some of the labor-oriented costs are structural in nature. I'm just trying to understand from the margin degradation you saw this quarter, was there anything that was kind of like onetime and shouldn't really repeat going forward? Any quantification of that would be helpful.\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes. I think -- and I'm not going to quantify it, but I'll characterize it. It's a situation where if you can imagine, with labor constraints and then compounded by disruption in the supply chain, which results you -- results in you having to reschedule production frequently. Just all of the inefficiencies that, that creates is going to be onetime in nature as we continue to address aggressively address these issues. And once we get on the other side of it, the absence of that bad news will be a tailwind and then will further drive productivity with initiatives. It may be automation as we discussed earlier. But once again, as we employ more people and they become more productive and engaged, we expect a lot of that bad news to go away just by virtue of that. But once again, we'll follow up on more of that with productivity initiatives like we always do.\nTodd Teske: And Joe, that's why we're not changing the long-term target for that business. And so we think that, as Joe points out, the labor gets fixed and the supply chain disruptions gets at the other side of all that, this business has a lot of room to run.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nTodd Teske: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: And next we can go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Thanks. Good morning everyone. I did want to just touch on cycle a little bit. And Joe, you mentioned some of the key things you look at haven't played out. But also, we are in sort of a unique environment. And I just wonder, as you look at the market, right, and we're entering a period here where plus or minus we could say there's little or no volume growth and everybody's revenue growth is on price. Does that, in and of itself, potentially portend peak of cycle? Have you guys thought about that? And what kind of context would you put around that question?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes, we have. Once again, I wouldn't read too much into the first quarter, our seasonally lightest quarter, once again, coming off comps where we were up last year, 32% in volume, 37% in revenue in our Residential business. So once again, I think it's more of a tough comp. And as you pointed out, just some challenging times, but the things that we look at are the overall health of the homeowner and the consumer, we don't see those things. Obviously, they're being challenged but not eroded to the degree where we're seeing a mix down, which would be an indicator that, once again, there's more financial stress on the homeowner along with parts and supply sales. So all the things that we continue to keep our finger on the pulse of point in the direction of continued multiple GDP growth in our residential business, and that's what we continue to see even when we look at order rates and like I said, what I would characterize as a backlog for residential, there's strong order and orders building in the pipeline.\nJeff Sprague: Great, I'll leave it there. Lot of ground covered. Thank you.\nJoseph Reitmeier: Okay, thanks Jeff.\nOperator: I'll go ahead and hand the call back to our speakers here.\nTodd Teske: Great, thank you. So to wrap up, demand remains strong, and we expect another record year for Lennox International, led by our Residential and Refrigeration businesses. We're focused on the current challenges in the commercial business. We've taken aggressive actions and expect operational improvement as the year progresses. Looking ahead overall, the future of Lennox is very bright, and I could not be more excited. Under Alok's leadership, with a strong management team, dedicated employees and a great foundation on which to grow, we look forward to the future and continued success. Thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today. Thanks for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference.

            "name": "Todd Teske",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us. It's great to be here on the earnings call today to review the quarter with Joe during the short interim period until Alok Maskara's start date as Lennox International's new CEO on May 9. Many of you already know Alok across his career from McKinsey to GE, to Pentair and then as the CEO of Luxfer. In the coming weeks and months you'll have an opportunity to reconnect with him or to make introductions. We are excited to have Alok join us to lead the company as we continue to focus on driving growth and profitability to maximize shareholder value. Along with his impressive experience and proven track record of successfully operating businesses through various economic challenges over 25 years, we see Alok as a great fit with the performance culture of Lennox. With his background and experience, Alok was the candidate during the search process that rose to the top of an outstanding slate of candidates. Alok recognizes the firm foundation that's been built at Lennox, and I think Todd Bluedorn was 15 years leading the company, and we will look forward to the next chapter in the company's history. Turning to the near-term, let me start with some highlights on the first quarter of 2022, a record first quarter for revenue and earnings per share. Company revenue in the quarter was up 9% to a first quarter record of $1.01 billion. GAAP operating income was $112 million, down 2%. GAAP EPS was a first quarter record of $2.29, up 4%. Total segment profit for the first quarter was $115 million, down 1% and total segment margin was 11.3%, down 110 basis points. Adjusted EPS was first quarter record of $2.36 up 4%. The record first quarter for Lennox International was driven by our Residential and Refrigeration businesses, which both set new first quarter highs for segment revenue and profit. In Residential revenue was up 11% to a first quarter record of $682 million. Replacement and new construction were both up double digits. Residential segment profit was up 12% to our first quarter record $108 million. Segment margin was down 10 basis points to 15.8%. In Refrigeration, revenue was $144 million, a first quarter record adjusted for historical divestitures. Revenue grew 15% as reported an 18% at constant currency led by more than 20% growth in North America. European refrigeration revenue was up low single digits as reported and up low double digits at constant currency. And Europe HVAC revenue was up high single digits as reported and up mid teens at constant currency. Refrigeration segment profit rose 78% to $14 million our first quarter record adjusted for historical divestitures. Segment margin expanded 350 basis points to 9.8%. Turning to our Commercial business. Demand remained strong, but our commercial operations continued to be impacted in production by labor constraints and global supply chain disruptions. Commercial revenue was down 6%. Segment profit was down 77% and segment margin contracted 1040 basis points to 3.4%. More about this in a moment, but further breaking out revenue. Commercial equipment revenue was down low double digits. Within this Replacement revenue was up low single digits with planned Replacement up more than 20% and emergency Replacement down more than 35%. New construction revenue was down more than 30% in the quarter. Breaking out revenue another way, regional and local business was down mid teens. National account equipment revenue was down mid single digits. On the service side Lennox National Account Services revenue was up high single digits. A few points to make on the performance of our Commercial business. Given the business mix to national account customers in a constrained environment, mix was up as was price. But price increases took longer to work through given contractual obligations, causing inflation to run ahead of the price benefit in the commercial business currently. We announced another price increase of up to 9% for our Commercial business effective May 2 and we will continue to layer in additional price this year. We continue to see additional inflationary pressures in commodities, components and freight, and the global supply chain disruptions continue to create factory inefficiencies along with lingering labor constraints. Our Commercial business continues to be challenged by supply chain disruptions that has adversely impacted production more than our other business. There are unique components in the commercial equipment, primarily electronics and controls to name just a few that distinguish it from our other businesses where we have experienced abnormal delays even for these times. For all of our businesses lead times in the supply chain continue to lengthen. However, they have been especially disruptive in commercials configure to order environment.  We do not know all the components required for a units production until you get all of the specifications of the products configuration from the customer. Our sourcing, engineering and manufacturing teams continue to collectively address supply chain disruptions by working closely with our suppliers and assisting them in addressing their delays, increasing safety stock, rapidly qualifying new suppliers and expanding the supply base along with in-sourcing and substitution where feasible. Even with the actions we continue to take, there are still unavoidable extended lead times for our commercial configured to order products due to delays in the supply chain for certain components. With respect to labor constraints in Stuttgart, Arkansas and surrounding areas where we draw for from for direct labor, unemployment is at historical lows 3% or less. We have been experiencing unprecedented employee turnover in our commercial factory. Part of the turnover stems from late last year and early this year as we navigated the COVID-related disruptions affecting our commercial facility, many COVID exposed employees elected not to return to work at the factory. In addition, our utilization of overtime to overcome production disruptions also impacted employee retention. To ease labor constraints at our Arkansas factory, we have raised wages to attract a broader pool of talent in a very tight market and make Lennox the employer of choice in that area. In addition to raising wages, we have instituted static scheduling in the factory that will ease demands for significant overtime on direct labor and create a better work-life balance for our factory employees. We expect the actions we've taken in the factory of increasing wages and stabilizing the work schedules for our factory employees to significantly reduce absenteeism and improve employee retention easing the labor constraint that along with supply chain disruptions is resulting in commercial manufacturing delays. Our commercial team continues to work diligently to overcome these disruptions with the primary focus taking care of our customers. For the company overall price was pacing ahead of commodity, component and freight pressures, and we expect that to continue through the year. In the first quarter, the company captured $85 million of price for a 9% yield compared to $58 million of material and freight headwind in the quarter. Joe will talk more about it in the 2022 guidance, but we now plan to capture approximately $335 million of price this year, compared to prior guidance of $235 million, with a focus on staying ahead of inflationary pressures. For the company overall in 2022, we are raising revenue growth guidance from 5% to 10%, to a new range of 7% to 11% and we are reiterating EPS guidance of $13.50 to $14.50 for the full year. We are reiterating plans for $400 million of stock repurchases in 2022 as we drive towards another record year led by the strength in our Residential and Refrigeration businesses. Now I'll turn it over to Joe for more detail on the first quarter and our outlook. Hi Nicole. We can hear you now, thank you. Yes, I think it's going be a couple, you know, it's probably going to take a little bit more time, Nicole, but you know, we're battling things on two fronts. One is the supply chain, which, you know, obviously, everyone's challenged across the industry and we'll continue to do what we need to do there to make sure that we're taking appropriate steps and minimizing the disruptions in the factory. The second is more in our control and that's the recruiting necessary to get our direct labor headcount to a level where we can continue to increase production. And quite frankly, in the first quarter, that was a limitation on the commercial business, which was getting product out of the commercial factories. We have more products coming out of the factory, we will be able to fix it. What we would expect to see would probably be improvement by the end of the second quarter, because it will take a little while to get those folks in the factory trained and productive on the factory floor. So once we're on the other side of that, it will lend itself to hopefully, what we're expecting is improved profitability in the second half of the year, and back on the trajectory of achieving their three-year long-term target margins. Yes Nicole, I think the overarching comment that I would make about Residential is continued strength. Early in the quarter, we were challenged even on our Residential business, with component shortages. Now that improved as we got through the quarter, and March was an exceptionally strong quarter for us. We do expect that momentum to continue. What we see in our order rates and our backlog to the extent that you can have a backlog in Residential is ordered demand, very strong. And we're also coming off of a very tough comp last year, where we were up 37% in that business. So, overall record start to the quarter, it is seasonally our latest quarter. We're over a hill, but we have the mountain in front of us, but we still expect to see strength in Residential and quite frankly, also Refrigeration for the balance of the year. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Gautam. So let me take, sure. I appreciate that question. Let me take the second question, the second half of your question first, and then we'll go back to the first. So essentially, we did not -- we did plan to have some overlap. However, the way the timing all worked out with the search, and ultimately with Todd, he had another opportunity that I think some of you may have seen now, got announced several weeks ago. And that's really what drove the situation with me being Interim and then not having a lot of overlap with Alok. However, I would tell you that even though Todd is now somewhere else, the fact is, is I have his phone number, and I'll give his phone number to Alok and he made it abundantly clear that he is happy to take any questions or help in any way he can, with the transition of Alok coming in. So, ultimately we hadn't planned it that way, but given timing and personal commitments, that's ultimately the way it shook out. I think at the end of the day, it's everything is working out well. The team here is exceptionally strong. And so I think I know Alok rolling into a very solid situation, a team that is high performing, and as you point out, has really executed well over time. With regards to the first part of your question, and should you expect any changes, as we went through the whole search process, the one thing we made sure, we want to make sure of, is a couple of things. One is culture. The culture here is a really high performing culture and we did not want to lose that at all. And so one of the things that was really important to us as we interview candidates, interviewed candidates was how will they fit with the culture. And Alok clearly rose to the top as it relates to that. We also wanted to make sure that there was experience at scale. And you know Luxfer is a smaller company, but certainly Alok's experience at Pentair running over $1 billion business provided experience at scale. And so those two things along with now, what we've asked him to do when he gets here on May 9 is, take the first 100 days and learn. This company is operating very well. Obviously, we've got some challenges in Commercial, but the team is well aware and is executing on those challenges to alleviate those challenges. And so ultimately, we want to make sure that we're taking a fresh look at the various opportunities that might be out there without losing the foundation of what we've built. And so ultimately, it will be up to Alok to come in, do a review of the business, come back to the Board and give his observations, recommendations, and then ultimately figure out what the next chapter for Lennox is going to be. And so we're really excited. I'm very excited about Alok coming in and joining the company, and ultimately look forward to what the next chapter is. Is there anything imminent, that's a significant shift? Of course not, because Alok has to come in and ultimately learn the business even better than he has already. He's done a lot of homework already and come back and give us his observations and his recommendations. Hi, Tim good morning. Good morning. Yes. I think it's a conscious effort to focus on our national account customers and their planned replacement activities and also the verticals that we're serving. So it's a situation where we've concentrated our efforts in production and making sure that we're preserving the core of the business and protecting the share that is most sticky. And quite frankly, I think that's lending itself to the Commercial new construction numbers being down as significantly as it was. So I don't know if it's necessarily a market dynamic more than it is a conscious effort on our part to preserve the core of our Commercial business. Yes, we don't give specific business unit guidance, so I'm not going to go down that path. Thanks, Brett. Yes, once again, I think our strategy has been to protect the core of the business where the share is most sticky, and that's with our national account customer base. We feel provided the success factors in emergency replacement are having the right product at the right place, at the right price. And once we are able to get through these challenges of direct labor in the factory and then hopefully, improvement in the supply chain, we think we can regain that share pretty quickly. So that will be it. We'll aggressively attack share once we've navigated some of the challenges that we have in the factory and we get more product out of that factory. Yes, it was really across the board, but to varying degrees. And what I mean by that is, when you look at our raw materials, there's two things in that number. One is slightly more volume, but also the value or inflationary effects have impacted that as well. And then with some of the challenges that we've had in our commercial business, we have a higher work in process category than normal where we've got goods that have been semi-finished and we're waiting for final components to come in so we can finish that. And that's driving some of the build that you see in the inventory numbers, specifically in the commercial business. No, it's in the productivity. Yes. You're welcome. Good morning, John. And John, the only thing I would add also is that what the company has been very good at is balancing off capital versus labor. Obviously, capital is fixed. Labor is not necessarily fixed. And so one of the things that becomes important at -- and we've got some really great manufacturing engineers in this company that as labor inflation continues, wage inflation continues, obviously the robotics side of things, and the automation side of things, the trade-off may become more balanced to automation and robotics and things like that. Again, not assuming that the inflation doesn't continue to ramp up in that area as well. And so the team is always looking for opportunities to deploy the right amount of capital and maintain the right amount of fixed versus variable in the business so that we don't become imbalanced. Good morning Steve. Doing well thank you. And Joe, you're talking specific to Arkansas. The broader question, Steve, basically, we're not at those kind of levels in the rest of the organization. So what we're seeing is typically what the others are seeing in the market. And we are at market in the rest of our operations. And so we're not seeing anywhere near what we had to do down in Arkansas. That was really specific to that Arkansas plant. So let me go to the premise of your question, Steve. And I'm not totally familiar with everything that happened at Luxfer, but explaining someone else's business is always fun. The -- when you go back to Luxfer, when Alok took over, he needed to take a big swing. The company needed a lot of work. It was really a transformation and there was restructuring and everything else from what I understand that needed to be done. That's very different from where we are here at Lennox. So the fact that he took a big swing shows that he's got the courage to do what needs to be done. At the same time, I would tell you that as he comes in and learns and really immerses himself and assimilates himself into the industry, the company and obviously our team, we want his unvarnished observations and his recommendations. And so, over time, the company has talked, and I know we've -- there's been a lot of discussion at conferences and whatnot with regards to industry consolidation and those sorts of things. We're open to it, but first and foremost, it has to create shareholder value. And as it relates to anything outside of industry consolidation, we're open to it as a Board, as long as it creates shareholder value. And so ultimately, we are not going to put any constraints on Alok from the standpoint that he can't look at this or that or has to look overly in these areas. We want him to take a very broad view of things. And so that's what we're looking forward to and that's ultimately where we are going to get to after he's had a chance to digest and move forward. Hi, Joe. And Joe, that's why we're not changing the long-term target for that business. And so we think that, as Joe points out, the labor gets fixed and the supply chain disruptions gets at the other side of all that, this business has a lot of room to run. Thanks, Joe. Great, thank you. So to wrap up, demand remains strong, and we expect another record year for Lennox International, led by our Residential and Refrigeration businesses. We're focused on the current challenges in the commercial business. We've taken aggressive actions and expect operational improvement as the year progresses. Looking ahead overall, the future of Lennox is very bright, and I could not be more excited. Under Alok's leadership, with a strong management team, dedicated employees and a great foundation on which to grow, we look forward to the future and continued success. Thank you for joining us today."

            "name": "Joseph Reitmeier",
            "content": "Thank you, Todd and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter starting with Residential heating and cooling. In the first quarter revenue from Residential heating and cooling was a first quarter record $682 million, up 13%. Volume was flat. Price was up 11% and mix was up 2%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Residential profit was a first quarter record $108 million, up 12%. Segment margin was 15.8%, down 10 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by favorable price and mix. Partial offsets included higher material, freight and warranty costs, global supply chain disruptions, and factoring efficiencies, lower joint venture income distribution investments and higher SG&A. Now turning to our Commercial heating and cooling business, in the first quarter commercial revenue was $188 million, down 6%. Volume was down 16%. Price was up 3% and mix was up 7%. Foreign exchange was neutral to revenue. Commercial segment profit was $6 million, down 77% and segment margin was 3.4%, down 1040 basis points. Segment profit was primarily impacted by lower volume and factory inefficiencies due to labor constraints and global supply chain disruptions, higher material freight distribution and other product costs, and higher SG&A. Partial offsets included favorable price and mix. In Refrigeration revenue was up 15% to $144 million, a first quarter record adjusted for historical divestitures. Volume was up 11% and price was up 8%. Mix was down 1%. Foreign exchange had a negative 3% impact on revenue. Refrigeration segment profit rose 78% to $14 million, also a first quarter record adjusted for historical divestitures. Segment margin expanded 350 basis points to 9.8%. Segment profit was positively impacted by higher volume and favorable price than a year ago. Partial offsets include unfavorable mix, global supply chain disruptions and higher material, freight and SG&A costs. Corporate expenses were $13 million in the first quarter compared to $16 million dollars in the prior quarter. Overall, SG&A was $155 million in the first quarter, or 15.3% of revenue, down from 15.6% of revenue in the prior quarter. Regarding special items, the company had net after tax charges of $2.5 million dollars in the quarter. Net cash used in operations in the first quarter was $98 million, compared to $18 million in the prior quarter as working capital increase primarily due to sales growth, increasing accounts receivable, as well as inventory increasing due to mitigation strategies to combat supply chain disruptions, along with inflationary effects year-over-year on product costs. Capital expenditures were approximately $25 million in the first quarter, compared to $24 million in the prior year quarter. Free cash flow was a use of $123 million for the quarter, compared to a use of $42 million in the prior quarter. And seasonally, we tend to use cash in the first half of the year and generate cash in the second half. The company paid approximately $34 million in dividends and repurchased $200 million of company stock in the first quarter. Total debt was $1.61 billion at the end of the first quarter, and we ended the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.4. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $40 million at the end of the quarter. Before I turn it over to Q&A, I'll review our outlook for 2022. Our underlying market assumptions for the year remain the same. We expect the industry to see low single digit shipment growth in Residential and mid single digit shipment growth in Commercial unitary and Refrigeration markets in North America. We are raising 2022 revenue guidance from 5% to 10% to a new range of 7% to 11% with neutral foreign exchange. And we are reiterating our guidance for GAAP and adjusted EPS of $13.50 to $14.50. Let me now run through some of the other key points in our guidance assumptions and the puts and takes for 2022. First, for the items that are changing. With a second round of price increases announced for 2022, we now expect price to be a benefit of $335 million for the year and 8% yield and this is up from our prior guidance of $235 million. Some headwinds that have increased in our guidance, we now expect approximately a $140 million headwind from commodities, which is up from $110 million previously. We now expect a net headwind of approximately $70 million from components, up from a net headwind of $30 million previously. And guidance for factory productivity is slipping from a benefit of $20 million to flat for 2022. And freight is now expected to be a $15 million headwind for the full year, up from a $5 million headwind previously. Tariffs are now expected to be a $5 million headwind compared to prior guidance to be neutral and we expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be at the low end of our prior guidance at approximately 36 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase a total of $400 million of stock this year. Now for the guidance items that are remaining the same, we are guiding for Residential mix to be neutral and we will assume neutral foreign exchange. We will be at a more normal run rate with distribution investments this year with 30 new Lennox stores planned and SG&A is still expected to be up $45 million this year, including our investments in R&D and IT. Now for a few final guidance points, corporate expenses are still targeted at $95 million. We still plan for capital expenditures to be approximately $125 million this year. And finally, free cash flow is still expected to be approximately $400 million. And with that, let's go to Q&A. Yes, as you know, Julian, it's been a while since we've had a normal year, going back to the tornado and then, you know, right into the pandemic and here we are today. So I think you nailed it. I think when you look at our earnings seasonality, what we expect this year is going be closer to 50/50. You know, we had an extremely strong start last year in the first half where we were up more than 30% in our Residential business for instance. Margins continued to grow and then things became more challenging in the second half. So comps in the second half of the year should ease a bit. But we would expect margins to be up for the full year. Yes, when I talk to the folks in our Residential business, what we are hearing is that distributors are hoarding a little bit of inventory for fear that they will not be able to meet end market demand and eventually be able to sell that product regardless. And then, dealers quite frankly, aren't hoarding as much inventory, typically the let distributions more than inventory levels. And we think that they're adequately supplied at this point. Our inventories still remain lean. As you know, as we entered enter this year we were pretty well depleted of finished goods inventory in our Residential business, because of strong demand, so high quality problem. We're addressing that as well. So, looking forward I think inventory in the channel, depending on which channel you look in, once again, with two-step distribution, distributors continue to take on additional inventory, and dealers are more at a, you know, what I would characterize as a normal level of inventory for what they need. You are welcome. Good morning. Yes, great question, Jeff. You know, we routinely evaluate our business strategies, and that includes our manufacturing footprint, specifically in our Commercial business where we have one physical manufacturing location. We believe that a multi-location manufacturing strategy could be beneficial to add capacity to support growth, provide manufacturing flexibility, as you mentioned, and with costs in line, quite frankly, add to profitability going forward. So given the current challenges in our Stuttgart facility, and expected growth of the commercial land markets, our Commercial manufacturing strategy is definitely on the table. So I would just encourage you to stay tuned on that front. Yes, when I talked to the folks once again in our Residential business and look at the industry data that we have to date, it looks like we're relatively flat on share. So, I wouldn't read into the first quarter dynamics too much other than the fact that we're able to get price. We continue to combat the supply chain challenges, but we're more effective in that in our Residential side of the business. And as far as end market growth, as I mentioned previously, it remains strong when you look at the order rates that we're continuing to see, both in our direct to dealer business along with our two-step business, both were up, quite frankly, Lennox was up, revenue wise, low teens, as I mentioned, but our allied business was up high teens, once again, getting back to the comments that I made about the differences of inventory levels in each of those channels. But overall, for the commercial business, we continue to see steady demand. We're not seeing any of the indications of end market challenges like you might see if the market was ready to turn, meaning a mixed out in our equipment business or product and supplies that outpaced equipment growth. So all the indicators of continued strength in Residential remain intact. And once again, we're excited about our record setting first quarter start, and what lies ahead for us in the balance of the year in our Residential business. You bet. Yes, Residential mix was up modestly, roughly 1%, but we're not seeing the erosion. One of the things, as you mentioned, Gautam, we're limited because of production on the high end. The more sophisticated electrical components are more difficult to get, and that's limiting availability for instance of 28 SEER, and obviously our commercial products. So that's where we're seeing some of the constraints, but mix overall was slightly up when you look at it year-over-year. You bet. Yes, I think as you would expect, it's more heavily tilted towards the Residential segment. I would expect their yield to be slightly higher than the company average. Company average will be closer to 8. I would expect Residential to be north of that 9. I expect Refrigeration to be on par with that. And then Commercial, given some of the challenges we're experiencing there and the typical time delays of acquiring price versus cost actions, I expect that to be slightly below the company average. I'm trying to get through the first quarter, or excuse me, the second quarter now, Tim, to be honest with you. So we haven't really figured that out. But similar to what we'd experienced this year, there certainly will be some carryover pricing. The price increase that we just announced will be effective early May. Yes, those things have already been executed, and we're ready to roll, quite frankly. And it's the 2023 -- yes, the 2023 regulatory change that affect both Commercial and Residential. I think one of the unique dynamics we have this year is with the challenges with the supply chain, I think most OEMs are going to shift towards the new minimum efficiency product and probably make minimal investments in those units that are being phased out. And it's different depending on where you're at. For instance, on Residential, in the north, it's on the manufacturer date. In the south, it's on the installed date. And then with Commercial, it's on the manufacturing date as well. So we do have some flexibility there, but I think there's some limiting things that will affect the way that OEMs behave, given the supply chain challenges. Good morning. Yes. I think when you look at our conversion costs, it's typically 15% or less of cost of goods manufactured and the labor component is roughly half of that number. It's fairly consistent when you look at Residential and Commercial, might be a little bit more in Commercial given the configure-to-order nature of the product versus the homogeneous products that we manufacture in Residential. But there's opportunity for us to do more with automation really across the entire portfolio. It's just a matter of us selecting and prioritizing those investments. And we've done things along the lines of auto raising, so certain high impact manufacturing activities, we've tried to make investments in to improve quality and throughput. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to do that along with examining our geographic footprint. Yes, the punch line is John, yes we'll continue to expose opportunities, and there are additional opportunities for automation among other things in our manufacturing strategy. Yes, it could affect both because we've raised prices on it, so there will be a price element. And then furnaces are some of our higher-margin products. So yes, it will affect the mix favorably as well. You're welcome. No, we are able to capture price almost at the same level in both of those channels. No. Once again, I think commercial new construction may have been flat to slightly down, I think, for the quarter. Once again, Steve, this is for the verticals that we serve. So that's what we saw was it flat to slightly down. We were down more significantly once again due to the conscious effort to focus in other areas of the business. Yes. And it's a bit of a unique situation in the area of Arkansas, where we do business because it's a geography with a declining population and unemployment of 3% or less. So it's a situation where you've got a very tight labor market to begin with. Our wages historically have been at market. But as you can imagine, working in a manufacturing facility and the demands of overtime have resulted in us having more volatile employee schedules than I think our employees have a tolerance for. And then the demographics of the folks that we were hiring more recently have been those that had less than five years' work experience, and most of them were unemployed. So we had to raise wages above market. We went as high in certain areas as high as 25% above where we were previously with the expectation that that would open up a broader pool of candidates for our Arkansas facility. And early reads are, when you look at the demographics of the folks that are now applying for jobs in that facility, those folks have more than five years' work experience and a lot of them are currently employed. So it's doing exactly what we wanted it to do was to broaden the pool of talent that we can pull from and hire folks with a little bit more experienced and probably a little bit more career-minded folks in our manufacturing facility there. So those are the steps we've taken. They came with the -- once again with a price, but we think over time, we'll cover that with productivity initiatives in the factory along with incremental price increases over time. Hi Joe. Our volume was flat in the Lennox business is the way I would characterize it, and it was up probably mid-single digits and maybe slightly more when you layer in the price on the Allied or two-step business. No, that would incorporate just all announced price increases, and then we'll continue to do what we always do. And if inflation continues to run at the pace it does and we need more price work, we'll go out with more prices. Yes. I think -- and I'm not going to quantify it, but I'll characterize it. It's a situation where if you can imagine, with labor constraints and then compounded by disruption in the supply chain, which results you -- results in you having to reschedule production frequently. Just all of the inefficiencies that, that creates is going to be onetime in nature as we continue to address aggressively address these issues. And once we get on the other side of it, the absence of that bad news will be a tailwind and then will further drive productivity with initiatives. It may be automation as we discussed earlier. But once again, as we employ more people and they become more productive and engaged, we expect a lot of that bad news to go away just by virtue of that. But once again, we'll follow up on more of that with productivity initiatives like we always do. Yes, we have. Once again, I wouldn't read too much into the first quarter, our seasonally lightest quarter, once again, coming off comps where we were up last year, 32% in volume, 37% in revenue in our Residential business. So once again, I think it's more of a tough comp. And as you pointed out, just some challenging times, but the things that we look at are the overall health of the homeowner and the consumer, we don't see those things. Obviously, they're being challenged but not eroded to the degree where we're seeing a mix down, which would be an indicator that, once again, there's more financial stress on the homeowner along with parts and supply sales. So all the things that we continue to keep our finger on the pulse of point in the direction of continued multiple GDP growth in our residential business, and that's what we continue to see even when we look at order rates and like I said, what I would characterize as a backlog for residential, there's strong order and orders building in the pipeline. Okay, thanks Jeff."

All lines are currently in a listen-only mode and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Chelsey Pulcheon from the Lennox Investor Relations team. Chelsey, please go ahead.\nChelsey Pulcheon: Thank you, Shelby. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning as we share yet another quarter of outstanding performance. With me today is CEO, Alok Maskara, our new CFO, Michael Quenzer; and our outgoing CFO, Joe Reitmeier. Alok, Michael and Joe will share their prepared remarks before we move to the Q&A session. Turning to Slide 2, a reminder that during today's call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as outlined on this page. We may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management considers relevant indicators of underlying business performance. Please refer to our SEC filings available on our Investor Relations website for additional details, including a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP measures. The earnings release, today's presentation and the webcast archive link for today's call are available on our Investor Relations website at investor.lennox.com. Now please turn to Slide 3 as I turn the call over to our CEO, Alok Maskara.\nAlok Maskara: Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning, and welcome. I'm proud to represent our 13,000 employees as we delivered another full year of record results. We are pleased with our 2023 growth, margin expansion and more important cash generation. Our strong results were noteworthy, given the unprecedented destocking faced by residential HVAC manufacturers last year. I'm deeply grateful for our employees and our customers whose hard work, loyalty and dedication drove the results that we will be discussing today. I would like to begin by highlighting 4 key messages on Slide 3. First, we delivered $3.63 in adjusted EPS for Q4, an increase of 41% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS for the full year was $17.96, a 27% increase year-over-year. Our 2023 full year results were also notable for 6% core revenue growth, 300 basis point expansion in adjusted segment margin. In addition, our operating cash flow more than doubled compared to prior year. Second, we continue to invest wisely in manufacturing capacity, distribution optimization, technology transitions and growth initiatives while maintaining our industry-leading ROIC of 44%. Third, while end market uncertainties linger, our transformation momentum sets a strong foundation and gives us confidence in our 2024 EPS guidance range of $18.50 to $20. Fourth, given the robust progress on the self-help transformation plan, we are pleased to increase our previously announced 2026 financial goals. Now please turn to Slide 4 for more details at 2023 self-help accomplishments. In 2023, Lennox experienced significant success during the first phase of our self-help transformation plan. Our strategic initiatives allowed us to effectively navigate the destocking challenges, which demonstrated our resilience and exceptional execution. This phase laid a solid foundation for future growth and positioned us to capitalize on further growth opportunities. We accelerated growth by strengthening our distribution muscle to better serve our existing customers, attract new customers and increase our share of wallet from HVAC dealers. We are investing in our sales and stores teams to create greater alignment, accountability and autonomy for improving the customer experience. To ensure resiliency we implemented pricing excellence initiatives to recover margins from previously depressed levels as many long-term key account contracts which were signed before the recent inflationary period came up for renewal. We also achieved higher factory output, enhanced productivity and optimize product mix. Together, these measures contributed to the overall margin expansion and strengthened our margin resiliency. Finally, to ensure consistent execution, we implemented a balanced core card-based operating system, which we refer to as Lennox unified management system. This system was instrumental in driving accountability and ensuring alignment with our strategic goals to accelerate revenue growth and expand margins. We also simplified our portfolio with the sale of the European businesses and improved our total life cycle value proposition with the recent AES acquisition. On the next slide, I will share more about how we fine-tuned our internal engine to ensure success of the transformation plan and accelerate growth throughout the journey. Slide 5 shows the 5 components that fueled Lennox's success in 2023 and are building momentum that will continue to power Lennox's bright future. At the heart of our transformation is our unwavering commitment to our vision and mission. These set the true north direction for everything we do, aligning our efforts towards a shared goal. Moving outward, the strategy to great will deliver accelerated growth, resilient margins, execution consistency, advanced technology portfolio and talent and culture that help us win every day. Next is the commitment to our customer charters, emphasizing our dedication to always being a partner of choice by delivering exceptional customer experience and quality solutions. Another crucial element to our outstanding performance was the implementation of our Lennox unified management systems. We are utilizing balance scorecard to drive accountability, integrating standard processes and best practices and aligning operating cadence for efficiency. This represents our commitment to a unified approach that enables Lennox to shift into a higher gear and outperform competition. Lastly, our core values and guiding behaviors serve as a foundation of our high-performance growth culture with a passion for improving the customer experience. Last year, we rolled out 9 guiding behaviors that improved the team's focus on critical behaviors such as positive engagement and sustainability. These 5 components not only helped us build momentum on our self-help transformation this year, but also act as a spring boom to continue our long-term journey of growth and expansion. Before we move into the detailed financial section, allow me a few moments to express my gratitude to our outgoing CFO, Joe Reitmeier. I am thankful for Joe's years of service to Lennox, and I'm especially grateful that stayed with us to train me, the new CEO, and to oversee a smooth transition to our new CFO, Michael Quenzer.  Now for the last time on an earnings call, let me hand the call over to Joe.\nJoe Reitmeier : Thank you, Alok, and greetings to everyone joining us this morning as we announce Lennox's record-setting performance and outlook. I've had the pleasure and privilege of serving as Lennox's Chief Financial Officer during a period of transformation and record-setting achievements. Portfolio changes enable a more intense focus on our key North American end markets, the team introduced new and innovative solutions. We delivered on initiatives that drove significant increases in profitability and that coupled with efficient capital allocation resulted in industry-leading returns on invested capital. We fortified the balance sheet and most significantly, we generated exponential increases in returns for our shareholders. Now before I hand it off to Michael, I'd like to reflect briefly on 2023. It was another year of exceptional performance while strengthening the foundation for the future by investing in our people, sustaining industry-leading innovation and enhancing our capabilities to better serve our customers. Now while I'm extremely proud of my time with such a great organization that has accomplished so much. I take even greater pride knowing that I'm leaving an extremely talented and seasoned team that is very well positioned both strategically and financially for long-term success. I'd like to wrap up my comments with a sincere thank you to all Lennox employees, our valued customers, the investment community and other stakeholders for your partnerships over the years.  I'll now hand it over to Michael, who will take you through the details of Lennox's financial performance and outlook. Michael, take it away.\nMichael Quenzer : Thank you, Joe. Good morning to everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. As Alok mentioned earlier, 2023 has been a record year in the fourth quarter with no exception. Core revenue, which excludes our revenue operations was $1.1 billion, up 7% as price and mix drove the year-over-year improvement. Adjusted segment profit increased $44 million at $69 million of price and mix benefits were partially offset by inflation and investment in SG&A and distribution.  Total adjusted segment margin was 15.9%, up 320 basis points versus prior year. For the fourth quarter, corporate expenses were $30 million, a decrease of $3 million. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 20% and diluted shares outstanding were $35.8 million compared to $35.6 million in the prior year quarter. The fourth quarter achieved record levels of revenue, segment profit and adjusted earnings per share, which grew by 41% to $3.63. Let's shift our focus to Slide 7 and review the financial results of our Home Comfort Solutions segment formerly referred to as a residential segment. The left graph shows revenue grew 1% to a record $709 million in the fourth quarter. The segment benefited from favorable mix of higher efficiency products and effective pricing execution. This was partially offset by volume declines. Although unit sales volumes for the segment declined by 5%, our direct-to-contractor sales volumes remained stable, signaling a resilient consumer demand landscape. Unit sales volumes through independent distribution channels declined more than 20% driven by continued industry destocking. Home Comfort Solutions profit decreased approximately 4% to $115 million, and segment margin also experienced a decline of 70 basis points to 16.2%. The decrease was attributed to a $9 million decrease in sales volumes and $25 million impact from inflation and investments in distribution and selling. Moving on to Slide 8. We will now review the performance of our Building Climate Solutions segment, formerly referred to as the commercial segment. The segment continues to consistently deliver outsize performance each quarter, resulting in another quarter of record revenue and profit. Revenue was $390 million in the quarter, up 19%. Combined price and mix were up 11% and volume was up 5%. Building Climate Solutions profit was $91 million or up 98% and segment margin expanded 930 basis points to 23.2%. These results were primarily driven by price and sales volume gains. The team's execution on several self-help initiatives aided in the recovery of previously depressed profit margins. These initiatives include price corrections, enhanced factory productivity and strengthened supply chain resiliency. The AES acquisition also played a role in the growth during the quarter. The integration is progressing smoothly with existing Lennox customers showing interest in the AES full life cycle value proposition. Ultimately, the fourth quarter continued the year's momentum and resulted in a strong finish to 2023. If you will now turn to Slide 9, I will recap the full year Lennox results. For full year 2023, core revenue, excluding European operations, was $4.7 billion, up 6%. Adjusted segment profit increased $180 million as $348 million of price and mix benefits were partially offset by Home Comfort Solutions sales volume declines as well as inflation and investment in SG&A and distribution. Total adjusted segment margin was 17.9%, up 300 basis points versus prior year. Despite facing volume challenges in the residential end markets, inflationary pressures and ongoing investments, the Home Comfort Solutions segment achieved revenue and profit growth through successful execution of strategic pricing initiatives and the seamless transition to the new minimum SEER standard. The Building Climate Solutions segment also achieved impressive results in 2023. Healing supply chains and factory productivity played a key role in growing volumes in the second half of the year, and pricing execution helped the segment recover previously depressed profit margins from years of higher supply chain and production costs. Exceptional execution by both segments resulted in adjusted earnings per share growing to $17.96, setting a new record and representing a 27% increase compared to the prior year. Moving on to cash flow and capital deployment on Slide 10. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $306 million compared to $132 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $125 million for the quarter, an increase of $91 million compared to the prior year. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.3x, down from 2x in prior year. Our approach to capital deployment remains consistent. We will prioritize organic growth investments with strong returns, grow dividends with earnings and continue to explore M&A opportunities and to supplement with share repurchases when necessary. Lennox's industry-leading ROIC of 44% reflects our dedication to delivering value to our stakeholders through strategic and targeted investments. We not only aim to maintain our high ROIC, but also aimed to make necessary investments to elevate our performance and competitiveness in the marketplace. We anticipate the successful completion of our upcoming commercial HVAC factory and production is slated to begin midyear. While overhead and ramp-up expenses posed known challenges in the first half of 2024, we anticipate the factory will realize productivity benefits in 2025. This facility plays a pivotal role in our sustained growth, enhancing our commercial production capacity by 25% by the end of 2024. It will allow us to better address consumer demand and recapture market share in emergency replacement market. Now let's transition to Slide 11. Here, I will provide an overview of our full year financial guidance for 2024. We anticipating another year of profitable growth, the chart on the left provides key growth drivers with revenue expected to increase by approximately 7%. Alok will provide additional comments on end markets later in the presentation, but sales volumes are expected to remain relatively flat with a slight upward trend from Building Climate Solutions growth and stable Home Comfort solutions end markets. The combination of price and mix is anticipated to contribute to a mid-single-digit growth in revenue, price increases will sustain margins amid continued cost inflation and a slight favorable mix is expected due to the 2023 minimum efficiency regulatory change. In addition to the profit drivers from revenue, we have listed key costs and investment assumptions on the right side of the slide. Component cost inflation is expected to be up mid-single digits, including large increases in our cost to acquire our 410A refrigerant. We expect this to be partially offset by material cost reduction programs. We anticipate ramp-up costs of approximately $10 million for the new commercial HVAC factory along with additional costs associated with the refrigerant transition across our Home Comfort solutions manufacturing facilities. We will continue to invest in information system advancements, distribution growth initiatives and projects to improve customer service. Additionally, we expect to support growth initiatives by making investments in both sales and marketing. While we continue to focus on managing SG&A expenses, we do expect moderate inflation area pressure in 2024. Our guidance for capital expenditures is approximately $175 million. This includes final spending for the new commercial HVAC factory and the 2025 low GWP refrigerant transition. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $50 million and tax rate is estimated to be between 20% and 21%. Incorporating all of these guidance items, we expect earnings per share to be within the range of $18.50 per share and $20 per share. Finally, we expect free cash flow to be within the range of $500 million to $600 million. With that, please turn to Slide 12, and I'll turn it back over to Alok for an overview of 2024 business conditions.\nAlok Maskara : Thanks, Michael. As we look forward to the coming year, it is important to recognize that while our transformation momentum has yielded positive results, we are still facing challenges in the end market. Within our Home Comfort Solutions segment, the health of the consumer will remain a significant driver of demand and greatly influence the repair versus replace dynamic. We are mindful of consumer sentiment, especially in an election year, and we'll continue to track macro data for early indicators. It is important to point out, we have not yet noticed any meaningful shift from replace to repair. EPA rulings have also introduced an element of uncertainty regarding industry inventory levels. Ahead of the R454B transition, we do not anticipate a large pre-buy due to inventory fatigue in the tunnel and the increased cost of carrying inventories. However, we do expect distributors to normalize inventory levels this year as the channel returns to its usual ordering patterns. We also expect ongoing benefits of the strategic pricing initiatives and potential share opportunity as Lennox historically win share during regulatory transitions. Turning our attention to building Climate Solutions, we predict solid demand in 2024. With the data we have from our National Account Services business, we know that rooftop units are aged past historical averages and will need to be replaced soon. 2024 demand may be impacted if key accounts delay installs pending new R454B product availability. End markets may also face challenges related to softening commercial new construction and project delays. Ultimately, our outlook for 2024 remains cautiously optimistic, though we acknowledge the complexities of the market conditions in the coming years. We trust that our proactive strategies focused on driving top line growth, expanding our margins and consistently executing on initiatives will continue to propel Linux towards enhancing customer experience and shareholder value. On the next slide, I will go into more depth on each of the strategies as it relates to 2024. On Slide 13, I want to take a moment to revisit our self-funded transformation plan, which has been steering our current success. As a reminder, this plan is structured around 3 phases over the next several years. Now let's dive into the specifics of our actions for 2024, where we will transition from the initial phase to the growth acceleration phase. This year is pivotal as it sets the stage for the next wave of growth through strategic investments and focused actions. First, we are investing in our sales force to expand customer touch points, enhancing the overall customer experience through digital innovations and anticipating improved output from our new commercial HVAC factory. Additionally, we aim to increase the attachment rate for parts and accessories, ensuring the holistic experience for our customers. Second, we are committed to driving resilient margins. This involves maintaining pricing excellence, leveraging greater productivity from volume recovery, realizing material cost reduction and reaping the mix benefits of transitioning to the new R454B product. These actions collectively fortify our financial position and solidify our sustainable competitive advantage. Lastly, we will leverage the Lennox unified management system to streamline our operations and set clear priorities. Our focused strategy, investment in heat pump growth and enhancement to our distribution network further exemplify our commitment to consistent management execution. 2024 is a year of purposeful actions that will propel us into the growth acceleration phase and lay the groundwork for our journey into the expansion phase. I am confident that with our collective dedication and strategic approach, we are not just following a plan, we are shaping our future success. Now please turn to Slide 14 for an update on our long-term financial goals. It has been just over a year since we introduced our 2026 goals and are confident that our execution is ahead of schedule, even though market uncertainties persist. We are pleased that Building Climate Solutions has achieved record margins and that Home Comfort solutions demonstrated margin resiliency, even while facing significant volume headwinds. With this year's achievements, we recognize the need to adjust our long-term goals to better reflect our current positions. For 2026 we are now targeting revenue of $5.4 billion to $6 billion, with total company target margin range of 19% to 21%. Our free cash flow conversion target is approximately 90% as we complete the necessary investments to support our growth. We are increasing the long-term target for Home Comfort solutions to a range of 20% to 22% ROS and building Climate Solutions to a range of 22% to 24% ROS. Now for a wrap up, please turn to Slide 15 for the reasons I continue to believe that Lennox is a great investment opportunity. Lennox operates in growth end markets has resilient margins demonstrates execution consistency and serves its customers through advanced technology and high-performance talent. The 5 reasons we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong results are: first, we will continue to make strategic growth investments to improve our go-to-market effectiveness and support consumer demand. Second, our margins remain a focus as we continue to evaluate our pricing strategy, implement innovative solutions to increase productivity and optimize our direct-to-dealer network. Third, while leveraging the Lennox unified management systems, our teams will be able to streamline processes, leverage best practices and consistently deliver strong results. The fourth aspect reflects our continued technology advancements that ensure Lennox will remain at the forefront of innovative solutions for our customers. Finally, the introduction of our guiding behavior enhances our team's focus on core values and fortified our high-performance culture. Our refreshed pay-for-performance incentive structure further aligns the talents of our team and the interest of our stakeholders. Allow me to wrap up by saying thank you to each of our dedicated employees and valued customers. I am proud for what we were able to accomplish this past year, and I'm looking forward to the promising future that lies ahead of Lennox as our best days are still ahead of us. Thank you. We will now be happy to take questions. Easy questions can go to Michael and I and the harder questions should go to Joe Reitmeier.  Operator, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJeff Hammond : Joe, look forward to seeing you in Cleveland, look me up. Just on margins, I'm just trying to think about the puts and takes. You've got some profit incrementals on the left of Slide 11 and then you talk about a number of headwinds. I'm just wondering if you could put a finer point on just overall incrementals embedded in the guide and maybe how to think more five point. Much of this refrigerant inflation, manufacturing efficiencies are going to cost similar to how you did for the factory ramp-up costs?\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes. So on the left-hand side, you can see our contribution margins. And on the right-hand side is the increase related to rate for costs as well as investments. So you have to join those two together see the full impact. But we do expect some margin improvement for the enterprise next year when you look at the combined. Our component costs are a big piece of our cost of goods sold are nearly 45% and then refrigerants also going to go up significantly. So most of that pricing should be there to maintain our current gross margins and then we'll get a bit of leverage on the volume and a little bit of leverage on the acquisition as well. But overall, we do expect margins to be up just not 300 basis points like we saw in 2023.\nJeff Hammond : Okay. And then can you just talk about your inventory destock process with respect to your company-owned distribution? And just on the independent channel, where are you at? Or what are they telling you in terms of how much more to go on destock?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. I'll take that, Jeff. On our own internal -- I mean I always think we can get more working capital improvements, but I think we are reaching a level, especially given the upcoming A2L transition, but I think the levels are going to be relatively flat. We might have to build up some towards the second half of 2024, and that's embedded in the guide just to ensure a smooth transition. On the independent China, I mean, honestly, the destocking in Q4 was more than we expected. And we do think there's going to be some destocking happening in Q1, especially on product line eases whether that's impact of weather and all, we don't know. But I think from overall, we do expect some destocking bleeding into Q1, but remain confident that by second half or Q2, independent channel distribution destocking would be largely behind us, especially as the distributors get ready for a A2L transition and the EPA ruling allows them some sell-through in 2024 as well. So lots of moving pieces, but we've embedded all of that in the guide, Jeff.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe : Congratulations, Joe. Enjoy your retirement. So I'm not sure whether it's a tough question or not. But just on the -- I think maybe on the back of Jeff's kind of question about incrementals. You've got price mix as a 90% incremental margin. So just wondering how that plays into the mid-single-digit component inflation math. So maybe I'm just asking Jeff's question again, but if you just see mid-single-digit contribution from price mix with the incremental, you get to sort of a $3 to $4 EPS tailwind. Is that how you're thinking about it?\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes. I mean what we have to do is look, it's predominantly price, price drops through to 100%. There's a little bit of mix that we'll get from the carryover benefit from the minimus year transition. So that will kind of drop through at 30%. When you blend the 2 together, you kind of get to the 90, but then that then covers some of the cost inflations we have on the right-hand side where we think our components are going to be up significantly, both from the normal inflation, mid-single digits as well as the refrigerant. So that kind of sets a lot of that, which maintains your gross margins. And then thereafter, we start to make investments in distribution and SG&A. And we still see overall operating margins improving think of it maybe a little less than 50 basis points within the guide.\nNigel Coe : Okay.\nAlok Maskara: And I think if I could add to that, Nigel, keep in mind, the factory inefficiency both for the start-up in Saltillo or the commercial factory and for the A2L conversion, but that's fairly massive transformation we have to do. Every line has to be redone. We'll have tiers of factory shutdown. So we bake in all of that -- so I understand your question. It's just we got to -- we baked in all of those inefficiencies in our guide.\nNigel Coe : I get it. I understand that now. And then just on the component inflation of mid-single digits. We talked to some of the motor manufacturers, some heat exchange suppliers. And it doesn't feel like they're targeting mid-single-digit price increases in 2024. So just curious where you're seeing that mid-single-digit price inflation. And maybe just talk about the 410A, what your expectations are in terms of that commodity inflation in 2024.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. First of all, you should give me the list of all those people that were telling you that. So we can go and negotiate, use their work on that. I'd love to get that Nigel. But no, more seriously, some of it comes down to the starting point. In some cases, on components, we did have long-term contracts that are coming up for renewal. So we may have like escaped some of the inflation in the past. The other thing you've got to see in the 410A, I mean, the spot pricing, the contract pricing and where we are still a lot of moving pieces. But based on the production quota reduction from EPA, we fully expect and have baked in inflation on 410A. And overall, I mean inflation is lower than before, but it's not gone away, whether it's SG&A or NAV factors. So we've built all of that in as we looked at what's going to happen in 2024 for us. but we do continue to see inflation in components, especially if our long-term contracts come up for renewal.\nNigel Coe : Right. I'll e-mail those suppliers to you offline, okay?\nAlok Maskara: Thanks, Nigel.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc.\nTommy Moll : I wanted to start on price mix and your outlook for the year, mid-single-digit contribution. Can you give us any sense of the phasing there? I presume it's going to contribute a little bit more to growth in the back half versus the second half? And then if you think about what's the art of the possible here over the next 2 years, Alok, I think in the past, you've said 15%, 15% plus is a good bogey to use for where we'll land by the end of 2025. But I wonder if you could just refresh us there? And are you any more or less confident on that outlook?\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes. So I'll first answer on the price, we see that mostly starting to build in through Q2, Q3 and Q4. As we announced in Q1, it will take a little bit of time to get that new price increase. But in Q1 is where you'll see the carryover benefit on the mix side from the minimum SEER product, we'll get the full year benefit of that.\nAlok Maskara: I think, Tommy, on the overall, we stick to the 10% to 15% total pricing impact by 2025. A large part of that is going to happen in 2025 as like in our 54 products start getting launched towards the tail end or second half of this year. So we will see a lot more of that benefit next year than they will see this year which is unfortunate because we'll see some of the manufacturing inefficiencies this year as we transition our line from 410 to 454B, a lot more of the benefit coming to as tail half of this year or like early next year is when we start seeing those benefits. But our view and outlook has not changed on that, and I was glad to see that others in the industry are also now catching up to that dynamic because there's extra cost of sensors, there's extra cost of controls, there's extra cost that we're going to do as we look at the heating capacity, compressors. There's just a lot of extra cost that we must offset.\nTommy Moll : Good to hear. I wanted to follow up with a question on M&A. There's another participant in the market that's talked about potentially turning loose of some assets. Begs the question just about your appetite for M&A at this point or any insight you might share there?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. I expected that to be one of the first question. I'm surprised it was a third question on the call today. So but [indiscernible]. Listen, I'll start by saying a few things, right? First of all, in the past, even before my time, Lennox has been very clear that if there is an industry consolidation opportunity, Lennox will like to participate. And we have specifically named out companies that we would like to participate if that came on. So let me just confirm that, that view has not changed. We still believe that if there's an opportunity that Lennox would be a participant in that. Overall, when I look at it industry consolidation, it's good for quite a few reasons. As we look at increased regulations, as we look at dealer consolidation. I think we'll better serve our customers. We'll better look at technology to come to the consumer. I think it gives us the right kind of investments that we can make to succeed. So I think it's going to be good. We would like to participate as and when things become clear and available. I don't want to comment specifically on any specific company and the news. But all I can tell you is that we don't have to do this. I mean, we are very confident in our own stand-alone strategy as well. We have sufficient scale to compete. We are gaining share in respective segments. We have like a very good technology team and a great path forward. So I think that's kind of the balanced outlook on that is if there's an opportunity, we would like to participate, but we're also very confident on where we are positioned ourselves.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell : Thanks, Joe, for all the help. Maybe just a first question on the sort of cadence of earnings through the year, is it can be kind of tricky looking at -- does pre-COVID seasonality apply or has something changed and we have the nuance of the Mexican plant and the refrigerant change. So are we assuming it's a kind of sort of 50-50 split first half versus second half earnings and then Q1 and always seasonally low and maybe you're starting out the year with weak home comfort volume.\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes, I think I'd look at the revenue seasonality in kind of 50-50. Q2 and Q3 should be pretty similar kind of 30% of the year each then you have kind of 20-ish in Q1 and Q4 on the revenue guide. That's similar to what we saw in 2023.\nJulian Mitchell : And then if we're thinking about the split within Home Comfort solutions for the year as a whole in terms of volumes. How wide a bifurcation should there be in the director contractor versus independent distribution? Just trying to understand kind of how quickly that delta narrows after being very significant in the fourth quarter.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. I think overall, we expect that to get even by 2025. I mean, in the independent channels of the distribution channel, we fully expect, because of comps and because of inventory get to appropriate level, increase in sales versus last year. We're not sure of the timing on when that stops, given all the comps and everything else. But we do think inventory levels and order patterns normalize and we will see a bounce back in our sales to the channel, irrespective of what happens from the channel to the dealer. On the dealer side, we were pleased with the resiliency that we saw, although volumes were down, they were better than most of us expected. And that resiliency gives us comfort going into 2024, and we expect and have baked in sort of flat to down numbers on that going into 2024. Just because of all the chatter around repair, replace, interest rate, election year, which so far has not turned out to be true, but we want to kind of make sure we put all of that and let [you guys] decide. Like here are assumptions that you can decide how you look at it. We focused on what we control, and we know we are going to win share through the transition, and we are recovering our service levels nicely.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye : Here's a potentially easy one. What drove the rebranding of the segments? Any functional difference to be aware of?\nAlok Maskara: No, no functional differences to be aware of. We simplified it from 3 to 2. We had some internal confusion going on between business unit name and segment name so we embarked on a new branding, which I guess the positive message. Overall, at Lennox, we have not focused on building a brand with dealers and consumers, and there were just different confusion going on. We simplified our websites. We have huge investments in improving our customers' experience, introducing new technology, updating even our e-mail addresses and our lennonx.com. It was part of a big rebranding exercise. It was just about time to differentiate residential segment from business unit, but I wouldn't read anything more to it besides just simplifying our internal nomenclature and better reflecting what we do, right? Because what was called commercial also had a tiny bit of refrigeration in there. So I do think the new names better reflect what we do and are more consistent with our new branding guidelines.\nNoah Kaye : Alok, as you talked about in your prepared remarks, a significant effort over the past year around the culture. You mentioned implementing more pay for performance. Can you highlight what some of those major changes were functionally in terms of pay for performance, what types of metrics you're trying to incent people towards, the timing of when you did those and how you might expect that to impact behavior and performance as we get into '24.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. Let's start with me and the highest level on the executive staff. So last year was the first year where our short-term incentives had a growth component or a revenue component to it. So 20% of our [indiscernible] STI now comes from growth. And that just changed the mindset. Just to give you an example, but let's take it down to a few levels on where it really matters. So if you think about sales incentives and compensation, it used to be the other way around because only on revenue are not enough on profits and margins. So as we talked about accountability, autonomy and in deploying all of that in the sales force, we are now measuring our sales team more on profits, more like a distributor would measure them versus purely on revenue. So that's kind of the 2 switches on the more senior level, more focused on growth and on the street level, more focused on profitability and profit margins. And that's a long journey because you can't change these things overnight, especially if they have been seeped into the culture for many, many years. But we are pleased with the early results and fully prepared for the long-term journey as we add technology and finance score cards and metrics-driven behavior versus the storytelling behavior, sometimes pleased to get there.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie : Thank you, Joe, for everything. Have a great retirement. It's well deserved. So my question is for Alok and Michael. It sounds like the implied 1Q guide is above where consensus is today and consensus is towards the high end of your full year guidance for the year. So like I'm just trying to understand kind of like the conservatism that might be baked in to the low versus the high end. So any color you want to provide there would be helpful.\nAlok Maskara: Sure, I'll start, and then Michael will jump in. Because we really did not consider consensus was giving guidance, and we don't give guidance by quarter. But here's what we did, right? We laid out the volume assumptions on Page 11, so you can look through that. And that kind of brackets are low end and the high end, all on the volume assumptions. As we look at it, Q1 is going to be a little weird because we get more mix benefits, as Michael said earlier, because last year, we still had old SEER and new SEER products. Some of the price increases go into effect in February for us, as you saw along with the other competition. So you get only half a quarter benefit on that. And seasonality will be similar to what we have seen unless there are any unusual weather patterns. So honestly, we didn't spend tons of time looking at quarter-over-quarter. We were just thinking of the longer term where we are focused and drive that. Michael, what would you add to that?\nMichael Quenzer : Yes. I would just add, we obviously don't give quarterly guidance. But generally, when you look at the seasonality that you plot as we just talked about, maybe a little bit more destocking as Alok talked about through the distributor business in Q1 and then starting to revert back up thereafter. And then a little better production out of the commercial factory, maybe little better volumes in Q1 from commercial as well.\nJoe Ritchie : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And I guess, look, just a follow-up question to M&A. Maybe just remind everybody what your criteria for M&A would be? And if you're looking for potential deals in the space. What is your kind of appetite to go broader internationally versus the footprint that you have today, which is predominantly U.S.\nAlok Maskara: I mean I think from our perspective, we like where we are positioned. So let's start that like we think we are positioned in an attractive market. That happens to be North America, but it could be somewhere else. I mean what we look for is attractive end markets, where we can win, where we can succeed, where we can generate the appropriate returns. I don't think we exited Europe because of Europe. We exited because the margin profile was weak, and we did think we were positioned to win there. So I don't want to make any specific comments and rule anything in or out at this stage. But we will look at those things is how does it benefit our shareholders? Are we positioned to win. Does it create attractive opportunities for us versus share buyback? I mean, end of the day, we have done very well, and we'll continue to do well based on share buyback. But I mean we're going to look for markets where we are positioned to win.\nOperator: I will take our next question from Damian Karas with UBS.\nDamian Karas : I wanted to ask you about your commercial outlook for this year. You spoke to a lot of the pent-up demand and the older installed base. You're guiding the building come for volumes to up low singles. Could you maybe just kind of parse that out, how you're thinking about planned replacement versus emergency and new construction?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So I'll tell you, it's maybe a tale of 2 halves that is quite a few moving pieces, but let's talk positives, right? I mean our order rate remains strong. Our backlog although doesn't matter, but in the short-term backlog remains solid. Our sales team is pretty excited and we see no impact of any of the things that we read about, whether it's KBI index and all that, we do see some projects moving to the right. So we are a bit cautious as we go into it. We also -- as we talk to our key accounts find a lot of enthusiasm around the R454B product and are somewhat concerned that maybe towards mid- to late this year, they might say, \"well, I'll just wait for the 454B versus take the existing product.\" So that's kind of baked into us, we looked at the guide for different competing factors, just to go back to it, pleased with the current order rate, please with the current backlog, freeze with our production output excited about this Saltillo factory, even adding more to our output because we remain supply constrained versus demand constraint. And they just want to reflect some of the noise/what we see in the future is slow in construction and any weird air pocket that could come in if you look at 454B transition.\nJoe Ritchie : I guess just thinking about the overall industry, look, I know you said you think consolidation could be a good thing for the market, but you're expecting to kind of gain share. I guess one of my observations coming out of the HR, it does feel like there's a bigger push in the U.S. by some of these overseas players. I'm wondering if you're perhaps seeing any increased competition or expect to maybe see some over time.\nAlok Maskara: We saw that too -- and I'm sorry, I missed you at the HRI show, but like I went to all the boots and it was impressive on some of the overseas players and the amount of money spent on the booth. I'll tell you the amount of money they spend in the pools correlated to the market share in U.S., it probably more reflects their aspirations for the future. I think what these players have done very well, it comes to mini splits and VRF, but if it comes to traditional unitary products, I think very few -- if any of them had any success, and that's where the core U.S. market remains very, very different and you know many splits and all are still in single-digit market share overall and had a tough year in '23. But listen, we are -- on the only -- we are the only unaffiliated player in U.S.  So we look at the international players, both as a threat and as an opportunity to be able to work with them to drive our joint market share in some areas. But we also look at it as a threat. So that's the way we look at it, but we were pleased with the interest we are getting on our own new products like at AHRI, we were pleased with people excited about new production capacity we're adding, the emergency replacement products that we displayed and just general energy from our sales team on how robust the activity was. It was the highest attendance AHRI show has had, which kind of makes me more optimistic on the economy than what I read in the newspapers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray : Maybe if you could just expand on the comment, a lot of discussion on the new refrigerant. And Alok, I think you said you're not expecting a prebuy. And I think you added the term, there might be some -- was it inventory fatigue. Just it's an interesting concept. Maybe you can expand on that, please, if I heard that correctly.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. I mean, historically, these transitions had a lot of prebuy from the independent channel. But because of the confusing EPA rulings that came out in sort of November, December, I think the channel is -- just a little concern about landing up with obsolete products. And since they see the manufacturers being pretty prepared, they may not feel the need higher interest rate works in that environment as well. And the overall given how much inventory people were holding because of the CEO transition just 2 years ago because of the COVID disruption a year ago. Some of the distributors are just working with us and saying, why don't you manage that for us? Make sure your lead times are low, and I can get it quickly. I may not want to spend a warehousing space and the cash to build up. Now but listen, if you're wrong, we will have upside in '24 and downside in '25. I mean over a 2-year period, it normalizes anyway. So we will be prepared if people decide to have a prebuy, but based on as we were looking at it, we just said, let's not take any of that in.\nDeane Dray : And then second question, just on the longer-term targets, the free cash flow at 90% seems like you are under promising there because this is not a capital-intensive business. You should be by -- from our perspective, closer to 100. And I know you've had a big CapEx push over the near term, but are you baking in more capacity expansion in that free cash flow conversion, but it just seems light versus what your potential is.\nAlok Maskara: That slide went through so many changes over the past 48 hours. We tried to give a range. We tried to -- but listen, if you're starting the year and you got $175 million of CapEx, you're not going to reach 100 in a 3-year period, right? I mean, just where we are. But in the long term, I think we'll get to 100 at some investments.\nJoe Reitmeier: The other main driver is as we grow revenue, you're going to have net working capital growth with that revenue. CapEx to be closer to depreciation by 2025 and 2026. So it's mostly related to just growing working capital with the revenue growth.\nDeane Dray : What's the working capital -- working capital sales target associated with that 90%?\nJoe Reitmeier: Upper teens.\nAlok Maskara: Yes, 15% to 20%, like it's higher on our direct model, lower on the indirect side, probably in the range of...\nDeane Dray : Upper teens is fine.\nAlok Maskara: Yes, it below 20 overall. But listen, 1 thing is our cash flow, we don't do any adjustments, right? I mean this is our -- the checkbook balances.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Ryan Merkel with William Blair.\nRyan Merkel : I had 2 questions. First, on the fourth quarter, in terms of weather, how big of an impact was the mild winter? And did you see any lift with the cold snap in January? And then my second question is just on the cadence of commercial margins. It sounds like it might be up slightly year-over-year. Is the first half sort of down a little and the second half is up a little bit? Just any help.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. I'll let Michael answer the second one, and then I'll come back to the first one. So Michael, why don't you go ahead.\nMichael Quenzer : Yes. So on the commercial margins, yes, we'll see a little bit of a headwind, though, on the factory ramp up in the first half, but we'll get the benefit of the mix and a little bit of volume. That should kind of neutralize each other. So overall, margins should be up in commercial, but I think they'll be kind of flattish throughout the year with those 2 elements adjusting against each other.\nAlok Maskara: And I think to the first question on weather. I learned early in my career, Ryan, that never ever talk about weather when you have a challenging number set to be delivered. But based on like where we are, yes, Q4, we had some of the kind of the warmest winter, and that did negatively impact our daily order rates and we track the same things you guys would track on average heating days and cooling days. And yes, Q1 with the cold streak, we have had a good start based on, as you would expect on the weather, but we don't know what tomorrow looks like or February looks like, but both your statements are correct, Ryan.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Tim Wojs with Baird.\nTim Wojs : Thanks for the entry here. Joe, congratulations and it\u2019s been good working with you. Just 2 quick ones for me. First, as you look at \u201825, just given the transition kind of changing from \u2013 I can\u2019t remember, just EPA or DOA and \u2013 or DOE, allowing the sell-through. Would you expect to still sell through a fair amount of R410A product next year through your own distribution? And then just a second question on the kind of longer-term mix benefits from A2L, I think, Alok, you said 10% to 15%. Is that a change from what you said before? Or is it just kind of some rounding?\nA \u2013Alok Maskara: No. I think the second one for us, it\u2019s just kind of rounding because \u2013 we give longer numbers, we\u2019ll get some benefit this year as well. So I\u2019ll try to portray what 2025 looks like, right? So that\u2019s just rounding. Maybe I should just stop giving ranges and pick a center line like 15 here. Tim, on the first one, there\u2019s still some uncertainties and EPA is not coming up with the final rule, they have indicated to rules. Listen, our preference would be not to make 410A products. But based on currently the way it\u2019s written; we\u2019ll probably be forced to make some 410A products next year. And that would be then impacting the 10% to 15% number because there will be some 410A products, they\u2019re going through the factories as people can repair outdoor units using new 410A products. I know it\u2019s a weird dynamic there. So still waiting for some clarity on that. We would prefer not to make 454 \u2013 not to be 410A for manufacturing efficiency and other reasons, but we are just at a stage that we\u2019ve got to see how the final rules plays out and how each of the state adopts it, too.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague : Two quick ones from me. Just back to kind of M&A, maybe just a little bit of color on where your comfort zone is on leverage. I think you talked about kind of normal leverage targets before. But like where is the flex target for something bigger that you'd be comfortable to work down from?\nAlok Maskara: I think when the time is right, we'll have that discussion with the board and put it all together. I mean, from our perspective, that have to be an opportunistic discussion on something that's attractive to the company. But yes, if it's attractive to our shareholders and we need to lever up. The key question would be is, would we get back to our preferred leverage range within a year or 2. I mean that's what our focus is going to be. So you can do the math backwards, right? I mean as long as we think there's real cash, and then we can use that cash to get back to our long-term leverage goals within a couple of years. I think we could make that work. But investment grade thing is important to us, right? I mean we are not in [indiscernible] shop or anything else like that. We'll maintain investment grade.\nJeff Sprague : Understood. And then just on CapEx. Has the amount of CapEx expected for the total program, the new plant and otherwise changed. I think you were talking about $150 million in CapEx for 2024 previously. Now we're at [175]. I was just kind of getting through it faster. Maybe you could just provide a little additional color there.\nJoe Reitmeier: The total program is still the same. We just have some additional CapEx that we have in 2024 to prepare for the new refrigerant products and investments with [tanks] and new refrigerant lines within the factory that also come in this year.\nJeff Sprague : And normal CapEx when we're all through this is $75 million to $100 million a year?\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes, with inflation, probably not closer to 100 like...\nAlok Maskara: Yes, I think it'd be closer to 100 million, 110, not 75 to 100. Just growth and maintenance built into that, right? Maintenance might be 75, 80, but to support our growth, we probably will add more. So I would say it's north of 100.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.\nSteve Tusa : Yes, I missed you at HR. I'd say attendance of investors was also at a record which may be inversely correlated to multiples someday, but we'll see.\nAlok Maskara: I saw you from far in a different company booth, but you're holding a good audience, I didn't interrupt.\nSteve Tusa : Yes, yes, yes. Lots of great details of that show, for sure. Just on the price capture dynamics. I think you guys had talked about doing some midyear price increases this year, your capture was in the fourth quarter around 2%. Can you maybe just talk about how -- what types of things you were doing at midyear and what your kind of net realization was and how that waterfall works?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. I'll start. So I think the overall, as we talked about price increases, we talked about doing residential new construction price increase in the middle of 2023. That did go ahead as expected and as we looked at the overall drop-through that is about what we expected, maybe a share worse than we expected, to be honest. And I think that just came down to the mix between residential new construction and the seasonality baked in there. Not a whole lot of R&C gets shipped towards in the Q4 time frame. So from that perspective, that went as we expected. We have key account price increases going into effect this year, mostly early this year, and we know we announced a price increase, broader 1 and that goes into effect in February. So all the pricing actions that we talked about is gone as we had expected. We remain comfortable on where we are. And it's been good to see that the whole industry moving in that direction as well.\nSteve Tusa : Yes. And I guess just on a unit basis, what was the actual revenue for the captive business in fourth quarter? And what was the -- putting parts aside, what was the unit volume for that business, the captive resi business?\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes. So total revenue through distributors was down high to mid-teens and then the direct was up high single digits for Q4.\nSteve Tusa : So your unit volume in Q4 for that business was actually up.\nJoe Reitmeier: Correct. Low single digits.\nSteve Tusa : Okay. And one last one, just on the new A2L product. When is first call for you guys? And what's your -- when will you be able to actually ship that product? When will the distributors like see the specs and a physical product, like what's kind of the schedule of that rollout just on the ground physically?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So I think with the key distributor, they're already seeing the spec. We're already going through the training and all that. First physical product probably comes out in the second half of this year. And we will start with sort of the high-end products, I think the consumer's appetite for going to R54B is going to be more and faster. And then we will slowly transition towards the lower year and the lower-end products. So we'll start with the higher end towards the middle of the year. And we are on track or ahead of schedule on each of those things. We don't expect any R454B for meaningful sales, can we put on a showcase on display booths in first half of this year, yes. But for somebody to actually place a PU and buy would be in the second half of this year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.\nJoe O'Dea : On the kind of commercial mix, can you just talk to how -- what percentage of the mix was emergency replacement in 2023 and how you're thinking about that stepping up in 2024. I think normalized as maybe something like 30%, but I think still on sort of a migration toward normal.\nAlok Maskara: Yes. So listen, we were close to 0. I think we hit double digit in '23 in terms of trying to get to emergency replacement. Barely, I would say, high single digit, double digits in 2023, and that includes both our direct and going to through our distribution partners. And we still think there's a lot of room ahead. We probably won't move that needle until Saltillo comes in production in the second half of this year. So expect us to hover in high single digits, low double digits until Saltillo comes online.\nJoe O'Dea : Got it. And then what are your thoughts on when we think about the residential side and the direct demand sounds like trended better than anticipated in '23 indirect sort of worse. And so how do you align those 2 things? Is your assessment that channel inventory is just thinner than historical averages? And why would direct trend better and indirect destock headwinds trend worse?\nAlok Maskara: Listen, as we talk to our distribution partners, and we're very close to them. It's not the channel inventory had more talk than we thought. And yes, with the EPA ruling and then everything, the channel essentially flows in Q4, especially they're worried that for a while remember the fear was that you would not be able to sell 410A products, unless it was replacement starting December 2024. So I think that ruling created just a freeze mentality in our channel, which I'm glad EPA issued some clarification and coming up with final ruling. But the direct business holding out better than we thought was actually a positive. I mean, which means the consumer is being resilient, and we were pleased with that resiliency. Now being the CEO of Lennox, I also think we gained share, so that's something we will watch out for as numbers normalize. It's hard to figure out share dynamics right now given things are unclear on how much of it is us winning share and how much is the fact that we are going direct, but I mean, from numbers that we see, I mean, we gain lots of shares. We just need to figure out how much of that is transitionary versus rail.\nJoe Reitmeier: And I'll just add on the direct side, we executed very well on the minimum SEER transition.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.\nGautam Khanna : I wanted to ask about the IRA and how well defined it is in the states in terms of the tax rebate.\nAlok Maskara: IRA has become such a topic for the past 12 months with very little to show for you kind of stopped banking on it and one aspect of IRA, which was through the SEER tax credits that's kind of flowing through in some cases, some states are renewing it on their own. I don't think any of us saw the big impact we were expecting from IRA, but we're starting to see drips and dribblers. If the government really gets their act together and figure out this whole income qualification criteria to get the IRA piece, which there's no practical way to do it for a dealer right now, then I do think there's upside left, but we're not counting on it right now, especially given the election year, I don't know if the government will put this as a priority to figure it out with the state governments and dealers on how to make that work. But the rest of it is kind of slowly dripping in.\nGautam Khanna : Got you. And then given the confusion, I guess, the phase-in of the new refrigerant resi systems in '25, what are your updated expectations for pricing over the next 2 years, average pricing in the past, we've talked about something like 15% off of the '23 levels. Do you think that's still valid or do you think it's lower now?\nAlok Maskara: Yes, that's a valid.\nJoe Reitmeier: No, it's still valid. I think that's still just working through the entire process, and that was the comment earlier as well maybe getting some of that this year, especially with the 410A numbers that we talked about this year. But at that number over 2 years still totally valid.\nGautam Khanna : Okay. And given the potential slowdown in unitary that you mentioned and what we're seeing in resi. Have you seen any evidence anywhere in the industry of intensified price competition? Or is everyone still just getting -- pushing through price and getting that.\nAlok Maskara: It's more the latter on an overall basis. But listen, if I speak to 1 salesperson in 1 corner, they will convince me that there's an intense price competition in their own territory, and that's why they're not meeting their numbers. But if you ignore those individual data points and you look at a broader trend, right now, the price seems to be sticking across the board. And it's no accident. I mean, the costs are going up too. I mean if you look at the overall margins, margins expanding nowhere close to what the pricing number we talk about. So some of it is just recovering the cost that we went through and are continuing to have to burden as we look at higher SEER products, new A2L refrigerants, better efficiency compressors and the labor and material inflation. So I don't see that going backwards because manufacturers have to offset the extra costs we are incurring.\nGautam Khanna : And one last one for Michael. I just -- maybe could you further quantify the new facility costs in Q1 and Q2? And just -- like what are you specifically unabsorbed cost, if you will? What are you implying on that.\nMichael Quenzer : Yes. Just thinking about it. We have a factory that we're going to start to staff with people. We're going to get them trained. We're not going to have very high productivity as we build units -- and really, we won't even start to get any absorption until kind of mid- to late Q2. You have all of those ramp-up costs there. And then even in the second half, a portion of the $10 million will be lower efficiency, we will start to get some units out, but it won't be highly efficient. We won't be running at full efficiency until mid-2025. So it's probably going to be more to the front half, and it gets better as you get into the second half of that $10 million.\nGautam Khanna : Got it. But in aggregate for the year, it's $10 million.\nMichael Quenzer : Correct.\nGautam Khanna : With the front end, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you for joining us today. Since there are no further questions, this will conclude Lennox's fourth quarter conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alok Maskara",
            "content": "Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning, and welcome. I'm proud to represent our 13,000 employees as we delivered another full year of record results. We are pleased with our 2023 growth, margin expansion and more important cash generation. Our strong results were noteworthy, given the unprecedented destocking faced by residential HVAC manufacturers last year. I'm deeply grateful for our employees and our customers whose hard work, loyalty and dedication drove the results that we will be discussing today. I would like to begin by highlighting 4 key messages on Slide 3. First, we delivered $3.63 in adjusted EPS for Q4, an increase of 41% year-over-year. Adjusted EPS for the full year was $17.96, a 27% increase year-over-year. Our 2023 full year results were also notable for 6% core revenue growth, 300 basis point expansion in adjusted segment margin. In addition, our operating cash flow more than doubled compared to prior year. Second, we continue to invest wisely in manufacturing capacity, distribution optimization, technology transitions and growth initiatives while maintaining our industry-leading ROIC of 44%. Third, while end market uncertainties linger, our transformation momentum sets a strong foundation and gives us confidence in our 2024 EPS guidance range of $18.50 to $20. Fourth, given the robust progress on the self-help transformation plan, we are pleased to increase our previously announced 2026 financial goals. Now please turn to Slide 4 for more details at 2023 self-help accomplishments. In 2023, Lennox experienced significant success during the first phase of our self-help transformation plan. Our strategic initiatives allowed us to effectively navigate the destocking challenges, which demonstrated our resilience and exceptional execution. This phase laid a solid foundation for future growth and positioned us to capitalize on further growth opportunities. We accelerated growth by strengthening our distribution muscle to better serve our existing customers, attract new customers and increase our share of wallet from HVAC dealers. We are investing in our sales and stores teams to create greater alignment, accountability and autonomy for improving the customer experience. To ensure resiliency we implemented pricing excellence initiatives to recover margins from previously depressed levels as many long-term key account contracts which were signed before the recent inflationary period came up for renewal. We also achieved higher factory output, enhanced productivity and optimize product mix. Together, these measures contributed to the overall margin expansion and strengthened our margin resiliency. Finally, to ensure consistent execution, we implemented a balanced core card-based operating system, which we refer to as Lennox unified management system. This system was instrumental in driving accountability and ensuring alignment with our strategic goals to accelerate revenue growth and expand margins. We also simplified our portfolio with the sale of the European businesses and improved our total life cycle value proposition with the recent AES acquisition. On the next slide, I will share more about how we fine-tuned our internal engine to ensure success of the transformation plan and accelerate growth throughout the journey. Slide 5 shows the 5 components that fueled Lennox's success in 2023 and are building momentum that will continue to power Lennox's bright future. At the heart of our transformation is our unwavering commitment to our vision and mission. These set the true north direction for everything we do, aligning our efforts towards a shared goal. Moving outward, the strategy to great will deliver accelerated growth, resilient margins, execution consistency, advanced technology portfolio and talent and culture that help us win every day. Next is the commitment to our customer charters, emphasizing our dedication to always being a partner of choice by delivering exceptional customer experience and quality solutions. Another crucial element to our outstanding performance was the implementation of our Lennox unified management systems. We are utilizing balance scorecard to drive accountability, integrating standard processes and best practices and aligning operating cadence for efficiency. This represents our commitment to a unified approach that enables Lennox to shift into a higher gear and outperform competition. Lastly, our core values and guiding behaviors serve as a foundation of our high-performance growth culture with a passion for improving the customer experience. Last year, we rolled out 9 guiding behaviors that improved the team's focus on critical behaviors such as positive engagement and sustainability. These 5 components not only helped us build momentum on our self-help transformation this year, but also act as a spring boom to continue our long-term journey of growth and expansion. Before we move into the detailed financial section, allow me a few moments to express my gratitude to our outgoing CFO, Joe Reitmeier. I am thankful for Joe's years of service to Lennox, and I'm especially grateful that stayed with us to train me, the new CEO, and to oversee a smooth transition to our new CFO, Michael Quenzer.  Now for the last time on an earnings call, let me hand the call over to Joe. Thanks, Michael. As we look forward to the coming year, it is important to recognize that while our transformation momentum has yielded positive results, we are still facing challenges in the end market. Within our Home Comfort Solutions segment, the health of the consumer will remain a significant driver of demand and greatly influence the repair versus replace dynamic. We are mindful of consumer sentiment, especially in an election year, and we'll continue to track macro data for early indicators. It is important to point out, we have not yet noticed any meaningful shift from replace to repair. EPA rulings have also introduced an element of uncertainty regarding industry inventory levels. Ahead of the R454B transition, we do not anticipate a large pre-buy due to inventory fatigue in the tunnel and the increased cost of carrying inventories. However, we do expect distributors to normalize inventory levels this year as the channel returns to its usual ordering patterns. We also expect ongoing benefits of the strategic pricing initiatives and potential share opportunity as Lennox historically win share during regulatory transitions. Turning our attention to building Climate Solutions, we predict solid demand in 2024. With the data we have from our National Account Services business, we know that rooftop units are aged past historical averages and will need to be replaced soon. 2024 demand may be impacted if key accounts delay installs pending new R454B product availability. End markets may also face challenges related to softening commercial new construction and project delays. Ultimately, our outlook for 2024 remains cautiously optimistic, though we acknowledge the complexities of the market conditions in the coming years. We trust that our proactive strategies focused on driving top line growth, expanding our margins and consistently executing on initiatives will continue to propel Linux towards enhancing customer experience and shareholder value. On the next slide, I will go into more depth on each of the strategies as it relates to 2024. On Slide 13, I want to take a moment to revisit our self-funded transformation plan, which has been steering our current success. As a reminder, this plan is structured around 3 phases over the next several years. Now let's dive into the specifics of our actions for 2024, where we will transition from the initial phase to the growth acceleration phase. This year is pivotal as it sets the stage for the next wave of growth through strategic investments and focused actions. First, we are investing in our sales force to expand customer touch points, enhancing the overall customer experience through digital innovations and anticipating improved output from our new commercial HVAC factory. Additionally, we aim to increase the attachment rate for parts and accessories, ensuring the holistic experience for our customers. Second, we are committed to driving resilient margins. This involves maintaining pricing excellence, leveraging greater productivity from volume recovery, realizing material cost reduction and reaping the mix benefits of transitioning to the new R454B product. These actions collectively fortify our financial position and solidify our sustainable competitive advantage. Lastly, we will leverage the Lennox unified management system to streamline our operations and set clear priorities. Our focused strategy, investment in heat pump growth and enhancement to our distribution network further exemplify our commitment to consistent management execution. 2024 is a year of purposeful actions that will propel us into the growth acceleration phase and lay the groundwork for our journey into the expansion phase. I am confident that with our collective dedication and strategic approach, we are not just following a plan, we are shaping our future success. Now please turn to Slide 14 for an update on our long-term financial goals. It has been just over a year since we introduced our 2026 goals and are confident that our execution is ahead of schedule, even though market uncertainties persist. We are pleased that Building Climate Solutions has achieved record margins and that Home Comfort solutions demonstrated margin resiliency, even while facing significant volume headwinds. With this year's achievements, we recognize the need to adjust our long-term goals to better reflect our current positions. For 2026 we are now targeting revenue of $5.4 billion to $6 billion, with total company target margin range of 19% to 21%. Our free cash flow conversion target is approximately 90% as we complete the necessary investments to support our growth. We are increasing the long-term target for Home Comfort solutions to a range of 20% to 22% ROS and building Climate Solutions to a range of 22% to 24% ROS. Now for a wrap up, please turn to Slide 15 for the reasons I continue to believe that Lennox is a great investment opportunity. Lennox operates in growth end markets has resilient margins demonstrates execution consistency and serves its customers through advanced technology and high-performance talent. The 5 reasons we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong results are: first, we will continue to make strategic growth investments to improve our go-to-market effectiveness and support consumer demand. Second, our margins remain a focus as we continue to evaluate our pricing strategy, implement innovative solutions to increase productivity and optimize our direct-to-dealer network. Third, while leveraging the Lennox unified management systems, our teams will be able to streamline processes, leverage best practices and consistently deliver strong results. The fourth aspect reflects our continued technology advancements that ensure Lennox will remain at the forefront of innovative solutions for our customers. Finally, the introduction of our guiding behavior enhances our team's focus on core values and fortified our high-performance culture. Our refreshed pay-for-performance incentive structure further aligns the talents of our team and the interest of our stakeholders. Allow me to wrap up by saying thank you to each of our dedicated employees and valued customers. I am proud for what we were able to accomplish this past year, and I'm looking forward to the promising future that lies ahead of Lennox as our best days are still ahead of us. Thank you. We will now be happy to take questions. Easy questions can go to Michael and I and the harder questions should go to Joe Reitmeier.  Operator, let's go to Q&A. Sure. I'll take that, Jeff. On our own internal -- I mean I always think we can get more working capital improvements, but I think we are reaching a level, especially given the upcoming A2L transition, but I think the levels are going to be relatively flat. We might have to build up some towards the second half of 2024, and that's embedded in the guide just to ensure a smooth transition. On the independent China, I mean, honestly, the destocking in Q4 was more than we expected. And we do think there's going to be some destocking happening in Q1, especially on product line eases whether that's impact of weather and all, we don't know. But I think from overall, we do expect some destocking bleeding into Q1, but remain confident that by second half or Q2, independent channel distribution destocking would be largely behind us, especially as the distributors get ready for a A2L transition and the EPA ruling allows them some sell-through in 2024 as well. So lots of moving pieces, but we've embedded all of that in the guide, Jeff. And I think if I could add to that, Nigel, keep in mind, the factory inefficiency both for the start-up in Saltillo or the commercial factory and for the A2L conversion, but that's fairly massive transformation we have to do. Every line has to be redone. We'll have tiers of factory shutdown. So we bake in all of that -- so I understand your question. It's just we got to -- we baked in all of those inefficiencies in our guide. Sure. First of all, you should give me the list of all those people that were telling you that. So we can go and negotiate, use their work on that. I'd love to get that Nigel. But no, more seriously, some of it comes down to the starting point. In some cases, on components, we did have long-term contracts that are coming up for renewal. So we may have like escaped some of the inflation in the past. The other thing you've got to see in the 410A, I mean, the spot pricing, the contract pricing and where we are still a lot of moving pieces. But based on the production quota reduction from EPA, we fully expect and have baked in inflation on 410A. And overall, I mean inflation is lower than before, but it's not gone away, whether it's SG&A or NAV factors. So we've built all of that in as we looked at what's going to happen in 2024 for us. but we do continue to see inflation in components, especially if our long-term contracts come up for renewal. Thanks, Nigel. I think, Tommy, on the overall, we stick to the 10% to 15% total pricing impact by 2025. A large part of that is going to happen in 2025 as like in our 54 products start getting launched towards the tail end or second half of this year. So we will see a lot more of that benefit next year than they will see this year which is unfortunate because we'll see some of the manufacturing inefficiencies this year as we transition our line from 410 to 454B, a lot more of the benefit coming to as tail half of this year or like early next year is when we start seeing those benefits. But our view and outlook has not changed on that, and I was glad to see that others in the industry are also now catching up to that dynamic because there's extra cost of sensors, there's extra cost of controls, there's extra cost that we're going to do as we look at the heating capacity, compressors. There's just a lot of extra cost that we must offset. Sure. I expected that to be one of the first question. I'm surprised it was a third question on the call today. So but [indiscernible]. Listen, I'll start by saying a few things, right? First of all, in the past, even before my time, Lennox has been very clear that if there is an industry consolidation opportunity, Lennox will like to participate. And we have specifically named out companies that we would like to participate if that came on. So let me just confirm that, that view has not changed. We still believe that if there's an opportunity that Lennox would be a participant in that. Overall, when I look at it industry consolidation, it's good for quite a few reasons. As we look at increased regulations, as we look at dealer consolidation. I think we'll better serve our customers. We'll better look at technology to come to the consumer. I think it gives us the right kind of investments that we can make to succeed. So I think it's going to be good. We would like to participate as and when things become clear and available. I don't want to comment specifically on any specific company and the news. But all I can tell you is that we don't have to do this. I mean, we are very confident in our own stand-alone strategy as well. We have sufficient scale to compete. We are gaining share in respective segments. We have like a very good technology team and a great path forward. So I think that's kind of the balanced outlook on that is if there's an opportunity, we would like to participate, but we're also very confident on where we are positioned ourselves. Sure. I think overall, we expect that to get even by 2025. I mean, in the independent channels of the distribution channel, we fully expect, because of comps and because of inventory get to appropriate level, increase in sales versus last year. We're not sure of the timing on when that stops, given all the comps and everything else. But we do think inventory levels and order patterns normalize and we will see a bounce back in our sales to the channel, irrespective of what happens from the channel to the dealer. On the dealer side, we were pleased with the resiliency that we saw, although volumes were down, they were better than most of us expected. And that resiliency gives us comfort going into 2024, and we expect and have baked in sort of flat to down numbers on that going into 2024. Just because of all the chatter around repair, replace, interest rate, election year, which so far has not turned out to be true, but we want to kind of make sure we put all of that and let [you guys] decide. Like here are assumptions that you can decide how you look at it. We focused on what we control, and we know we are going to win share through the transition, and we are recovering our service levels nicely. No, no functional differences to be aware of. We simplified it from 3 to 2. We had some internal confusion going on between business unit name and segment name so we embarked on a new branding, which I guess the positive message. Overall, at Lennox, we have not focused on building a brand with dealers and consumers, and there were just different confusion going on. We simplified our websites. We have huge investments in improving our customers' experience, introducing new technology, updating even our e-mail addresses and our lennonx.com. It was part of a big rebranding exercise. It was just about time to differentiate residential segment from business unit, but I wouldn't read anything more to it besides just simplifying our internal nomenclature and better reflecting what we do, right? Because what was called commercial also had a tiny bit of refrigeration in there. So I do think the new names better reflect what we do and are more consistent with our new branding guidelines. Sure. Let's start with me and the highest level on the executive staff. So last year was the first year where our short-term incentives had a growth component or a revenue component to it. So 20% of our [indiscernible] STI now comes from growth. And that just changed the mindset. Just to give you an example, but let's take it down to a few levels on where it really matters. So if you think about sales incentives and compensation, it used to be the other way around because only on revenue are not enough on profits and margins. So as we talked about accountability, autonomy and in deploying all of that in the sales force, we are now measuring our sales team more on profits, more like a distributor would measure them versus purely on revenue. So that's kind of the 2 switches on the more senior level, more focused on growth and on the street level, more focused on profitability and profit margins. And that's a long journey because you can't change these things overnight, especially if they have been seeped into the culture for many, many years. But we are pleased with the early results and fully prepared for the long-term journey as we add technology and finance score cards and metrics-driven behavior versus the storytelling behavior, sometimes pleased to get there. Sure, I'll start, and then Michael will jump in. Because we really did not consider consensus was giving guidance, and we don't give guidance by quarter. But here's what we did, right? We laid out the volume assumptions on Page 11, so you can look through that. And that kind of brackets are low end and the high end, all on the volume assumptions. As we look at it, Q1 is going to be a little weird because we get more mix benefits, as Michael said earlier, because last year, we still had old SEER and new SEER products. Some of the price increases go into effect in February for us, as you saw along with the other competition. So you get only half a quarter benefit on that. And seasonality will be similar to what we have seen unless there are any unusual weather patterns. So honestly, we didn't spend tons of time looking at quarter-over-quarter. We were just thinking of the longer term where we are focused and drive that. Michael, what would you add to that? I mean I think from our perspective, we like where we are positioned. So let's start that like we think we are positioned in an attractive market. That happens to be North America, but it could be somewhere else. I mean what we look for is attractive end markets, where we can win, where we can succeed, where we can generate the appropriate returns. I don't think we exited Europe because of Europe. We exited because the margin profile was weak, and we did think we were positioned to win there. So I don't want to make any specific comments and rule anything in or out at this stage. But we will look at those things is how does it benefit our shareholders? Are we positioned to win. Does it create attractive opportunities for us versus share buyback? I mean, end of the day, we have done very well, and we'll continue to do well based on share buyback. But I mean we're going to look for markets where we are positioned to win. Sure. So I'll tell you, it's maybe a tale of 2 halves that is quite a few moving pieces, but let's talk positives, right? I mean our order rate remains strong. Our backlog although doesn't matter, but in the short-term backlog remains solid. Our sales team is pretty excited and we see no impact of any of the things that we read about, whether it's KBI index and all that, we do see some projects moving to the right. So we are a bit cautious as we go into it. We also -- as we talk to our key accounts find a lot of enthusiasm around the R454B product and are somewhat concerned that maybe towards mid- to late this year, they might say, \"well, I'll just wait for the 454B versus take the existing product.\" So that's kind of baked into us, we looked at the guide for different competing factors, just to go back to it, pleased with the current order rate, please with the current backlog, freeze with our production output excited about this Saltillo factory, even adding more to our output because we remain supply constrained versus demand constraint. And they just want to reflect some of the noise/what we see in the future is slow in construction and any weird air pocket that could come in if you look at 454B transition. We saw that too -- and I'm sorry, I missed you at the HRI show, but like I went to all the boots and it was impressive on some of the overseas players and the amount of money spent on the booth. I'll tell you the amount of money they spend in the pools correlated to the market share in U.S., it probably more reflects their aspirations for the future. I think what these players have done very well, it comes to mini splits and VRF, but if it comes to traditional unitary products, I think very few -- if any of them had any success, and that's where the core U.S. market remains very, very different and you know many splits and all are still in single-digit market share overall and had a tough year in '23. But listen, we are -- on the only -- we are the only unaffiliated player in U.S.  So we look at the international players, both as a threat and as an opportunity to be able to work with them to drive our joint market share in some areas. But we also look at it as a threat. So that's the way we look at it, but we were pleased with the interest we are getting on our own new products like at AHRI, we were pleased with people excited about new production capacity we're adding, the emergency replacement products that we displayed and just general energy from our sales team on how robust the activity was. It was the highest attendance AHRI show has had, which kind of makes me more optimistic on the economy than what I read in the newspapers. Sure. I mean, historically, these transitions had a lot of prebuy from the independent channel. But because of the confusing EPA rulings that came out in sort of November, December, I think the channel is -- just a little concern about landing up with obsolete products. And since they see the manufacturers being pretty prepared, they may not feel the need higher interest rate works in that environment as well. And the overall given how much inventory people were holding because of the CEO transition just 2 years ago because of the COVID disruption a year ago. Some of the distributors are just working with us and saying, why don't you manage that for us? Make sure your lead times are low, and I can get it quickly. I may not want to spend a warehousing space and the cash to build up. Now but listen, if you're wrong, we will have upside in '24 and downside in '25. I mean over a 2-year period, it normalizes anyway. So we will be prepared if people decide to have a prebuy, but based on as we were looking at it, we just said, let's not take any of that in. That slide went through so many changes over the past 48 hours. We tried to give a range. We tried to -- but listen, if you're starting the year and you got $175 million of CapEx, you're not going to reach 100 in a 3-year period, right? I mean, just where we are. But in the long term, I think we'll get to 100 at some investments. Yes, 15% to 20%, like it's higher on our direct model, lower on the indirect side, probably in the range of... Yes, it below 20 overall. But listen, 1 thing is our cash flow, we don't do any adjustments, right? I mean this is our -- the checkbook balances. Sure. I'll let Michael answer the second one, and then I'll come back to the first one. So Michael, why don't you go ahead. And I think to the first question on weather. I learned early in my career, Ryan, that never ever talk about weather when you have a challenging number set to be delivered. But based on like where we are, yes, Q4, we had some of the kind of the warmest winter, and that did negatively impact our daily order rates and we track the same things you guys would track on average heating days and cooling days. And yes, Q1 with the cold streak, we have had a good start based on, as you would expect on the weather, but we don't know what tomorrow looks like or February looks like, but both your statements are correct, Ryan. I think when the time is right, we'll have that discussion with the board and put it all together. I mean, from our perspective, that have to be an opportunistic discussion on something that's attractive to the company. But yes, if it's attractive to our shareholders and we need to lever up. The key question would be is, would we get back to our preferred leverage range within a year or 2. I mean that's what our focus is going to be. So you can do the math backwards, right? I mean as long as we think there's real cash, and then we can use that cash to get back to our long-term leverage goals within a couple of years. I think we could make that work. But investment grade thing is important to us, right? I mean we are not in [indiscernible] shop or anything else like that. We'll maintain investment grade. Yes, I think it'd be closer to 100 million, 110, not 75 to 100. Just growth and maintenance built into that, right? Maintenance might be 75, 80, but to support our growth, we probably will add more. So I would say it's north of 100. I saw you from far in a different company booth, but you're holding a good audience, I didn't interrupt. Sure. I'll start. So I think the overall, as we talked about price increases, we talked about doing residential new construction price increase in the middle of 2023. That did go ahead as expected and as we looked at the overall drop-through that is about what we expected, maybe a share worse than we expected, to be honest. And I think that just came down to the mix between residential new construction and the seasonality baked in there. Not a whole lot of R&C gets shipped towards in the Q4 time frame. So from that perspective, that went as we expected. We have key account price increases going into effect this year, mostly early this year, and we know we announced a price increase, broader 1 and that goes into effect in February. So all the pricing actions that we talked about is gone as we had expected. We remain comfortable on where we are. And it's been good to see that the whole industry moving in that direction as well. Sure. So I think with the key distributor, they're already seeing the spec. We're already going through the training and all that. First physical product probably comes out in the second half of this year. And we will start with sort of the high-end products, I think the consumer's appetite for going to R54B is going to be more and faster. And then we will slowly transition towards the lower year and the lower-end products. So we'll start with the higher end towards the middle of the year. And we are on track or ahead of schedule on each of those things. We don't expect any R454B for meaningful sales, can we put on a showcase on display booths in first half of this year, yes. But for somebody to actually place a PU and buy would be in the second half of this year. Yes. So listen, we were close to 0. I think we hit double digit in '23 in terms of trying to get to emergency replacement. Barely, I would say, high single digit, double digits in 2023, and that includes both our direct and going to through our distribution partners. And we still think there's a lot of room ahead. We probably won't move that needle until Saltillo comes in production in the second half of this year. So expect us to hover in high single digits, low double digits until Saltillo comes online. Listen, as we talk to our distribution partners, and we're very close to them. It's not the channel inventory had more talk than we thought. And yes, with the EPA ruling and then everything, the channel essentially flows in Q4, especially they're worried that for a while remember the fear was that you would not be able to sell 410A products, unless it was replacement starting December 2024. So I think that ruling created just a freeze mentality in our channel, which I'm glad EPA issued some clarification and coming up with final ruling. But the direct business holding out better than we thought was actually a positive. I mean, which means the consumer is being resilient, and we were pleased with that resiliency. Now being the CEO of Lennox, I also think we gained share, so that's something we will watch out for as numbers normalize. It's hard to figure out share dynamics right now given things are unclear on how much of it is us winning share and how much is the fact that we are going direct, but I mean, from numbers that we see, I mean, we gain lots of shares. We just need to figure out how much of that is transitionary versus rail. IRA has become such a topic for the past 12 months with very little to show for you kind of stopped banking on it and one aspect of IRA, which was through the SEER tax credits that's kind of flowing through in some cases, some states are renewing it on their own. I don't think any of us saw the big impact we were expecting from IRA, but we're starting to see drips and dribblers. If the government really gets their act together and figure out this whole income qualification criteria to get the IRA piece, which there's no practical way to do it for a dealer right now, then I do think there's upside left, but we're not counting on it right now, especially given the election year, I don't know if the government will put this as a priority to figure it out with the state governments and dealers on how to make that work. But the rest of it is kind of slowly dripping in. Yes, that's a valid. It's more the latter on an overall basis. But listen, if I speak to 1 salesperson in 1 corner, they will convince me that there's an intense price competition in their own territory, and that's why they're not meeting their numbers. But if you ignore those individual data points and you look at a broader trend, right now, the price seems to be sticking across the board. And it's no accident. I mean, the costs are going up too. I mean if you look at the overall margins, margins expanding nowhere close to what the pricing number we talk about. So some of it is just recovering the cost that we went through and are continuing to have to burden as we look at higher SEER products, new A2L refrigerants, better efficiency compressors and the labor and material inflation. So I don't see that going backwards because manufacturers have to offset the extra costs we are incurring."

            "name": "Joe Reitmeier",
            "content": "Thank you, Alok, and greetings to everyone joining us this morning as we announce Lennox's record-setting performance and outlook. I've had the pleasure and privilege of serving as Lennox's Chief Financial Officer during a period of transformation and record-setting achievements. Portfolio changes enable a more intense focus on our key North American end markets, the team introduced new and innovative solutions. We delivered on initiatives that drove significant increases in profitability and that coupled with efficient capital allocation resulted in industry-leading returns on invested capital. We fortified the balance sheet and most significantly, we generated exponential increases in returns for our shareholders. Now before I hand it off to Michael, I'd like to reflect briefly on 2023. It was another year of exceptional performance while strengthening the foundation for the future by investing in our people, sustaining industry-leading innovation and enhancing our capabilities to better serve our customers. Now while I'm extremely proud of my time with such a great organization that has accomplished so much. I take even greater pride knowing that I'm leaving an extremely talented and seasoned team that is very well positioned both strategically and financially for long-term success. I'd like to wrap up my comments with a sincere thank you to all Lennox employees, our valued customers, the investment community and other stakeholders for your partnerships over the years.  I'll now hand it over to Michael, who will take you through the details of Lennox's financial performance and outlook. Michael, take it away. Yes. So on the left-hand side, you can see our contribution margins. And on the right-hand side is the increase related to rate for costs as well as investments. So you have to join those two together see the full impact. But we do expect some margin improvement for the enterprise next year when you look at the combined. Our component costs are a big piece of our cost of goods sold are nearly 45% and then refrigerants also going to go up significantly. So most of that pricing should be there to maintain our current gross margins and then we'll get a bit of leverage on the volume and a little bit of leverage on the acquisition as well. But overall, we do expect margins to be up just not 300 basis points like we saw in 2023. Yes. I mean what we have to do is look, it's predominantly price, price drops through to 100%. There's a little bit of mix that we'll get from the carryover benefit from the minimus year transition. So that will kind of drop through at 30%. When you blend the 2 together, you kind of get to the 90, but then that then covers some of the cost inflations we have on the right-hand side where we think our components are going to be up significantly, both from the normal inflation, mid-single digits as well as the refrigerant. So that kind of sets a lot of that, which maintains your gross margins. And then thereafter, we start to make investments in distribution and SG&A. And we still see overall operating margins improving think of it maybe a little less than 50 basis points within the guide. Yes. So I'll first answer on the price, we see that mostly starting to build in through Q2, Q3 and Q4. As we announced in Q1, it will take a little bit of time to get that new price increase. But in Q1 is where you'll see the carryover benefit on the mix side from the minimum SEER product, we'll get the full year benefit of that. Yes, I think I'd look at the revenue seasonality in kind of 50-50. Q2 and Q3 should be pretty similar kind of 30% of the year each then you have kind of 20-ish in Q1 and Q4 on the revenue guide. That's similar to what we saw in 2023. The other main driver is as we grow revenue, you're going to have net working capital growth with that revenue. CapEx to be closer to depreciation by 2025 and 2026. So it's mostly related to just growing working capital with the revenue growth. Upper teens. The total program is still the same. We just have some additional CapEx that we have in 2024 to prepare for the new refrigerant products and investments with [tanks] and new refrigerant lines within the factory that also come in this year. Yes, with inflation, probably not closer to 100 like... Yes. So total revenue through distributors was down high to mid-teens and then the direct was up high single digits for Q4. Correct. Low single digits. And I'll just add on the direct side, we executed very well on the minimum SEER transition. No, it's still valid. I think that's still just working through the entire process, and that was the comment earlier as well maybe getting some of that this year, especially with the 410A numbers that we talked about this year. But at that number over 2 years still totally valid."

            "name": "Michael Quenzer",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. Good morning to everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. As Alok mentioned earlier, 2023 has been a record year in the fourth quarter with no exception. Core revenue, which excludes our revenue operations was $1.1 billion, up 7% as price and mix drove the year-over-year improvement. Adjusted segment profit increased $44 million at $69 million of price and mix benefits were partially offset by inflation and investment in SG&A and distribution.  Total adjusted segment margin was 15.9%, up 320 basis points versus prior year. For the fourth quarter, corporate expenses were $30 million, a decrease of $3 million. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 20% and diluted shares outstanding were $35.8 million compared to $35.6 million in the prior year quarter. The fourth quarter achieved record levels of revenue, segment profit and adjusted earnings per share, which grew by 41% to $3.63. Let's shift our focus to Slide 7 and review the financial results of our Home Comfort Solutions segment formerly referred to as a residential segment. The left graph shows revenue grew 1% to a record $709 million in the fourth quarter. The segment benefited from favorable mix of higher efficiency products and effective pricing execution. This was partially offset by volume declines. Although unit sales volumes for the segment declined by 5%, our direct-to-contractor sales volumes remained stable, signaling a resilient consumer demand landscape. Unit sales volumes through independent distribution channels declined more than 20% driven by continued industry destocking. Home Comfort Solutions profit decreased approximately 4% to $115 million, and segment margin also experienced a decline of 70 basis points to 16.2%. The decrease was attributed to a $9 million decrease in sales volumes and $25 million impact from inflation and investments in distribution and selling. Moving on to Slide 8. We will now review the performance of our Building Climate Solutions segment, formerly referred to as the commercial segment. The segment continues to consistently deliver outsize performance each quarter, resulting in another quarter of record revenue and profit. Revenue was $390 million in the quarter, up 19%. Combined price and mix were up 11% and volume was up 5%. Building Climate Solutions profit was $91 million or up 98% and segment margin expanded 930 basis points to 23.2%. These results were primarily driven by price and sales volume gains. The team's execution on several self-help initiatives aided in the recovery of previously depressed profit margins. These initiatives include price corrections, enhanced factory productivity and strengthened supply chain resiliency. The AES acquisition also played a role in the growth during the quarter. The integration is progressing smoothly with existing Lennox customers showing interest in the AES full life cycle value proposition. Ultimately, the fourth quarter continued the year's momentum and resulted in a strong finish to 2023. If you will now turn to Slide 9, I will recap the full year Lennox results. For full year 2023, core revenue, excluding European operations, was $4.7 billion, up 6%. Adjusted segment profit increased $180 million as $348 million of price and mix benefits were partially offset by Home Comfort Solutions sales volume declines as well as inflation and investment in SG&A and distribution. Total adjusted segment margin was 17.9%, up 300 basis points versus prior year. Despite facing volume challenges in the residential end markets, inflationary pressures and ongoing investments, the Home Comfort Solutions segment achieved revenue and profit growth through successful execution of strategic pricing initiatives and the seamless transition to the new minimum SEER standard. The Building Climate Solutions segment also achieved impressive results in 2023. Healing supply chains and factory productivity played a key role in growing volumes in the second half of the year, and pricing execution helped the segment recover previously depressed profit margins from years of higher supply chain and production costs. Exceptional execution by both segments resulted in adjusted earnings per share growing to $17.96, setting a new record and representing a 27% increase compared to the prior year. Moving on to cash flow and capital deployment on Slide 10. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $306 million compared to $132 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $125 million for the quarter, an increase of $91 million compared to the prior year. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.3x, down from 2x in prior year. Our approach to capital deployment remains consistent. We will prioritize organic growth investments with strong returns, grow dividends with earnings and continue to explore M&A opportunities and to supplement with share repurchases when necessary. Lennox's industry-leading ROIC of 44% reflects our dedication to delivering value to our stakeholders through strategic and targeted investments. We not only aim to maintain our high ROIC, but also aimed to make necessary investments to elevate our performance and competitiveness in the marketplace. We anticipate the successful completion of our upcoming commercial HVAC factory and production is slated to begin midyear. While overhead and ramp-up expenses posed known challenges in the first half of 2024, we anticipate the factory will realize productivity benefits in 2025. This facility plays a pivotal role in our sustained growth, enhancing our commercial production capacity by 25% by the end of 2024. It will allow us to better address consumer demand and recapture market share in emergency replacement market. Now let's transition to Slide 11. Here, I will provide an overview of our full year financial guidance for 2024. We anticipating another year of profitable growth, the chart on the left provides key growth drivers with revenue expected to increase by approximately 7%. Alok will provide additional comments on end markets later in the presentation, but sales volumes are expected to remain relatively flat with a slight upward trend from Building Climate Solutions growth and stable Home Comfort solutions end markets. The combination of price and mix is anticipated to contribute to a mid-single-digit growth in revenue, price increases will sustain margins amid continued cost inflation and a slight favorable mix is expected due to the 2023 minimum efficiency regulatory change. In addition to the profit drivers from revenue, we have listed key costs and investment assumptions on the right side of the slide. Component cost inflation is expected to be up mid-single digits, including large increases in our cost to acquire our 410A refrigerant. We expect this to be partially offset by material cost reduction programs. We anticipate ramp-up costs of approximately $10 million for the new commercial HVAC factory along with additional costs associated with the refrigerant transition across our Home Comfort solutions manufacturing facilities. We will continue to invest in information system advancements, distribution growth initiatives and projects to improve customer service. Additionally, we expect to support growth initiatives by making investments in both sales and marketing. While we continue to focus on managing SG&A expenses, we do expect moderate inflation area pressure in 2024. Our guidance for capital expenditures is approximately $175 million. This includes final spending for the new commercial HVAC factory and the 2025 low GWP refrigerant transition. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $50 million and tax rate is estimated to be between 20% and 21%. Incorporating all of these guidance items, we expect earnings per share to be within the range of $18.50 per share and $20 per share. Finally, we expect free cash flow to be within the range of $500 million to $600 million. With that, please turn to Slide 12, and I'll turn it back over to Alok for an overview of 2024 business conditions. Yes. I would just add, we obviously don't give quarterly guidance. But generally, when you look at the seasonality that you plot as we just talked about, maybe a little bit more destocking as Alok talked about through the distributor business in Q1 and then starting to revert back up thereafter. And then a little better production out of the commercial factory, maybe little better volumes in Q1 from commercial as well. Yes. So on the commercial margins, yes, we'll see a little bit of a headwind, though, on the factory ramp up in the first half, but we'll get the benefit of the mix and a little bit of volume. That should kind of neutralize each other. So overall, margins should be up in commercial, but I think they'll be kind of flattish throughout the year with those 2 elements adjusting against each other. Yes. Just thinking about it. We have a factory that we're going to start to staff with people. We're going to get them trained. We're not going to have very high productivity as we build units -- and really, we won't even start to get any absorption until kind of mid- to late Q2. You have all of those ramp-up costs there. And then even in the second half, a portion of the $10 million will be lower efficiency, we will start to get some units out, but it won't be highly efficient. We won't be running at full efficiency until mid-2025. So it's probably going to be more to the front half, and it gets better as you get into the second half of that $10 million. Correct."

We may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management considers to be relevant indicators of underlying business performance. Please refer to our SEC filings available on our Investor Relations website for additional details, including a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP measures. The earnings release, today's presentation and the webcast archive link for today's call are available on our Investor Relations website at investor.lennox.com. You can also find the press releases for our CFO transition and AES acquisition on the Investor Relations website. Now please turn to Slide 3, I then turn the call over to our CEO, Alok Maskara.\nAlok Maskara: Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning, everyone. I am proud to report that this has been another record quarter for Lennox with results that truly speak to our commitment towards delivering growth acceleration and resilient margin expansion. The record revenue, profit and earnings that we are sharing today reflect the transformative impact of our self-help initiatives put in place last year. These results were made possible by the hard work of Lennox's 13,000 employees as well as the unwavering loyalty of our dealers and customers. I deeply appreciate the tireless efforts of everyone who played a part in delivering these exceptional results. I also extend my appreciation to our dealers and customers for entrusting Lennox to provide top-tier innovative products and solutions. Now let me transition into an overview of this quarter's highlights. Lennox's core revenue grew 10% and our adjusted segment margin expanded 334 basis points to 19.3%, resulting in our adjusted earnings per share increasing 30% to $5.37. Our operating cash flow of $313 million was up 83% year-over-year. Additionally, earlier this morning, we announced Joe Reitmeier decision to retire and the appointment of Michael Quenzer as our new CFO. We are excited for both Joe and Michael as we complete this planned transition. Additionally, we also announced the strategic acquisition of Architectural Engineering Services, or AES this morning. The acquisition is consistent with our bolt-on acquisition strategy and is a clear strategic fit that will accelerate growth, unlock operational synergies and enhance our service offerings to create incremental shareholder value. Now please turn to Slide 4 for more details on our CFO transition. Announced earlier this morning, Joe Reitmeier has decided to retire, and I'd like to express my sincere gratitude for his remarkable 18-year tenure at Lennox. Under his leadership, the Company achieved many significant milestones, including 7x earnings per share growth and 12x increase in market cap. Beyond his financial stewardship, Joe has cultivated a talented dynamic finance organization here at Lennox. With that strong foundation and robust succession plan, we expect a smooth transition as Michael Quenzer takes on the role of Chief Financial Officer, effective January 1, 2024. Michael joined Lennox in 2004 and has been a key contributor to Lennox's strong financial performance. He has a proven track record of driving operational excellence developing talent and creating shareholder value. Michael's experience as the segment CFO during the commercial turnaround and most recently as VP Finance and Investor Relations, equips him with a solid foundation for his new role. I'm very happy for Joe, as he looks forward to his well-owned retirement, and I am excited to work with Michael in his new capacity. Please join me in congratulating both Joe and Michael. Now please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of the ADS acquisition. We are pleased to welcome AES customers and employees to the Lennox family. This strategic bolt-on acquisition is in line with our overall capital deployment strategy and provides clear benefits to our customers, employees and shareholders. As you may know, Lennox's existing national account service team is focused on preventative maintenance and energy monitoring services. Our new acquisition is centered on turnkey installation accessories as well as refrigerant, reclaim and recycling. The combined portfolio will allow us to serve our customers more holistically, ensuring that all their needs are met by Lennox. Additionally, it enhances our cross-selling opportunities as we can now offer a broader range of services and solutions to our client base. This will strengthen our relationship with our customers and positions us for a comprehensive lifecycle provider in this fragmented light commercial service industry. AES also provides new services to facilitate product life commissioning, including refrigerant reclamation and material recycling. For example, a commercial customer can purchase rooftop equipment from Lennox, utilize AES installation services, use us for maintenance and monitoring and leverage our reclaim and recycling services at the end of equipment life. By offering these services, we not only align with the evolving environmental needs and regulations but also create a new revenue stream for our business, ensuring that we remain at the forefront of sustainable innovations. Another compelling aspect of this acquisition is the vertical integration into parts and accessories, specifically in core adapters. By manufacturing and core adapters in-house, we will be able to generate cost efficiencies, increase profitability and build a stronger competitive edge in the marketplace. Ultimately, this strategic bolt-on acquisition addresses several critical execution needs in our growth strategy. It adds installation capabilities to our industry-leading preventative maintenance services, provides new services such as refrigerant reclaimer and material recycling to support product lifecycle decommissioning and increases the sales of parts and access fees. Now, let me hand the call over to Joe, who will take us through the details of our Q3 financial performance.\nJoe Reitmeier: Thank you, Alok, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. As Alok mentioned earlier, the Company posted strong revenue and earnings growth. Our core revenue, which excludes our European operations, was a record $1.3 billion, up 10% where price and mix drove significant year-over-year improvement. Adjusted segment profit increased $62 million as $97 million of price and mix benefits were partially offset by inflationary impacts on SG&A and distribution costs. Total adjusted segment margin was 19.3%, up 334 basis points versus prior year. And for the quarter, corporate expenses were $27 million, an increase of $11 million as a result of higher incentive compensation and wage inflation. In the third quarter -- or the third quarter, achieved record levels of revenue, segment profit and adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted earnings per share grew by 30% to $5.37. Our third quarter tax rate of 25.6% and diluted shares outstanding were $35.7 million compared to $35.5 million in the prior year quarter. Turning to our residential results on Slide 7. The chart shows revenue growth of 7% to a record $896 million in third quarter. The segment benefited from new minimum efficiency standards and a richer mix of higher efficiency products. We also noticed the positive impact from the strategic price increase in June. Although unit sales volumes for the segment declined by 2%, our direct-to-contractor sales volume increased mid-single digits, reflecting healthy end markets and ongoing market share gains. Unit sales volumes through independent distribution channels declined mid-teens, primarily due to continued industry de-stocking, which decelerated during the quarter. Residential segment profit increased 18% to $181 million, and segment margin improved by 183 basis points to 20.2%, driven primarily by price and mix and partially offset with lower volume, higher incentive compensation and inflationary effects on wages and distribution. Turning to Slide 8 and our commercial business that continues to deliver strong results. Revenue was $406 million in the quarter, up 15%. Combined price and mix were up 13%, and volume was up 2%. Commercial segment profit was $97 million or up 86%, and segment margin expanded 912 basis points to 24%. These results were driven by price and mix for a total for the total of a $47 million increase in profit for the quarter. Increased factory productivity has offset inflation and we have made significant progress on our new factory construction, which will support growth and productivity. Moving on to cash flow performance and our net debt to EBITDA starting on Slide 9. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $313 million compared to $171 million orders in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $40 million for the quarter, an increase of $20 million compared to prior year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent, supporting organic growth investments like our new commercial manufacturing facility in Mexico, driving industry-leading innovation and exploring potential bolt-on acquisitions like AES. In the quarter, the Company paid approximately $78 million in dividends. Total debt was approximately $1.5 billion at the end of the quarter, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.7x. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $141.6 million at the end of the quarter. Construction on the new commercial factory is also coming along nicely with first production anticipated mid-2024. We do anticipate some P&L inefficiencies and temporary working capital build as the factory ramps up. By the second half of 2025, however, we expect the factory will be fully ramped, and we will begin realizing productivity gains. Now turning to Slide 10, I'll review our revised 2023 full year guidance. As a result of our strong execution on driving growth and expanding margins, we are increasing our full year outlook. We estimate core revenue to be up approximately 5% for the year and earnings per share of $17.25 per share to $17.75 per share. We are also increasing our free cash flow target to a range of $350 million to $400 million. Our guidance for capital expenditures is unchanged from our prior guide at $250 million, and this includes our investment in the new Saltillo factory and refrigerant transition-related investments. Pricing cost benefit are now expected to be $325 million, and net material costs are expected to be flat for 2023. We revised our corporate expense estimate to be $100 million attributable to higher incentive compensation expenses. We will remain diligent on managing SG&A expense while also making necessary investments in the business to support growth, promote the development of our innovative products and solutions, improve overall productivity. And finally, we still expect our weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be approximately 35.5 million shares. With that, let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll hand it back over to Alok.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks, Joe. In addition to delivering impressed results, we are also making significant progress towards streamlining our portfolio. Last year, we announced a plan to divest -- we announced the plan to divest our European operations aligning with Lennox's strategic concentration on the North American market, where we are well positioned to accelerate growth and expand resilient margins. In the third quarter, we reached exclusive agreements for the sale of our European commercial HVAC businesses as well as our European process cooling businesses. Based on these agreements, we recorded $63 million noncash impairment this quarter. We expect both transactions to be completed before the end of the year. We also made strides in simplifying our already strong balance sheet. In September, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured five-year notes, which will replace the $350 million note maturing in November of this year. In order to retire all secured debt, we increased our revolving credit facility and introduced a commercial paper program. With these changes, we have lowered our financing cost and created additional liquidity. Now please turn to Slide 12, where I will provide an initial assessment of 2024 business conditions. 2024 will be another transformative year for Lennox as we ramp up the new commercial factory transition to low GWP refrigerant and continue our transformation plan. Our strategic management and execution discipline will allow us to navigate ongoing macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainties. On the left-hand side of this slide, we have laid out several tailwinds and headwinds that are likely to impact industry demand. We anticipate channel de-stocking to end in 2023, which will lead to favorable volume trends in 2024 as channel returns to its usual ordering patterns. Additionally, the IRA, tax credits and other local incentives aimed at promoting energy-efficient at grades will encourage consumers to replace versus repair as well as the boost the sales of higher efficiency products. Also, as supply chains continue to heal and lead times normalize, pent-up demand for commercial products will drive growth. We continue to monitor demand changes related to the impending refrigerant regulatory transition in 2025. There is likely to be demand disruptions as distributors are going to adjust inventory levels to mitigate supply chain risks, gain possible price advantage and prepare to meet regulatory deadlines. In terms of headwinds, the most significant source of uncertainty stems from macroeconomic factors. These include 2024 as an election year, fluctuations in consumer confidence influenced by geopolitical concerns and the impact of elevated interest rates on residential new homes and large commercial construction projects. On the right-hand side of the slide, we have identified several profit drivers. We believe that end market demand and normalization of channel inventory will drive improved volume with consistent incremental profits. We also expect the ongoing benefits of the strategic pricing initiatives and additional pricing opportunity driven by the increase in the cost of 410 refrigerants. Towards the end of 2024, we'll start experiencing additional price and mix benefits, driven by the higher cost of 454B units that require new sensors, control boards and more for advanced heat exchangers to maintain energy efficiency ratings. We forecast additional manufacturing productivity due to higher absorption and fuel for supply chain constraints. These drivers will be partially offset by ongoing inflation, ramp-up costs for the new commercial factory in Saltillo and costs associated with the refrigerant transitions. Regarding cash flow, we anticipate cash conversion to be impacted by a temporary increase in working capital as well as capital investment to complete the new commercial factory and to meet the 2025 refrigerant transition requirements. Ultimately, our outlook on 2024 is cautiously optimistic. Our strategy remains focused on consistent execution, driving top line growth and expanding our margins. We plan to provide our 2024 financial guidance when we report our fourth quarter earnings early next year. With that, please turn to Slide 13. Allow me to summarize some of the factors that lead me to believe Lennox is poised to continue delivering great results. First, we are making the necessary investments to enhance our go-to-market effectiveness to meet the attractive long-term industry demand. Second, our unique direct-to-dealer model enables us to deliver sustainable and resilient higher margins by leveraging both our manufacturing and distribution network to optimize profitability. Third, we deliver consistent execution through utilization of our balanced scorecard-based operating system, dual source supply chain and lean digital processes. Our capital deployment remains disciplined as we prioritize organic growth investments, developments, acquisitions and share repurchases. The fourth pillar is our advanced technology portfolio that allows us to address mega-trends and provide innovative solutions to our customers. Finally, we live by our core values and embody our guiding principles to strengthen our high-performance culture. Our pay-for-performance incentive structure also ensures close alignment of talent and stakeholder interest. I would like to conclude by expressing my appreciation to all of our employees and customers. I also want to thank Joe Reitmeier for his dedication over the years and congratulate Michael Quenzer on his new role as CFO. Finally, I would like to welcome all of the 280 AES employees to the Lennox family. I am excited about what the future holds for Lennox as our best days are still ahead of us. Thank you. Joe, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions now. Kerry, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Joe, we're going to miss you. I think it was you, me and LeBron from Akron. So, we're going to be down to two now, but...\nJoe Reitmeier: I appreciate you.\nJeff Sprague: Thanks for all the help over the years. Look, thanks for the early view into 2024. I wonder if we could just drill a little bit more into the transition itself. And just thinking about the timing of all this, should we expect, say, kind of cost burdens early in the year that are then kind of recaptured in higher selling prices later in the year? Just kind of thinking about the progression of this through your P&L as you prepare and then ultimately sell on the other side?\nMichael Quenzer: Jeff, this is Michael. Yes, I'll speak specifically to the commercial factory. What you'll see in the first half of next year is that we'll ramp that factory up specifically on the head count and some of the training needed to start the production kind of late into Q2. So, you'll see some costs in the first half with no production output. And then in the second half, we'll start to get some production output, but that also still won't be at full efficiency. It will take a bit of time before we get the efficiency, but the second half will at least start to get some more production out and let us start to get back into the inventory levels that we need to get into emergency replacement. So, most first half of the year is going to be kind of the cost and efficiency getting better in the second half.\nAlok Maskara: And Jeff, the same would be true on the refrigerant transition. So I think you're right to assume that the first half, there would be cost burdens as we start converting lines, ordering more spare parts. And then second half is where we start getting the price mix benefits. Most of the price mix benefits for refrigerant transition is likely to be 2025, but we'll start seeing some of that towards the tail end of next year.\nJeff Sprague: And maybe just as a follow-on comment here. Just thinking about the commercial margins, obviously, just a very positive story here in 2023 looks like you are still expecting kind of a significant step down in Q4. Obviously, there's some seasonality, but maybe just give us some color on what you'd expect in Q4 in commercial price/cost mix and how the bridges to a margin expectation there?\nJoe Ritchie: Yes. Naturally, our Q4 has a little less volume in it seasonally. It drops down a little bit. But -- as we look to our backlog, the margin and the backlog still this supports margins that we saw in Q3. So pricing still remains to hold there well as well as the mix dynamic is positive. So, we see that continuing into next year. I mean after several years of being behind on the price/cost dynamic, we've kind of gotten back to where we think we have normal margins. Now, it's involved maintaining those margins going forward as we start to see costs for refrigerants and some of the new 454B cost additions that we need to do.\nAlok Maskara: I think, Jeff, on the guide perspective, I mean, I just want to remind that like we are still heavily volume-constrained. And even in Q3, if we had more capacity, we would have sold more. So I just want to remind that like we made good progress in the factory. There are still -- are paying back a more some time with supply chain with production output. We wanted to make sure that we didn't get too far ahead of ourselves as to giving guidance for the rest of the year.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from the line of Chirag Patel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nChirag Patel: Thank you. Just wanted to also thank Joe for his time and patience with us over the years, and Michael I look forward to your continued insights in the new role, congratulations. One thing I wanted to kind of hit on was on the acquisition side. Any sort of thoughts on seasonality of that business, if there is something that doesn't match up with where commercial is currently? And then we talked about being accretive to earnings. Just wanted to also get a sense for how that margin profile kind of works. Will it be at the similar levels that we're seeing here in commercial currently? Or is there maybe a little bit of a dilution to that in the near term?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. Thanks, Chirag. Let me start on that. So first of all, very excited about the acquisition, very consistent with our stated goal of how we look at bolt-on and areas such as service parts and accessories so super excited on what that brings. In terms of seasonality I mean given that it's installation and services, it's going to be very similar to the rest of the Lennox business, so I wouldn't expect anything materially different compared to the rest of the business. The same comment also holds on the margin. The margin on par would be same as the rest of Lennox, neither accretive nor dilutive to us as we embark on 2024. So, a great fit for us, it kind of from a revenue perspective and margin perspective would be similar dynamics to the rest of Lennox's business. I mean the fit is like hand in a glove fit for us on how well this business fits with our existing portfolio.\nChirag Patel: And then I guess on the commercial side, we talked about the idea of being able to sell more if we had more volume capacity currently. But just digging a little bit deeper into the actual end markets themselves, are you seeing any sort of softness or weakness in any of the various markets you serve? Is there a specific area that may be moderating just given the current macro environment that's out there, anything that you can help us within understanding that a little bit better?\nAlok Maskara: Where we have seen some softness is like large office complexes and others. The good news is our exposure to that market is very small. Our primary exposure, as you know, is in flat single-story buildings like retail, restaurants, schools and all of them have been doing very well. So we haven't seen any significant change. Now we do see backlog, which is not like big for us, going back to more normal levels as lead times are going back to more normal levels. But from a core demand perspective, we're not noticing any noticeable differences, except in the small pocket where we don't have much exposure that's large office buildings and office complexes.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Nice quarter. So, the net material inflation now, I think, looks flat. So I think prior, you're looking for, I think, commodity costs, $35 million of deflation offset by component inflation of, I think, 90, if I'm not mistaken. How does -- if you break out that flat between the components and the commodities, how does that look? Is it mainly steel price the facing coming through on the commodities? I was just curious how that bucket looks?\nJoe Ritchie: Yes. What we've seen is the commodity is about favorable. We saw steel year-to-date favorable. And for the rest of the year, we think commodities are going to be pretty flat. We don't see a lot of benefit in the commodities in the fourth quarter. You'll see continued headwinds a little bit on some of the material costs in Q4, but it's not as significant as we previously thought under our last guidance. That's really where the big change is that little bit less expected inflation on some of the non-commodity material. But for now, the commodities have been relatively flat across steel, copper and aluminum.\nNigel Coe: And then if we then carry that through into '24, obviously, with the hedges, you got some visibility there. How does that look in maybe the first half of the year?\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes, we'll see a little bit of benefit on the hedges as they drift into next year in the first half for the aluminum. Aluminum, we spent more on that as the copper and the steel that's more fluctuation on the current pricing. So, we'll see where steel goes, but we think it will be pretty muted next year on commodities.\nNigel Coe: And then just a quick one, if you bear with me on the refinancing cost. I think, look, you mentioned lower financing cost with refi. I think it was $50 million or 5%, replacing $350 at 3%. So just wondering how the mathematics works there?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. I'll take that. I mean, I think if you look at it as an overall financing cost, I mean, clearly, interest rates are out of our control. But many of our secured credit lines and if we look at the actual financing costs were higher. But from a pure interest rate perspective, you're right. I mean, the new bonds are at a higher interest rate and the bonds that are expiring. But as you took a whole package together, on what we are paying for secured financing versus the benefits of commercial paper, items under control would now be at a lower cost versus otherwise.\nNigel Coe: Okay. I'll dig it into that, and Joe, congratulations, Michael, congratulations. So, I'll leave it there.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: And I'll add my congratulations to mix as well, wishing both lots of luck. Peers are sounding like they may expect a richer mix the low GWP products next year just based off of the installation requirements under the EPA rules that recently came out. Are you thinking similarly, could there actually be a stronger front-loaded pre-buy of 410A? Just your thoughts on how the rules impact those considerations for next year?\nAlok Maskara: I mean the rules are still a bit of in a flux. As you know, EPA came out with some final guidelines recently. We are still waiting for some clarifications from DOE and other pieces. Would there be mix benefits for the new refrigerants? Absolutely. Is it going to be early next year? We don't know. We think it's likely going to be more towards second half of next year as the transition starts ticking forward. But what we know for sure is given our preparation, which we think we are at or ahead of orders in terms of preparation, given our direct-to-dealer model, and given that our indoor units are compatible with our outdoor units. As we go through the transition, we think we are favorably positioned as we go into the transition year. But we will give you more details when we announce Q4 results and there be greater clarity on the different regulations and rules that will impact the transition. We are ready for the change, and we feel we're going to do better than others, but the mix impact is still to be TBD, likely to be more in the second half versus first half.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. And I'm pleasantly surprised to hear that the margins on the AES acquisition are comparable to the commercial or to the Lennox average is given that, that's would just be largely an installed business. Can you talk a little bit about that? And what accounts for sort of the quality implications in that business? And what was really appealing about the business that made it a target for you?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. So, the financial profile, as I said, is similar to rest of Lennox, which is good. What was attractive to us was to be able to provide a comprehensive holistic range of services to our customers because earlier, we did not provide installation services. We did not provide refrigerant reclaim and recycling, and we did not manufacture our own core adapters. So it was really a very, very good fit with the gaps in our portfolio. We like the team. We like the customer base. As you can imagine, we did significant due diligence including using external services for financial due diligence. And we are super excited about taking the business forward, getting a greater share of our customer spend, giving them good assurance all the way from cradle to grave for the product to be able to serve as well. So while the financials are small, we are just super excited about the strategic fit and where this business is going to go, including the synergies that we can gain out of this business.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: My congratulations to Michael as well, and then thank you, Joe, for all the time and wish you the best on retirement. So maybe my first question, can we just focus on resi volumes for the quarter? Nice to see the decelerating trend this quarter, curious, can you maybe just kind of parse that out? What do you see specifically in your independent distribution channel versus selling direct?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes. So, the independent distribution, we saw volumes down kind of mid-teens. And we saw that improve as the kind of quarter went on, specifically in our coils business. That was one of the first businesses that started destocking. We're starting to see that improve. So that's a good sign. The destocking is ending on the coil side. So you'll start kind of mid-teens on the independent district distribution.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. And Michael, what's kind of like the expectation then for 4Q on the independent distribution side?\nMichael Quenzer: Middle of all, we're getting to kind of a flat volume for Q4. We think it'll be down a little bit. There's still some furnace inventory in the channel that needs to destock. It's more of a seasonal product in Q4. So you'll see that for a bit. But then the direct side should be up offsetting that.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Cool. And then I guess just thinking about 2024, and I appreciate the comments you've already made on commercial margins and the plant and potentially productivity efficiencies as you kind of ramp the plant. At the same time, like you haven't seen a lot of productivity benefits coming through commercially yet, yet the margins are -- have been really, really good. So, I'm just curious like -- how do you kind of -- how do we level set like what the margin profile for the commercial business should be or could be in 2024?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. Let me speak on that. So as we look at the commercial business, we are very pleased with the progress. And as a reminder, we are sort of ahead of where we had communicated and expected, and we have delivered over $100 million in EBIT improvement even before Q3. If you go back and look at strategically what we did there, we rationalize a significant portion of our product. You can call that a mix benefit. You can cause that productivity benefit. It really doesn't matter. But yes, I mean, we are -- our factories are running much better, getting a greater output and giving us more of the products that we getting margins on. So what it does is it sets us up really nicely for even though we are going to have a onetime cost for factory startup and we'll be bidding the kind of extra labor, extra cost before we start production. We think going into 2024, we are not going to be degrading margins in commercial throughout the year. So, I think we are set up for long-term success. Second factory gets us more volume at similar margins, and we are excited about the future of commercial. And I wouldn't read too much into whether we got productivity or not because on those walks, you can put mix as any different ways. We just put a lot of those benefits certainly into mix.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: Nice quarter. Alok, could you just comment on demand trends exiting 3Q and into 4Q? It sounds like the Allied business is improving, but anything else you'd add?\nAlok Maskara: Hey, Ryan, thanks. It's been very similar. We said even when we give '23, guidance that we would expect destocking to essentially end in '23, besides some furnaces. And that's exactly what you're seeing is destocking is tailing down some furnaces, as Michael mentioned earlier, are still in there. And we haven't noticed anything different compared to the end of Q3 versus the beginning of Q4. That holds true for both direct and indirect channel. Consumer seems to be holding pretty well on the resi side. On the commercial side, there's lots of sophisticated dialogue around how we transition next year and what we do with capacity when it comes back online, but again, no significant changes in demand over the past few weeks as we finished Q3 and move into Q4. Everything is very, very consistent with how we thought about it and what we have communicated in the past.\nRyan Merkel: You mentioned pent-up demand. I'm just curious how much visibility do you have? Do you have backlog through the first part -- the first half of '24, just any commentary on sort of your confidence in that part of the business?\nAlok Maskara: I mean we are not in the long lead backlog type business. So I mean within a quarter, we typically book and ship. When we end the quarter, we might have six to eight weeks of backlog on the books. So no, from a booked order perspective, we don't carry over beyond a quarter or so. But from conversations with our customers and quotation activity and starting to schedule changeovers, we feel good about 2024. Because remember, there's a pent-up demand. The average age of units on rooftops when you look at large customers, whether it's Lowe's, Walmart, others, is much higher than what it should be, which means they're paying more for repairs than they should and a new unit may have a much quick payback compared to the previous times. So those conversations all make us feel confident. But we'll get more into this when we announce Q4 results in early 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: Congrats, Joe, I'm wondering if you're getting your retirement home in Cleveland.\nJoe Reitmeier: Believe it or not, yes, and we'll see you around the stocking on some way.\nJeff Hammond: Just look, I want to go back to pricing you made some comments at a conference kind of 15% price. I think Carey was out with similar comments. Just maybe walk through your confidence in being able to kind of realize those? And then, it seems like year one is maybe more around refrigerant inflation, which we're not seeing yet, just any feedback on kind of where refrigerant prices go from here?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. So, I think, first of all, we are pleased that the numbers we gave are similar to what the peers are giving. And just a reminder to others who may be less familiar because those numbers were over two years, right, we said starting 2023, ending in 2025, we think there's a pricing opportunity in that range over two years. First year, yes, there is a refrigerant. Now the spot pricing on 40 goes up and down a little bit. But keep in mind that the production quota has not been reduced yet. That gets into reduction starting 2024. So we still expect refrigerant price to go up. And all indications based on conversations with suppliers is that it will, that will force everybody to do price increases, including us. So we are monitoring that closely and no change in our outlook yet. In addition, as we go further into the year and we think of the new tire efficiency, the cost of sensors, that outlook has not changed either. So while you can there be certain and we'll get more into this in early 2024, Jeff, in our viewpoint on that has not changed.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. Great. And then just the mix and resi continues to be impressive. I'm just wondering how much is just straight year change versus consumers mixing up or I know supply chain was an issue on the higher-end stuff. And then just on share gain. I mean, it's obviously some noise with destocking and everything, but it seems like some share pickup in the residential business, maybe where do you see that coming from?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. On the mix Jeff, as a reminder, like last year, we talked a lot about mix being negative. So remember, our mix has been negative for the past two years. A lot of it was semiconductor-driven as we tend to have the chips for the high-end products, which uses a lot more chips. So that has reverted itself. We are selling a lot more of the premium products. I think as part of pricing excellence, the team is doing a really good job driving the right mix as we go into larger accounts and running the appropriate promotions. That would promote a higher mix. The incentive structure helps us well because a lot of the government incentives and rebates come only at higher efficiency products, not at a lower one. And then, of course, there's the pure [indiscernible], which we called out earlier. So, I think that number has not changed. But I think the upside in the mix is more from all the other factors, mostly on selling higher-end premium products.\nJeff Hammond: And then just kind of around share gain?\nAlok Maskara: On share gain, I like to look at it over a 12-month period. I mean, right now, because of destocking our direct business clearly shows very good share gains. We think some of it is artificial and will go away as destocking again. We are confident some of it is real and will stick around as like in the dust clears between stocking and destocking. But it's too early to call victory or too early to take a victory lap here. We'd like to see all the numbers settle in by next year. But we feel very good based on conversations, based on a number of dealers who are coming back to us based on our new dealer pipeline and based on just the feedback and customer satisfaction stores that we are getting. Our customer satisfaction had dipped. But as I look at NPS scores, we are back to regular better than regular, which is always a leading indicator into share. So we feel good where we are, but I'd like to give it a few more months and just to settle before we kind of claim that to be a win.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: I guess wanted to start on just 2024 and your comments around volume growth and consistent incrementals and just touch on the volume growth side of that a little bit and in particular, on the resi side and just the dynamic you consider as kind of the setup for 2024, maybe some kind of comp benefits, so a little bit of absence of destock but then other factors you're considering kind of how you're thinking about that volume algorithm?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes, that was the one that you just touched on. The absence of the destock that's obviously going to revert next year. So, we will see that pick up on the indirect side of our business. And then outside of that, we still expect the economy to continue to grow in low single-digit PDP and with that, we see the replacement market continue to expand. We'll get some volume there, potentially some share gains as well in residential. And then, we talked about, we still see good visibility into next year on the commercial after many years of being down in the industry. We're going to continue to see that grow as we talk with national accounts. They have big planned replacement programs going for several years to come, and we see that as a volume tailwind next year.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: And then on the fourth quarter implied margin step down, you touched on commercial, it sounds like nothing more than typical seasonality? Can you also touch on resi because it looks like what's implied is a larger-than-normal sequential step down? Is there anything within resi that's adding any kind of abnormal pressure versus typical seasonality?\nMichael Quenzer: We'll have a little bit of headwind from absorption. As you saw in Q3, we started to ramp down our inventory levels. We had some absorption headwind in Q3. We'll see some more of that in the Q4, so we get the inventory levels to where we want to be and maximize our cash flow this year. Then next year, we start to grow inventories again as we transition to the new refer product, you get the absorption benefit back next year.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Okay. And so when we think about the third quarter and fourth quarter kind of this margin move, a bigger impact on resi than what we would see on commercial. Is that reasonable?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nBrett Linzey: Congrats to Joe and Michael. I wanted to come back to price. And understandably, there's a lot of moving pieces on the regulatory in terms of price mix and everything in resi. But thinking more broadly to commercial, I guess as your lead times and your ability to serve does improve here. Does it give you an inherent price entitlement? And how should we think about that as we flip the calendar here?\nAlok Maskara: This is -- look, I don't know if it gives us any additional price entitlement that we have today. So we have done better at getting key account pricing that had been stuck with contracts in the past. We have done better at driving mix appropriately. So getting out of lower margin products and focusing our capacity on the higher-margin business where we have kind of appropriate advantages in terms of both price and performance. As we roll into 2024, beyond the 410A pricing impact that we talked about earlier and towards the tail end of the year, the new 454B units. I don't think there's anything incremental beyond those two that we already talked about in getting into there. A lot of the catch-up on national accounts and commercial was done this year and I wouldn't expect another catch up next year.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on commercial. I was hoping you might be able to provide a little bit of context on the individual vertical performance within that business. I think you noted last quarter there was a gradual improvement within emergency replacement as you regain your footing there. But does that continue into Q3? And then any color on the individual verticals there?\nAlok Maskara: Same trend as Q2, I mean some things like schools are always seasonal, so you will see that tailing off in Q3 compared to Q2 as most of those placements happen in summer. But beyond that, no specific track, and we continue to make inroads, I would call it, into emergency replacement and continue to maintain our key account value and beyond normal seasonality, nothing else specific to point out.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Maybe I could circle back on the resi destocking this quarter. You said it was decelerated, so it seems to mostly have played out. Has there been any surprises from your perspective?\nAlok Maskara: Not really big surprises. I mean, sometimes when we look at the overall industry numbers month-to-month, I think there are some months where we thought it was, wow, really better, some months the way worse. But net-net, not that many surprises, Deane, because I think overall, it's turning out very much exactly as we thought it would be in terms of when it would end. Now, I think there's different dynamics between independent distributors and large organized distributors. And just keep in mind that our focus and our exposure is largely to independent distributors versus large organized distributor. For us, it's played out very similar to what we thought it would.\nDeane Dray: Great. And I appreciate the early look on some of the 2024 dynamics was hoping you could expand on the free cash flow implications. Just can you size what that temporary working capital bill might be? And when might that get worked down?\nJoe Reitmeier: We're still formalizing all the plants, but it might be maybe 1% of sales. It's mostly related to the Commercial business as we ramp up that factor. We're going to need additional raw material might have a little bit of pre-build on the commercial but also with the 410A equipment since the manufacturing did cut off is kind of at the end of the year for all of that package system. So, that's really where most of that growth is going to be -- and then in addition to that, we'll have some higher or elevated capital expenditures going into next year as we finish up the factory and finish up the transition of the commercial factor and finish up the investments we need to make to transition our factories to the 454B product. So, CapEx will be elevated maybe kind of $150 million on that for next year as well. And then you ask about burning off that working cap that will take place over 2025.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Please check your mute button. I am not able to hear you. Gautam, are you -- as your mute button undone.\nAlok Maskara: I think Gautam moved down in the queue. So maybe go to Steve next the next question.\nOperator: Okay one moment, please. Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Congrats to both of you, for sure, Joe. It was a pleasure working with you. Always tremendous straight shooter, so I appreciate the work over the years. So just on the commercial side, I mean, I know you guys are opening up some really good numbers, carrier up 30% again this quarter or something like that. You say orders are solid. Like what is the -- but the lead times are like 50 weeks at some point, which is almost even like a fake lead time to an extent. What is the book-to-bill? What was the book-to-bill this quarter for that business as the backlog normalizes?\nAlok Maskara: Steve, for us, as we look at our business, we have very little orders that carry over beyond a quarter. And when I mean order like booked order. So our book-to-bill ratio was extremely close to one, which is what it has been most of the time, except during really bad crisis. And the lead times for -- at least for us are no longer 50 weeks. Lead times are now trending just around a quarter within a quarter and getting much, much closer to normal.\nSteve Tusa: Right. So you're saying that even when those lead times kind of stretched out there there's really no backlog build? I mean, is that what you're saying? I'm just having trouble reconcile on that because everybody else built a lot of backlog, obviously?\nAlok Maskara: So, we did. So if you go back to last year, right, about the same time, we had talked about our backlog, and we had said that is unusual for us to carry so much backlog given the nature of the business. At this point, 12 years after that, we are saying that we still have backlog, but it's more in a normal level. It's no longer an elevated backlog, but our book-to-bill. So we are essentially shipping as much as we are booking at any given time. So that's close to right.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Got it. And then just on the pricing side, you guys have talked about that kind of mid-season price adjustment for some of the resi customers. Your pricing was kind of consistent 3Q to 2Q. Can you maybe just talk about how that played through? I know that may be a little bit of a tougher comp versus last year, but maybe just some color on that, how that played through?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes. I think what you saw in Q2 is that we still had some benefit of lapping some prices in Q2, and by Q3, we fully lapped all that benefit, but we picked up the incremental strategic pricing in Q3. So that's where we'll start to see that normalize for the rest of the year though. But yes, we did see good pricing on the strategic pricing initiative we launched in June.\nSteve Tusa: Okay and then one last question on pricing for next year. I know you said the double digit over a two-year period I'm not sure if that meant like mid-singles in '24 and mid-singles in '25. Maybe just a little bit more clarity on how you see that breaking out between '24 and '25.\nAlok Maskara: Steve, that's still a bit TBD. We're in October, as we go into price increases, we got a greater clarity in a couple of months because there are lots of moving pieces, including cost of refrigerants, sensors, where the overall situation is in different manufacturing cost as well because we haven't even made any measurable quantity of the new product. So, we'll be able to give you a much more refined view of that when we announce Q4 results early next year.\nSteve Tusa: Right. And no Investor Day, right, obviously in December?\nAlok Maskara: That's right. No investor Day.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Congratulations to Joe and to Michael. Maybe just a first question. commercial margins, so not a particularly original topic. But if we think about what you said, Michael, earlier on this call, I think it's that the sort of firm-wide operating margin looks like it's down maybe 200, 300 basis points sequentially in Q4. And commercial is down sort of less than that and resi down a little bit more. So, we have that sort of jumping off point of a commercial margin of sort of 22% or something for the year, a little bit more than that. When we look at next year, the sort of puts and takes of all your color, are we assuming kind of fairly normal commercial operating leverage, you have the sort of the balance of the tailwind from volume and price mix and then the headwind from the new plant ramp-up. Is that maybe just confirm that thought process for Q4 and next year is roughly correct?\nAlok Maskara: Julian, I'll start and then Michael will continue. But I just want to start by reminding that we don't really get segment margin targets by quarter. I mean, part of it is we just too small for that in terms of -- there's always puts and takes. So I think when we give guide, we look at the Company overall, and having said that, I'll go to Michael, who can get into the details of margin expectations and pluses and minuses, both for Q4 and for next year.\nMichael Quenzer: So maybe I'll just talk about next year first. So I think that's mostly our focus at this point is. So what we'll see next year is that the margins that are in our P&L currently will retain next year. We'll want to price to maintain those as costs come in, specifically on components and some of the 410A refrigerant will maintain those margins. And then on top of that, we see volume growth. So, we'll get 30-plus percent incrementals as we get some additional volume out of that second price end markets or so. So you'll see that help lift up some of the operating margins offsetting that though will be some of that we have in the factory, the new factories, we've ramped those up. That's kind of our early thinking right now. But overall structure of the margins you see in 2023, we think will repeat next year.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. And just my quick follow-up is I know we're up on time. The price mix tailwind to EBIT, you've quantified it for this year. Just sort of fourth quarter, are we thinking it's about $50 million or so tailwind? Is that roughly the order of magnitude? And then, do we assume that that's sort of a good run rate into early next year?\nMichael Quenzer: That's the guide that we have right now. We'll see where the final results come in. You need to remember that commercial last year, we had a lot of price increases that we started to get in Q4. So pretty big comps and commerce, which is why it drift off a little bit in Q4. But yes, we should retain that. And then you'll get a carryover price benefit next year for the residential strategic pricing that we did in June. So let to be on top of any price increases we announced effective January 1 that will come out in the next month or so.\nOperator: And we'll take our last question from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: All right. Well, first, congratulations, Joe and Michael, I appreciate that all your help over the years, Joe, and wish you well.\nJoe Reitmeier: Thank you.\nGautam Khanna: A lot of questions have been asked and answered. But I was curious some companies have remarked that there's been evidence of trading down, if you will, repair over replacement in North American resi HVAC. Have you seen any evidence of that in your sales in the third quarter?\nAlok Maskara: Gautam Khanna, I'll take that. It's unclear. Our exposure to repair is much lower than some of the other players in the industry, as you know. So we have read the same transcripts and we have gone through the same earnings and that does cause us some concern. But when I look at our own results and what we're hearing from our own dealers, we don't see that. So I mean I've read the same thing. It makes us a little cautious as we look at the guide going forward and making sure we continue to train our dealers to inform the consumer and make a very informed sale. But at the end of the day, as price of refrigerant keeps going up, whether it's R22 or 410A as cost of repair keeps going up and the fact that new units come with full warranty and are making it better in terms of efficiency our dealers do the right thing to educating the consumers around it. But we have read the same things. We have not heard that or seen that from our channel or our dealer base yet, but we're going to keep a close eye on that for Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And just to reconcile a comment, I think you made to Steve on book-to-bill and then earlier on productivity and within the commercial business. It sounds like I'm just curious at what level of backlog are you kind of operating off of this at this point? Because it sounds like had you had capacity to do more, you would have shipped more. Yes. Just I'm curious like how much of the next quarter or two is actually visible to you in terms of demand?\nAlok Maskara: So I think we -- and maybe the term backlog is used differently by different companies I mean when we think of backlog, it's for us, orders that are POs in the system, right, confirm. And then there's pipeline, we could be having discussions with the customer and getting their commitment about shipments in 2025 but those are not confirmed PO in our system. So our pipeline visibility is much higher, and we can see that through the next 12 to 18 months, but there's a conversion drop out in there. So we can be 100% sure. What we're 100% sure is our backlog. Typically, we book and ship within the same quarter. And during supply chain disruption, it became more than one quarter, and now we are back to sort of within the quarterly range. And we don't want to get into a situation where we start publishing backlog numbers because it's really not that relevant to our business. It is all within the quarter. So that's the comment on the backlog that I specifically mentioned.\nMichael Quenzer: And I'll just add to that. It will be even less important as we move more into merger plus, that is really fast backlog activities.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. And just maybe a last one for me on that productivity journey at the commercial facility in Arkansas, like how far along are you in that journey? Are you kind of where you expect to be? And I'm just curious like how much headroom is actually left in terms of throughput and as the supply chain has gotten better and the like. How much upside do we still have?\nAlok Maskara: There is upside remaining. And I think some of that has to be captured after the second factories online. I mean right now, we are still running at as I called it earlier, sometimes with band-aid and tweaks, I mean we have put in new management, great leaders. We have got sold or labor issues. So, there's a lot of good things going on there. But from a lean operations perspective and to be able to run a factory with consistent output, very low defect rates, very little rework. We have significant room for improving productivity in that factory. A lot of that is happening, but a lot more will happen as we get the second factory online and not run the factory above sort of where its capacity has been or what we think is capable of. So, some of that will happen only after the second factory comes online. Second, we'll keep working through that.\nOperator: Thank you for joining us today. Since there are no further questions, this will conclude Lennox's third quarter conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alok Maskara",
            "content": "Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning, everyone. I am proud to report that this has been another record quarter for Lennox with results that truly speak to our commitment towards delivering growth acceleration and resilient margin expansion. The record revenue, profit and earnings that we are sharing today reflect the transformative impact of our self-help initiatives put in place last year. These results were made possible by the hard work of Lennox's 13,000 employees as well as the unwavering loyalty of our dealers and customers. I deeply appreciate the tireless efforts of everyone who played a part in delivering these exceptional results. I also extend my appreciation to our dealers and customers for entrusting Lennox to provide top-tier innovative products and solutions. Now let me transition into an overview of this quarter's highlights. Lennox's core revenue grew 10% and our adjusted segment margin expanded 334 basis points to 19.3%, resulting in our adjusted earnings per share increasing 30% to $5.37. Our operating cash flow of $313 million was up 83% year-over-year. Additionally, earlier this morning, we announced Joe Reitmeier decision to retire and the appointment of Michael Quenzer as our new CFO. We are excited for both Joe and Michael as we complete this planned transition. Additionally, we also announced the strategic acquisition of Architectural Engineering Services, or AES this morning. The acquisition is consistent with our bolt-on acquisition strategy and is a clear strategic fit that will accelerate growth, unlock operational synergies and enhance our service offerings to create incremental shareholder value. Now please turn to Slide 4 for more details on our CFO transition. Announced earlier this morning, Joe Reitmeier has decided to retire, and I'd like to express my sincere gratitude for his remarkable 18-year tenure at Lennox. Under his leadership, the Company achieved many significant milestones, including 7x earnings per share growth and 12x increase in market cap. Beyond his financial stewardship, Joe has cultivated a talented dynamic finance organization here at Lennox. With that strong foundation and robust succession plan, we expect a smooth transition as Michael Quenzer takes on the role of Chief Financial Officer, effective January 1, 2024. Michael joined Lennox in 2004 and has been a key contributor to Lennox's strong financial performance. He has a proven track record of driving operational excellence developing talent and creating shareholder value. Michael's experience as the segment CFO during the commercial turnaround and most recently as VP Finance and Investor Relations, equips him with a solid foundation for his new role. I'm very happy for Joe, as he looks forward to his well-owned retirement, and I am excited to work with Michael in his new capacity. Please join me in congratulating both Joe and Michael. Now please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of the ADS acquisition. We are pleased to welcome AES customers and employees to the Lennox family. This strategic bolt-on acquisition is in line with our overall capital deployment strategy and provides clear benefits to our customers, employees and shareholders. As you may know, Lennox's existing national account service team is focused on preventative maintenance and energy monitoring services. Our new acquisition is centered on turnkey installation accessories as well as refrigerant, reclaim and recycling. The combined portfolio will allow us to serve our customers more holistically, ensuring that all their needs are met by Lennox. Additionally, it enhances our cross-selling opportunities as we can now offer a broader range of services and solutions to our client base. This will strengthen our relationship with our customers and positions us for a comprehensive lifecycle provider in this fragmented light commercial service industry. AES also provides new services to facilitate product life commissioning, including refrigerant reclamation and material recycling. For example, a commercial customer can purchase rooftop equipment from Lennox, utilize AES installation services, use us for maintenance and monitoring and leverage our reclaim and recycling services at the end of equipment life. By offering these services, we not only align with the evolving environmental needs and regulations but also create a new revenue stream for our business, ensuring that we remain at the forefront of sustainable innovations. Another compelling aspect of this acquisition is the vertical integration into parts and accessories, specifically in core adapters. By manufacturing and core adapters in-house, we will be able to generate cost efficiencies, increase profitability and build a stronger competitive edge in the marketplace. Ultimately, this strategic bolt-on acquisition addresses several critical execution needs in our growth strategy. It adds installation capabilities to our industry-leading preventative maintenance services, provides new services such as refrigerant reclaimer and material recycling to support product lifecycle decommissioning and increases the sales of parts and access fees. Now, let me hand the call over to Joe, who will take us through the details of our Q3 financial performance. Thanks, Joe. In addition to delivering impressed results, we are also making significant progress towards streamlining our portfolio. Last year, we announced a plan to divest -- we announced the plan to divest our European operations aligning with Lennox's strategic concentration on the North American market, where we are well positioned to accelerate growth and expand resilient margins. In the third quarter, we reached exclusive agreements for the sale of our European commercial HVAC businesses as well as our European process cooling businesses. Based on these agreements, we recorded $63 million noncash impairment this quarter. We expect both transactions to be completed before the end of the year. We also made strides in simplifying our already strong balance sheet. In September, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured five-year notes, which will replace the $350 million note maturing in November of this year. In order to retire all secured debt, we increased our revolving credit facility and introduced a commercial paper program. With these changes, we have lowered our financing cost and created additional liquidity. Now please turn to Slide 12, where I will provide an initial assessment of 2024 business conditions. 2024 will be another transformative year for Lennox as we ramp up the new commercial factory transition to low GWP refrigerant and continue our transformation plan. Our strategic management and execution discipline will allow us to navigate ongoing macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainties. On the left-hand side of this slide, we have laid out several tailwinds and headwinds that are likely to impact industry demand. We anticipate channel de-stocking to end in 2023, which will lead to favorable volume trends in 2024 as channel returns to its usual ordering patterns. Additionally, the IRA, tax credits and other local incentives aimed at promoting energy-efficient at grades will encourage consumers to replace versus repair as well as the boost the sales of higher efficiency products. Also, as supply chains continue to heal and lead times normalize, pent-up demand for commercial products will drive growth. We continue to monitor demand changes related to the impending refrigerant regulatory transition in 2025. There is likely to be demand disruptions as distributors are going to adjust inventory levels to mitigate supply chain risks, gain possible price advantage and prepare to meet regulatory deadlines. In terms of headwinds, the most significant source of uncertainty stems from macroeconomic factors. These include 2024 as an election year, fluctuations in consumer confidence influenced by geopolitical concerns and the impact of elevated interest rates on residential new homes and large commercial construction projects. On the right-hand side of the slide, we have identified several profit drivers. We believe that end market demand and normalization of channel inventory will drive improved volume with consistent incremental profits. We also expect the ongoing benefits of the strategic pricing initiatives and additional pricing opportunity driven by the increase in the cost of 410 refrigerants. Towards the end of 2024, we'll start experiencing additional price and mix benefits, driven by the higher cost of 454B units that require new sensors, control boards and more for advanced heat exchangers to maintain energy efficiency ratings. We forecast additional manufacturing productivity due to higher absorption and fuel for supply chain constraints. These drivers will be partially offset by ongoing inflation, ramp-up costs for the new commercial factory in Saltillo and costs associated with the refrigerant transitions. Regarding cash flow, we anticipate cash conversion to be impacted by a temporary increase in working capital as well as capital investment to complete the new commercial factory and to meet the 2025 refrigerant transition requirements. Ultimately, our outlook on 2024 is cautiously optimistic. Our strategy remains focused on consistent execution, driving top line growth and expanding our margins. We plan to provide our 2024 financial guidance when we report our fourth quarter earnings early next year. With that, please turn to Slide 13. Allow me to summarize some of the factors that lead me to believe Lennox is poised to continue delivering great results. First, we are making the necessary investments to enhance our go-to-market effectiveness to meet the attractive long-term industry demand. Second, our unique direct-to-dealer model enables us to deliver sustainable and resilient higher margins by leveraging both our manufacturing and distribution network to optimize profitability. Third, we deliver consistent execution through utilization of our balanced scorecard-based operating system, dual source supply chain and lean digital processes. Our capital deployment remains disciplined as we prioritize organic growth investments, developments, acquisitions and share repurchases. The fourth pillar is our advanced technology portfolio that allows us to address mega-trends and provide innovative solutions to our customers. Finally, we live by our core values and embody our guiding principles to strengthen our high-performance culture. Our pay-for-performance incentive structure also ensures close alignment of talent and stakeholder interest. I would like to conclude by expressing my appreciation to all of our employees and customers. I also want to thank Joe Reitmeier for his dedication over the years and congratulate Michael Quenzer on his new role as CFO. Finally, I would like to welcome all of the 280 AES employees to the Lennox family. I am excited about what the future holds for Lennox as our best days are still ahead of us. Thank you. Joe, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions now. Kerry, let's go to Q&A. And Jeff, the same would be true on the refrigerant transition. So I think you're right to assume that the first half, there would be cost burdens as we start converting lines, ordering more spare parts. And then second half is where we start getting the price mix benefits. Most of the price mix benefits for refrigerant transition is likely to be 2025, but we'll start seeing some of that towards the tail end of next year. I think, Jeff, on the guide perspective, I mean, I just want to remind that like we are still heavily volume-constrained. And even in Q3, if we had more capacity, we would have sold more. So I just want to remind that like we made good progress in the factory. There are still -- are paying back a more some time with supply chain with production output. We wanted to make sure that we didn't get too far ahead of ourselves as to giving guidance for the rest of the year. Sure. Thanks, Chirag. Let me start on that. So first of all, very excited about the acquisition, very consistent with our stated goal of how we look at bolt-on and areas such as service parts and accessories so super excited on what that brings. In terms of seasonality I mean given that it's installation and services, it's going to be very similar to the rest of the Lennox business, so I wouldn't expect anything materially different compared to the rest of the business. The same comment also holds on the margin. The margin on par would be same as the rest of Lennox, neither accretive nor dilutive to us as we embark on 2024. So, a great fit for us, it kind of from a revenue perspective and margin perspective would be similar dynamics to the rest of Lennox's business. I mean the fit is like hand in a glove fit for us on how well this business fits with our existing portfolio. Where we have seen some softness is like large office complexes and others. The good news is our exposure to that market is very small. Our primary exposure, as you know, is in flat single-story buildings like retail, restaurants, schools and all of them have been doing very well. So we haven't seen any significant change. Now we do see backlog, which is not like big for us, going back to more normal levels as lead times are going back to more normal levels. But from a core demand perspective, we're not noticing any noticeable differences, except in the small pocket where we don't have much exposure that's large office buildings and office complexes. Sure. I'll take that. I mean, I think if you look at it as an overall financing cost, I mean, clearly, interest rates are out of our control. But many of our secured credit lines and if we look at the actual financing costs were higher. But from a pure interest rate perspective, you're right. I mean, the new bonds are at a higher interest rate and the bonds that are expiring. But as you took a whole package together, on what we are paying for secured financing versus the benefits of commercial paper, items under control would now be at a lower cost versus otherwise. I mean the rules are still a bit of in a flux. As you know, EPA came out with some final guidelines recently. We are still waiting for some clarifications from DOE and other pieces. Would there be mix benefits for the new refrigerants? Absolutely. Is it going to be early next year? We don't know. We think it's likely going to be more towards second half of next year as the transition starts ticking forward. But what we know for sure is given our preparation, which we think we are at or ahead of orders in terms of preparation, given our direct-to-dealer model, and given that our indoor units are compatible with our outdoor units. As we go through the transition, we think we are favorably positioned as we go into the transition year. But we will give you more details when we announce Q4 results and there be greater clarity on the different regulations and rules that will impact the transition. We are ready for the change, and we feel we're going to do better than others, but the mix impact is still to be TBD, likely to be more in the second half versus first half. Yes. So, the financial profile, as I said, is similar to rest of Lennox, which is good. What was attractive to us was to be able to provide a comprehensive holistic range of services to our customers because earlier, we did not provide installation services. We did not provide refrigerant reclaim and recycling, and we did not manufacture our own core adapters. So it was really a very, very good fit with the gaps in our portfolio. We like the team. We like the customer base. As you can imagine, we did significant due diligence including using external services for financial due diligence. And we are super excited about taking the business forward, getting a greater share of our customer spend, giving them good assurance all the way from cradle to grave for the product to be able to serve as well. So while the financials are small, we are just super excited about the strategic fit and where this business is going to go, including the synergies that we can gain out of this business. Sure. Let me speak on that. So as we look at the commercial business, we are very pleased with the progress. And as a reminder, we are sort of ahead of where we had communicated and expected, and we have delivered over $100 million in EBIT improvement even before Q3. If you go back and look at strategically what we did there, we rationalize a significant portion of our product. You can call that a mix benefit. You can cause that productivity benefit. It really doesn't matter. But yes, I mean, we are -- our factories are running much better, getting a greater output and giving us more of the products that we getting margins on. So what it does is it sets us up really nicely for even though we are going to have a onetime cost for factory startup and we'll be bidding the kind of extra labor, extra cost before we start production. We think going into 2024, we are not going to be degrading margins in commercial throughout the year. So, I think we are set up for long-term success. Second factory gets us more volume at similar margins, and we are excited about the future of commercial. And I wouldn't read too much into whether we got productivity or not because on those walks, you can put mix as any different ways. We just put a lot of those benefits certainly into mix. Hey, Ryan, thanks. It's been very similar. We said even when we give '23, guidance that we would expect destocking to essentially end in '23, besides some furnaces. And that's exactly what you're seeing is destocking is tailing down some furnaces, as Michael mentioned earlier, are still in there. And we haven't noticed anything different compared to the end of Q3 versus the beginning of Q4. That holds true for both direct and indirect channel. Consumer seems to be holding pretty well on the resi side. On the commercial side, there's lots of sophisticated dialogue around how we transition next year and what we do with capacity when it comes back online, but again, no significant changes in demand over the past few weeks as we finished Q3 and move into Q4. Everything is very, very consistent with how we thought about it and what we have communicated in the past. I mean we are not in the long lead backlog type business. So I mean within a quarter, we typically book and ship. When we end the quarter, we might have six to eight weeks of backlog on the books. So no, from a booked order perspective, we don't carry over beyond a quarter or so. But from conversations with our customers and quotation activity and starting to schedule changeovers, we feel good about 2024. Because remember, there's a pent-up demand. The average age of units on rooftops when you look at large customers, whether it's Lowe's, Walmart, others, is much higher than what it should be, which means they're paying more for repairs than they should and a new unit may have a much quick payback compared to the previous times. So those conversations all make us feel confident. But we'll get more into this when we announce Q4 results in early 2024. Yes. So, I think, first of all, we are pleased that the numbers we gave are similar to what the peers are giving. And just a reminder to others who may be less familiar because those numbers were over two years, right, we said starting 2023, ending in 2025, we think there's a pricing opportunity in that range over two years. First year, yes, there is a refrigerant. Now the spot pricing on 40 goes up and down a little bit. But keep in mind that the production quota has not been reduced yet. That gets into reduction starting 2024. So we still expect refrigerant price to go up. And all indications based on conversations with suppliers is that it will, that will force everybody to do price increases, including us. So we are monitoring that closely and no change in our outlook yet. In addition, as we go further into the year and we think of the new tire efficiency, the cost of sensors, that outlook has not changed either. So while you can there be certain and we'll get more into this in early 2024, Jeff, in our viewpoint on that has not changed. Sure. On the mix Jeff, as a reminder, like last year, we talked a lot about mix being negative. So remember, our mix has been negative for the past two years. A lot of it was semiconductor-driven as we tend to have the chips for the high-end products, which uses a lot more chips. So that has reverted itself. We are selling a lot more of the premium products. I think as part of pricing excellence, the team is doing a really good job driving the right mix as we go into larger accounts and running the appropriate promotions. That would promote a higher mix. The incentive structure helps us well because a lot of the government incentives and rebates come only at higher efficiency products, not at a lower one. And then, of course, there's the pure [indiscernible], which we called out earlier. So, I think that number has not changed. But I think the upside in the mix is more from all the other factors, mostly on selling higher-end premium products. On share gain, I like to look at it over a 12-month period. I mean, right now, because of destocking our direct business clearly shows very good share gains. We think some of it is artificial and will go away as destocking again. We are confident some of it is real and will stick around as like in the dust clears between stocking and destocking. But it's too early to call victory or too early to take a victory lap here. We'd like to see all the numbers settle in by next year. But we feel very good based on conversations, based on a number of dealers who are coming back to us based on our new dealer pipeline and based on just the feedback and customer satisfaction stores that we are getting. Our customer satisfaction had dipped. But as I look at NPS scores, we are back to regular better than regular, which is always a leading indicator into share. So we feel good where we are, but I'd like to give it a few more months and just to settle before we kind of claim that to be a win. This is -- look, I don't know if it gives us any additional price entitlement that we have today. So we have done better at getting key account pricing that had been stuck with contracts in the past. We have done better at driving mix appropriately. So getting out of lower margin products and focusing our capacity on the higher-margin business where we have kind of appropriate advantages in terms of both price and performance. As we roll into 2024, beyond the 410A pricing impact that we talked about earlier and towards the tail end of the year, the new 454B units. I don't think there's anything incremental beyond those two that we already talked about in getting into there. A lot of the catch-up on national accounts and commercial was done this year and I wouldn't expect another catch up next year. Same trend as Q2, I mean some things like schools are always seasonal, so you will see that tailing off in Q3 compared to Q2 as most of those placements happen in summer. But beyond that, no specific track, and we continue to make inroads, I would call it, into emergency replacement and continue to maintain our key account value and beyond normal seasonality, nothing else specific to point out. Not really big surprises. I mean, sometimes when we look at the overall industry numbers month-to-month, I think there are some months where we thought it was, wow, really better, some months the way worse. But net-net, not that many surprises, Deane, because I think overall, it's turning out very much exactly as we thought it would be in terms of when it would end. Now, I think there's different dynamics between independent distributors and large organized distributors. And just keep in mind that our focus and our exposure is largely to independent distributors versus large organized distributor. For us, it's played out very similar to what we thought it would. I think Gautam moved down in the queue. So maybe go to Steve next the next question. Steve, for us, as we look at our business, we have very little orders that carry over beyond a quarter. And when I mean order like booked order. So our book-to-bill ratio was extremely close to one, which is what it has been most of the time, except during really bad crisis. And the lead times for -- at least for us are no longer 50 weeks. Lead times are now trending just around a quarter within a quarter and getting much, much closer to normal. So, we did. So if you go back to last year, right, about the same time, we had talked about our backlog, and we had said that is unusual for us to carry so much backlog given the nature of the business. At this point, 12 years after that, we are saying that we still have backlog, but it's more in a normal level. It's no longer an elevated backlog, but our book-to-bill. So we are essentially shipping as much as we are booking at any given time. So that's close to right. Steve, that's still a bit TBD. We're in October, as we go into price increases, we got a greater clarity in a couple of months because there are lots of moving pieces, including cost of refrigerants, sensors, where the overall situation is in different manufacturing cost as well because we haven't even made any measurable quantity of the new product. So, we'll be able to give you a much more refined view of that when we announce Q4 results early next year. That's right. No investor Day. Julian, I'll start and then Michael will continue. But I just want to start by reminding that we don't really get segment margin targets by quarter. I mean, part of it is we just too small for that in terms of -- there's always puts and takes. So I think when we give guide, we look at the Company overall, and having said that, I'll go to Michael, who can get into the details of margin expectations and pluses and minuses, both for Q4 and for next year. Gautam Khanna, I'll take that. It's unclear. Our exposure to repair is much lower than some of the other players in the industry, as you know. So we have read the same transcripts and we have gone through the same earnings and that does cause us some concern. But when I look at our own results and what we're hearing from our own dealers, we don't see that. So I mean I've read the same thing. It makes us a little cautious as we look at the guide going forward and making sure we continue to train our dealers to inform the consumer and make a very informed sale. But at the end of the day, as price of refrigerant keeps going up, whether it's R22 or 410A as cost of repair keeps going up and the fact that new units come with full warranty and are making it better in terms of efficiency our dealers do the right thing to educating the consumers around it. But we have read the same things. We have not heard that or seen that from our channel or our dealer base yet, but we're going to keep a close eye on that for Gautam. So I think we -- and maybe the term backlog is used differently by different companies I mean when we think of backlog, it's for us, orders that are POs in the system, right, confirm. And then there's pipeline, we could be having discussions with the customer and getting their commitment about shipments in 2025 but those are not confirmed PO in our system. So our pipeline visibility is much higher, and we can see that through the next 12 to 18 months, but there's a conversion drop out in there. So we can be 100% sure. What we're 100% sure is our backlog. Typically, we book and ship within the same quarter. And during supply chain disruption, it became more than one quarter, and now we are back to sort of within the quarterly range. And we don't want to get into a situation where we start publishing backlog numbers because it's really not that relevant to our business. It is all within the quarter. So that's the comment on the backlog that I specifically mentioned. There is upside remaining. And I think some of that has to be captured after the second factories online. I mean right now, we are still running at as I called it earlier, sometimes with band-aid and tweaks, I mean we have put in new management, great leaders. We have got sold or labor issues. So, there's a lot of good things going on there. But from a lean operations perspective and to be able to run a factory with consistent output, very low defect rates, very little rework. We have significant room for improving productivity in that factory. A lot of that is happening, but a lot more will happen as we get the second factory online and not run the factory above sort of where its capacity has been or what we think is capable of. So, some of that will happen only after the second factory comes online. Second, we'll keep working through that."

            "content": "Thank you, Alok, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. As Alok mentioned earlier, the Company posted strong revenue and earnings growth. Our core revenue, which excludes our European operations, was a record $1.3 billion, up 10% where price and mix drove significant year-over-year improvement. Adjusted segment profit increased $62 million as $97 million of price and mix benefits were partially offset by inflationary impacts on SG&A and distribution costs. Total adjusted segment margin was 19.3%, up 334 basis points versus prior year. And for the quarter, corporate expenses were $27 million, an increase of $11 million as a result of higher incentive compensation and wage inflation. In the third quarter -- or the third quarter, achieved record levels of revenue, segment profit and adjusted earnings per share. Adjusted earnings per share grew by 30% to $5.37. Our third quarter tax rate of 25.6% and diluted shares outstanding were $35.7 million compared to $35.5 million in the prior year quarter. Turning to our residential results on Slide 7. The chart shows revenue growth of 7% to a record $896 million in third quarter. The segment benefited from new minimum efficiency standards and a richer mix of higher efficiency products. We also noticed the positive impact from the strategic price increase in June. Although unit sales volumes for the segment declined by 2%, our direct-to-contractor sales volume increased mid-single digits, reflecting healthy end markets and ongoing market share gains. Unit sales volumes through independent distribution channels declined mid-teens, primarily due to continued industry de-stocking, which decelerated during the quarter. Residential segment profit increased 18% to $181 million, and segment margin improved by 183 basis points to 20.2%, driven primarily by price and mix and partially offset with lower volume, higher incentive compensation and inflationary effects on wages and distribution. Turning to Slide 8 and our commercial business that continues to deliver strong results. Revenue was $406 million in the quarter, up 15%. Combined price and mix were up 13%, and volume was up 2%. Commercial segment profit was $97 million or up 86%, and segment margin expanded 912 basis points to 24%. These results were driven by price and mix for a total for the total of a $47 million increase in profit for the quarter. Increased factory productivity has offset inflation and we have made significant progress on our new factory construction, which will support growth and productivity. Moving on to cash flow performance and our net debt to EBITDA starting on Slide 9. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $313 million compared to $171 million orders in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $40 million for the quarter, an increase of $20 million compared to prior year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent, supporting organic growth investments like our new commercial manufacturing facility in Mexico, driving industry-leading innovation and exploring potential bolt-on acquisitions like AES. In the quarter, the Company paid approximately $78 million in dividends. Total debt was approximately $1.5 billion at the end of the quarter, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.7x. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $141.6 million at the end of the quarter. Construction on the new commercial factory is also coming along nicely with first production anticipated mid-2024. We do anticipate some P&L inefficiencies and temporary working capital build as the factory ramps up. By the second half of 2025, however, we expect the factory will be fully ramped, and we will begin realizing productivity gains. Now turning to Slide 10, I'll review our revised 2023 full year guidance. As a result of our strong execution on driving growth and expanding margins, we are increasing our full year outlook. We estimate core revenue to be up approximately 5% for the year and earnings per share of $17.25 per share to $17.75 per share. We are also increasing our free cash flow target to a range of $350 million to $400 million. Our guidance for capital expenditures is unchanged from our prior guide at $250 million, and this includes our investment in the new Saltillo factory and refrigerant transition-related investments. Pricing cost benefit are now expected to be $325 million, and net material costs are expected to be flat for 2023. We revised our corporate expense estimate to be $100 million attributable to higher incentive compensation expenses. We will remain diligent on managing SG&A expense while also making necessary investments in the business to support growth, promote the development of our innovative products and solutions, improve overall productivity. And finally, we still expect our weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be approximately 35.5 million shares. With that, let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll hand it back over to Alok. I appreciate you. Yes, we'll see a little bit of benefit on the hedges as they drift into next year in the first half for the aluminum. Aluminum, we spent more on that as the copper and the steel that's more fluctuation on the current pricing. So, we'll see where steel goes, but we think it will be pretty muted next year on commodities. Believe it or not, yes, and we'll see you around the stocking on some way. We're still formalizing all the plants, but it might be maybe 1% of sales. It's mostly related to the Commercial business as we ramp up that factor. We're going to need additional raw material might have a little bit of pre-build on the commercial but also with the 410A equipment since the manufacturing did cut off is kind of at the end of the year for all of that package system. So, that's really where most of that growth is going to be -- and then in addition to that, we'll have some higher or elevated capital expenditures going into next year as we finish up the factory and finish up the transition of the commercial factor and finish up the investments we need to make to transition our factories to the 454B product. So, CapEx will be elevated maybe kind of $150 million on that for next year as well. And then you ask about burning off that working cap that will take place over 2025. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael Quenzer",
            "content": "Jeff, this is Michael. Yes, I'll speak specifically to the commercial factory. What you'll see in the first half of next year is that we'll ramp that factory up specifically on the head count and some of the training needed to start the production kind of late into Q2. So, you'll see some costs in the first half with no production output. And then in the second half, we'll start to get some production output, but that also still won't be at full efficiency. It will take a bit of time before we get the efficiency, but the second half will at least start to get some more production out and let us start to get back into the inventory levels that we need to get into emergency replacement. So, most first half of the year is going to be kind of the cost and efficiency getting better in the second half. Yes. So, the independent distribution, we saw volumes down kind of mid-teens. And we saw that improve as the kind of quarter went on, specifically in our coils business. That was one of the first businesses that started destocking. We're starting to see that improve. So that's a good sign. The destocking is ending on the coil side. So you'll start kind of mid-teens on the independent district distribution. Middle of all, we're getting to kind of a flat volume for Q4. We think it'll be down a little bit. There's still some furnace inventory in the channel that needs to destock. It's more of a seasonal product in Q4. So you'll see that for a bit. But then the direct side should be up offsetting that. Yes, that was the one that you just touched on. The absence of the destock that's obviously going to revert next year. So, we will see that pick up on the indirect side of our business. And then outside of that, we still expect the economy to continue to grow in low single-digit PDP and with that, we see the replacement market continue to expand. We'll get some volume there, potentially some share gains as well in residential. And then, we talked about, we still see good visibility into next year on the commercial after many years of being down in the industry. We're going to continue to see that grow as we talk with national accounts. They have big planned replacement programs going for several years to come, and we see that as a volume tailwind next year. We'll have a little bit of headwind from absorption. As you saw in Q3, we started to ramp down our inventory levels. We had some absorption headwind in Q3. We'll see some more of that in the Q4, so we get the inventory levels to where we want to be and maximize our cash flow this year. Then next year, we start to grow inventories again as we transition to the new refer product, you get the absorption benefit back next year. Yes. Yes. I think what you saw in Q2 is that we still had some benefit of lapping some prices in Q2, and by Q3, we fully lapped all that benefit, but we picked up the incremental strategic pricing in Q3. So that's where we'll start to see that normalize for the rest of the year though. But yes, we did see good pricing on the strategic pricing initiative we launched in June. So maybe I'll just talk about next year first. So I think that's mostly our focus at this point is. So what we'll see next year is that the margins that are in our P&L currently will retain next year. We'll want to price to maintain those as costs come in, specifically on components and some of the 410A refrigerant will maintain those margins. And then on top of that, we see volume growth. So, we'll get 30-plus percent incrementals as we get some additional volume out of that second price end markets or so. So you'll see that help lift up some of the operating margins offsetting that though will be some of that we have in the factory, the new factories, we've ramped those up. That's kind of our early thinking right now. But overall structure of the margins you see in 2023, we think will repeat next year. That's the guide that we have right now. We'll see where the final results come in. You need to remember that commercial last year, we had a lot of price increases that we started to get in Q4. So pretty big comps and commerce, which is why it drift off a little bit in Q4. But yes, we should retain that. And then you'll get a carryover price benefit next year for the residential strategic pricing that we did in June. So let to be on top of any price increases we announced effective January 1 that will come out in the next month or so. And I'll just add to that. It will be even less important as we move more into merger plus, that is really fast backlog activities."

And I would now like to turn the conference over to Chelsey Pulcheon from Lennox Investor Relations team. Chelsey, please go ahead.\nChelsey Pulcheon: Thank you, Ashley. Good morning, everyone. We are excited to have you here with us this morning. Joining me today is CEO, Alok Maskara; CFO, Joe Reitmeier; and VP Finance, Michael Quenzer.  Alok will discuss quarter highlights and Joe will go into depth on the company's quarterly financial results and our updated guidance for fiscal 2023. After that, we will have a Q&A session with Alok, Joe and Michael. Turning to Slide 2. A reminder that during today's call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as outlined on this page. We may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management considers to be relevant indicators of underlying business performance. Please refer to our SEC filings available on our website for additional details, including a reconciliation of all GAAP and non-GAAP measures. The earnings release, today's presentation slides and the webcast archived link for today's call are available on our new Investor Relations website at www.investor.lennox.com. Now let me turn over the call to our CEO, Alok Maskara.\nAlok Maskara: Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning, everyone. I am delighted to share our impressive results from the recent quarter ending on June 30, during which we delivered record revenues, record profit, record EPS, record margins and record cash flow. These results demonstrate the power of our focused growth strategy and the progress of our commercial turnaround plan. I am grateful to our dealers and customers for their continued loyalty towards our products and services as we remain committed to further improving our service levels and enhancing their customer experience. I'm also thankful for the dedication and hard work of my 13,000 Lennox colleagues, whose relentless efforts have contributed to our outstanding performance this quarter. This successful quarter demonstrates the power of our laser-focused strategy, which builds on our existing strong direct customer relationships, advanced products platform and our unique distribution network. These factors will continue to fuel our share gain and margin expansion for the foreseeable future. Now I want to discuss some key highlights of the quarter on Slide 3. First, core revenues grew 3% and our adjusted segment margin expanded 320 basis points to 20.9%, resulting in our adjusted earnings per share, increasing 22% to $6.15. Additionally, our operating cash flow increased nearly 100% to $196 million. Second, we are extremely proud of our commercial team's execution of our profitable growth strategy. Both revenue and profits for the Commercial segment hit a record this quarter, driven by favorable price/mix and improved production output from our Stuttgart manufacturing location. Third, residential end markets were challenging, which resulted in our Residential segment, delivering lower revenue, margins and profits. Margins were also impacted by lower factory output and absorption as we normalize our own inventory levels, post the SEER transition. We remain cautiously optimistic about the second half, as we believe that the industry's inventory rightsizing is decelerating. In addition, our recent price increase will enable us to deliver improved margin performance during the balance of the year. Fourth and finally on this page, we are pleased to share the revised fiscal guidance for this year as we anticipate higher revenues, higher earnings per share and higher operating cash flow for the full year. Joe will review the revised guidance in greater depth later in the call. Now, please turn to Slide 4 for our view on the current business conditions impacting the industry. For the residential end market, we experienced higher-than-expected distributor destocking and a cooler start to the summer selling season. We are now anticipating unit volumes for the full year to decline by high single digits versus prior expectation of a mid-single-digit decline. Looking at the second half, we expect the impact of distributor destocking to diminish and we have started to see an uptick in our replacement sales, consistent with higher temperatures. In Commercial, we now anticipate sales to be up low double digits for the full year versus prior expectations of high single digits to low double-digit sales increase. The order backlog remains strong, and although delivery lead times remain extended, they are 50% lower than last year and in line with the industry. Regarding price versus inflation, we are pleased to report that the industry pricing remains disciplined and our own mid-year price increase has been broadly successful. Our outlook on both components and commodity cost inflation remains stable and unchanged, and we expect the second half of the year to deliver a positive price versus inflation spread. Ultimately, our improved service levels and increased commercial production gives us confidence that we are well positioned to gain share in the second half of this year. We continue to invest SG&A dollars towards improving our go-to-market processes, while deploying incremental frontline resources to win over more dealers and more key accounts. We believe that Lennox outperformed the industry in successfully launching the product portfolio to meet the new minimum efficiency standards, gaining further loyalty from customers and our dealers. During future regulatory transitions, including the upcoming low GWP refrigerant requirements on January 1, 2025, Lennox aims to deliver similar outperformance and capture additional share. Please turn to Slide 5 for more details regarding ongoing Lennox activities related to the upcoming refrigerant transition. We are pleased to announce that Lennox will transition to R-454B from R-410A refrigerant to meet the EPA requirement effective January 1, 2025. The R-454B choice was driven by our commitment to provide the best option for our valued customers and the environment. Compared to the existing 410A refrigerant, R-454B reduces greenhouse gas emissions and is approximately 80% less global warming potential. Lennox has demonstrated a solid track record of successfully navigating regulatory changes and this will be no exception. We have completed most product redesign and are now in the testing phase for this transition. The redesign includes updated compressors and other components for refrigerant compatibility and high efficiency performance. To address safety requirements for the new A2L refrigerate, we will have additional safeguards on all our products that use this refrigerant. These safeguards may include sensors, controls and algorithms which will mitigate any leaks if and when they occur. Safety of all our products remains our highest priority, and our redesign will meet or exceed applicable safety standards. As you know, Lennox has a structural advantage of primarily selling direct to dealers. This enables our team to deliver advanced training to deliverers and equip them with accurate information to share with the end consumers. This helps us and our dealers to win during the regulatory transition, while addressing all the safety requirements for manufacturing, distribution and installation. Throughout this transition, we do not expect a significant inventory prebuild as the transition to R-454B would likely happen faster compared to similar refrigerant transitions in the past. We intend to deliver a safe, seamless transition, supported by appropriate inventory levels. By maintaining strong relationships and timely communications with our suppliers, we will avoid supply chain disruptions. While we are still reviewing this transition's financial impact, we expect it to be neutral or accretive to our margins. We are confident that the increase in the product cost will be offset by price. Overall, we anticipate that once again, we will outperform the industry and garner additional loyalty from our dealers and customers during this refrigerant transition. Now let me hand the call over to Joe, who will take us through the details of our Q2 financial performance.\nJoseph Reitmeier: Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. As Alok mentioned earlier, the company posted a strong revenue and earnings growth. Core revenue, which excludes our European operations was a record $1.34 billion, up 3% compared to prior year's price and mix benefits, more than offset Residential sales volume declines. Total adjusted segment profit increased $50 million or 22% versus prior year. Price and mix increased profit by $106 million and were partially offset with $43 million from lower volume and $13 million from inflationary effects and investments in distribution and SG&A. Total adjusted segment margin was 20.9%, up 320 basis points versus prior year. For the quarter, corporate expenses were $25 million, a decline of $2 million, as we continue to tightly control corporate spending. The second quarter not only achieved record levels of revenue and segment profit, but also marked record earnings per share, with GAAP earnings per share rising 23% to $6.10, and adjusted earnings per share growing by 22% to $6.15. Our record -- our second quarter tax rate was 17.6%, and diluted shares outstanding were 35.6 million compared to 35.7 million in the prior year quarter. Now turn to Slide 7. As we saw in the first quarter, industry-wide distributor destocking continued in the second quarter and the summer season began with cooler temperatures, resulting in a 12% volume decline. The volume decline was partially offset with 2% favorable price and 6% favorable mix. Our direct-to-dealer sales, which are around 75% of our segment revenues, experienced a revenue increase in the low single digits. The remaining 25% of our revenue, which goes through distributors was down approximately 20%. Residential segment profit fell 6% to $203 million, and segment margin dipped 50 basis points to 21.6%, driven primarily by lower volume, inflation effects and selling and distribution investments. The headwinds were partially offset with price increases and favorable mix, partially driven by the new minimum efficiency standards. Turning to Slide 8, and our Commercial business that delivered another quarter of exceptional results. Revenue was $408 million in the quarter, up 24%. Combined price and mix were up 22% and volume was up 4%. Commercial segment profit was $103 million, up 150% and segment margin more than doubled to 25.3%. Price and mix had an outsized impact in the quarter, delivering $66 million and the total $62 million -- of the total $62 million of the profit increase. Last year, we provided guidance on a multiyear profit opportunity of $100 million, and I'm delighted to share that our trailing 12-month segment profit has already surged by $120 million compared to the same period last year. Our rooftop production output continues to increase, and we are maintaining a robust commercial backlog, while steadily improving delivery lead times, which now align with the industry. Moving to cash flow performance and our debt to EBITDA starting on Slide 9. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $196 million compared to $97 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $49 million for the quarter, an increase of $28 million compared to the prior year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent, supporting organic growth investments like our new commercial factory in Mexico, driving industry-leading innovation and exploring potential bolt-on acquisitions. In the quarter, the company paid $38 million in dividends. Total debt was approximately $1.6 billion at the end of the quarter, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9x. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $58.6 million at the end of the quarter. Turning to Slide 10. Let's review our 2023 full year guidance. As a result of our strong first half performance, we are increasing our full year outlook. We expect core revenue to be up between 2% and 4% for the year and earnings per share of $15.50 per share to $16 per share. We are increasing our free cash flow target to a range of $300 million to $350 million. Our guidance for capital expenditures remains consistent with our prior guide at $250 million. As a reminder, that includes investment in a second commercial factory and investments related to the refrigerant transition to take effect in 2025. Price benefit is now expected to be $250 million, and we now expect net material cost to be a $25 million headwind in 2023. The material cost headwind is driven by component cost inflation of $90 million, net of $30 million in savings from cost reduction initiatives, along with the $35 million commodity cost benefit. Our new target for corporate expenses is $95 million attributable to higher incentive compensation expenses. We will continue to manage SG&A expenses tightly, while simultaneously making essential investments in the business to support growth initiatives, advance our innovative products and solutions and enhance productivity. And finally, we still expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between 35 million and 36 million shares. With that, let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll turn it back over to Alok.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks, Joe. In addition to solid short-term results, we are also making significant progress towards transforming the company for longer-term shareholder value expansion. Last quarter, we shared the key initiatives that pave a clear path towards our 2026 financial targets. Today, we would like to share 3 transformation phases that would clarify the execution time frame of those initiatives. Collectively, these initiatives will deliver on the 2026 targets and set up Lennox for even longer-term value creation. We are currently in the self-help phase of the plan, which delivers execution consistency to our customers and shareholders. We have already demonstrated success in our commercial recovery and portfolio simplification initiatives. Our pricing excellence initiative will drive favorable margins through improved price setting, getting and netting. We are strengthening our core foundation by enhancing talent and reinforcing culture with an emphasis on accountability. This stronger foundation will serve as a springboard for accelerated growth in 2025 and beyond. Looking into 2025, Lennox is prepared for growth acceleration in several areas. Our up-to-dated go-to-market sales strategy will increase our growth capacity and grow our core dealer base with a renewed focus on premium margin products. As we highlighted earlier, we anticipate accelerated share gain during the upcoming refrigerant change. Our technology advantage in cold climate heat pump will enable additional share gain during ongoing industry electrification. While we remain committed to delivering our 2026 financial targets, we also recognize the opportunities to continue expanding shareholder value even beyond 2026. We will build upon our structural competitive advantage with an expanded distribution network to increase our North American coverage.  We will also capitalize on this expanded distribution network to expand our share of wallet through higher commercial service penetration, higher attachment rates for parts, supplies and adjacent products used by HVAC dealers. In summary, we are committed to our 2026 fiscal targets and also have a clear line of sight to strategic imperatives that will continue creating differentiated shareholder value. Now please turn to Slide 12, where I will like to recap why I believe that Lennox's structural competitive advantage is poised to deliver long-term differentiated shareholder value. Let me highlight the 5 pillars of our structural advantage. First, our direct-to-dealer model uniquely positions us to deliver accelerated growth. To capture this, we will enhance our sales go-to-market effectiveness, consistently elevate the customer experience and make necessary investments in growth capacity to meet market demand. Second, because we own our own primary distribution channel, we can deliver sustainable and resilient higher margins by leveraging scale and technology to reduce cost and increase the efficiency of our distribution network. Third, our balanced scorecard-based operating system, dual sourced supply chain and lean digital processes, deliver execution consistency throughout our operations. The fourth pillar is our advanced technology portfolio that is perfectly suited to serve the North American heating and cooling industry with environmentally sustainable innovative solutions. Finally, we have high-performance talent and culture that is nurtured by our core values and recently launched guiding behaviors. We are continuously engaged in talent development and succession planning, while diligently ensuring that our compensation structure is closely aligned to shareholder value creation. I would like to close by reaffirming my gratitude to our employees and our customers. We are proud of our accomplishments in the first half of this year and continue to believe that our best days are ahead of us. Thank you. Joe, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions now. Ashley, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.\nJeffrey Hammond: Just on commercial, I mean that the margins were just exceptional. So I just wanted to understand margin sustainability, any aberrations in the quarter? And then maybe just speak to the backlog and how much your lead times are improving versus peak and just the level of reduction that kind of contributed to the quarter?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes. From a sustainability perspective, first, the backlog remains resilient. It's down a little bit, mostly because the lead times are improving. Margins within the backlog remains strong, reflective of the margins we saw in Q2. So pricing mix is solid in that business. And again, we continue to see output coming out of the factory, which is a good sign for volume growth to continue.\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes. I think the one thing you'll see, Jeff, for the quarter, price and mix propped up the quarter. In back half of the year, you should see volume even more from the commercial segment. So we're excited about the future there. Once again, I think we've achieved getting this business back to the trajectory that it was once on and are excited about our ability to now demonstrate our trajectory of getting into our target margins by 2026.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. Great. And then just in resi, anything more than really weather that's informing kind of the lower trajectory there? And just maybe speak to how your destocking is going for your company-owned stores.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. This is Alok. Yes, listen, on resi, I don't want to talk just about weather, but we all know Q2 was softer. I think the distributor destocking was also more pronounced than we had expected. And at the end, we took our volume guide down and talking about high single digits. That's also to just reflect our learning in 6 months of the year. But as you see -- notice, we kept our revenue the same. From my perspective, our own inventory destocking is going fine. I think it will take us another 6 to 9 months to bring it down to more normal levels. And that's because internally, we are just more cautious and don't want to lay off a lot of people just to turn around and try and hire them, which we know was a struggle in the past. From what we hear from the distributors, they -- most of them expect destocking to be over by Q3. If there's a little bit that bleeds into Q4, that's likely to be seasonal products like furnaces and things that don't sell well in Q3. So that view hasn't changed for us. So overall, in resi, it's slightly worse than we had talked about last time. But within the overall guide range, we think it's similar outlook to what we previously disclosed.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc.\nThomas Moll: I wanted to follow up with one more on the resi volume trends and outlook. Are you able to share the volume trends in the quarter for direct-to-dealer versus Allied? And then you've talked on several occasions about the distributor destocking, which I would think is more an Allied-driven comment, but is there anything on a sell-through basis other than, like you said, about the cooler weather in the second quarter that's changed in terms of your outlook?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. So clearly, Allied and ADP, which makes up our indirect channel, they had significant decline. Our core Lennox business was kind of flattish, maybe slightly down in terms of units. So I mean that gives us a lot of confidence that the industry is holding quite well. And all the current softness is mostly driven by just the distributor destocking. Now you've got to ignore things like weather because June was a little colder, July is going to be a little bit harder, but that just gets washes out for the full year, Tommy. But net-net, I think overall industry is holding up well, and the current impact is almost all driven by channel destocking.\nThomas Moll: That's helpful. I also wanted to follow up on a theme you highlighted earlier, Alok, just on the accountability and growth culture that you really want to drive. Can you just bring us in a little bit more on what that means and what some of the initiatives are?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So I mean, Lennox has a great culture, as always had a great culture. For the past 5 years, we just trained for Lennox. Starting with the Marshalltown tornado, which as you saw, we finally finished the rebuilding and we never want to use the T word again in any of our conversations. Two, to COVID and many other pieces where supply chain, we got disproportionately negative impacted versus the industry because the supply chain was more reliant on China. I think in the past 5 years, we just got beaten down and started using all of those as excuses. And I think going forward, we have launched -- relaunched our core values. We have 9 guiding behaviors. You may have seen some of those posters when you were here. Each and every employee is going through a training that's going to be over the next 12 months, complete. And we really want to emphasize things such as customer experience, accountability, innovation, sustainability. And of course, that depends on where you are in the organization. But we are very pleased with the results. Employees are genuinely excited about the path forward, and everybody is ready to put the past 5 years behind us and truly embrace the next 5, 10 years.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Great numbers, guys. I wanted to ask about that refrigerant change next year. And when do you expect the mix to transition to that new refrigerants? And then what is the pricing implications of that change? When do you start to see the product transition into the channel? And is it -- do we get another lift like we did this year with this year transition in terms of average selling price and the like?\nMichael Quenzer: Gautam, this is Michael. Yes. So the transition really won't happen until pretty much January, but you will start to see in January 2025, some of that price/mix dynamic where we'll lift up the price to more than offset the cost. But really, that will be more of a 2025 impact than 2024. We'll be preparing for that through inventory preparations and transitioning and preparing the dealer network, but really no financial impact in 2025 -- or 2024.\nGautam Khanna: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the Commercial side. Where are you with respect to the emergency replacement market? Have you kind of reentered it? Do you have the capacity to do that yet? And when do you expect to?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes, Gautam, the way I would characterize that right now, we're still focused on the planned replacement and national account segment of the business. We're early innings in reengaging in emergency replacement as our factory continues to increase output. By the end of the year, we'll be more fully engaged in that, but it's early innings right now, and that remains a significant upside opportunity for us going forward.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.\nNicole DeBlase: So just maybe on the revised full year guidance. So I think you're kind of implying that sub-50% of earnings going to come in the second half now. And typically, that's more like 55% in the second half. So just trying to understand like the dynamics between potential conservatism in the guidance or something that we should be factoring in from one half, as you have?\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes. I think once again, Nicole, we've been accused of being conservative in the past. And I think even though we've had a strong first half, there still remains some uncertainty around the economy and certain Residential end markets, whether it's certainly cooperating now, it tempered second quarter results a little bit, and you saw that in our commentary about our Residential segment. But going forward, once again, I think we probably have upside in the number. But once again, we're going to be cautiously optimistic as we move forward.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. That's clear. And then with respect to the Resi margins. So I guess, normally, margins are kind of flattish sequentially between 2Q and 3Q from a seasonal perspective. Do you guys see opportunity to improve Resi margins as we move into the third quarter because of some of those specific headwinds that you called out on the call related to 2Q?\nAlok Maskara: Nicole, this is Alok. On the Resi margins, I was disappointed on where the margins turned out to be. So while we understand the seasonal trend, and I don't want to bake up a lot of upside in the model. From my perspective, Resi margins have a lot more room for the upside. If you think about just the things we talked about, we need to get more manufactured margin and distributor margin to have margin performance that's much, much higher than where we are today. So I think there's a lot of room. Our pricing excellence initiative which only starts in Q3, from delivering results perspective, is going to have a benefit. Right now, the factories are building less than we are selling. So there's a clear negative absorption impact, which is going to last through the year. So we think margins are going up in the second half, and then I think same will continue in 2024 as well.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Ryan Merkel with William Blair.\nRyan Merkel: I wanted to follow up on the Commercial margin. Joe, you said it was price/mix. I think that boosted the quarter. It seems like the second half, the guidance is more like EBIT margins in the 15, 16 range. So can you just help us bridge kind of 2Q to the second half and what's changing?\nJoseph Reitmeier: So obviously, we don't give really second half guidance, but implied in that, there is still some conservativeness. But what you really saw in the first half was a lot of carryover price benefit that we started to get in the second half last year. So you will see some more price benefit in commercial in the first half than the second half. But with that said, our backlog still has solid margins and they should reflect that way through the balance of the year.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. Makes sense. And then I had a question on Resi, just the second half sales. It seems to imply maybe down 1. And it seems like what are the big drivers? Is it destock decelerating and a bit more price? Is there anything else?\nAlok Maskara: I think those are the two right ones, Ryan, is destocking that caused most of the decline. And obviously, July weather has been a tailwind for us as we move forward. So I think those will be the 2 things I would call out.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: So I guess one thing I want to follow up on is, we talked about Commercial margins a little bit. Obviously, a big turn versus where we were a year ago. Alok, how much of what you're seeing today or what you're seeing this year is sort of a pull forward of maybe kind of the 3-year discussion that you originally laid out last year? Or you just had a plan by 12, 18 months? Is it more the price cost stuff, which maybe normalizes? Maybe walk us through that journey and how we should think about winning your progression from here?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. Last year, about this time, they were at, I think, at Ryan's conference in Chicago, and we talked about $100 million. As Joe said, we have got $220 million. What happened is the price cost turned out to be better than rest as we expected. And that's because the team did a really good job kind of getting the cost benefits, getting the right kind of negotiations and repricing some of the backlog. The upside continues from a lot of other factors, such as manufacturing. We are still below historical levels, which we talked about in terms of output. I think our factory still has a lot more room for productivity. I still feel there's a lot more opportunity for us, as Joe mentioned earlier, on getting into things like emergency replacement, which we are barely scratching the surface of. And remember, we have a second factory that we're spending money on right now with no output. So net-net, it's not necessarily kind of pull forward, I would say. It's kind of things that just went better than we had communicated. Now clearly, when we promised 3 years, for $100 million on an external basis, our internal plan called for half of that, and now we are 6 months ahead of it. We're glad to put that $100 million behind us. We would not be making a new commitment. But we talk about a long-term margin range of we've always said we want both segments to be in the 18% to 20% range on a sustainable basis. And that's what we're going to be focused on.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Okay. That's helpful. And then just transitioning to this refrigerant transitions you talked about kind of the new equipment coming out in '25. I know next year, there's a big step down in allocation for R-410A. Any sense for what you think that does to refrigerant prices or the replacement market, if folks are like, hey, this refrigerant is getting much more expensive?  Do I really want to replace something where availability is going to get tough? How do you think about that equipment transition being a couple of years away, but refrigerant gap up maybe being a little more near term, just open-ended question, anything on your mind.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. A lot in there, and I'll tell you, we don't have a crystal ball looking into '24 yet. Each of the things that you mentioned is true, but we don't have final price on the R-410A for next year. There's always going to be an inventory draw down that we'll have to do to make sure we're not stuck with legacy R-410A beyond what we need. And from a consumer perspective, I think this is going to be a small change. We have gone through changes before. Consumers really don't think about refrigerants. It's more going to be educating our dealers and a few consumers who are probably more well versed in this than others. So still a lot of moving pieces. Net-net, I think there's a danger of overanalyzing this because the industry is used to these changes, we are very used to this change, our dealers are now getting used to this change. I think this is going to happen more seamlessly than we all expect with some pluses and minuses.  But as Michael said earlier, we think this helps our mix up towards in '25. But some of it might start happening in '24 if the R-410A pricing is higher, and we are like forced to increase our price in conjunction. So stay tuned, lots of moving pieces, but from a product design, dealer training and truly having confidence in the transition, I think we are way ahead.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: So I guess, beating a dead horse here, but this R-454B transition. Investment spending, how does that sort of shake out through the next couple of years? I mean you talked about investment spend this year. How does that look into next year? Clearly, you don't know the mix impact that's going to be positive. But is -- from your understanding, is this an installation deadline? Or is it a production deadline? And do you think there's going to be any sort of channel impact as we transition to this new refrigerant.\nJoseph Reitmeier: Yes. I think this will be a situation where maybe a little bit different than the larger transitions we've had in the past, going back to the 10 to 13 SEER transition, which was traumatic for the industry. I don't think that's going to be anywhere near this as Alok mentioned, probably a little bit more seamless. So we'll just play it out the way it is, once again, we're in great shape. We typically do very well during these transitions because we're on the leading edge of innovation. This requires a significant investment. $50 million this year, probably $50 million next year to prepare being able to factor and processes, et cetera, to make the appropriate investments. And we've made some of those investments already. And as Alok mentioned, are ahead of things. This usually creates opportunities for us. There's typically 1 or 2 competitors that stumble, and they lease some share on the Street. So once again, we're well positioned for this transition. We're excited about what lies in front of us. And we typically win when these things come to fruition. So we're excited about what this brings forward to us.\nAlok Maskara: And Nigel, just to add to that, it's a manufacturing date transition. But as Joe said, we don't expect significant inventory burn because the 410 is more expensive next year, the delta between a 2024 price and a 2025 price might be just like a normal price difference year-over-year. And I just don't think that's going to make a meaningful difference toward dealers' economic calculations.\nNigel Coe: I was just wondering, are contractors as excited as you are about using this flammable refrigerants. It seems like there was definitely some contractors out there that might be pushing the 410A next year to customers just on that basis alone.\nAlok Maskara: There might be, and we have 10,000 dealers plus more in U.S. and we can't control. But I think overall, I think the flammability concerns a little overblown. I mean if you take a candle and blow the refrigerant on it, the candle extinguishes versus catch on fire. So this is not as flammable as like some people might fear. We have done lots of internal testing and the safety mechanisms are solid. So I think from that perspective, I believe majority of the contractors will come along with us to say, hey, this is a safe product. This is a good product, and we'll follow the rules and make the transition seamless.\nNigel Coe: Okay. I appreciate that, Alok. And so a quick one, just to clarify the distribution network expansion. Is that primarily Lennox store expansions? Or are you looking at -- or do you think it's been more on the independent channels?\nAlok Maskara: It's both. I think the way we look at it is we are underpenetrated in both. On our stores, our recent focus is more around increasing output through the current stores and putting more products through that, but we are still geographically underpenetrated in North America. And on independent distributors, of course, we have a very low share. So both of those, I think we have significant expansion opportunities. Once we get through our self-help, once we get through our growth acceleration and put the right amount of feet on the street and the process behind that. We're super excited about the expansion phase.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nCharles Tusa: So just on the commercial side, so the -- I know there's like differences in comps and things like that, but Carrier reported very, very strong volume. You guys, I think, were up like 3%. You mentioned you still have yet to reenter emergency replacement. But where do you think the differences between your growth rate and theirs and anything vertical specific to talk about?\nMichael Quenzer: Steve, this is Michael. Yes. So we saw total volumes up 4%. But if you look at the rooftop production out of our Stuttgart factory. That was up significantly more. So we're pleased to see that side of it. We had some obviously offsets in different products, but definitely some growth more than the 4% coming out of our Stuttgart factory. A lot of that growth that we saw on the rooftops was on the national accounts, and it was really broad-based across retail and restaurants and distributions that really saw that broad-based growth. From an emergency replacement, although it's small, we did see a little bit of growth in the quarter, but still very small. So it's a good start to that journey as we move back into that space.\nAlok Maskara: And I think I would start -- also say that, hey, congratulations to the Carrier team. I haven't digested the earnings, but great growth for them, and we are excited that the industry growth trend continues, and the industry overall is in good shape. I think that bodes well for us and for them. We still remain production-constrained where we are producing less than we confirmed. So excited about continued output increase in Stuttgart and our new factory in Mexico.\nCharles Tusa: And then just on this, since you're kind of delving into the technology here, you talked about it not being that big of a change, I think, in December, you said you now have -- I mean, you just chose your refrigerant, I guess, is what you're saying. What's the source of confidence that your technology is so much better than the other guys?  And also, why do you think you're entitled to share gains? In the last couple of years, it's been very choppy, obviously, with what's happened. A little bit of a different approach on initiatives relative to what the former CEO did over a 10-year period, a little bit different of a market like what -- where do you think your product is so differentiated versus the other guys?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. A couple of things, right? First of all, for the past 5 years, as I said, Lennox was in a very difficult spot because our supply chain was more constrained versus others because we are more reliant on China than others. The tornadoes severely crimped our manufacturing ability, especially for the premium products. And I think the transition on leadership and CEO that obviously, while it doesn't have a direct impact, had lots of indirect impacts. So -- but that's not important right now. What's more important is your question of why are we confident. I think our direct-to-dealer network is something that we have under leveraged, but have done a great job building up. So I think that's -- the investment that still needs to continue delivering results for a while. Technology-wise, I mean, even in the current SEER transition, there was a lot of noise about compatibility of indoor units versus the outdoor units. A lot of new homebuilders they put indoor units first and then they put outdoor units. During the year transition, they have to go rip out indoor units if the indoor units were the older SEER compatible and outdoor units were new SEER. Ours' didn't have to make that difference because our indoor units were compatible both with the new SEER and the old SEER.  So the connection to the dealer we have, that helps us make those kind of choices and decisions. At the end, I can't tell you that our compressor is better than our competitive compressor because you buy it from the same place usually. But what we can tell you is our product design, our actual package and the choices we made for our dealers, that's what helps us gain share. The results would be probably more convincing than any of my answers. So let's wait a year or 2 and then we'll answer this question with numbers.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague: Look, you probably accused us of overanalyzing stuff, but that is what we do. So I appreciate Joe's comments on reiterating kind of the investment for the transition. It sounds like you clearly know what you need to do. So I think Mike kind of left Gautam's question somewhat unanswered in terms of what's your best guess on the increase in cost or selling price to customers in 2025 on the transition?\nAlok Maskara: I think the -- well, fair enough, I'll try and give more detail of it. Part of it is we don't know exact numbers. I can give you ranges. So there's 2 things to think about. The price increase from current prices, like 2023 to 2025, and then price increase from potential 2024 price to 2025. The reason we are hesitant to answer that question is not that we are trying to be evasive, but we don't know the 2024 pricing, which could get significantly impacted by R-410 production curtailment that's going on. I don't think it's going to be 20%. I just give you some ranges. I don't think it's 0% either. It's likely to be between 0% and 10%, putting everything together. And that's just going to help us all preserve our margins and pass on the cost through. Going back to the over analyzing, it was actually one of the research report, which says the HVAC industry has become like analyzing storms in a teacup. So I'm not -- I actually enjoyed reading all of this, and I think I've learned a lot in my one year. And I think what we have learned is that Lennox is going to win because of our direct-to-dealer network, because we need to leverage that better, because we are really focused on one thing and only one thing, and because we are able to design our products. Just recently, we got the design awards, and we won more awards than others. So I think that's what I've learned more is that everything else matters, but we all do it about the same. What differentiates Lennox is what was in the last page of my presentation.\nJeffrey Sprague: Yes. That 0% to 10% is from '23 to '25 though, just to put that finer point on it? Or is it...\nAlok Maskara: If you're not going to hold me to it, yes.\nJeffrey Sprague: Yes. And then just a separate question. I know Joe likes to kind of link and not and yet we're conservative. But I mean, realistically, guys, like you're going to be at your 2026 guide this year, right? You're going to be at the midpoint of it, roughly. So clearly, you're signaling you think there's upside to that. But also, are you in fact signaling that maybe there's heavier investment to drive growth and therefore, we shouldn't kind of extrapolate too aggressively on margins from here. Maybe just give us a little bit more context on how you're thinking about that.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. I think the reason I talked about the third phase of the transformation, which is beyond '26, is yes, there is a high chance that we will get to the '26 targets sooner. I won't commit to this year or next year because, I mean, our actions remain the same. So I think that's one. On the conservatism side, listen, there are so many things that could go wrong. And historically, it has gone wrong for us in the past. So we just want to make sure that if we are wrong, we are going to be wrong on the conservative side versus being wrong on the aggressive side. On the investment questions, no, I think, I mean our current investment rate is kind of what we expect going forward. I mean CapEx will go down going forward for sure, as the second factory is the heavy lift this year. And a lot of those refrigerant change investment is happening this year and some will happen next year. So no. And some of this is also we are lapping ourselves on incentives, on much lower incentive payouts last year. Last year, our incentives were below target. This year, at least current math shows it will be above target. So that's where the corporate cost delta you see. But net-net, we are optimistic, and we hope to get to the 2026 targets sooner, but we know we'll get there to 2026, by sure.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: Maybe just to better understand the revised price/mix, EBIT outlook of $250 million benefit. You've already done $182 million, right, year-to-date. So maybe if you can help us understand the dynamics for the rest of the year. It seems like maybe a little bit less benefit in commercial because the carryover is easing, but I mean Resi is clipping along at kind of this $40 million per quarter run rate, you just implemented PI. So just help us understand that revised guide?\nMichael Quenzer: Noah, it's Michael. Yes. One of the big drivers is, as you mentioned, the carryover benefit of Commercial. So that's the odd sized difference between first half and second half. But with that said, we do have a little bit of conservativeness, as Alok said some of that would be in the price/mix category. But really, what we're focused on is the pricing excellence in Residential is new price increase that was just announced that will start to happen in the second half. And again, margins look good in the Commercial backlog. So everything looks positive for the second half on price/mix still, but guide may be a little conservative.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. Just to double click on that, I mean how do we think about the incremental benefit of that price increase in Resi side?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes. So in the last quarter, we raised our price/mix guide from $150 million to $175 million, the $25 million reflected that additional residential price increase. We already had in the previous $175 million guide.\nNoah Kaye: Okay.\nMichael Quenzer: So that's progressing well.\nNoah Kaye: And then on the Saltillo expansion, just can you give us an update on how the timetable there looks. And then just sort of remind us or dimension for us how much that increases Commercial's revenue capacity.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. Yes, just before the -- 15 minutes before the call, I was with the Commercial team, congratulating them on an excellent quarter, and I saw latest video feed and pictures of the Saltillo factory construction. The ground is all prepared. We have roof going up in portions of the business. We are hiring talent, some are being redeployed from our residential factory in Saltillo. Clearly, we are well on the way of ordering equipment given some of the extended lead time. So all indications are green and solid that we will be starting production end of next year. Nameplate capacity wise, over years, it could more than double our capacity. But at the same time, we're not going to put all the equipment immediately, right? We're going to get enough land and roof space to put more, but we're going to put equipment on a judicial basis. And the last thing we want is the industry to have overcapacity on this as well. So we're going to watch out. And as Joe mentioned earlier, this would be focused around standard products shipped by the truckload, getting into the emergency replacement, where our revenue is below what it used to be and our share is just dismally low. And we have a huge opportunity to use our distribution network to increase that number. So we are very excited and all systems go there.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoseph Ritchie: So maybe just along the lines of Jeff's question earlier and just trying to think about these commercial margins. I know that it was only just a few months ago that you gave us that 19% to 21% long-term target. But first half of the year, you guys are already there and actually slightly above it. I'm just curious, like how do you kind of think about the trajectory of the margins then from here after that business, maybe even beyond 2023.\nAlok Maskara: I think our next Investor Day is going to be 2024, and we love to update you on our long-term targets. There's a lot going well, but I keep in mind that a lot could go wrong as well. I think one quarter doesn't make a trend. I mean it's a great sign of our progress. I think the team has done an excellent job, but we need to leave some room for things could slide different ways. Net-net, listen, we are not doubting anything you're saying. I think we need to be cautious and not get ahead of ourselves in where we are in the journey.\nJoseph Ritchie: Yes. No, that's fair. And look, it's a good position to be in -- to be able to already -- be ready to update those targets. So congrats on the progress there. I guess maybe my quick follow-on question. The piece of your business, the quarter of your business that goes through independent distribution. I think you guys said it was down 20%. How much were volumes down versus the pricing that came through in that business?\nAlok Maskara: Well, volume on that one is a little messy because remember, we sell a lot of coils in that business. So I think that kind of often skews the volume number for us in a negative way. But in general, I would say they were more -- they were slightly better than what you would look at on the AHRI data. I mean you guys all look at the AHRI data. So I think we did better than what you saw in the AHRI data, but slightly better.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.\nJoseph O'Dea: I wanted to just start on the Commercial manufacturing, you've sort of noted that there are still further manufacturing improvements to make in the back half of the year. Any details around that, that you could outline for us any major sort of goalposts there? And what's the time line for when you expect factory output to hit targeted levels?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. You did a very good question on that. Listen, when we started the year, we hardly had any production in January because we were taking some drastic improvement actions. We rationalized 65% of our SKUs. We looked at different lines and reconfigure the line to make the products that give us the best way to serve our customers. So starting from almost 0 in January until the end of the first half, we have reached progressively higher numbers and are starting to hit daily rates that are kind of consistent with what the factory used to do in the past. I think of first half as kind of in a linear progression from 0 to getting to the rate and second half, I think that we've got to obviously maintain rate and continue driving the improvements going forward. The team is doing well there. I mean, our labor challenges are behind us. We are no longer struggling to track labor. I would say, supplier challenges are kind of 75%, 80% behind us.  We still feel like we are playing whac-a-mole sometime, but we have done a good job at getting dual source supplier or working with our suppliers to better communicate and build the appropriate buffer and transportation. So things are going well. It could go better the way I look at it.\nJoseph O'Dea: Got it. That's helpful. And then just circling back to the 25.3% commercial margin, how does that compare to kind of internal expectations for the quarter? And then when we think about seasonality going forward, I mean, any sort of variances to be mindful of versus typical seasonality in the back half?\nAlok Maskara: Yes, I could tell you my answer, but I'll hand it over to Michael to answer the rest. Yes, listen, my expectations are always higher than the team delivers. So put that aside, like I think Michael can give you a better answer on that.\nMichael Quenzer: Obviously, the speed of the recovery is a little faster than expected and a lot of this on the price/mix benefits that we're pleased to see that side of it. But it was a little better than what we had expected, mostly just because of the price/mix speed of recovery that we saw.\nJoseph Reitmeier: And then on the seasonality that you inquired about, there's always a natural choppiness in the commercial business because of a lot of its project nature. It doesn't really have the perfect seasonality that we sometimes see in our residential demand patterns. So I'll just leave that out there. Sometimes the second quarter can be a little bit more of a leading quarter for us than the third quarter, but it all depends on projects.\nJoseph O'Dea: But nothing non-repeat really in the quarter to be mindful of in terms of sort of comp into the back half?\nJoseph Reitmeier: No.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: For anyone overly sensitive, definitely, the tea cup comments were not meant to denigrate diligent work. In terms of, I suppose, sort of diving in on the...\nAlok Maskara: Julian, I sort of enjoyed that comment, and I used that offense. I thought it was a great way to look at bigger picture, while continuing to analyze the storm in a tea cup.\nJulian Mitchell: Yes, we'll see how the Resi cliff plays out, I suppose. But the -- in the very, very short term, are we sort of -- kind of it was in 2025. But are we trying to think about Resi HVAC volumes in your guide, you're assuming sort of down low double-digit third quarter and then down sort of low singles in the fourth quarter. Is that the way to think about it year-on-year?\nAlok Maskara: On the indirect side, maybe, but no, not on the overall basis, our volumes are not down that much. And I know if you look at the current bridge and we showed 12% on the Resi side, Julian. And you got to keep in mind, that's probably the worst that you would see during the year. As we go toward Q3, we think the number just gets better from there on.\nJulian Mitchell: Okay. So even with the destocking in Q3, it's still a narrower year-on-year decline then?\nAlok Maskara: Exactly, exactly. So I think some destocking start happening in Q3, very little. And we do think destocking is decelerating, as we mentioned in the comment. So I would look at that number being much lower in Q3 and then Q4.\nJulian Mitchell: That's perfect. And then I just wanted to put a finer point on the core sales guide of sort of up 3% total company for the year. Did you clarify the price/mix tailwind within that? I see the price/mix EBIT guided benefit, but just wondered if you clarified any revenue benefit from price/mix in that sales guide?\nAlok Maskara: We did not. I think a lot of that is -- there are so many different types of mix in there. I mean we look at channel mix, we look at products like equipment versus parts versus coil. We look at, obviously, mix based on the SEER. We did say that about half of the mix benefit in residential was because of SEER and the other half was all the other factors in there. So still a lot of uncertainty out there, but we are pleased with where we are in July.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And one last quick one. Commercial backlog, how do you see that moving from here? I understand that lead times should normalize. Does that put much pressure on the backlog or the end markets are sort of strong enough it should stay stable?\nMichael Quenzer: Julian, this is Michael. Yes. So we saw our lead times improved 50%, and obviously, our backlog didn't decline that much. So order rates continue to remain strong. Everything we see on plan, replacement for national accounts still remains strong. So really no indication yet of a backlog decline except for just because of lead times are shortening.\nOperator: Thank you for joining us today. Since there are no further questions, this will conclude Lennox's Second Quarter Conference Call. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alok Maskara",
            "content": "Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning, everyone. I am delighted to share our impressive results from the recent quarter ending on June 30, during which we delivered record revenues, record profit, record EPS, record margins and record cash flow. These results demonstrate the power of our focused growth strategy and the progress of our commercial turnaround plan. I am grateful to our dealers and customers for their continued loyalty towards our products and services as we remain committed to further improving our service levels and enhancing their customer experience. I'm also thankful for the dedication and hard work of my 13,000 Lennox colleagues, whose relentless efforts have contributed to our outstanding performance this quarter. This successful quarter demonstrates the power of our laser-focused strategy, which builds on our existing strong direct customer relationships, advanced products platform and our unique distribution network. These factors will continue to fuel our share gain and margin expansion for the foreseeable future. Now I want to discuss some key highlights of the quarter on Slide 3. First, core revenues grew 3% and our adjusted segment margin expanded 320 basis points to 20.9%, resulting in our adjusted earnings per share, increasing 22% to $6.15. Additionally, our operating cash flow increased nearly 100% to $196 million. Second, we are extremely proud of our commercial team's execution of our profitable growth strategy. Both revenue and profits for the Commercial segment hit a record this quarter, driven by favorable price/mix and improved production output from our Stuttgart manufacturing location. Third, residential end markets were challenging, which resulted in our Residential segment, delivering lower revenue, margins and profits. Margins were also impacted by lower factory output and absorption as we normalize our own inventory levels, post the SEER transition. We remain cautiously optimistic about the second half, as we believe that the industry's inventory rightsizing is decelerating. In addition, our recent price increase will enable us to deliver improved margin performance during the balance of the year. Fourth and finally on this page, we are pleased to share the revised fiscal guidance for this year as we anticipate higher revenues, higher earnings per share and higher operating cash flow for the full year. Joe will review the revised guidance in greater depth later in the call. Now, please turn to Slide 4 for our view on the current business conditions impacting the industry. For the residential end market, we experienced higher-than-expected distributor destocking and a cooler start to the summer selling season. We are now anticipating unit volumes for the full year to decline by high single digits versus prior expectation of a mid-single-digit decline. Looking at the second half, we expect the impact of distributor destocking to diminish and we have started to see an uptick in our replacement sales, consistent with higher temperatures. In Commercial, we now anticipate sales to be up low double digits for the full year versus prior expectations of high single digits to low double-digit sales increase. The order backlog remains strong, and although delivery lead times remain extended, they are 50% lower than last year and in line with the industry. Regarding price versus inflation, we are pleased to report that the industry pricing remains disciplined and our own mid-year price increase has been broadly successful. Our outlook on both components and commodity cost inflation remains stable and unchanged, and we expect the second half of the year to deliver a positive price versus inflation spread. Ultimately, our improved service levels and increased commercial production gives us confidence that we are well positioned to gain share in the second half of this year. We continue to invest SG&A dollars towards improving our go-to-market processes, while deploying incremental frontline resources to win over more dealers and more key accounts. We believe that Lennox outperformed the industry in successfully launching the product portfolio to meet the new minimum efficiency standards, gaining further loyalty from customers and our dealers. During future regulatory transitions, including the upcoming low GWP refrigerant requirements on January 1, 2025, Lennox aims to deliver similar outperformance and capture additional share. Please turn to Slide 5 for more details regarding ongoing Lennox activities related to the upcoming refrigerant transition. We are pleased to announce that Lennox will transition to R-454B from R-410A refrigerant to meet the EPA requirement effective January 1, 2025. The R-454B choice was driven by our commitment to provide the best option for our valued customers and the environment. Compared to the existing 410A refrigerant, R-454B reduces greenhouse gas emissions and is approximately 80% less global warming potential. Lennox has demonstrated a solid track record of successfully navigating regulatory changes and this will be no exception. We have completed most product redesign and are now in the testing phase for this transition. The redesign includes updated compressors and other components for refrigerant compatibility and high efficiency performance. To address safety requirements for the new A2L refrigerate, we will have additional safeguards on all our products that use this refrigerant. These safeguards may include sensors, controls and algorithms which will mitigate any leaks if and when they occur. Safety of all our products remains our highest priority, and our redesign will meet or exceed applicable safety standards. As you know, Lennox has a structural advantage of primarily selling direct to dealers. This enables our team to deliver advanced training to deliverers and equip them with accurate information to share with the end consumers. This helps us and our dealers to win during the regulatory transition, while addressing all the safety requirements for manufacturing, distribution and installation. Throughout this transition, we do not expect a significant inventory prebuild as the transition to R-454B would likely happen faster compared to similar refrigerant transitions in the past. We intend to deliver a safe, seamless transition, supported by appropriate inventory levels. By maintaining strong relationships and timely communications with our suppliers, we will avoid supply chain disruptions. While we are still reviewing this transition's financial impact, we expect it to be neutral or accretive to our margins. We are confident that the increase in the product cost will be offset by price. Overall, we anticipate that once again, we will outperform the industry and garner additional loyalty from our dealers and customers during this refrigerant transition. Now let me hand the call over to Joe, who will take us through the details of our Q2 financial performance. Thanks, Joe. In addition to solid short-term results, we are also making significant progress towards transforming the company for longer-term shareholder value expansion. Last quarter, we shared the key initiatives that pave a clear path towards our 2026 financial targets. Today, we would like to share 3 transformation phases that would clarify the execution time frame of those initiatives. Collectively, these initiatives will deliver on the 2026 targets and set up Lennox for even longer-term value creation. We are currently in the self-help phase of the plan, which delivers execution consistency to our customers and shareholders. We have already demonstrated success in our commercial recovery and portfolio simplification initiatives. Our pricing excellence initiative will drive favorable margins through improved price setting, getting and netting. We are strengthening our core foundation by enhancing talent and reinforcing culture with an emphasis on accountability. This stronger foundation will serve as a springboard for accelerated growth in 2025 and beyond. Looking into 2025, Lennox is prepared for growth acceleration in several areas. Our up-to-dated go-to-market sales strategy will increase our growth capacity and grow our core dealer base with a renewed focus on premium margin products. As we highlighted earlier, we anticipate accelerated share gain during the upcoming refrigerant change. Our technology advantage in cold climate heat pump will enable additional share gain during ongoing industry electrification. While we remain committed to delivering our 2026 financial targets, we also recognize the opportunities to continue expanding shareholder value even beyond 2026. We will build upon our structural competitive advantage with an expanded distribution network to increase our North American coverage.  We will also capitalize on this expanded distribution network to expand our share of wallet through higher commercial service penetration, higher attachment rates for parts, supplies and adjacent products used by HVAC dealers. In summary, we are committed to our 2026 fiscal targets and also have a clear line of sight to strategic imperatives that will continue creating differentiated shareholder value. Now please turn to Slide 12, where I will like to recap why I believe that Lennox's structural competitive advantage is poised to deliver long-term differentiated shareholder value. Let me highlight the 5 pillars of our structural advantage. First, our direct-to-dealer model uniquely positions us to deliver accelerated growth. To capture this, we will enhance our sales go-to-market effectiveness, consistently elevate the customer experience and make necessary investments in growth capacity to meet market demand. Second, because we own our own primary distribution channel, we can deliver sustainable and resilient higher margins by leveraging scale and technology to reduce cost and increase the efficiency of our distribution network. Third, our balanced scorecard-based operating system, dual sourced supply chain and lean digital processes, deliver execution consistency throughout our operations. The fourth pillar is our advanced technology portfolio that is perfectly suited to serve the North American heating and cooling industry with environmentally sustainable innovative solutions. Finally, we have high-performance talent and culture that is nurtured by our core values and recently launched guiding behaviors. We are continuously engaged in talent development and succession planning, while diligently ensuring that our compensation structure is closely aligned to shareholder value creation. I would like to close by reaffirming my gratitude to our employees and our customers. We are proud of our accomplishments in the first half of this year and continue to believe that our best days are ahead of us. Thank you. Joe, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions now. Ashley, let's go to Q&A. Sure. This is Alok. Yes, listen, on resi, I don't want to talk just about weather, but we all know Q2 was softer. I think the distributor destocking was also more pronounced than we had expected. And at the end, we took our volume guide down and talking about high single digits. That's also to just reflect our learning in 6 months of the year. But as you see -- notice, we kept our revenue the same. From my perspective, our own inventory destocking is going fine. I think it will take us another 6 to 9 months to bring it down to more normal levels. And that's because internally, we are just more cautious and don't want to lay off a lot of people just to turn around and try and hire them, which we know was a struggle in the past. From what we hear from the distributors, they -- most of them expect destocking to be over by Q3. If there's a little bit that bleeds into Q4, that's likely to be seasonal products like furnaces and things that don't sell well in Q3. So that view hasn't changed for us. So overall, in resi, it's slightly worse than we had talked about last time. But within the overall guide range, we think it's similar outlook to what we previously disclosed. Yes. So clearly, Allied and ADP, which makes up our indirect channel, they had significant decline. Our core Lennox business was kind of flattish, maybe slightly down in terms of units. So I mean that gives us a lot of confidence that the industry is holding quite well. And all the current softness is mostly driven by just the distributor destocking. Now you've got to ignore things like weather because June was a little colder, July is going to be a little bit harder, but that just gets washes out for the full year, Tommy. But net-net, I think overall industry is holding up well, and the current impact is almost all driven by channel destocking. Sure. So I mean, Lennox has a great culture, as always had a great culture. For the past 5 years, we just trained for Lennox. Starting with the Marshalltown tornado, which as you saw, we finally finished the rebuilding and we never want to use the T word again in any of our conversations. Two, to COVID and many other pieces where supply chain, we got disproportionately negative impacted versus the industry because the supply chain was more reliant on China. I think in the past 5 years, we just got beaten down and started using all of those as excuses. And I think going forward, we have launched -- relaunched our core values. We have 9 guiding behaviors. You may have seen some of those posters when you were here. Each and every employee is going through a training that's going to be over the next 12 months, complete. And we really want to emphasize things such as customer experience, accountability, innovation, sustainability. And of course, that depends on where you are in the organization. But we are very pleased with the results. Employees are genuinely excited about the path forward, and everybody is ready to put the past 5 years behind us and truly embrace the next 5, 10 years. Nicole, this is Alok. On the Resi margins, I was disappointed on where the margins turned out to be. So while we understand the seasonal trend, and I don't want to bake up a lot of upside in the model. From my perspective, Resi margins have a lot more room for the upside. If you think about just the things we talked about, we need to get more manufactured margin and distributor margin to have margin performance that's much, much higher than where we are today. So I think there's a lot of room. Our pricing excellence initiative which only starts in Q3, from delivering results perspective, is going to have a benefit. Right now, the factories are building less than we are selling. So there's a clear negative absorption impact, which is going to last through the year. So we think margins are going up in the second half, and then I think same will continue in 2024 as well. I think those are the two right ones, Ryan, is destocking that caused most of the decline. And obviously, July weather has been a tailwind for us as we move forward. So I think those will be the 2 things I would call out. Sure. Last year, about this time, they were at, I think, at Ryan's conference in Chicago, and we talked about $100 million. As Joe said, we have got $220 million. What happened is the price cost turned out to be better than rest as we expected. And that's because the team did a really good job kind of getting the cost benefits, getting the right kind of negotiations and repricing some of the backlog. The upside continues from a lot of other factors, such as manufacturing. We are still below historical levels, which we talked about in terms of output. I think our factory still has a lot more room for productivity. I still feel there's a lot more opportunity for us, as Joe mentioned earlier, on getting into things like emergency replacement, which we are barely scratching the surface of. And remember, we have a second factory that we're spending money on right now with no output. So net-net, it's not necessarily kind of pull forward, I would say. It's kind of things that just went better than we had communicated. Now clearly, when we promised 3 years, for $100 million on an external basis, our internal plan called for half of that, and now we are 6 months ahead of it. We're glad to put that $100 million behind us. We would not be making a new commitment. But we talk about a long-term margin range of we've always said we want both segments to be in the 18% to 20% range on a sustainable basis. And that's what we're going to be focused on. Sure. A lot in there, and I'll tell you, we don't have a crystal ball looking into '24 yet. Each of the things that you mentioned is true, but we don't have final price on the R-410A for next year. There's always going to be an inventory draw down that we'll have to do to make sure we're not stuck with legacy R-410A beyond what we need. And from a consumer perspective, I think this is going to be a small change. We have gone through changes before. Consumers really don't think about refrigerants. It's more going to be educating our dealers and a few consumers who are probably more well versed in this than others. So still a lot of moving pieces. Net-net, I think there's a danger of overanalyzing this because the industry is used to these changes, we are very used to this change, our dealers are now getting used to this change. I think this is going to happen more seamlessly than we all expect with some pluses and minuses.  But as Michael said earlier, we think this helps our mix up towards in '25. But some of it might start happening in '24 if the R-410A pricing is higher, and we are like forced to increase our price in conjunction. So stay tuned, lots of moving pieces, but from a product design, dealer training and truly having confidence in the transition, I think we are way ahead. And Nigel, just to add to that, it's a manufacturing date transition. But as Joe said, we don't expect significant inventory burn because the 410 is more expensive next year, the delta between a 2024 price and a 2025 price might be just like a normal price difference year-over-year. And I just don't think that's going to make a meaningful difference toward dealers' economic calculations. There might be, and we have 10,000 dealers plus more in U.S. and we can't control. But I think overall, I think the flammability concerns a little overblown. I mean if you take a candle and blow the refrigerant on it, the candle extinguishes versus catch on fire. So this is not as flammable as like some people might fear. We have done lots of internal testing and the safety mechanisms are solid. So I think from that perspective, I believe majority of the contractors will come along with us to say, hey, this is a safe product. This is a good product, and we'll follow the rules and make the transition seamless. It's both. I think the way we look at it is we are underpenetrated in both. On our stores, our recent focus is more around increasing output through the current stores and putting more products through that, but we are still geographically underpenetrated in North America. And on independent distributors, of course, we have a very low share. So both of those, I think we have significant expansion opportunities. Once we get through our self-help, once we get through our growth acceleration and put the right amount of feet on the street and the process behind that. We're super excited about the expansion phase. And I think I would start -- also say that, hey, congratulations to the Carrier team. I haven't digested the earnings, but great growth for them, and we are excited that the industry growth trend continues, and the industry overall is in good shape. I think that bodes well for us and for them. We still remain production-constrained where we are producing less than we confirmed. So excited about continued output increase in Stuttgart and our new factory in Mexico. Sure. A couple of things, right? First of all, for the past 5 years, as I said, Lennox was in a very difficult spot because our supply chain was more constrained versus others because we are more reliant on China than others. The tornadoes severely crimped our manufacturing ability, especially for the premium products. And I think the transition on leadership and CEO that obviously, while it doesn't have a direct impact, had lots of indirect impacts. So -- but that's not important right now. What's more important is your question of why are we confident. I think our direct-to-dealer network is something that we have under leveraged, but have done a great job building up. So I think that's -- the investment that still needs to continue delivering results for a while. Technology-wise, I mean, even in the current SEER transition, there was a lot of noise about compatibility of indoor units versus the outdoor units. A lot of new homebuilders they put indoor units first and then they put outdoor units. During the year transition, they have to go rip out indoor units if the indoor units were the older SEER compatible and outdoor units were new SEER. Ours' didn't have to make that difference because our indoor units were compatible both with the new SEER and the old SEER.  So the connection to the dealer we have, that helps us make those kind of choices and decisions. At the end, I can't tell you that our compressor is better than our competitive compressor because you buy it from the same place usually. But what we can tell you is our product design, our actual package and the choices we made for our dealers, that's what helps us gain share. The results would be probably more convincing than any of my answers. So let's wait a year or 2 and then we'll answer this question with numbers. I think the -- well, fair enough, I'll try and give more detail of it. Part of it is we don't know exact numbers. I can give you ranges. So there's 2 things to think about. The price increase from current prices, like 2023 to 2025, and then price increase from potential 2024 price to 2025. The reason we are hesitant to answer that question is not that we are trying to be evasive, but we don't know the 2024 pricing, which could get significantly impacted by R-410 production curtailment that's going on. I don't think it's going to be 20%. I just give you some ranges. I don't think it's 0% either. It's likely to be between 0% and 10%, putting everything together. And that's just going to help us all preserve our margins and pass on the cost through. Going back to the over analyzing, it was actually one of the research report, which says the HVAC industry has become like analyzing storms in a teacup. So I'm not -- I actually enjoyed reading all of this, and I think I've learned a lot in my one year. And I think what we have learned is that Lennox is going to win because of our direct-to-dealer network, because we need to leverage that better, because we are really focused on one thing and only one thing, and because we are able to design our products. Just recently, we got the design awards, and we won more awards than others. So I think that's what I've learned more is that everything else matters, but we all do it about the same. What differentiates Lennox is what was in the last page of my presentation. If you're not going to hold me to it, yes. Sure. I think the reason I talked about the third phase of the transformation, which is beyond '26, is yes, there is a high chance that we will get to the '26 targets sooner. I won't commit to this year or next year because, I mean, our actions remain the same. So I think that's one. On the conservatism side, listen, there are so many things that could go wrong. And historically, it has gone wrong for us in the past. So we just want to make sure that if we are wrong, we are going to be wrong on the conservative side versus being wrong on the aggressive side. On the investment questions, no, I think, I mean our current investment rate is kind of what we expect going forward. I mean CapEx will go down going forward for sure, as the second factory is the heavy lift this year. And a lot of those refrigerant change investment is happening this year and some will happen next year. So no. And some of this is also we are lapping ourselves on incentives, on much lower incentive payouts last year. Last year, our incentives were below target. This year, at least current math shows it will be above target. So that's where the corporate cost delta you see. But net-net, we are optimistic, and we hope to get to the 2026 targets sooner, but we know we'll get there to 2026, by sure. Sure. Yes, just before the -- 15 minutes before the call, I was with the Commercial team, congratulating them on an excellent quarter, and I saw latest video feed and pictures of the Saltillo factory construction. The ground is all prepared. We have roof going up in portions of the business. We are hiring talent, some are being redeployed from our residential factory in Saltillo. Clearly, we are well on the way of ordering equipment given some of the extended lead time. So all indications are green and solid that we will be starting production end of next year. Nameplate capacity wise, over years, it could more than double our capacity. But at the same time, we're not going to put all the equipment immediately, right? We're going to get enough land and roof space to put more, but we're going to put equipment on a judicial basis. And the last thing we want is the industry to have overcapacity on this as well. So we're going to watch out. And as Joe mentioned earlier, this would be focused around standard products shipped by the truckload, getting into the emergency replacement, where our revenue is below what it used to be and our share is just dismally low. And we have a huge opportunity to use our distribution network to increase that number. So we are very excited and all systems go there. I think our next Investor Day is going to be 2024, and we love to update you on our long-term targets. There's a lot going well, but I keep in mind that a lot could go wrong as well. I think one quarter doesn't make a trend. I mean it's a great sign of our progress. I think the team has done an excellent job, but we need to leave some room for things could slide different ways. Net-net, listen, we are not doubting anything you're saying. I think we need to be cautious and not get ahead of ourselves in where we are in the journey. Well, volume on that one is a little messy because remember, we sell a lot of coils in that business. So I think that kind of often skews the volume number for us in a negative way. But in general, I would say they were more -- they were slightly better than what you would look at on the AHRI data. I mean you guys all look at the AHRI data. So I think we did better than what you saw in the AHRI data, but slightly better. Sure. You did a very good question on that. Listen, when we started the year, we hardly had any production in January because we were taking some drastic improvement actions. We rationalized 65% of our SKUs. We looked at different lines and reconfigure the line to make the products that give us the best way to serve our customers. So starting from almost 0 in January until the end of the first half, we have reached progressively higher numbers and are starting to hit daily rates that are kind of consistent with what the factory used to do in the past. I think of first half as kind of in a linear progression from 0 to getting to the rate and second half, I think that we've got to obviously maintain rate and continue driving the improvements going forward. The team is doing well there. I mean, our labor challenges are behind us. We are no longer struggling to track labor. I would say, supplier challenges are kind of 75%, 80% behind us.  We still feel like we are playing whac-a-mole sometime, but we have done a good job at getting dual source supplier or working with our suppliers to better communicate and build the appropriate buffer and transportation. So things are going well. It could go better the way I look at it. Yes, I could tell you my answer, but I'll hand it over to Michael to answer the rest. Yes, listen, my expectations are always higher than the team delivers. So put that aside, like I think Michael can give you a better answer on that. Julian, I sort of enjoyed that comment, and I used that offense. I thought it was a great way to look at bigger picture, while continuing to analyze the storm in a tea cup. On the indirect side, maybe, but no, not on the overall basis, our volumes are not down that much. And I know if you look at the current bridge and we showed 12% on the Resi side, Julian. And you got to keep in mind, that's probably the worst that you would see during the year. As we go toward Q3, we think the number just gets better from there on. Exactly, exactly. So I think some destocking start happening in Q3, very little. And we do think destocking is decelerating, as we mentioned in the comment. So I would look at that number being much lower in Q3 and then Q4. We did not. I think a lot of that is -- there are so many different types of mix in there. I mean we look at channel mix, we look at products like equipment versus parts versus coil. We look at, obviously, mix based on the SEER. We did say that about half of the mix benefit in residential was because of SEER and the other half was all the other factors in there. So still a lot of uncertainty out there, but we are pleased with where we are in July."

            "name": "Joseph Reitmeier",
            "content": "Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. As Alok mentioned earlier, the company posted a strong revenue and earnings growth. Core revenue, which excludes our European operations was a record $1.34 billion, up 3% compared to prior year's price and mix benefits, more than offset Residential sales volume declines. Total adjusted segment profit increased $50 million or 22% versus prior year. Price and mix increased profit by $106 million and were partially offset with $43 million from lower volume and $13 million from inflationary effects and investments in distribution and SG&A. Total adjusted segment margin was 20.9%, up 320 basis points versus prior year. For the quarter, corporate expenses were $25 million, a decline of $2 million, as we continue to tightly control corporate spending. The second quarter not only achieved record levels of revenue and segment profit, but also marked record earnings per share, with GAAP earnings per share rising 23% to $6.10, and adjusted earnings per share growing by 22% to $6.15. Our record -- our second quarter tax rate was 17.6%, and diluted shares outstanding were 35.6 million compared to 35.7 million in the prior year quarter. Now turn to Slide 7. As we saw in the first quarter, industry-wide distributor destocking continued in the second quarter and the summer season began with cooler temperatures, resulting in a 12% volume decline. The volume decline was partially offset with 2% favorable price and 6% favorable mix. Our direct-to-dealer sales, which are around 75% of our segment revenues, experienced a revenue increase in the low single digits. The remaining 25% of our revenue, which goes through distributors was down approximately 20%. Residential segment profit fell 6% to $203 million, and segment margin dipped 50 basis points to 21.6%, driven primarily by lower volume, inflation effects and selling and distribution investments. The headwinds were partially offset with price increases and favorable mix, partially driven by the new minimum efficiency standards. Turning to Slide 8, and our Commercial business that delivered another quarter of exceptional results. Revenue was $408 million in the quarter, up 24%. Combined price and mix were up 22% and volume was up 4%. Commercial segment profit was $103 million, up 150% and segment margin more than doubled to 25.3%. Price and mix had an outsized impact in the quarter, delivering $66 million and the total $62 million -- of the total $62 million of the profit increase. Last year, we provided guidance on a multiyear profit opportunity of $100 million, and I'm delighted to share that our trailing 12-month segment profit has already surged by $120 million compared to the same period last year. Our rooftop production output continues to increase, and we are maintaining a robust commercial backlog, while steadily improving delivery lead times, which now align with the industry. Moving to cash flow performance and our debt to EBITDA starting on Slide 9. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $196 million compared to $97 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $49 million for the quarter, an increase of $28 million compared to the prior year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent, supporting organic growth investments like our new commercial factory in Mexico, driving industry-leading innovation and exploring potential bolt-on acquisitions. In the quarter, the company paid $38 million in dividends. Total debt was approximately $1.6 billion at the end of the quarter, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9x. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $58.6 million at the end of the quarter. Turning to Slide 10. Let's review our 2023 full year guidance. As a result of our strong first half performance, we are increasing our full year outlook. We expect core revenue to be up between 2% and 4% for the year and earnings per share of $15.50 per share to $16 per share. We are increasing our free cash flow target to a range of $300 million to $350 million. Our guidance for capital expenditures remains consistent with our prior guide at $250 million. As a reminder, that includes investment in a second commercial factory and investments related to the refrigerant transition to take effect in 2025. Price benefit is now expected to be $250 million, and we now expect net material cost to be a $25 million headwind in 2023. The material cost headwind is driven by component cost inflation of $90 million, net of $30 million in savings from cost reduction initiatives, along with the $35 million commodity cost benefit. Our new target for corporate expenses is $95 million attributable to higher incentive compensation expenses. We will continue to manage SG&A expenses tightly, while simultaneously making essential investments in the business to support growth initiatives, advance our innovative products and solutions and enhance productivity. And finally, we still expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between 35 million and 36 million shares. With that, let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll turn it back over to Alok. Yes. I think the one thing you'll see, Jeff, for the quarter, price and mix propped up the quarter. In back half of the year, you should see volume even more from the commercial segment. So we're excited about the future there. Once again, I think we've achieved getting this business back to the trajectory that it was once on and are excited about our ability to now demonstrate our trajectory of getting into our target margins by 2026. Yes, Gautam, the way I would characterize that right now, we're still focused on the planned replacement and national account segment of the business. We're early innings in reengaging in emergency replacement as our factory continues to increase output. By the end of the year, we'll be more fully engaged in that, but it's early innings right now, and that remains a significant upside opportunity for us going forward. Yes. I think once again, Nicole, we've been accused of being conservative in the past. And I think even though we've had a strong first half, there still remains some uncertainty around the economy and certain Residential end markets, whether it's certainly cooperating now, it tempered second quarter results a little bit, and you saw that in our commentary about our Residential segment. But going forward, once again, I think we probably have upside in the number. But once again, we're going to be cautiously optimistic as we move forward. So obviously, we don't give really second half guidance, but implied in that, there is still some conservativeness. But what you really saw in the first half was a lot of carryover price benefit that we started to get in the second half last year. So you will see some more price benefit in commercial in the first half than the second half. But with that said, our backlog still has solid margins and they should reflect that way through the balance of the year. Yes. I think this will be a situation where maybe a little bit different than the larger transitions we've had in the past, going back to the 10 to 13 SEER transition, which was traumatic for the industry. I don't think that's going to be anywhere near this as Alok mentioned, probably a little bit more seamless. So we'll just play it out the way it is, once again, we're in great shape. We typically do very well during these transitions because we're on the leading edge of innovation. This requires a significant investment. $50 million this year, probably $50 million next year to prepare being able to factor and processes, et cetera, to make the appropriate investments. And we've made some of those investments already. And as Alok mentioned, are ahead of things. This usually creates opportunities for us. There's typically 1 or 2 competitors that stumble, and they lease some share on the Street. So once again, we're well positioned for this transition. We're excited about what lies in front of us. And we typically win when these things come to fruition. So we're excited about what this brings forward to us. And then on the seasonality that you inquired about, there's always a natural choppiness in the commercial business because of a lot of its project nature. It doesn't really have the perfect seasonality that we sometimes see in our residential demand patterns. So I'll just leave that out there. Sometimes the second quarter can be a little bit more of a leading quarter for us than the third quarter, but it all depends on projects. No."

            "name": "Michael Quenzer",
            "content": "Yes. From a sustainability perspective, first, the backlog remains resilient. It's down a little bit, mostly because the lead times are improving. Margins within the backlog remains strong, reflective of the margins we saw in Q2. So pricing mix is solid in that business. And again, we continue to see output coming out of the factory, which is a good sign for volume growth to continue. Gautam, this is Michael. Yes. So the transition really won't happen until pretty much January, but you will start to see in January 2025, some of that price/mix dynamic where we'll lift up the price to more than offset the cost. But really, that will be more of a 2025 impact than 2024. We'll be preparing for that through inventory preparations and transitioning and preparing the dealer network, but really no financial impact in 2025 -- or 2024. Steve, this is Michael. Yes. So we saw total volumes up 4%. But if you look at the rooftop production out of our Stuttgart factory. That was up significantly more. So we're pleased to see that side of it. We had some obviously offsets in different products, but definitely some growth more than the 4% coming out of our Stuttgart factory. A lot of that growth that we saw on the rooftops was on the national accounts, and it was really broad-based across retail and restaurants and distributions that really saw that broad-based growth. From an emergency replacement, although it's small, we did see a little bit of growth in the quarter, but still very small. So it's a good start to that journey as we move back into that space. Noah, it's Michael. Yes. One of the big drivers is, as you mentioned, the carryover benefit of Commercial. So that's the odd sized difference between first half and second half. But with that said, we do have a little bit of conservativeness, as Alok said some of that would be in the price/mix category. But really, what we're focused on is the pricing excellence in Residential is new price increase that was just announced that will start to happen in the second half. And again, margins look good in the Commercial backlog. So everything looks positive for the second half on price/mix still, but guide may be a little conservative. Yes. So in the last quarter, we raised our price/mix guide from $150 million to $175 million, the $25 million reflected that additional residential price increase. We already had in the previous $175 million guide. So that's progressing well. Obviously, the speed of the recovery is a little faster than expected and a lot of this on the price/mix benefits that we're pleased to see that side of it. But it was a little better than what we had expected, mostly just because of the price/mix speed of recovery that we saw. Julian, this is Michael. Yes. So we saw our lead times improved 50%, and obviously, our backlog didn't decline that much. So order rates continue to remain strong. Everything we see on plan, replacement for national accounts still remains strong. So really no indication yet of a backlog decline except for just because of lead times are shortening."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Chelsey Pulcheon from Lennox Investor Relations team. Chelsey, please go ahead.\nChelsey Pulcheon: Thank you, Britney. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for Lennox\u2019s first quarter earnings results. I am here today with CEO, Alok Maskara; CFO, Joe Reitmeier, and VP of Finance, Michael Quenzer. Alok will discuss highlights for the quarter and Joe will take you through the company\u2019s quarterly financial performance and our view on 2023 fiscal guidance. After that, we will have a Q&A session with Alok, Joe and Michael. Turning to Slide 2, a reminder that during today\u2019s call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as outlined on this page. Please refer to our SEC filings available on our website for additional details. All comparisons mentioned today are against the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Speakers may also refer to certain non-GAAP adjusted financial measures that management may consider to be relevant indicators of underlying business performance and trends. A reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release, SEC filings and in the appendix of this presentation. The earnings release, today\u2019s presentation slides and the webcast archived link for today\u2019s call are available on our website at www.lennoxinternational.com. Now, let me turn the call over to our CEO, Alok Maskara.\nAlok Maskara: Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning and welcome everyone. Allow me to start by sharing my appreciation for all of our employees whose hard work has enabled us to deliver exceptional performance this quarter, including record quarterly earnings per share. We take great pride in our team\u2019s effort to gain share, expand margin, and seamlessly transition our product portfolio to meet the new minimum energy efficiency regulations. This successful quarter reflects our company\u2019s product leadership, strong direct customer relationships and advanced digital platforms. These factors will continue to fuel our share gain and margin expansion for the foreseeable future. I want to also take this opportunity to thank our dealers and customers for their loyalty to Lennox as we improve our service levels while delivering the best HVACR products and solutions in North America. Now please turn to Slide 3, where I want to highlight four key messages. First, Lennox is proud to report another quarter with record financial results. First quarter 2023 core revenues grew 3%. Our margin expanded 210 basis points, resulting in our adjusted EPS, increasing 15% to $2.83. Our free cash usage this quarter was $114 million, which is typical given the seasonality of our business. Second, we are pleased with the pace of margin recovery in our commercial business segment. Our profits more than doubled compared to last year as manufacturing operations stabilized and the benefit of price and mix outpaced inflationary cost increases. Third, we continue to help our dealers and customers succeed during the transition to the new minimum efficiency regulations that went into effect on January 1, 2023. Our superior design and successful track record of executing during regulatory changes, in conjunction with improved service inventory levels has put us in a strong position to gain share. Fourth, given the strong quarterly results, we remain comfortable with our previously issued full year financial guidance. We continue to closely monitor end market sentiments, track movements in commodity pricing, and execute countermeasures, including additional price increases. We are also optimizing our inventory levels, given improved lead times and current sales outlook. Now please turn to Slide 4 for our view on the current end market conditions. In the residential end market, we are experiencing destocking in our 2-step distribution channel just as we had expected. We anticipate the destocking to continue through the beginning of second half of this year. Volume in our direct-to-dealer channel was flat in Q1. However, we are expecting softness later in the year, driven by fewer new housing starts in 2022. We are closely monitoring consumer confidence for any changes that may impact the replacement versus repair decisions, but we are also encouraged by the recent improvement in the new housing starts. There is no change in our full year outlook for a mid-single-digit decline in residential unit volumes. In commercial, our backlog is strong, and our lead times have improved as the factory situation has stabilized. The industry lead time for commercial equipment remains extended due to the shortage of common components. We still believe that commercial sales will grow by high single digits this year. On the price versus inflation balance, we are price cost positive, but we are monitoring recent inflation in commodities such as steel and copper to offset the higher material cost we have implemented a targeted residential price increase that will become effective on June 18 this year. Overall, we are well positioned to gain share with our success in seamlessly transitioning to the new minimum efficiency standards and given our improved service inventory levels. In addition, we are strengthening our go-to-market organization by adding more field resources and offsetting those investments by driving back-office SG&A productivity. Now please turn to Slide 5. To accelerate our profitable growth and to expand margins, we are investing in pricing excellence at Lennox. Over the past few years, we have managed to offset inflation with price, but there remains a significant opportunity for us to refine our pricing strategy to drive greater benefits from both price and mix. We are strengthening our pricing infrastructure by increasing price analytics, engaging outside experts and further developing our internal talent. Recently, we have revised our company-wide contract signing authority to ensure appropriate scrutiny over key account pricing, and have redirected new business development on higher-margin channels and applications. We also plan to expand our rebate auditing process and take all the necessary steps to increase price netting. Another priority of ours is to work with our larger key accounts to optimize our cost to serve so that we can establish win-win partnerships. In summary, we know that pricing excellence is an important step towards Lennox regaining our competitive margin advantage. And thus, we are increasing our focus to meet or exceed our long-term margin goals. Later in the presentation, I will provide an update on our long-term goals. But for now, I\u2019m going to hand the call over to Joe Reitmeier, who will go through our first quarter financial performance.\nJoe Reitmeier: Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. Looking at the quarter for Lennox overall, the company posted strong revenue and profit growth, core revenue, which excludes our European operations was a record $990 million, up 3% compared to prior year. Both our Residential and Commercial segments experienced sales volume declines, but price execution and favorable product mix more than offset the volume headwinds. Total adjusted segment profit increased $24 million or 20% versus prior year. Price and mix exceeded product cost inflation by $63 million with partial offsets of $17 million from lower volume and $22 million for inflationary effects and investments in distribution and SG&A expenses. Total adjusted margin was 14.4%, up 210 basis points, with most of the margin expansion driven by performance in our Commercial segment. In the first quarter, corporate expenses increased $6 million to $19 million due to the timing of incentive compensation expenses. Moving on to net income and cash flow performance, starting on Slide 7. The first quarter not only achieved record levels of revenue and segment profit but also marked record earnings per share with GAAP earnings per share rising 20% to $2.75, and adjusted EPS growing by 15% to $2.83. Our first quarter adjusted net income included a 21.4% tax rate, and diluted shares outstanding were $35.6 million compared to $36.4 million in the prior year quarter. The company used $79 million of cash in operations compared to a use of $98 million in the prior year. Working capital optimization is a priority, and we remain on track to achieve our 2023 cash flow target. Capital expenditures were approximately $35 million for the quarter, an increase of $10 million compared to prior year. Capital investments will be higher this year as we fund growth and increased capacity including a new factory for our commercial business. We used $114 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $123 million in the prior year quarter. In the quarter, the company paid approximately $38 million in dividends. Total debt was $1.67 billion at the end of the quarter, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $48 million at the end of the quarter. Moving to the business segments, starting on Slide 8, where our Residential segment delivered record fourth quarter revenue. Residential revenue was flat to prior year as sales volume declines of 8%, were offset with 4% favorable price, 5% favorable mix and 1% unfavorable foreign exchange. Total sales, which go direct to dealer represent about 70% of our segment revenue and were up mid-single digits. The remaining 30% of our revenue goes through distributors where total revenues were down low teens, the result of expected industry destocking. Residential segment profit rose 3% to $111 million, a first quarter record. Segment margin expanded 50 basis points to 16.3% as continued pricing gains more than offset product cost inflation of our new minimum efficiency standard products drove favorable mix. Partially offsetting these gains were $12 million of lower volumes and $16 million from inflationary headwinds on distribution and selling and administrative expenses, where we\u2019ve made investments to fuel growth. Turning to Slide 9 in our commercial business, as announced in our last earnings call, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, the Commercial segment results will include our North American refrigeration operations. Our European operations will be reported in our Corporate and Other segment until we complete the divestiture of the European businesses. Revenue was $309 million in the quarter, up 10%. Combined price and mix were up 16% and volume was down 6%. Commercial segment profit was up 110% and segment margin expanded 770 basis points to 16.2%. We are pleased with the profit recovery in our commercial segment where price and favorable mix were the main contributors to profit growth early in the year. In the first quarter, we successfully transitioned our HVAC products to the new minimum efficiency standard, but industry-wide supply chain challenges constrained production output and continue to limit sales volumes. Demand from customers remains robust with a solid order backlog. While supply chain challenges persist, lead times to our commercial customers are shortening and are competitive with the industry. Turning to Slide 10, let\u2019s review our 2023 full year guidance. Our outlook provided on our last conference call remains unchanged. As a reminder, I will reiterate a few guidance points. We expect core revenue to be flat to up 4% for the full year and earnings per share of between a range of $14.25 per share to $15.25 per share. Free cash flow is targeted within a range of $250 million to $350 million. We are planning capital expenditures of $250 million that includes investment in a second commercial factory and investments related to refrigerant transition to take effect in 2025. Price benefit, including price associated with the 2023 SEER transition is now expected to be $175 million. And we now expect net material cost to be a $45 million headwind in 2023. The material cost headwind is driven by component cost inflation of $100 million, net of $30 million in savings from cost reduction initiatives, along with $25 million from commodity cost benefits. Corporate expenses are still targeted at $80 million. We will manage SG&A tightly while continuing to manage necessary investments in the businesses to support growth initiatives and drive productivity. And finally, we still expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between 35 million to 36 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase $100 million to $200 million of stock this year. With that, let\u2019s turn to Slide 11, and I\u2019ll turn it back to Alok.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks, Joe. Please turn to Page 11 for an update on the key initiatives reviewed during last year\u2019s Investor Day to deliver on our long-term targets. As a recap, our 2026 target is to deliver an ROS of 18% to 20% with revenues over $5 billion. We believe that are laser-like focus on North America HVACR market, our direct-to-dealer business model and our superior technology portfolio will ensure long-term success. We are executing 6 self-help strategic imperatives outlined on the right-hand side of this page to meet or exceed our 2026 goals. First, growth acceleration to drive share gain will be achieved by optimizing our go-to-market effectiveness by improving our brand customer experience and by increasing growth capacity. Second, we will increase resilient margins through commercial recovery, productivity and pricing excellence, which was highlighted earlier in the call today. Third, to maintain execution consistency, we have introduced a balanced score card operating system. We are transitioning to a dual-source supply chain, and we are implementing lean digital processes like sales and inventory planning. Fourth, we are reconfirming our commitment to 90% to 100% cash conversion and a healthy balance sheet while building a bolt-on M&A pipeline focused on North American HVACR. Fifth, we will enhance our technology leadership through the frequent regulatory transitions by winning in core climate heat pump and investing in digital AI/ML adoption across all our business functions. Fixed and finally, we are reinforcing our high-performance talent and culture by rolling out guiding behaviors to support our core values. In addition, we are undertaking succession planning and ensuring that our compensation scheme remains aligned with value creation. Once again, I would like to thank our employees who are working hard to successfully implement this self-help transformation plan. To close our prepared remarks, I would like to summarize on Page 12, the reasons why I believe LII is an attractive investment opportunity. Lennox is a narrowly focused North American leader in the attractive industry of energy-efficient, environmentally friendly HVACR solutions. We operate in high-growth end markets with strong replacement demand that provides us with resiliency even during periods of economic uncertainty. The company has a unique direct-to-dealer network, which creates a sustainable competitive advantage. And we have a history of robust execution with disciplined capital allocation. As I complete my first year at Lennox, I\u2019m even more excited about Lennox\u2019s future and continue to believe that our best days are ahead of us. Thank you. Joe, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions now. Britney, let\u2019s go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Hi, good morning everyone.\nAlok Maskara: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Just to start on the commercial margins, certainly some encouraging progress there. Anything that you can talk about that, that you would consider sort of non-repeat in the quarter versus just some of the progress that you were expecting maybe coming through a little bit faster, kind of weave that into how you\u2019re thinking about sort of the go forward from here is supply chain continuing to improve and those margins continuing to improve sequentially?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. So Joe, on the commercial, we are pleased with the progress. We had talked about earlier that we think there\u2019s a reset coming in the first quarter of this year. Given that many of our key accounts had to be repriced with the sea change and the new product addition. And you saw that loudly reflected in our P&L. So that\u2019s consistent with what we expected. We had also talked about almost a little over under a year ago, $100 million in EBIT improvement. And over the past few quarters, we have already delivered $60 of that $100 million. So yes, we are a little ahead of where we expected, and that\u2019s a good thing. We remain on that journey. I think we are going to get to that $100 million faster than what we had originally talked about, just given we are more than halfway through with that. And with supply chains improving, demand remaining strong, we still expect high single-digit growth this year, and we still expect margins to hold. And no, there was nothing unusual in Q1, we would expect the performance trajectory to continue going forward.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Great. Thank you. And then on the resi side, can you talk a little bit about your sort of expectations for the year on the sort of direct-to-dealer versus to distributor kind of outlined. And you gave some color on the first quarter, but curious sort of how you think about that, if you\u2019re able to talk at all about sort of your framework for the second quarter, thinking about that? And then just generally, for the full year, how we should think about those varying trends?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So I think let me start with the end consumer, right, because that\u2019s how we look at it. I mean the end consumer demand seems to be holding pretty well. From our perspective \u2013 as you know, this was not a great season from a heating perspective. It was unseasonably warm in quite a few parts of the country. Despite that, we talk about that in our direct-to-dealer business, we had flat drive units coming through. And on our two-step motor, we had declines, and that was largely destocking driven. So from our perspective, the end consumer demand remains healthy. There\u2019s obviously a slowdown in growth but we don\u2019t see any declines coming up because the replacement business is holding pretty steady. For the rest of the year, Joe, I will expect a decline in direct mostly because of residential new construction. That slowed last year, and that\u2019s going to impact our demand now. On two-step, I think the declines get better. So I think in Q2, we will see less destocking that we saw in Q1 and Q3, we will probably see a little to no destocking as that gets behind us. We\u2019re only in April, May, June are bigger months for us than in April. But overall, we remain confident in the full year outlook of mid-single-digit unit decline with 0% to 4% revenue growth for us as we look at all these factors combined together.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nAlok Maskara: Hi, Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: Maybe just going back to the commercial margins, obviously really strong this quarter. And with respect to Joe\u2019s question, I mean, I think you usually see a step-up in margins seasonally in commercial from 1Q to 2Q and then a smaller step-up in the third quarter. Would you say that it\u2019s possible that we could see a seasonal increase? It\u2019s just kind of hard to gauge since 1Q was so strong? Thank you.\nAlok Maskara: Yes. I mean, commercial, listen, overall, for the long-term, we expect that business to be a 20% ROS business. And Q1 was good, but we were only at a 16%. So I think there\u2019s still room for improvement for us. I don\u2019t want to accurately try and predict Q3, Q4 or Q2. I mean we don\u2019t have that level of precision. But I would see no reason why our typical seasonality trend won\u2019t hold this quarter. Because remember, this quarter, we also had some inefficiencies related to the CEO transition as we completed those. So stay tuned. I mean, I think we\u2019re starting at a good spot and \u2013 do you expect to end in a few years at closer to 20%.\nNicole DeBlase: Thanks. That\u2019s really, really clear. And then second question, just on price/cost. Obviously, a benefit to margins in the quarter. How does that phase through the year, especially given the new price actions that you talked about today? Thanks.\nAlok Maskara: Yes. So the new price actions that we talked about are on the residential side. On commercial, we had a reset going into this year. So I think the price cost benefit that you saw \u2013 we will see the levels to remain the same, but obviously, we start going through more difficult comps because we had done significant price increases. So the year-over-year comps get difficult, but I think the levels on a as this basis remains where we have to do more pricing effort is on the residential side, and that\u2019s where we are putting a lot of our emphasis and focus, and that\u2019s where the new price increase that we talked about goes into effect in June 18.\nNicole DeBlase: Thanks so much, Alok.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Tommy Moll with Stephens, Inc. Your line is now open.\nTommy Moll: Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions.\nAlok Maskara: Hi, Tommy.\nTommy Moll: We appreciated the insight you provided on the pricing excellence strategy, and I wanted to drill down on a couple of the items in there, specifically around the optimizing local versus central decision-making \u2013 can you bring us in on what that involves? And to what extent was that related to the midyear price increase that you just announced on resi to us today? Or was there some other factor driving that decision? Thanks.\nAlok Maskara: I think as we went through the tornado many years ago as we went through COVID and significant inflation, we went into more of a command and control more because we had to. Those were crisis that we\u2019re managing. Historically, we have really good territory managers. We have really good branch leaders. We have really good folks. We have good field intelligence. And we need to act accordingly, just like a distributor does because although we had a manufacturer, our 250 outlets act more as a distributor. So as we are looking at [indiscernible], we want to give more input, more say to local pricing decisions versus looking at things doing more centrally. And so obviously, you want to set our strategy centrally, but our local field force have a lot more market intelligence and look at every region behaving a little differently. So that was the comment was we\u2019re going to optimize it, and that\u2019s a pretty typical thing for us to do because pricing in South Florida may be very different than pricing in North Dakota. And we need to make sure that we appropriately account for those differences.\nTommy Moll: Thanks, Alok, I appreciate the context there. As a follow-up, I wanted to look at the residential profit contribution versus the commercial side, which was quite robust this quarter. But if we think about the full year trajectory there, your guidance does imply some growth in profitability year-over-year. Given the residential volume headwinds that you\u2019ve articulated, should we assume that all or substantially all of the profit growth this year should come on the commercial side? Or is that not the right way to think about it?\nAlok Maskara: No, I think it will be a balance between residential and commercial. Listen, Commercial had a good start. I think residential has lots of room for improvement with the price, with the mixing with the inventory level coming down. So I\u2019m optimistic on residential, and we are driving that hard. Commercial did have easy comps to compared to where we started in Q1 last year, Tommy look at that. I think the overall profit increase for this year would be balanced between those two as residential. The benefit of sea change also is going to happen a little slower than commercial because commercial, we didn\u2019t have as much finished good inventory sitting around. And in residential, we sold quite a bit of a lower SEER products in Q1 as we are finishing that inventory. So I think putting it all together, we are equally optimistic about residential improving for the rest of the year.\nTommy Moll: Appreciated, Alok. I will turn it back.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nJeff Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys.\nAlok Maskara: Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Hammond: I just want to come back on price. I guess, first, what\u2019s informing another price increase kind of on this June 18. And then just as you talk to the contractors and get feedback, any start \u2013 you\u2019re starting to see \u2013 are you starting to see any pushback from contractors or fatigue from the consumer on kind of these multiple increases?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. I mean listen, costs keep going up. I mean you saw steel has been up significantly. Copper started to go back up. And what we also did is just like you would expect good companies, too, we did a pricing benchmark on where we stand. So I think the price increase in June is a targeted price increase. We targeted areas where we think we have greater opportunities. And that\u2019s because for the past couple of years, we were sort of doing brute-force price increases versus what I would call sophisticated price increases. So a lot of that is working with our own analytics and our teams to go through that. And fully offset the inflation and make sure we remain competitive in the market and capture the adequate balance. So, it\u2019s a lot of details and analytics behind it, Jeff, but we remain confident the right thing to do and support the industry pricing level. On the second part of your question, I mean remember the equipment price is only a small portion, less than half of what the consumer pays or sees in there. And we have seen no pullback because the repair versus replacement dynamics, in fact, still favors replacement, given that repairs are more expensive, our 22 units are very hard to repair or the cost of 20 is going up and cost of spare parts and labor has gone up more than the cost of equipment. So we haven\u2019t seen any changes, and I think they are consistent with the industry. Well, obviously, we remain closely aligned with 10,000 dealers, and we keep getting their feedback, and we will adjust if anything changes.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. Great. And then just as we look at it, it seems like you still have a lot of confidence in the resiliency, res, seems like commercial is running ahead. What kind of precluded you from kind of moving the guide at this point?\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes, Jeff, I think, once again, first and fourth quarters were seasonally or lites, \u2013 we\u2019ve got a lot of the year still in front of us and just didn\u2019t really want to \u2013 once again, we approach it with conservative. Cautious optimism, I think, is the right way to characterize it. We remain confident and are gauging the underlying markets, but just wanted to get into the peak season before we made a call on the full year.\nJeff Hammond: Okay, thanks, guys.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe I\u2019ll leave commercial margins in pace for the time being. Maybe just on the commercial kind of top line, I fully understand the excitement around the good margin performance. But on the top line, maybe remind us of some of those main sort of end market exposures for the commercial piece in terms of kind of end market verticals obviously, a lot of concern from people out there on things like office and retail and so forth in recent months. So have you seen any kind of shift in customer behaviors? Any color you could provide on sort of bookings or orders at all on the commercial side? And again, any sort of flavor you could give on how the end market breakout for the business?\nMichael Quenzer: Hey, Julien, this is Michael. Yes, on the commercial side, the backlog still is healthy. We\u2019re seeing good demand across most of our verticals. New construction is kind of 15%, 20% of that business. We\u2019re not seeing any credit issues yet, but the backlog is definitely still healthy going \u2013 reaching into Q3. So we\u2019re really not seeing a pullback on the demand yet. Backlogs are extended a little bit because of some of the lead times in the factory. But from a demand perspective, it still looks healthy.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much. And Michael, any color you could give on sort of vertical splits, I don\u2019t know, education versus more commercial applications, anything like that?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. We\u2019re seeing some good demand on the education. So that\u2019s predominantly a summer season, though when the schools are out of season, and we can get in and do the replacement work. So schools are more of a Q2 kind of Q3 dynamic more than Q1. Right now, it\u2019s still just executing our backlog that we\u2019ve had for quite a while, and we\u2019re seeing good demand across most of the channels.\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes. And a few more things, Juliane. Where we\u2019ve put a concerted effort was preserving our national account customers. Once again, that strategy, I think, is paying off for us. as once again, the order rates and backlog remain strong there. And then as we continue to reengage in the emergency replacement segment of the market, that should provide us additional upside more in the second half than first half. But regardless of how the underlying vertical is performing, we still think, given where our business is positioned today, we still have tremendous runway, particularly in the second half of the year.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just my quick follow-up on going back to sort of residential volumes, so I understand that maybe Q1 is a bit noisy with the CEO transition just sort of happening and so forth. And you had that and maybe some weather constraints. So you\u2019ve got the down volumes in resi in the quarter just behind you. As we think about how that plays out through the year and what you\u2019ve seen in April, albeit it\u2019s a very small month for the quarter, but do we assume sort of second quarter is down about the same amount, sort of volumes down high single digit in the second quarter. And then by the fourth quarter, you\u2019re probably growing volumes again. Is that the way to think about the year for resi volume?\nAlok Maskara: I mean, it\u2019s hard to say in April, I mean April doesn\u2019t really give a trend. I mean if you think about the key drivers of the volume decline in Q1, almost all of it was destocking right? So I mean, if I take that destocking part, and I would say Q2 we\u2019ll see some de some more destocking. I don\u2019t know if it be as extensive as Q1, probably not because Q1 was the most pullback as people completed so transitions and knew that they were comfortable stock, and that\u2019s what we expected. I think Q2, there\u2019ll be a little less destocking. Q3 will be minimal to zero and then Q4, we should be done with destocking. So I think that\u2019s the way to think about it. And the user demand seems to be holding just fine. I mean, there\u2019s no growth that we saw rapid growth that we saw during COVID in other places, but that demand seems to be holding just fine. And RNC, residential new construction, we can predict very well. Because the housing starts is what drive it. So I think the volume declines moderate. It won\u2019t be 8% in Q2, Q3. But in Q4, to your specific portion, I\u2019m not sure if it returned to growth because that will depend on the residential new construction. It\u2019s looking better. We started the year thinking it will be down 20% right now, it looks like it\u2019s closer to 10% from a housing start perspective, we just need to watch and monitor that Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Alok.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I want to come back to kind of the \u2013 maybe it\u2019s on Slide 5, kind of the pricing slide. Alok, can you dig a little deeper into maybe the opportunities, I guess, I\u2019ll call them non-price price actions, right? Rebates, leakage, things like that. Is this an area where the firm once had discipline and lost it or this is a new area of focus? And maybe you could give some color or insight on like how significant driving some of these netting actions might be?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. I guess having done pricing back in my consulting days, I strongly believe that all three levers are important, setting, getting and netting \u2013 so I think it\u2019s important. In some of these cases, yes, we had strong discipline. And during COVID and other cases, as we pulled back on non-critical activities, some of these just had to give that we had to focus on other things such as recovery on, COVID looking at supporting the volume constraint. So I think we have that muscle. We\u2019ve got to kind of make sure we retrain it. We make sure we find it and deploy it. A lot of this is also around, we have structural advantages when it comes to serving some of the large accounts, whether it\u2019s we call it national accounts or key accounts and it\u2019s going to be for us to work jointly with our customers to find the lowest cost way to serve them and create win-win situations there. Because we are direct, right? We can optimize a lot of freight, distribution and make it win-win for us and these large growing often like a sponsor-owned dealer network. So we think that\u2019s a big opportunity. Where it\u2019s less about what the list price is, but it\u2019s more about what\u2019s margin on both sides, and we have an opportunity to optimize that. So we used to do it very well. We lost some ground just because we had to focus on other areas. We are bringing that back, and we are excited about the structural advantage we have in going after larger accounts where the cost to serve would be lower on both sides.\nJeff Sprague: And then just on inventories, you spoke to the channel destocking and the like. I just wonder if you could address your own inventories, I guess we\u2019re up 30% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. It\u2019s not crazy given the inflation that\u2019s out there. But maybe just address where your inventories are vis-a-vis where you think they should be any particular absorption or other issues embedded in the guide as you work through that or anything else to be aware of there?\nAlok Maskara: I think what you saw is our inventories definitely grew in Q1, but that\u2019s normal with our seasonal nature of our business. We always grow inventory in the first quarter. And then we will burn that off in Q2 and Q3 built into the guide that burn off of the inventory. We\u2019re going to look to potentially do a little bit more. We think there may be some upside to exceed the free cash guide. But it\u2019s normal to build inventory as we did in Q1.\nJoe Reitmeier: And if I can just jump on that. I mean, if you go back again a few years ago, when we were turning inventory at 5 to 6x a year and we still have room for improvement there. I mean, right now, we are taking it at 3 to 4x. So I think over the 3-year planning period, you can expect us to go back to turning inventory at the historical levels. Driven by finished goods optimization that Michael mentioned, but also raw material supply chains became extended, we bulked up on raw material, and we don\u2019t want to do anything crazy here, but over the next 2 to 3 years in a very disciplined manner, working with our suppliers and our customers, we are going to drive our inventory turns to be better.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning, guys.\nAlok Maskara: Hey, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Look, I want to follow-up on, I guess, adjacent to price, but really about share gain. If you think about where you see the biggest opportunity today, is it more on kind of the larger dealers, bigger national accounts like homebuilders? Is it in the smaller guys? Maybe talk about where this kind of newer field autonomy is really designed to try to meet the market between different customer types.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. I mean, Josh, I think the simple answer is all of them. I mean we have an opportunity with smaller dealers because we underserve them post the tornado. I mean we were known for our endo Signature Series products. We had really good partnerships and because we didn\u2019t have enough inventory or service levels, many of them were forced to look somewhere else. So we need to win them back. And I think that\u2019s where a lot of the local autonomy, the improved service levels and all of that goes into, right? Second part of that is just geographic based on legacy and driven, I mean, our market share in South Florida is much lower than our market share in Marshalltown, Iowa, and that\u2019s been for years. I mean that\u2019s where a lot of the efforts we have done, including increasing our reach, investing in our distribution footprint, getting more heat pump coverage, all of that has, I think second factor is geographic. Third, to come back to the national dealers or the larger dealers, that\u2019s where we have a structural advantage and it\u2019s a different, more sophisticated approach of working with them on trying to make sure that we create a win-win partnership. So, Josh, we have opportunities in all three areas. And don\u2019t forget at the same time our indirect business, which is also doing very well. So, when I talked about that direct, on the indirect side, where we are targeting through Allied, our independent distribution network and giving them a stronger, better value proposition, that works well. So, I think all four are important, right. Smaller dealers that we lost unfortunately during and after the tornado, truly looking at regional expansion, going into key accounts and getting to make sure we have a win-win value proposition and finally, continuing to expand our two-step model as well because we believe we have a unique value proposition. So, those are kind of our four levers for market share gain.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Understood. And then just shifting over to the product side and the 2025 transition coming up, I know you really [ph] guidance today, but it does look like you have a little bit of padding to start the year, so good performance in commercial, anything that you are able to pull forward on R&D, CapEx, anything else on getting set for \u201825?\nJoe Reitmeier: Yes. It\u2019s a situation where I think we are doing all that we can. Once again, our priorities are elevating our service levels with our customers, making sure we have got the right mix of product to meet end market demand and then continuing to pull forward, and we are done that to some extent, Josh, you noticed is our capital expenditures are $250 million. $50 million of that is associated with staying ahead of the 2025 transition. So, we are making those investments pulling ahead those activities that we can\u2019t deliver that value to our customers. And once again, much like we did with the minimum efficiency transition this year, seamlessly attack what\u2019s ahead of us in 2025.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Thanks for the color. Best of luck guys.\nJoe Reitmeier: Thanks.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nNoah Kaye: Good morning. Good to be with you. Thanks. I guess to start with, interested in the commentary around this year benefit to mix. Look, I think you said actually, it was a fairly small amount of SEER products sold through the resi channel in 1Q. Is it possible to quantify the SEER benefit to mix in the quarter, how you would think about that into the seasonal uptick and what\u2019s embedded for SEER specifically in the full year guide?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. Michael will answer that question, but let me just clarify. Maybe what I was saying is that not all our sales in Q1 were the new SEER products, about one-third of our sales in Q1 are still the older SEER products as you are going. But no, majority of the sale in Q1 did shift to new SEER, but Michael can actually break down the mix benefits for you.\nMichael Quenzer: Alright. Yes. In residential, we did see favorable mix. It\u2019s predominantly for the SEER transition. As we have talked about previously, it acts more as volume than price. So, it dropped through to about a 30% drop-through that we saw in residential. We should start to see that for the rest of the year to similar 30% drop-through on the benefit for the mix shift. And a little bit higher margins on the drop-through on the commercial as we are able to get some additional pricing on top of that, but should be about a 30% drop-through that we see in residential.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. Great. And then what did you see from the e-commerce channel this quarter? I think to the question around share gains overall, just how did that channel factor in?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. We don\u2019t break out e-commerce sales by quarter. But needless to say, as we talked in the Investor Day, it\u2019s a very important channel for us. We look at over a third of our sales as we mentioned at the Investor Day, go through e-commerce. We find that all of those are very sticky customers, and that continues to grow. So, I think the numbers we disclosed in December still hold or better, but we don\u2019t break that out quarterly, nor do we think it\u2019s relevant to break it out quarterly. But it\u2019s an important part of our growth strategy. And what we are even more excited about is to be able to leverage those data and the relationship and using artificial intelligence and machine learning to make critical decisions, everything from inventory planning to pricing, also looking at making it easier for our dealers from predictive maintenance perspective and others. It\u2019s a huge investment for us, very important for us, but the quarterly breakdown of that is not something we think is relevant.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open.\nRyan Merkel: Hey everyone. Just a couple of cleanups for me. Just going back to commercial Alok, can you put a finer point on why you are so far ahead on the margin recovery, because I think before, you thought it was a 3-year sort of linear progression and now it looks like you might be there at the end of this year?\nAlok Maskara: Well, first of all, I would say really pleased to have a conservative CFO. So, I think that will be the first start point on that, Ryan. Listen, it definitely helps. And when we said 3 years, we really looked at that being like our external commitment. Internally, obviously, we were driving it to a faster pace. I think the SEER transition worked well for us. I mean as we looked at the factory converting over, the labor stabilizing, getting the new products, which I give full credit to the team as we were also able to rationalize our SKUs. So, we have like 40% less SKU in the factories working through and simplifying. So, a lot of just core discipline was restored. We make a step forward with SKU rationalization. We were able to work with our key accounts because these new SKUs were not covered by some of the legacy contracts, so all of those. So, I think we \u2013 if there was like an optimistic scenario and a conservative scenario, we were probably guiding you guys to the midpoint of that. And right now, we are fighting on cylinders to hit closer to be optimistic. But it\u2019s within the range of what we thought Ryan.\nRyan Merkel: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for that. And then just on resi, any differences in the quarter by geography? We obviously had some weather out west, just curious there.\nAlok Maskara: Not substantial. I mean there is weather related, right. Because the winter was mild in certain cases, Northeast did not do well, but I think that\u2019s an industry-wide factor. Southern states did well, but I think it could also be because some of our competitors stumbled during this year transition and we had inventory. So, I think some of the Southern states, we saw particular strength. But nothing that I could call out or give you the dubious answer on, Ryan.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning guys.\nAlok Maskara: Good morning Nigel.\nNigel Coe: I will say we got a lot of ground already. Hi guys. Just on that last point. So obviously, we saw a pretty significant shift during the fourth quarter with the transition. It sounds like that continued perhaps not at the stream, but that did continue in the first quarter. Is that fair, Alok?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. That\u2019s fair. And I think these things typically, given the abrupt nature of the regulations, but the difference between North and South, I think we all have got \u2013 I mean all industry players have got sophisticated on starting to make them in Q4 and continue selling them through end of kind of Q2 to make sure the inventory doesn\u2019t become like E&O time excess and obsolete. So, I think we have done \u2013 all have done a good job with that.\nJoe Reitmeier: And I think our direct-to-dealer strategy benefits us due to the destocking in the two-step channels. So, once again, I think we were probably unjustly criticized for losing share as the two-step channel stocked up. Once again, as it destocks, we will see some of that benefit in the form of additional share.\nNigel Coe: Yes. That\u2019s very fair. Going back to commercial margins, I know this has been well vetted. But if you think about the Arkansas facility, where is labor and material productivity trending today relative to normal, and I will leave you to define normal, but where are you sort of target on that curve?\nAlok Maskara: I am glad you are going to leave us to define normal. I am going to leave it to somebody else. So, it\u2019s hard to fine normal, but here is the thing, right. I mean wages are not going back. So, let\u2019s put it in that perspective. But our factories are still fairly inefficient. Lot of the inefficiencies that trapped in, including expedited rate, including overtime, including line rates running below normal, those still persist. And Q1 was actually a little bit worse on that because we had to go through SEER change. So, imagine retooling all your lines and getting to new products, which were completely new design for us. Remember, there are three new models that we introduced at the beginning of the year. So, I think there is still room for productivity improvement for us going forward. Our priority is still output there, right. I mean I think the more we can produce, the more we can find. We are still limited by our Board. But getting the output up, getting manufacturing productivity and working on the second factory, remember, all of this is still based on the existing factory. Once we have two factories and can truly look at one being focused on made to stock, going after emergency replacement, making standard products at very high velocity, very high efficiency and the other being on made to order for key accounts specific. I mean that\u2019s out of our vision that hasn\u2019t changed. We just got to the one factory improvement sooner.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks a lot. I will leave it there.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Joe Ritche with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJoe Ritche: Hi guys. Good morning. Can you touch on just your visibility into the independent distribution channels? It looks like your Allied business was probably down. I am guessing volumes are down like high teens this quarter. Just what kind of visibility do you actually have to destocking, being pretty much behind you in 2Q?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So and when we say two-step, we mean ADP and Allied. So, combined together, and you are right. I mean the volume was down in the range you mentioned. We have very good relationship with this channel, and we have good visibility, that\u2019s the reason we are kind of hinting at, we would expect destocking to continue in Q2 and then beginning of Q3 or beginning of second half. We think that will be behind us. It\u2019s hard to quantify because every distributor is different, right. I mean nobody has the same exact operating rhythm as somebody else in a different state. But the amount of excess inventory that the distributors are holding is \u2013 should be compete with destocking by beginning of Q3.\nJoe Ritche: Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. And I guess maybe just a follow-on on commercial. I know we have talked about it, and congrats on being way ahead of plan on getting that $100 million back. It\u2019s probably unfair for me to even ask this question, but how are you thinking about what \u2013 where the margin improvement is going to come post achieving the $100 million, which seems like it\u2019s going to come a lot faster than you originally anticipated?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. I mean I will point out to a few different things, right. First of all, remember, the $100 million we had said does not include the second factory benefit. So, I think we are still holding to that. So, the second factory, we have started construction. Things are moving along well. We expect to be under roof by the end of the year. We would expect production sometime next year. So, that will give a significant benefit as we have two factories, very focused operating to serve our customers really well. So, that\u2019s going to be one part. Second on that is, I think there is significant opportunity for us to continue looking at our service growth. Service is a very attractive business for us, and we were not fully focused on that, given all the disruptions happening here. So, getting service and increasing our service focus, which is good margin, it\u2019s repeatable, and it\u2019s predictable, and gives us great insight for equipment sales. I think the service would really help us well. And finally going back to the manufacturing inefficiencies, I don\u2019t want to rule that out. I mean we are in the early stages of working through manufacturing inefficiencies and getting all of those out of the system. So, long term we are committed to 20%-plus ROS across both the segments. And we are excited about all the steps. And those are sort of the things I have mentioned in the last page, when I talked about the six key self-help initiatives we are working on. They kind of equally apply to both residential and commercial.\nJoe Ritche: It makes sense. Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nBrett Linzey: Alright. Good morning all.\nAlok Maskara: Hi Brett.\nBrett Linzey: I just wanted to come back to commercial briefly. So, you noted the backlog remains strong and order rates are solid. What degree of visibility on those orders converting do you have for this year? And is there anything specific of mix, whether it\u2019s national account versus other verticals that we should be aware of over the next two quarters, three quarters?\nAlok Maskara: I will take the second question first. So, on the mix side, no, I mean we don\u2019t have large projects that funnel through the pipeline or anything, right. I mean these are all projects and these are products that we price accordingly. So, no, the margin in our backlog is no different than the margin we are expecting in Q1, if that\u2019s your question, right. We have good visibility into that margin, and it\u2019s all good, nothing to worry about there. On the overall demand visibility, it\u2019s everything from some key accounts who want to plan 2025 volume right now post the low GWP to people on emergency replacement who wants product tomorrow. But our backlog is healthy. I mean the industry lead times remain stretched. I mean today, if somebody places an order, whether it\u2019s our sort of competition, chances of getting a product this year is low. I mean you would likely get into Q4 next year. So, I think there is some flexibility here and there, but that\u2019s kind of the demand visibility we have. It\u2019s pretty solid going forward, both from actual revenue, sales and also margin perspective.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Great. And just to follow-up on the news this week with one of your peers making a portfolio move into European heat pumps, can you maybe just speak to your appetite to compete internationally, be it organically, be it inorganically? And then maybe just how much investment do you think is required to maybe reinvigorate that part of your portfolio?\nAlok Maskara: As you know, already we made a decision last year to make the portfolio move, which includes divestment of our European operation. We like being laser-like focused on North America HVAC-R business. It\u2019s a very large industry. We have low share. I think our focus is going to help us win. So, I think we are currently 100% committed to remaining North America HVAC/R player. We still have lots of bolt-on opportunities here, whether it\u2019s about service or expanding our line card, so our stores can be more efficient and looking at other opportunities. So, I think for us, never say never, but currently, we like our laser focus, and I think that will help us win share, that will help us through the transition. Everybody at Lennox gets up every morning and is focused on winning in North America HVAC-R. And all our 11,000 employees focus in that direction. We are confident that\u2019s a winning formula for us. And if you guys want to diversify for other international, you can always buy shares in other international companies.\nBrett Linzey: Alright. Thanks a lot. Best of luck.\nAlok Maskara: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSteve Tusa: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.\nAlok Maskara: Hi Steve.\nSteve Tusa: I don\u2019t quite \u2013 I am not sure I heard this before, been a lot of calls this morning, but could you guys comment at all on how April is looking relative in resi to what you guys posted for the first quarter?\nAlok Maskara: We didn\u2019t comment specifically on April, but I will tell you, it\u2019s consistent with what we expected. And April is a hard month given that most of the summer sales stops in kind of May and June. But there is nothing in April that would have caused us to change our full year outlook.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then I think you mentioned there were some production inefficiencies in the fourth quarter on new products coming up to speed. It was my understanding that you guys didn\u2019t really do like a major clean sheet kind of redesign for this year go around? I thought you were maybe taking a legacy product, and you were talking about how you had the outdoor unit kind of advantage there. Can you maybe just explain how your product strategy kind of progressed through that?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So, let\u2019s start with the two segments separately, right. So, on the commercial, we did redesign our product, and that\u2019s what we were referring to earlier. So, we launched three new models and replaced most of our legacy that included significant SKU rationalization, more modular design and more modern. So commercial, we did redesign our product line. On residential, we had to redesign our outdoor units just because air conditioning and heat pump, but that\u2019s what regulation does. We did not re-launch an indoor unit because our indoor units are still very new. They were launched just a year or so ago. And they are already very high efficiency and they are compatible. So, we believe that gives us competitive advantage in the marketplace is that our new higher air conditioning and heat pump units are backwards compatible with our existing furnaces and air handlers indoor. So, that\u2019s the piece I think of the product strategy we had mentioned earlier.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Okay. And then one last one, on this price increase, how much in total is the price increase? And then can you just remind us of how that works with your distribution channel? I mean are you selling \u2013 does that price increase go independent versus your captive like \u2013 is there a difference between what the contractor is seeing and what your independent distributor is seeing?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. We call it a targeted price increase, Steve. And I think a lot of the discussions, the customers are starting now. So, I would rather not go into terms of details in that one. But the answer is we believe that this is the right step for us to be more competitively priced in the marketplace. From a consumer perspective, this is a small portion of the overall cost. And all we are doing is making sure we can offset inflation. You will notice in our full year guide, we now talk about $175 million in pricing benefits, earlier we have given a range with the high end at $175 million, and we took our commodity inflation up by offsetting $10 million. So, that\u2019s kind of where we are on the numbers.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. So, it\u2019s embedded, it\u2019s embedded in that $175 million now, your realization, whatever you expect to get in June.\nAlok Maskara: Yes. We just to remove the range and stuck with the high number.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. Okay. Great. Thank you.\nAlok Maskara: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Chirag Patel with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nChirag Patel: Thanks. So, I just wanted to cover the Allied piece, just one more kind of a blush here. One, I was just kind of looking at what the opportunity kind of seems like for you guys over time? I know in the past, we have talked about the idea of share gains of $300 million or so to get to that 2026 target. How much of that is Allied? What do you kind of see the growth? Is there an acceleration opportunity in that, is there an opportunity to partner with additional distribution channels to kind of expand that product? Just trying to get a little bit more sense for what you see as that particular piece of the business growing is versus the core Lennox brand?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So first of all, we are very proud of Allied. I mean they have done great over the past many years. I mean the business has grown up 4x. I mean the margins have expanded beautifully. And I think Joan [ph] and the team have done a fabulous job taking that. At the same time, we don\u2019t think we are anywhere close to being done. We have significant room for improvement. I can easily see that business doubling again over the next 5 years as we continue to add distributors to have a very focused product portfolio that wins a lot of awards and we truly focus on best serving these independent distributors. So, excited about Allied, we think there is a lot of growth potential ahead. At the same time, I don\u2019t want to break down $300 million in opportunity between business A and B. Ideally, both of them will get it, right. I mean ideally, we would both get the $300 million targets and we deliver more to the shareholders. The super excited about Allied, I think we have share gain opportunities on direct and in indirect, we will keep driving both of them.\nChirag Patel: Appreciate that. Would there be a mix shift if that were to grow a little bit faster or slower on the margin side, I just mean?\nAlok Maskara: No. And we don\u2019t break out margins. I just \u2013 we would remain committed to 20% margin on residential overall. And it\u2019s hard to kind of break down margin artificially because remember, we share the same infrastructure for manufacturing, product development and all of that. So, that just becomes allocation game, right.\nChirag Patel: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for joining us today. Since there are no further questions, this will conclude Lennox first quarter conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alok Maskara",
            "content": "Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning and welcome everyone. Allow me to start by sharing my appreciation for all of our employees whose hard work has enabled us to deliver exceptional performance this quarter, including record quarterly earnings per share. We take great pride in our team's effort to gain share, expand margin, and seamlessly transition our product portfolio to meet the new minimum energy efficiency regulations. This successful quarter reflects our company's product leadership, strong direct customer relationships and advanced digital platforms. These factors will continue to fuel our share gain and margin expansion for the foreseeable future. I want to also take this opportunity to thank our dealers and customers for their loyalty to Lennox as we improve our service levels while delivering the best HVACR products and solutions in North America. Now please turn to Slide 3, where I want to highlight four key messages. First, Lennox is proud to report another quarter with record financial results. First quarter 2023 core revenues grew 3%. Our margin expanded 210 basis points, resulting in our adjusted EPS, increasing 15% to $2.83. Our free cash usage this quarter was $114 million, which is typical given the seasonality of our business. Second, we are pleased with the pace of margin recovery in our commercial business segment. Our profits more than doubled compared to last year as manufacturing operations stabilized and the benefit of price and mix outpaced inflationary cost increases. Third, we continue to help our dealers and customers succeed during the transition to the new minimum efficiency regulations that went into effect on January 1, 2023. Our superior design and successful track record of executing during regulatory changes, in conjunction with improved service inventory levels has put us in a strong position to gain share. Fourth, given the strong quarterly results, we remain comfortable with our previously issued full year financial guidance. We continue to closely monitor end market sentiments, track movements in commodity pricing, and execute countermeasures, including additional price increases. We are also optimizing our inventory levels, given improved lead times and current sales outlook. Now please turn to Slide 4 for our view on the current end market conditions. In the residential end market, we are experiencing destocking in our 2-step distribution channel just as we had expected. We anticipate the destocking to continue through the beginning of second half of this year. Volume in our direct-to-dealer channel was flat in Q1. However, we are expecting softness later in the year, driven by fewer new housing starts in 2022. We are closely monitoring consumer confidence for any changes that may impact the replacement versus repair decisions, but we are also encouraged by the recent improvement in the new housing starts. There is no change in our full year outlook for a mid-single-digit decline in residential unit volumes. In commercial, our backlog is strong, and our lead times have improved as the factory situation has stabilized. The industry lead time for commercial equipment remains extended due to the shortage of common components. We still believe that commercial sales will grow by high single digits this year. On the price versus inflation balance, we are price cost positive, but we are monitoring recent inflation in commodities such as steel and copper to offset the higher material cost we have implemented a targeted residential price increase that will become effective on June 18 this year. Overall, we are well positioned to gain share with our success in seamlessly transitioning to the new minimum efficiency standards and given our improved service inventory levels. In addition, we are strengthening our go-to-market organization by adding more field resources and offsetting those investments by driving back-office SG&A productivity. Now please turn to Slide 5. To accelerate our profitable growth and to expand margins, we are investing in pricing excellence at Lennox. Over the past few years, we have managed to offset inflation with price, but there remains a significant opportunity for us to refine our pricing strategy to drive greater benefits from both price and mix. We are strengthening our pricing infrastructure by increasing price analytics, engaging outside experts and further developing our internal talent. Recently, we have revised our company-wide contract signing authority to ensure appropriate scrutiny over key account pricing, and have redirected new business development on higher-margin channels and applications. We also plan to expand our rebate auditing process and take all the necessary steps to increase price netting. Another priority of ours is to work with our larger key accounts to optimize our cost to serve so that we can establish win-win partnerships. In summary, we know that pricing excellence is an important step towards Lennox regaining our competitive margin advantage. And thus, we are increasing our focus to meet or exceed our long-term margin goals. Later in the presentation, I will provide an update on our long-term goals. But for now, I'm going to hand the call over to Joe Reitmeier, who will go through our first quarter financial performance. Thanks, Joe. Please turn to Page 11 for an update on the key initiatives reviewed during last year's Investor Day to deliver on our long-term targets. As a recap, our 2026 target is to deliver an ROS of 18% to 20% with revenues over $5 billion. We believe that are laser-like focus on North America HVACR market, our direct-to-dealer business model and our superior technology portfolio will ensure long-term success. We are executing 6 self-help strategic imperatives outlined on the right-hand side of this page to meet or exceed our 2026 goals. First, growth acceleration to drive share gain will be achieved by optimizing our go-to-market effectiveness by improving our brand customer experience and by increasing growth capacity. Second, we will increase resilient margins through commercial recovery, productivity and pricing excellence, which was highlighted earlier in the call today. Third, to maintain execution consistency, we have introduced a balanced score card operating system. We are transitioning to a dual-source supply chain, and we are implementing lean digital processes like sales and inventory planning. Fourth, we are reconfirming our commitment to 90% to 100% cash conversion and a healthy balance sheet while building a bolt-on M&A pipeline focused on North American HVACR. Fifth, we will enhance our technology leadership through the frequent regulatory transitions by winning in core climate heat pump and investing in digital AI/ML adoption across all our business functions. Fixed and finally, we are reinforcing our high-performance talent and culture by rolling out guiding behaviors to support our core values. In addition, we are undertaking succession planning and ensuring that our compensation scheme remains aligned with value creation. Once again, I would like to thank our employees who are working hard to successfully implement this self-help transformation plan. To close our prepared remarks, I would like to summarize on Page 12, the reasons why I believe LII is an attractive investment opportunity. Lennox is a narrowly focused North American leader in the attractive industry of energy-efficient, environmentally friendly HVACR solutions. We operate in high-growth end markets with strong replacement demand that provides us with resiliency even during periods of economic uncertainty. The company has a unique direct-to-dealer network, which creates a sustainable competitive advantage. And we have a history of robust execution with disciplined capital allocation. As I complete my first year at Lennox, I'm even more excited about Lennox's future and continue to believe that our best days are ahead of us. Thank you. Joe, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions now. Britney, let's go to Q&A. Good morning, Joe. Yes. So Joe, on the commercial, we are pleased with the progress. We had talked about earlier that we think there's a reset coming in the first quarter of this year. Given that many of our key accounts had to be repriced with the sea change and the new product addition. And you saw that loudly reflected in our P&L. So that's consistent with what we expected. We had also talked about almost a little over under a year ago, $100 million in EBIT improvement. And over the past few quarters, we have already delivered $60 of that $100 million. So yes, we are a little ahead of where we expected, and that's a good thing. We remain on that journey. I think we are going to get to that $100 million faster than what we had originally talked about, just given we are more than halfway through with that. And with supply chains improving, demand remaining strong, we still expect high single-digit growth this year, and we still expect margins to hold. And no, there was nothing unusual in Q1, we would expect the performance trajectory to continue going forward. Sure. So I think let me start with the end consumer, right, because that's how we look at it. I mean the end consumer demand seems to be holding pretty well. From our perspective \u2013 as you know, this was not a great season from a heating perspective. It was unseasonably warm in quite a few parts of the country. Despite that, we talk about that in our direct-to-dealer business, we had flat drive units coming through. And on our two-step motor, we had declines, and that was largely destocking driven. So from our perspective, the end consumer demand remains healthy. There's obviously a slowdown in growth but we don't see any declines coming up because the replacement business is holding pretty steady. For the rest of the year, Joe, I will expect a decline in direct mostly because of residential new construction. That slowed last year, and that's going to impact our demand now. On two-step, I think the declines get better. So I think in Q2, we will see less destocking that we saw in Q1 and Q3, we will probably see a little to no destocking as that gets behind us. We're only in April, May, June are bigger months for us than in April. But overall, we remain confident in the full year outlook of mid-single-digit unit decline with 0% to 4% revenue growth for us as we look at all these factors combined together. Thanks, Joe. Hi, Nicole. Yes. I mean, commercial, listen, overall, for the long-term, we expect that business to be a 20% ROS business. And Q1 was good, but we were only at a 16%. So I think there's still room for improvement for us. I don't want to accurately try and predict Q3, Q4 or Q2. I mean we don't have that level of precision. But I would see no reason why our typical seasonality trend won't hold this quarter. Because remember, this quarter, we also had some inefficiencies related to the CEO transition as we completed those. So stay tuned. I mean, I think we're starting at a good spot and \u2013 do you expect to end in a few years at closer to 20%. Yes. So the new price actions that we talked about are on the residential side. On commercial, we had a reset going into this year. So I think the price cost benefit that you saw \u2013 we will see the levels to remain the same, but obviously, we start going through more difficult comps because we had done significant price increases. So the year-over-year comps get difficult, but I think the levels on a as this basis remains where we have to do more pricing effort is on the residential side, and that's where we are putting a lot of our emphasis and focus, and that's where the new price increase that we talked about goes into effect in June 18. Hi, Tommy. I think as we went through the tornado many years ago as we went through COVID and significant inflation, we went into more of a command and control more because we had to. Those were crisis that we're managing. Historically, we have really good territory managers. We have really good branch leaders. We have really good folks. We have good field intelligence. And we need to act accordingly, just like a distributor does because although we had a manufacturer, our 250 outlets act more as a distributor. So as we are looking at [indiscernible], we want to give more input, more say to local pricing decisions versus looking at things doing more centrally. And so obviously, you want to set our strategy centrally, but our local field force have a lot more market intelligence and look at every region behaving a little differently. So that was the comment was we're going to optimize it, and that's a pretty typical thing for us to do because pricing in South Florida may be very different than pricing in North Dakota. And we need to make sure that we appropriately account for those differences. No, I think it will be a balance between residential and commercial. Listen, Commercial had a good start. I think residential has lots of room for improvement with the price, with the mixing with the inventory level coming down. So I'm optimistic on residential, and we are driving that hard. Commercial did have easy comps to compared to where we started in Q1 last year, Tommy look at that. I think the overall profit increase for this year would be balanced between those two as residential. The benefit of sea change also is going to happen a little slower than commercial because commercial, we didn't have as much finished good inventory sitting around. And in residential, we sold quite a bit of a lower SEER products in Q1 as we are finishing that inventory. So I think putting it all together, we are equally optimistic about residential improving for the rest of the year. Thanks. Hi, Jeff. Yes. I mean listen, costs keep going up. I mean you saw steel has been up significantly. Copper started to go back up. And what we also did is just like you would expect good companies, too, we did a pricing benchmark on where we stand. So I think the price increase in June is a targeted price increase. We targeted areas where we think we have greater opportunities. And that's because for the past couple of years, we were sort of doing brute-force price increases versus what I would call sophisticated price increases. So a lot of that is working with our own analytics and our teams to go through that. And fully offset the inflation and make sure we remain competitive in the market and capture the adequate balance. So, it's a lot of details and analytics behind it, Jeff, but we remain confident the right thing to do and support the industry pricing level. On the second part of your question, I mean remember the equipment price is only a small portion, less than half of what the consumer pays or sees in there. And we have seen no pullback because the repair versus replacement dynamics, in fact, still favors replacement, given that repairs are more expensive, our 22 units are very hard to repair or the cost of 20 is going up and cost of spare parts and labor has gone up more than the cost of equipment. So we haven't seen any changes, and I think they are consistent with the industry. Well, obviously, we remain closely aligned with 10,000 dealers, and we keep getting their feedback, and we will adjust if anything changes. Thanks, Jeff. Yes. We're seeing some good demand on the education. So that's predominantly a summer season, though when the schools are out of season, and we can get in and do the replacement work. So schools are more of a Q2 kind of Q3 dynamic more than Q1. Right now, it's still just executing our backlog that we've had for quite a while, and we're seeing good demand across most of the channels. I mean, it's hard to say in April, I mean April doesn't really give a trend. I mean if you think about the key drivers of the volume decline in Q1, almost all of it was destocking right? So I mean, if I take that destocking part, and I would say Q2 we'll see some de some more destocking. I don't know if it be as extensive as Q1, probably not because Q1 was the most pullback as people completed so transitions and knew that they were comfortable stock, and that's what we expected. I think Q2, there'll be a little less destocking. Q3 will be minimal to zero and then Q4, we should be done with destocking. So I think that's the way to think about it. And the user demand seems to be holding just fine. I mean, there's no growth that we saw rapid growth that we saw during COVID in other places, but that demand seems to be holding just fine. And RNC, residential new construction, we can predict very well. Because the housing starts is what drive it. So I think the volume declines moderate. It won't be 8% in Q2, Q3. But in Q4, to your specific portion, I'm not sure if it returned to growth because that will depend on the residential new construction. It's looking better. We started the year thinking it will be down 20% right now, it looks like it's closer to 10% from a housing start perspective, we just need to watch and monitor that Julian. Yes. I guess having done pricing back in my consulting days, I strongly believe that all three levers are important, setting, getting and netting \u2013 so I think it's important. In some of these cases, yes, we had strong discipline. And during COVID and other cases, as we pulled back on non-critical activities, some of these just had to give that we had to focus on other things such as recovery on, COVID looking at supporting the volume constraint. So I think we have that muscle. We've got to kind of make sure we retrain it. We make sure we find it and deploy it. A lot of this is also around, we have structural advantages when it comes to serving some of the large accounts, whether it's we call it national accounts or key accounts and it's going to be for us to work jointly with our customers to find the lowest cost way to serve them and create win-win situations there. Because we are direct, right? We can optimize a lot of freight, distribution and make it win-win for us and these large growing often like a sponsor-owned dealer network. So we think that's a big opportunity. Where it's less about what the list price is, but it's more about what's margin on both sides, and we have an opportunity to optimize that. So we used to do it very well. We lost some ground just because we had to focus on other areas. We are bringing that back, and we are excited about the structural advantage we have in going after larger accounts where the cost to serve would be lower on both sides. I think what you saw is our inventories definitely grew in Q1, but that's normal with our seasonal nature of our business. We always grow inventory in the first quarter. And then we will burn that off in Q2 and Q3 built into the guide that burn off of the inventory. We're going to look to potentially do a little bit more. We think there may be some upside to exceed the free cash guide. But it's normal to build inventory as we did in Q1. Hey, Josh. Sure. I mean, Josh, I think the simple answer is all of them. I mean we have an opportunity with smaller dealers because we underserve them post the tornado. I mean we were known for our endo Signature Series products. We had really good partnerships and because we didn't have enough inventory or service levels, many of them were forced to look somewhere else. So we need to win them back. And I think that's where a lot of the local autonomy, the improved service levels and all of that goes into, right? Second part of that is just geographic based on legacy and driven, I mean, our market share in South Florida is much lower than our market share in Marshalltown, Iowa, and that's been for years. I mean that's where a lot of the efforts we have done, including increasing our reach, investing in our distribution footprint, getting more heat pump coverage, all of that has, I think second factor is geographic. Third, to come back to the national dealers or the larger dealers, that's where we have a structural advantage and it's a different, more sophisticated approach of working with them on trying to make sure that we create a win-win partnership. So, Josh, we have opportunities in all three areas. And don't forget at the same time our indirect business, which is also doing very well. So, when I talked about that direct, on the indirect side, where we are targeting through Allied, our independent distribution network and giving them a stronger, better value proposition, that works well. So, I think all four are important, right. Smaller dealers that we lost unfortunately during and after the tornado, truly looking at regional expansion, going into key accounts and getting to make sure we have a win-win value proposition and finally, continuing to expand our two-step model as well because we believe we have a unique value proposition. So, those are kind of our four levers for market share gain. Sure. Michael will answer that question, but let me just clarify. Maybe what I was saying is that not all our sales in Q1 were the new SEER products, about one-third of our sales in Q1 are still the older SEER products as you are going. But no, majority of the sale in Q1 did shift to new SEER, but Michael can actually break down the mix benefits for you. Yes. We don't break out e-commerce sales by quarter. But needless to say, as we talked in the Investor Day, it's a very important channel for us. We look at over a third of our sales as we mentioned at the Investor Day, go through e-commerce. We find that all of those are very sticky customers, and that continues to grow. So, I think the numbers we disclosed in December still hold or better, but we don't break that out quarterly, nor do we think it's relevant to break it out quarterly. But it's an important part of our growth strategy. And what we are even more excited about is to be able to leverage those data and the relationship and using artificial intelligence and machine learning to make critical decisions, everything from inventory planning to pricing, also looking at making it easier for our dealers from predictive maintenance perspective and others. It's a huge investment for us, very important for us, but the quarterly breakdown of that is not something we think is relevant. Well, first of all, I would say really pleased to have a conservative CFO. So, I think that will be the first start point on that, Ryan. Listen, it definitely helps. And when we said 3 years, we really looked at that being like our external commitment. Internally, obviously, we were driving it to a faster pace. I think the SEER transition worked well for us. I mean as we looked at the factory converting over, the labor stabilizing, getting the new products, which I give full credit to the team as we were also able to rationalize our SKUs. So, we have like 40% less SKU in the factories working through and simplifying. So, a lot of just core discipline was restored. We make a step forward with SKU rationalization. We were able to work with our key accounts because these new SKUs were not covered by some of the legacy contracts, so all of those. So, I think we \u2013 if there was like an optimistic scenario and a conservative scenario, we were probably guiding you guys to the midpoint of that. And right now, we are fighting on cylinders to hit closer to be optimistic. But it's within the range of what we thought Ryan. Not substantial. I mean there is weather related, right. Because the winter was mild in certain cases, Northeast did not do well, but I think that's an industry-wide factor. Southern states did well, but I think it could also be because some of our competitors stumbled during this year transition and we had inventory. So, I think some of the Southern states, we saw particular strength. But nothing that I could call out or give you the dubious answer on, Ryan. Good morning Nigel. Yes. That's fair. And I think these things typically, given the abrupt nature of the regulations, but the difference between North and South, I think we all have got \u2013 I mean all industry players have got sophisticated on starting to make them in Q4 and continue selling them through end of kind of Q2 to make sure the inventory doesn't become like E&O time excess and obsolete. So, I think we have done \u2013 all have done a good job with that. I am glad you are going to leave us to define normal. I am going to leave it to somebody else. So, it's hard to fine normal, but here is the thing, right. I mean wages are not going back. So, let's put it in that perspective. But our factories are still fairly inefficient. Lot of the inefficiencies that trapped in, including expedited rate, including overtime, including line rates running below normal, those still persist. And Q1 was actually a little bit worse on that because we had to go through SEER change. So, imagine retooling all your lines and getting to new products, which were completely new design for us. Remember, there are three new models that we introduced at the beginning of the year. So, I think there is still room for productivity improvement for us going forward. Our priority is still output there, right. I mean I think the more we can produce, the more we can find. We are still limited by our Board. But getting the output up, getting manufacturing productivity and working on the second factory, remember, all of this is still based on the existing factory. Once we have two factories and can truly look at one being focused on made to stock, going after emergency replacement, making standard products at very high velocity, very high efficiency and the other being on made to order for key accounts specific. I mean that's out of our vision that hasn't changed. We just got to the one factory improvement sooner. Sure. So and when we say two-step, we mean ADP and Allied. So, combined together, and you are right. I mean the volume was down in the range you mentioned. We have very good relationship with this channel, and we have good visibility, that's the reason we are kind of hinting at, we would expect destocking to continue in Q2 and then beginning of Q3 or beginning of second half. We think that will be behind us. It's hard to quantify because every distributor is different, right. I mean nobody has the same exact operating rhythm as somebody else in a different state. But the amount of excess inventory that the distributors are holding is \u2013 should be compete with destocking by beginning of Q3. Yes. I mean I will point out to a few different things, right. First of all, remember, the $100 million we had said does not include the second factory benefit. So, I think we are still holding to that. So, the second factory, we have started construction. Things are moving along well. We expect to be under roof by the end of the year. We would expect production sometime next year. So, that will give a significant benefit as we have two factories, very focused operating to serve our customers really well. So, that's going to be one part. Second on that is, I think there is significant opportunity for us to continue looking at our service growth. Service is a very attractive business for us, and we were not fully focused on that, given all the disruptions happening here. So, getting service and increasing our service focus, which is good margin, it's repeatable, and it's predictable, and gives us great insight for equipment sales. I think the service would really help us well. And finally going back to the manufacturing inefficiencies, I don't want to rule that out. I mean we are in the early stages of working through manufacturing inefficiencies and getting all of those out of the system. So, long term we are committed to 20%-plus ROS across both the segments. And we are excited about all the steps. And those are sort of the things I have mentioned in the last page, when I talked about the six key self-help initiatives we are working on. They kind of equally apply to both residential and commercial. Hi Brett. I will take the second question first. So, on the mix side, no, I mean we don't have large projects that funnel through the pipeline or anything, right. I mean these are all projects and these are products that we price accordingly. So, no, the margin in our backlog is no different than the margin we are expecting in Q1, if that's your question, right. We have good visibility into that margin, and it's all good, nothing to worry about there. On the overall demand visibility, it's everything from some key accounts who want to plan 2025 volume right now post the low GWP to people on emergency replacement who wants product tomorrow. But our backlog is healthy. I mean the industry lead times remain stretched. I mean today, if somebody places an order, whether it's our sort of competition, chances of getting a product this year is low. I mean you would likely get into Q4 next year. So, I think there is some flexibility here and there, but that's kind of the demand visibility we have. It's pretty solid going forward, both from actual revenue, sales and also margin perspective. As you know, already we made a decision last year to make the portfolio move, which includes divestment of our European operation. We like being laser-like focused on North America HVAC-R business. It's a very large industry. We have low share. I think our focus is going to help us win. So, I think we are currently 100% committed to remaining North America HVAC/R player. We still have lots of bolt-on opportunities here, whether it's about service or expanding our line card, so our stores can be more efficient and looking at other opportunities. So, I think for us, never say never, but currently, we like our laser focus, and I think that will help us win share, that will help us through the transition. Everybody at Lennox gets up every morning and is focused on winning in North America HVAC-R. And all our 11,000 employees focus in that direction. We are confident that's a winning formula for us. And if you guys want to diversify for other international, you can always buy shares in other international companies. Thank you. Hi Steve. We didn't comment specifically on April, but I will tell you, it's consistent with what we expected. And April is a hard month given that most of the summer sales stops in kind of May and June. But there is nothing in April that would have caused us to change our full year outlook. Sure. So, let's start with the two segments separately, right. So, on the commercial, we did redesign our product, and that's what we were referring to earlier. So, we launched three new models and replaced most of our legacy that included significant SKU rationalization, more modular design and more modern. So commercial, we did redesign our product line. On residential, we had to redesign our outdoor units just because air conditioning and heat pump, but that's what regulation does. We did not re-launch an indoor unit because our indoor units are still very new. They were launched just a year or so ago. And they are already very high efficiency and they are compatible. So, we believe that gives us competitive advantage in the marketplace is that our new higher air conditioning and heat pump units are backwards compatible with our existing furnaces and air handlers indoor. So, that's the piece I think of the product strategy we had mentioned earlier. Yes. We call it a targeted price increase, Steve. And I think a lot of the discussions, the customers are starting now. So, I would rather not go into terms of details in that one. But the answer is we believe that this is the right step for us to be more competitively priced in the marketplace. From a consumer perspective, this is a small portion of the overall cost. And all we are doing is making sure we can offset inflation. You will notice in our full year guide, we now talk about $175 million in pricing benefits, earlier we have given a range with the high end at $175 million, and we took our commodity inflation up by offsetting $10 million. So, that's kind of where we are on the numbers. Yes. We just to remove the range and stuck with the high number. Thank you. Sure. So first of all, we are very proud of Allied. I mean they have done great over the past many years. I mean the business has grown up 4x. I mean the margins have expanded beautifully. And I think Joan [ph] and the team have done a fabulous job taking that. At the same time, we don't think we are anywhere close to being done. We have significant room for improvement. I can easily see that business doubling again over the next 5 years as we continue to add distributors to have a very focused product portfolio that wins a lot of awards and we truly focus on best serving these independent distributors. So, excited about Allied, we think there is a lot of growth potential ahead. At the same time, I don't want to break down $300 million in opportunity between business A and B. Ideally, both of them will get it, right. I mean ideally, we would both get the $300 million targets and we deliver more to the shareholders. The super excited about Allied, I think we have share gain opportunities on direct and in indirect, we will keep driving both of them. No. And we don't break out margins. I just \u2013 we would remain committed to 20% margin on residential overall. And it's hard to kind of break down margin artificially because remember, we share the same infrastructure for manufacturing, product development and all of that. So, that just becomes allocation game, right."

            "name": "Joe Reitmeier",
            "content": "Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. Looking at the quarter for Lennox overall, the company posted strong revenue and profit growth, core revenue, which excludes our European operations was a record $990 million, up 3% compared to prior year. Both our Residential and Commercial segments experienced sales volume declines, but price execution and favorable product mix more than offset the volume headwinds. Total adjusted segment profit increased $24 million or 20% versus prior year. Price and mix exceeded product cost inflation by $63 million with partial offsets of $17 million from lower volume and $22 million for inflationary effects and investments in distribution and SG&A expenses. Total adjusted margin was 14.4%, up 210 basis points, with most of the margin expansion driven by performance in our Commercial segment. In the first quarter, corporate expenses increased $6 million to $19 million due to the timing of incentive compensation expenses. Moving on to net income and cash flow performance, starting on Slide 7. The first quarter not only achieved record levels of revenue and segment profit but also marked record earnings per share with GAAP earnings per share rising 20% to $2.75, and adjusted EPS growing by 15% to $2.83. Our first quarter adjusted net income included a 21.4% tax rate, and diluted shares outstanding were $35.6 million compared to $36.4 million in the prior year quarter. The company used $79 million of cash in operations compared to a use of $98 million in the prior year. Working capital optimization is a priority, and we remain on track to achieve our 2023 cash flow target. Capital expenditures were approximately $35 million for the quarter, an increase of $10 million compared to prior year. Capital investments will be higher this year as we fund growth and increased capacity including a new factory for our commercial business. We used $114 million of free cash flow compared to a use of $123 million in the prior year quarter. In the quarter, the company paid approximately $38 million in dividends. Total debt was $1.67 billion at the end of the quarter, and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $48 million at the end of the quarter. Moving to the business segments, starting on Slide 8, where our Residential segment delivered record fourth quarter revenue. Residential revenue was flat to prior year as sales volume declines of 8%, were offset with 4% favorable price, 5% favorable mix and 1% unfavorable foreign exchange. Total sales, which go direct to dealer represent about 70% of our segment revenue and were up mid-single digits. The remaining 30% of our revenue goes through distributors where total revenues were down low teens, the result of expected industry destocking. Residential segment profit rose 3% to $111 million, a first quarter record. Segment margin expanded 50 basis points to 16.3% as continued pricing gains more than offset product cost inflation of our new minimum efficiency standard products drove favorable mix. Partially offsetting these gains were $12 million of lower volumes and $16 million from inflationary headwinds on distribution and selling and administrative expenses, where we've made investments to fuel growth. Turning to Slide 9 in our commercial business, as announced in our last earnings call, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, the Commercial segment results will include our North American refrigeration operations. Our European operations will be reported in our Corporate and Other segment until we complete the divestiture of the European businesses. Revenue was $309 million in the quarter, up 10%. Combined price and mix were up 16% and volume was down 6%. Commercial segment profit was up 110% and segment margin expanded 770 basis points to 16.2%. We are pleased with the profit recovery in our commercial segment where price and favorable mix were the main contributors to profit growth early in the year. In the first quarter, we successfully transitioned our HVAC products to the new minimum efficiency standard, but industry-wide supply chain challenges constrained production output and continue to limit sales volumes. Demand from customers remains robust with a solid order backlog. While supply chain challenges persist, lead times to our commercial customers are shortening and are competitive with the industry. Turning to Slide 10, let's review our 2023 full year guidance. Our outlook provided on our last conference call remains unchanged. As a reminder, I will reiterate a few guidance points. We expect core revenue to be flat to up 4% for the full year and earnings per share of between a range of $14.25 per share to $15.25 per share. Free cash flow is targeted within a range of $250 million to $350 million. We are planning capital expenditures of $250 million that includes investment in a second commercial factory and investments related to refrigerant transition to take effect in 2025. Price benefit, including price associated with the 2023 SEER transition is now expected to be $175 million. And we now expect net material cost to be a $45 million headwind in 2023. The material cost headwind is driven by component cost inflation of $100 million, net of $30 million in savings from cost reduction initiatives, along with $25 million from commodity cost benefits. Corporate expenses are still targeted at $80 million. We will manage SG&A tightly while continuing to manage necessary investments in the businesses to support growth initiatives and drive productivity. And finally, we still expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between 35 million to 36 million shares, which incorporates our plans to repurchase $100 million to $200 million of stock this year. With that, let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll turn it back to Alok. Yes, Jeff, I think, once again, first and fourth quarters were seasonally or lites, \u2013 we've got a lot of the year still in front of us and just didn't really want to \u2013 once again, we approach it with conservative. Cautious optimism, I think, is the right way to characterize it. We remain confident and are gauging the underlying markets, but just wanted to get into the peak season before we made a call on the full year. Yes. And a few more things, Juliane. Where we've put a concerted effort was preserving our national account customers. Once again, that strategy, I think, is paying off for us. as once again, the order rates and backlog remain strong there. And then as we continue to reengage in the emergency replacement segment of the market, that should provide us additional upside more in the second half than first half. But regardless of how the underlying vertical is performing, we still think, given where our business is positioned today, we still have tremendous runway, particularly in the second half of the year. And if I can just jump on that. I mean, if you go back again a few years ago, when we were turning inventory at 5 to 6x a year and we still have room for improvement there. I mean, right now, we are taking it at 3 to 4x. So I think over the 3-year planning period, you can expect us to go back to turning inventory at the historical levels. Driven by finished goods optimization that Michael mentioned, but also raw material supply chains became extended, we bulked up on raw material, and we don't want to do anything crazy here, but over the next 2 to 3 years in a very disciplined manner, working with our suppliers and our customers, we are going to drive our inventory turns to be better. Yes. It's a situation where I think we are doing all that we can. Once again, our priorities are elevating our service levels with our customers, making sure we have got the right mix of product to meet end market demand and then continuing to pull forward, and we are done that to some extent, Josh, you noticed is our capital expenditures are $250 million. $50 million of that is associated with staying ahead of the 2025 transition. So, we are making those investments pulling ahead those activities that we can't deliver that value to our customers. And once again, much like we did with the minimum efficiency transition this year, seamlessly attack what's ahead of us in 2025. Thanks. And I think our direct-to-dealer strategy benefits us due to the destocking in the two-step channels. So, once again, I think we were probably unjustly criticized for losing share as the two-step channel stocked up. Once again, as it destocks, we will see some of that benefit in the form of additional share."

            "content": "Hey, Julien, this is Michael. Yes, on the commercial side, the backlog still is healthy. We're seeing good demand across most of our verticals. New construction is kind of 15%, 20% of that business. We're not seeing any credit issues yet, but the backlog is definitely still healthy going \u2013 reaching into Q3. So we're really not seeing a pullback on the demand yet. Backlogs are extended a little bit because of some of the lead times in the factory. But from a demand perspective, it still looks healthy. Alright. Yes. In residential, we did see favorable mix. It's predominantly for the SEER transition. As we have talked about previously, it acts more as volume than price. So, it dropped through to about a 30% drop-through that we saw in residential. We should start to see that for the rest of the year to similar 30% drop-through on the benefit for the mix shift. And a little bit higher margins on the drop-through on the commercial as we are able to get some additional pricing on top of that, but should be about a 30% drop-through that we see in residential."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Chelsey Pulcheon from Lennox Investor Relations team. Chelsey, please go ahead.\nChelsey Pulcheon: Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we share a remarkable 2024 third quarter results. Joining me is CEO, Alok Maskara, and CFO, Michael Quenzer. Each will share their prepared remarks before we move to the Q&A session. Turning to Slide 2, a reminder that during today's call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as outlined on this page. We may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management considers relevant indicators of underlying business performance. Please refer to our SEC filings available on our Investor Relations website for additional details, including a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP measures. The earnings release, today's presentation, and the webcast archived link for today's call are available on our Investor Relations website at investor.lennox.com. Now please turn to Slide 3 as I turn the call over to our CEO, Alok Maskara.\nAlok Maskara: Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning, everyone. Lennox delivered another record quarter, highlighted by double-digit revenue growth, operating margin exceeding 20%, and strong free cash flow. We also made solid progress on multiple key initiatives as part of our ongoing transformation plan. I am grateful for our talented team and the growth mindset of our customers who enabled these exceptionally strong results. Let's turn to Slide 3 for the highlights of this quarter. Core revenue grew 15% and our adjusted segment margin expanded 90 basis points to a Q3 record of 20.2%, resulting in adjusted earnings per share increase of 24% to $6.68. We generated an impressive $452 million in operating cash flow this quarter, which is $139 million or approximately 44% increase over the same quarter last year. Our industry-leading ROIC also grew to 47%. Both our segments, HCS and BCS, achieved 15% revenue growth in the quarter and both continued to deliver strong segment profit. Investments in manufacturing capacity and front-end redesign has enabled us to gain share and meet customer demand for R-410A products. In addition, investments in digital processes and distribution technologies led to improved order fill rates within Home Comfort Solutions. The new commercial factory startup remains on track and the Building Climate Solutions segment successfully integrated the AES acquisition ahead of schedule. These results reflect the dedication of our 14,000 employees and the continued support of our dealers and customers. Therefore, I am confident in raising our 2024 EPS guidance range to $20.75 to $21. Now please turn to Slide 4 for more details on our CLO transition. As announced earlier this morning, John Torres, Lennox's Chief Legal Officer has elected to retire. I want to take a moment to acknowledge John's outstanding 16 years of leadership and his lasting impact on Lennox. He led multiple acquisitions and divestitures to streamline our portfolio and ensure that we operate with the highest ethical standards by strengthening our ethics and compliance office. As a result of our thoughtful succession planning, we are excited for Monica Brown as she takes on the role of Chief Legal Officer effective January 1, 2025. Monica has been with Lennox for 12 years with a proven track record across our businesses and legal functions. Before joining Lennox, she spent nearly 13 years with the leading outside law firm. Looking ahead, Monica is well-positioned to continue John's legacy of success with a focus on advancing our digital capabilities and accelerating future growth. Now let me hand the call over to Michael to take us through the details of our Q3 financial performance.\nMichael Quenzer: Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. We are pleased to report our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year adjusted earnings per share growth. This quarter, we increased our adjusted segment margin by 90 basis points and achieved a remarkable 15% revenue growth, resulting in 24% adjusted EPS growth. Now I will share more details on our third quarter financial results. Core revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, up nearly $200 million from last year, attributed mostly to volume gains in both segments. Adjusted segment profit increased by $52 million or 21%, driven by $86 million in volume as well as price and mix benefits. This was partially offset by regulatory transition costs and expenses related to our new commercial factory ramp-up. Ongoing investments also impacted profits as we are committed to strategic initiatives in sales and distribution to support consistent profitable growth. The tax rate was 18.7% and diluted shares outstanding were $35.8 million compared to $35.7 million in the prior year quarter. Let's now turn to Slide 6 and review the third quarter financial performance of the Home Comfort Solutions segment. The Home Comfort Solutions segment had an exceptional quarter, delivering 15% revenue growth, 25% segment profit growth, and an impressive 170 basis point expansion in segment profit margin. Sales volumes increased by 11%, fueled by over 30% growth in our two-step distributor channel, primarily reflecting normal restocking after several quarters of industry-wide destocking. Our one-step contractor channel saw modest volume growth supported by R-410A availability compared to the broader market. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw early signs of R-410A provide demand. Pricing execution has been a key focus for the HCS segment over the past year, driving 4% revenue growth in the quarter. Having successfully met our 2024 price improvement targets, we are now concentrating on pricing for the new R-454B products and these initiatives are progressing well. Finally, our quarterly profit was impacted by anticipated product cost challenges during our transition to our new R-454B products and for ongoing investments aimed at enhancing our distribution capabilities and improving the overall customer experience. Moving on to Slide 7. The Building Climate Solutions segment also delivered an impressive 15% revenue growth in the third quarter, 6% of which can be attributed to inorganic growth from our AES acquisition. We are very pleased with this acquisition, which was completed in the fourth quarter of last year. The integration was finished ahead of schedule and we have delivered better than expected AES profit margins, driven by additional synergies. From an organic growth perspective, sales volume was up 7% in the quarter but was constrained by manufacturing challenges and new factory ramp-up inefficiencies that limited production output. Segment profit increased by $9 million, though profit margin declined due to anticipated manufacturing ramp-up costs. Production startup at our new commercial factory in Saltillo, Mexico, remains on track. However, total manufacturing output for commercial HVAC continues to be below demand levels. For emergency replacement, we have started offering products in some pilot markets and early results are encouraging. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will review our cash flow performance and capital deployment strategies. Operating cash flow for the quarter totaled $452 million compared to $313 million in the same period last year. Capital expenditures were $40 million, representing $1 million increase year-over-year. Our cash flow performance has been solid this year, reflecting ongoing efforts to drive revenue growth, expand profit margins, and optimize working capital. Earlier this year, we implemented working capital initiatives with a focus on accounts payable, which has been a driver of the $183 million increase in year-to-date operating cash flow. In the coming years, we will unlock additional working capital by leveraging digital tools and efficient processes. Our return on invested capital, ROIC, stands at 47%, an industry-leading figure that remains resilient across business cycles due to high non-discretionary replacement demand. We continue to expand ROIC year-over-year, while also making capital investments that are poised to deliver substantial benefits in the coming years. Finally, we maintain a healthy balance sheet with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 0.8 times, down from 1.8 times in the prior year. Our free cash flow deployment strategy remains focused on driving annual dividend growth and executing bolt-on acquisitions. We have reinitiated buybacks in the third quarter and we'll continue leveraging share repurchases to efficiently return excess cash to shareholders. If you will now turn to Slide 9, I will review our revised 2024 financial guidance. After the third quarter results and more visibility into the last quarter of the year, we have raised our full year revenue guidance. The table on the left summarizes our full year revenue growth factors. Total company core revenue is now projected to increase by approximately 10%. We now expect mid-single digit improvement in sales volumes, combined price and mix to be up low-single digits, and our AES acquisition to contribute low-single digit growth. As a result of our strong third quarter profit performance, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance to $20.75 to $21 from the previously guided range of $19.50 to $20.25. We are also raising our free cash flow guidance to $575 million to $650 million. As you can see, most of our other guide points have not changed except for interest expense, which is now estimated to be approximately $45 million. Overall, year-to-date performance combined with increased clarity on industry demand has given us the confidence to significantly raise our earnings per share guidance. With that, please turn to Slide 10, and I'll turn it back over to Alok for an overview of the low GWP Refrigerant transition.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks, Michael. All necessary preparations for design, engineering, and manufacturing of the low GWP products were completed earlier in the year, ensuring a successful launch in the third quarter. As part of this transition, we are also excited to introduce our new Lennox powered by Samsung Mini-Split and VRF heat pump systems. We have invested heavily in developing new low GWP products and minimizing disruptions during the transition. We anticipate continued manufacturing cost headwinds into the first quarter of next year as we continue to convert production lines in our factories. Our approach to reconfiguring our factories balances production flexibility with cost efficiency. In 2025, we expect a gradual shift in demand for the new low GWP Refrigerant products. The first half of the year, specifically the first quarter, we'll see continued R-410A sales from manufacturers, distributors, and dealers as everyone depletes their regular and pre-bought R-410A inventory. We still estimate that for the full year, approximately 65% of the end-market demand will transition to low GWP product, which will favorably impact mix. Looking further ahead, we anticipate existing 410A refrigerant will face price increases as supply items and demand moves towards low GWP products. This will increase cost pressure on repairs, leading to higher demand for system replacements. This transition also opens more service opportunities for dealers and contractors given additional safety features and components in the new R-454B products. We expect some of the low GWP price and mix benefits to extend into 2026 as the market fully transitions to the new low GWP product. With that, please turn to Slide 11 for our early thinking on the outlook for 2025. We are pleased with the resilience of the North America HVAC industry growth. We remain cautiously optimistic for 2025, given our sustained competitive momentum from our ongoing transformation journey. On the left-hand side of the slide, you will see several factors that will likely impact revenue growth in 2025. Mix benefits from the low GWP transition with 10% plus price increases will accelerate growth. Lennox has historically executed extremely well during these regulatory transitions, gaining share and confidence from our dealers and distributors. We plan to do the same thing next year. We anticipate higher manufacturing output from our commercial HVAC factories within our BCS segment. In conjunction with the investment we made in our sales team this year, we will be able to recapture some of the previously lost share in the emergency replacement market. Moreover, these improvements will instill greater confidence in our ability to serve national accounts with a full lifecycle value proposition. We are encouraged by the growth opportunities from partnering with Samsung for our ductless heat pump offering, strengthening brand recognition, and providing access to a broader customer base. Increased incentives for energy-efficient system may lead to higher replacement demand as well as a higher tier mix. While we are generally optimistic about 2025 revenue growth, it is important to recognize our outlook can be impacted by several end-market factors. Uncertain consumer confidence continues to pose challenges alongside a trend towards more value tiered products, which may negatively impact mix. Higher cost for the new products may also create complexities in the ongoing repair versus replace dynamics. From an industry perspective, we expect destocking in the first half of 2025 as distributors sell through R-410A pre-buys this year. Additionally, competitors may gain some share as they overcome their current availability challenges. On the right-hand side of the slide, we have highlighted key drivers for margin expansion. We anticipate margin improvements from the low GWP product mix with 30% incrementals, supported by our continued focus on price cost discipline. We also foresee improvements in productivity from higher distribution fill rates as our focus on digital inventory planning and our investment in distribution technologies start to generate results. Greater factory efficiency will also contribute to our margin expansion, particularly in the second half of next year as we begin to lap the ramp-up costs associated with the new commercial factory and low GWP transition. However, these gains may be partially offset by several factors. Our investments in digital capabilities and distribution network improvements are essential for enhancing operational efficiency and improving customer experience. While these investments are crucial for long-term growth, they may create some near-term pressure on margins. Additionally, we anticipate inflationary pressures for both commodities and component cost. We also expect increases in healthcare and employee benefit costs. Ultimately, our focus in 2025 remains on superior execution to drive differentiated growth and expand margins. We will provide further financial guidance when we report our Q4 earnings early next year. Now please turn to Slide 12. As we wrap up today's call, I want to emphasize our confidence in driving sustainable growth guided by five key elements of our strategic transformation plan. Our first focus is on accelerating growth by adding new customers as well as capturing a greater share of wallet from existing customers. Second, we will expand our margins from price cost productivity and leveraging the strength of our direct-to-dealer network. Third, the Lennox unified management system remains key to our success, helping us streamline operations, share best practices, and execute our strategy. Next, our ongoing investments in digital and heat pump technology keep us at the forefront of innovation to deliver cutting-edge solutions for our customers. And finally, our strong culture rooted in core values and reinforced by our pay-for-performance model drives our success. Our differentiated strategy continues to create sustained competitive advantages and will enable us to achieve our long-term goals. I'm incredibly proud of what we have accomplished so far and I have no doubt that our best days are still ahead of us. Thank you. We will be happy to take your questions now. Margo, let's go to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tommy Moll from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions.\nAlok Maskara: Good morning, Tommy.\nTommy Moll: Alok, I want to start on the A2L commentary that you've provided. I hear you talk about the 10% plus pricing tailwind versus the R-410A product, and then also about some early success with initiatives in recent weeks or months I guess. So if we pull all this together, am I correct in saying that, number one, the magnitude of the pricing mix tailwind is unchanged versus prior expectations? And then number two, that your conviction in successfully realizing that is higher now that you've introduced some product into the market, albeit at low volumes.\nAlok Maskara: I would say both are true, Tommy. The third thing I would add to is the competitive share gain that we get normally during any regulatory transition, the confidence in achieving that in this transition is also higher.\nTommy Moll: Thank you. Looking at the 2025 early thinking slide you provided, Alok, I wanted to unpack what you're referencing here in terms of the trend for the value tier and then the repair versus replaced? What have you seen to date on those points? And then what do you want to make sure to communicate about how that might evolve into next year? Thank you.\nAlok Maskara: Yes, what we have seen so far is not a meaningful shift between repair and replace, and -- but we continue to be cautious about it, especially given that the price of new equipment will rise. So we continue to monitor that and that's why I want to call it out. On the value tier shift, as we went from sort of 13 SEER to 14 SEER and as we look at the overall state of the economy, we have seen a shift towards more people buying the minimum SEER. It already used to be about 60%, 65% of the industry, so now it might be 65% to 70% of the industry. So that's what we are calling out in the value tier. No surprises, no changes from any of our previous conversations, just wanted to lay out the positives and the potential watch out for 2025, but really no change in Q3 that we are calling out.\nTommy Moll: Noted. Thank you, Alok. I'll turn it back.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks, Tommy.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll next go to Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. My first one is just on the 65% next year that will be A2L. Can you just talk about some of the assumptions you're making there? And then would you say the risk is to the upside there or to the downside? I know that is kind of a hard question, but.\nAlok Maskara: It is a hard question, but Ryan, we are here to answer your hard questions. Listen, I think the risk right now is fairly balanced around the number 65%. If you remember earlier in the year, we were talking about 50% to 65%, but right now we feel more confident around the 65% number. I think if it's a little lower, it could be because there is more pre-buy in 410A, which we will see in Q4. And if it's higher, it will because a lot of the competitors already out of 410A inventory right now. So as we're selling 410A, it could be used this quarter versus being left over for next year. So those are kind of the two dynamics on the 410A that we are selling today, does that land up becoming pre-buy, which I think is some chances or it's just because competitors are short on that product. So those will be the pluses and minuses on that, Ryan.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Okay. And then just on the pre-buy, clearly that helped the quarter. As we think about the first half of '25, can you quantify the magnitude just so we can set our models correctly?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So on the pre-buy, I'm not sure how much it helped Q3. I mean, if you think about Q3, what helped us was three different factors. First of all, the end of destocking and beginning of restocking, I mean, that was probably the largest contributor. As you saw, our two-step business was up over 30% or around 30%, so I think that's the biggest factor for what helped in Q3. Second, I would call out is just share gains. I mean, we've been gaining share just because of better execution and there was some impact of competitors running out of inventory. So I think share gains were the second factor. Third, which may have happened a little bit towards the tail end of the quarter is pre-buy. But remember, most of our business goes to dealers and unless they go start renting out big bonds, I mean, they're not going to be able to do a lot of pre-buy, and distributor inventory levels are still pretty close to normal. So I just want to emphasize the point on the pre-buy on how we expect. What we would expect, as said, is in Q1 next year, there clearly will be some depletion or destocking of pre-buy, maybe some carryover in Q2, but that gives us confidence in the 65% number, saying majority of the sales next year will be 454B.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll next go to Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.\nJoseph O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start on the market share comments that you've made. I mean, I think that going back to 2018 time period in tornado and a period of time of maybe two or three years of some share headwinds, it seems like over the past couple of years, those have reversed and you've been on a share gain trajectory. But can you just level set in terms of through these periods of time, how much you may have given up, how much you've recaptured net-net, where do you stand today, and how you're thinking about those share gain opportunities moving forward?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. I'll start by reaffirming what you said is that, yes, we have reversed those share losses and we are back on a positive trajectory. Because we do both one-step and two-step, share is a little difficult as we look at AHRI or any of those data. But today, where we stand because of all the moving pieces, we are confident that we have gained share and we continue to gain share. What we have to do next year is make sure that we can retain most of the captured share, because as competitors have inventory, which many of them don't right now on 410A product, then there would be like a lot of our effort going towards making sure our share gains are more permanent. On the commercial side, where also the share gain comment comes up, we have not been able to recover the share so far. That\u2019s part of our plan for 2025 on getting share back on the emergency replacement, because we are still constrained by manufacturing capacity, not demand in that segment. So I want to separate the shared comments into commercial and residential.\nJoseph O'Dea: Got it. And then, just wanted to circle back on the 454B pricing commentary and you've noted that the initiatives are progressing well, any color that you can provide on what that means in terms of or with respect to the 10% plus price? And I think there is still debate out there on how to think about that price and list versus realized, so any clarification there when you talk about 10% price and if that's a realized number?\nAlok Maskara: I think as we finish Q4, when we have greater clarity on market movements and acceptance, we can talk about that in early Q1. Right now, the 10% is what we are looking to gain out of a price. But realize, we'll apply to only 65% of sales and only the products that are 454B, and we will also be raising price on 410A next year. So the 10% has to be taken in conjunction with 410A pricing today. So there are a lot of moving pieces and we can provide greater clarity. But the overall where we are seeing in the marketplace is the higher cost products that we're introducing, 454B, is being supported by our and competitive moves on 10% plus price increase into 2025.\nJoseph O'Dea: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we're going to go to Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Hammond: Hi, good morning, guys.\nAlok Maskara: Hi, Jeff.\nJeffrey Hammond: Just -- I appreciate all the color on that 25 moving pieces. If we just kind of looked at the market today, what do you think that res unit and commercial unit kind of market growth looks like as you snap a line into '25? I know there is a number of moving pieces, some noise with the pre-buy, but just kind of underlying unit demand in each of the businesses.\nAlok Maskara: If you think about res and we talked about this earlier in the year that we expected for a dealer the volume to be flat-to-down, then halfway through the year, we upgraded to be flat, and now we're going to say flat to maybe slightly up is where we are on the res side. And I'm talking about installed units, away from stocking, destocking, but think of flat as the conservative, flat to slightly up as maybe a little bit more, like aggressive numbers to look at. But it's hard to come to that in a firm number as you know with the different moving pieces.\nMichael Quenzer: Yes, I think what we need to do is see this Q4 pre-buy play out and see kind of how that impacts the end-market demand as well as share gain initiatives as we've talked about. Normally, we've executed better than others during this transition. So those are two unknowns that we need to see how they play out over the next quarter.\nAlok Maskara: So we'll wait for AHRI, but I think flat to slightly up would be a good way to look at end-market non-residential. On commercial, since we remain supply-constrained, we just go with the industry figures, where I think the market has been growing slightly. It's still not fully recovered from the COVID decline that it happened, because our markets, remember, we don't have offices, we don't have as much multi-storey housing, what we call commercial is typically retail single-storey buildings. So from that perspective, we do see that market continuing to do -- grow low-single digits at the end-market. And on resi, I'm more optimistic about lower interest rates, better -- like market performance going into next year.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. And then just in commercial, maybe let us -- remind us your mix in education and there has been a lot of funding -- ESSER funding around K through 12 and I know that's been a hot market. If you're seeing any signs that as that sunsets that market might see a move back.\nAlok Maskara: We had not seen any signs of that market going back. Our exposure in education is probably less than some of our competitors, given like, historically, we have been so focused on retail, but we look at that as a good growth opportunity. But currently, we don't see any of that slowing down as we see also schools issuing bonds and other pieces, because these are very necessary maintenance and many of these units remain way past their useful life.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we'll go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJeffSprague: Hi, thanks, and good morning, everyone. Hi, Alok, I just want to come back to kind of the share gain dynamics and we got to hop over and see what else Watsco is saying this morning, but you're kind of putting the share gain largely being a function of some competitors running out of 410A, where they sound like maybe there is actually some bigger problem with somebody. I'm not expecting you to kind of name -- names on competitors, but are you actually seeing somebody also struggle with the transition or there is some other kind of systematic problem with someone in the channel other than just kind of running out of 410A?\nAlok Maskara: Obviously, we don't know what's happening inside the hood with any of those competitors. What we know is our availability right now on 410A products is better than many of the other players and that's giving us an advantage. We also know that a lot of the investments we made last year in improving our sales team, being a better distributor, making sure we have higher fill rates, and ensuring that we have a decentralized model that gets more aggressive and focused on our typical AOR dealer, all that's paying off as well. So I do want to break out the share gains into two comments, right? One is totally consistent with everything we have been trying to do. And second, maybe some current advantage because of competition stumbles. It's part of the transition. We made a bet that throughout this year, 410A demand would be higher and the shift to 454B would only happen next year. I believe some of the competitors may have made a different bet and they may have run out of products.\nJeffSprague: And then thinking about the after effects of whatever pre-buy we have into next year, right, I mean the 35% of the market that's not 454B, almost by definition, right, has to be sitting in distribution by the end of the year, right, if manufacturers are running low on it now. So I mean that -- I mean that feels like really a potentially bigger air pocket early in the year than, I don't know, maybe people think. Maybe just kind of comment on that, like the -- how you see the state of distribution at the end of the year and how this kind of give back on the pre-buy might play out?\nAlok Maskara: Yes, sure. First of all, we will get greater clarity next year because Q4 is still just starting and we got to work through that. Our 35 number was based on that even manufacturers will have some 410A inventory like we will have 410A inventory at the end of the year that we will be selling. So like as we look at our own distribution and I think other manufacturers will likely also have 410A inventory at the end of the year. So it's not just inventory at distributors, it's inventory at manufacturers and distributors. Q1 is where we will see the most impact. I think the FX starts waning away in Q2 and that's why the 65:35. But Jeff, I wish there was an exact science behind this or if we had full visibility and complete transparency. So this is just like us looking at what we know and coming up with an educated guess. We are going to be wrong. We just don't know whether it's going to be wrong on the upside or the downside.\nJeffSprague: Understood. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we're going to go to Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephen Volkmann: Thank you very much. Actually, I'm just going to build right off of that. Alok, wouldn't you rather be wrong by having more R-410A, so that you are price competitive further into 2025?\nAlok Maskara: For the whole industry, which is what we care about deeply as well, I would hope that everybody runs out of 410A by the end of the year, so we get the better mix and the transition is more seamless for our dealers. For a dealer dealing with two different product lines and training their crews and all that is just very difficult. So we want to support our dealers and I hope the entire industry runs out, which is quite likely given that some competitors already running out of 410A. But from our perspective, yes, we would like our manufacturing transition to be clean and for us to move to 454B. At the same time, we don't want to be price-disadvantaged in the first quarter when others may have 410A. So that's a daily balance we got to drive, Jeff.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay. And maybe just switching to commercial, any words of wisdom as we think about how the new facility kind of ramps up through 2025 and we sort of try to model that and when the startup costs kind of go away.\nAlok Maskara: Yes, the startup costs will go away definitely by Q2, a large part will go away in Q1. Right now, where we are is, we are on track from the timeline perspective. I would say the startup inefficiency maybe a shade higher than what we thought originally, just because we are putting extra focus on quality and sometimes we are paying more for freight to move products back-and-forth, and we want to make sure it's a really good quality product and we take care of our customers through their transition. So I would say, you should expect by mid-next year us to be kind of running up to as we thought the capacity of the factory would be. So think of another three quarters worth of ramp-up associated with inefficiencies fading away in Q1. Michael?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes, I'll just add, a lot of these costs we're experiencing right now, we believe are temporary. Obviously, we're trying to launch a factory. So in the second half of next year, when that factory is fully operational, these temporary transition costs should abate.\nStephen Volkmann: Great. And then just finally on that, you mentioned earlier that demand is outstripping supply on commercial, when this thing is up mid-year to normal run-rates, is that then in better balance?\nAlok Maskara: We know we'll be in better balance. We may still be below capacity because remember, we're only getting 20% of the potential capacity in Saltillo up and running, and if demand continues to outstrip supply, we will put up another 20%. I mean, the factory is large enough for us to be able to double our current capacity, but we are doing it 20% at a time. But yes, we'll definitely better balance and better be able to serve our customers. I mean, currently, our customer satisfaction in that is very low because we just can't meet the amount of demand and orders we have.\nStephen Volkmann: Yes. Helpful. Thank you, guys. Good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we're going to go to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Alok, that you clearly -- I don't have the crystal ball here, but just to square those comments on your own inventory levels exiting the year, is the way we should think about it that you expect to carry inventory levels of 410A products to at least meet demand for the first quarter and that's really kind of like the balance that you're trying to make sure you get right.\nAlok Maskara: Approximately, the reason I say is, like remember, we are also a distributor and 70% of our sales act just like a distributor sale, and if we turn inventory five times a year, which I know we do around that much, I will have 410A inventory just from phase in, phase out perspective that we will sell through in Q1. So I think some of it is just practical constraints of transition, and other is, of course, we do want to remain competitive. So while it's not a goal, I think that's just largely how it will play out, because we will continue manufacturing till the time we can.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, fair enough. And then just maybe just sticking on pricing for 410A, given that the products are going to be discontinued going into next year, does that change the pricing dynamics that you're able to put through in the early part of next year as you typically put your annual price increases through, or how should we kind of think about that 410A pricing even for the portion of the year that it held into the network in early 2025?\nAlok Maskara: First of all, we want to take care of our customers and be fair, but second, from a demand and supply perspective, if 410A is short in supply, which is what we are experiencing right now, then we fully expect to capture the incremental pricing in 2025 or any 410A product sold in 2025. When we do annual price increases, I mean cost of benefits are going up, cost of -- lot of the commodities continue to be around inflation in wages, so yes, we fully expect to have 410A sold in 2025 to be at higher price than 410A sold in 2024.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, great to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we'll go to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much. Alok, maybe first off, there is some sort of interesting bits and pieces on the margins I suppose on Slide 11, maybe trying to wrap it together. So I think your margin -- your operating margin this year is guided up about a point for the year as a whole, just total Lennox, so it's sort of 30%-ish incremental margin. When we look at the bits and pieces on Slide 11, is the main takeaway that it's a similar incremental next year or is there something I'm missing on some of the moving parts on Slide 11?\nMichael Quenzer: I think, overall, we expect our margins to expand at both next year, predominantly led by the mix benefits that we'll see. Then offsetting some of that will be some of the investments we're making. We're going to have at least a 30% incremental on the mix and then we'll get some more volume tailwinds hopefully in share, which is also 30% incremental. We'll have to go through all the puts and takes and some of the investments we're making, but 25% to 30% incremental sound in the range, but we got to go through all the details still.\nAlok Maskara: Yes, and Julian, remember our long-term targets for Lennox margins that we have published, I mean, we are still not there. So we obviously want to keep making progress towards that over the next year, year and a half to get there. So I don't want to give you exact number because Q4 still has to play out depending on how that goes, but we do expect margin expansion next year for sure.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just my follow-up, revisiting sadly the pre-buy stuff again. So I guess, it sounds like if we're trying to quantify it, we should not be too concerned, if that's right for a couple of reasons about the extent of the destock. I think one is, if I look at your residential volume guide for this year, it's gone up about three points, I think, for the year versus what you said in July, but a lot of that is share gain. So you've got maybe, I don't know, a point of effect from pre-buy this year. And then also if the effect is mostly in Q1 of next year, Q1 is typically a very small seasonal quarter anyway for you, and particularly so for cooling product, which presumably is what the refrigerant change affects rather than hot products. So maybe just clarify for me if I'm misunderstanding anything with those points, please.\nAlok Maskara: First of all, you're not misunderstanding, Julian, this is the -- your classic quote, if I can quote back to you like analyzing storm and a teacup, right? I mean, our industry is over-analyzed sometimes. I think companies that execute well have a strong strategy to do better. But yes, your math is about correct. I mean, we -- 70% of our shares are kind of immune to this whole pre-buy discussion and that's going to work as planned. The other 30%, we believe majority of the effect right now is stocking, destocking, not pre-buy. Having said all of that, Q4 is still out there. I mean, if Q4 has a very heavy Q -- quarter and a lot of that's driven by pre-buy, then all our answers could change and we will have to talk about that in Q1. But so far, we are assuming there will be some pre-buy but not a heavy pre-buy that impacts us this year.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we're going to go to Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks for taking the questions. Really great quarter for cash generation, and as we look towards '25 and lapping some of the investments you've made on the CapEx side, and I think in the past, you talked about getting back to 100% free cash flow generation -- 100% free cash flow conversion, how do we think about share repurchases, that picking up here in 4Q levels for '25. It had been a couple of years, but going back, it used to be pretty active on the repo front.\nAlok Maskara: I'll start by just saying that our new CFO is really helping to drive the free cash. He is bringing a new level of discipline, a new level of accountability, and a new level of focus on working capital management. With that, I will hand it over to Michael to actually answer that question.\nMichael Quenzer: And I'll just add on that. That's one of the initiatives I started is trying to align the organization on working capital management, especially as we look to get 90% or even close to 100% of free cash to net income. So it's something we're focused on over the next couple of years. But yes, we are generating a lot of cash, and our deployment strategy is going to be basically consistent where every year we're going to increase our dividend. We're going to look at our dividend yield compared to growth companies in the S&P 500, so we'll do that. And then we're also evaluating bolt-on acquisitions that have to have the right fit with the right returns on it. So we're being very disciplined in that, but we're definitely focused there. And then thereafter, it's going to be about share repurchases. We started getting back into share repurchases this quarter. We'll continue to do those, but it will be kind of a tool to efficiently deploy that capital if we don't do acquisitions.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. And can you talk a little bit about that acquisition pipeline and what your needs may be at this moment?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes. I think what we've looked at is different technologies, kind of bolt-on technologies in the commercial space. They just give us a better product offering with our commercial customers. We've looked at distribution opportunities to have a full assortment of products that we can sell through our residential distribution network. Those are two big ones. And then there is just different technologies to make our product smarter, either on the thermostats, IQ, so it's a host of things that we're looking at, but again, they got to have the right fit and the right price.\nAlok Maskara: And I would add to that, remember, I mean, we are also trying to be more of a distributor versus just a manufacturer and there's a big opportunity for products that our dealers buy or our key accounts buy that we don't sell today. So if we could look at appropriate products and technologies, as Michael said, and bring them into our network, that would be significantly value enhancing to our shareholders. So we are very disciplined in capital allocation, and as Michael said, we will look at all those opportunities and balance those appropriately. But it starts with strong cash flow, which I think Michael and the team are doing a great job at.\nNoah Kaye: Great. I'll have some follow-ups offline. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we're going to go to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nAlok Maskara: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Hi. I saw that the plan to build share in emergency replacement is highlighted on the outlook for '25, you've talked about this before. Can you just share some color on what it means to refocus on that business? My understanding is you will need to boost inventory in the field because you need 24-hour turnaround and the customers have to know this and it's either you're ready for that order or you miss it entirely. So what kind of working capital burden increase are you looking at to fill emergency replacement, and can you size that? Thanks.\nAlok Maskara: Deane, that's a very good question. Thanks. I agree with you that the going back to emergency replacement requires a lot of effort, starts with us having more manufacturing capacity, then it goes into making sure we have appropriate inventory within 24 hours and in some cases, urban market, the same day. And then finally, it also comes down to having the right feet on the street and getting all the contractors who may have gone to something else or someone else to come back and look at that fold, and we are doing all of that. Most of that working capital impact will be in 2025 and we'll be happy to come back and look at it. But I can also tell you it won't be as material because today we have excess working capital, but it's on the raw product side as we are starting factories and transitioning factories. I would look to redeploy a lot of that working capital from raw materials more into finished goods and closer to the customer. So it's a pretty heavy move, but from a financial perspective, I would expect a lot of that come from the additional draw inventory we are carrying as part of startup.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. Thanks. And then second question for Michael. On ROIC, Lennox is so far ahead of anyone else in industrials. I think from our coverage, you're probably -- you're nearly two times bigger versus the next closest competitor. So just kind of talk us through, as you make decisions -- investment decisions, CapEx decisions, are you looking at the ROIC impact? Do you hesitate at all on investments? I know it's a rhetorical question and you're going to just say no, but just the idea that you will at times pressure ROIC. So is this more of an outcome or a target on the way you think about it in the company?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes, what I'll say is that our industry-leading ROIC is mostly driven by our organic disciplined approach to investments, so we've not done a lot of inorganic acquisitions. Obviously, when you do those, they will be dilutive. But when we look at acquisitions like we did with AES, it was a good ROIC, well above 20%, but still below the 47% that we're tracking. So we'll continue to look at bolt-on acquisitions that are above our cost of capital. And then from a capital expenditure perspective, we do the same thing. So we're not necessarily targeted on growing above 47%, but we want to stay 40% and have good ROI projects on these CapEx, and so we're looking at both on the organic capital expenditures and the inorganic acquisitions to have healthy ROIC above our cost of capital.\nDeane Dray: That's really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we're going to go to Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nBrett Linzey: Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Hi -- I wanted to come back to the early thinking on 2025 and the 30% incremental comment on low GWP, is that a volume incremental comment, and then price mix should drop through at something above that similar to this year? I'm just hoping you could maybe parse those pieces out.\nMichael Quenzer: Yes. What we're expecting is more of a kind of price cost. It will come through. We'll have mix-up for the pricing that we just talked about and then the drop-through on that mix will be at least 30% to maintain our gross margins and reflect the additional costs that we're having to put into the product and investments that we're making. Our volume incrementals are also similar to 30%. So we have both kind of dropping through 30% of the mix next year and our normal volume gains.\nBrett Linzey: Got it. And then just thinking about new versus replacement in residential, obviously, new housing has been a drag, how much was that down so far this year? And then you noted some of the value tier growth for next year. Thinking about a better housing environment and some of the investment, should you maybe pick up some share in new housing next year or grow in line with the market, any thoughts there?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. I think we're starting to see some green shoots in new housing, so we are like either bouncing along the bottom or we are coming off from the trough from new housing. So that's positive. And remember, we are kind of six months behind the new housing starts number that you might see. Our share position in there remains very strong. And on the replacement side, again, if you believe, even the recent Wall Street Journal article about homeowners starting to do more repairs and renovations, we think higher demand there will probably result from lower interest rates and consumer confidence. But all that said, there is just a lot of uncertainty. On the value tier, our comment was driven by because of the SEER changes, because of the pricing levels, and because of the higher interest rates that are prevailing versus a few years ago. So we just want to watch out for that going forward. So a lot more for us to analyze and evaluate before we come to you in 2025 and give you more firm guidance on those things.\nBrett Linzey: Thanks. Appreciate the insight.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we're going to go to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, good morning.\nAlok Maskara: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: What do you think is driving distributors to stock up in like the last couple of months of the summer when the demand is effectively like maybe flat-to-up a little bit and you have this transition coming? What's kind of the -- what's the driver there?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. And I think, Steve, depends on which type of distributors. I mean, we can talk about our distributors. We haven't seen our distributors stocking up. We are seeing our distributors going away from destocking, so they're going back to normal inventory levels that existed pre-COVID and we haven't seen them taking extraordinary measures to stock up. Now, I think in Q4, they might do some 410 pre-buy to get some price advantage versus 454B. But I have not seen any -- at least from our distributors that we work with, any big push to stock up.\nMichael Quenzer: And all that said, on top of comps, if you go back to Q3 last year, that channel is down 20% due to destocking, so definitely favorable comps year-over-year as they restock as Alok mentioned.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And then when it comes to the pricing for next year, so you're saying 10% plus on 70% of your revenue, I think 65% penetration, so that kind of gets you into firmly in the mid-single digit plus range for price for next year kind of capture for the segment, is that like the right math that you're talking about?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. We'll get you greater clarity in 2025 because I do -- we'll have more clarity both on like 65, 35, 454B, but I think that's roughly the right math and the way you looked at it right now.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then lastly\u2026\nAlok Maskara: \u2026most of this is going to look at mix -- most is going to look at mix versus price, right, because these are brand new products.\nSteve Tusa: Right. So this is mix versus like just pure price, but that is the right math right now. It's around 5%, 6%.\nAlok Maskara: \u2026mid-single digit is a good range.\nMichael Quenzer: And then I'll just add, the stick rate we normally see in regulatory transitions is high because we're making a lot of cost investment as we need to stick it.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And then just lastly, I guess with the combination of the pre-buy for the industry at least maybe perhaps more, some of the things you talked about is being uncertain as far as consumer confidence, repair versus replace all that, do you expect like industry volumes next year at this stage to be down -- industry volumes? You've talked about your share gains, but is industry volume down next year, do you think?\nAlok Maskara: Listen, from my perspective, I would say the industry volume -- and this is installed on the ground, so away from any like distributor stock-in or stock-out and all that, I would think it's going to be flat to slightly up next year and a lot of that's just driven by the ongoing trends, age of units, and the cost of repair versus replays. But I wish I could predict that more accurately, Steve. Everybody is going to have a different view on that.\nMichael Quenzer: And interest rates are going to have a heavy influence in that as well.\nSteve Tusa: Right. And then sorry, one more question.\nAlok Maskara: Remember, new home construction is picking up, so right.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. Sorry, one more question from maybe the guy that over-analyzes, as you said, whatever the comment was. The share gains this year with your competitors that have been like out of the market, why are those sustainable? Why isn't that like a tough comp in the next year? Are they -- is this kind of structural share gain you think you've taken because of that?\nAlok Maskara: Whenever somebody stumbles, some of that becomes permanent, like when we stumbled with the tornado, it took us years, like six years, to get that share back. So when I look at our past tumbles, some dealers will switch back, some won't, so -- I mean that's my part. Our comment is, our goal is to make them as permanent as possible. But that is where execution comes down and see what works.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we'll go to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. We covered a lot of ground and let's not over-analyze this situation, but what is the feedback from your end customers, the contractors, the dealers on A2L? Have they come to terms with the technology, the train requirements, et cetera? Do they actually want to have A2L or do they want to take as much 410A as they can? And I'm just wondering this dynamic of 4Q versus 1Q, if you're going to increase prices effective 2025, is there an incentive for them to stock up in 4Q versus 1Q?\nAlok Maskara: Yes, so talking about end contractors, I mean, the good news is we are belly-to-belly with 10,000 of them, and I can tell you all 10,000 have 10,000 -- like individual views. So depending on whom you ask, you will get that view. In general, I would say, most contractors would prefer to continue doing what they are doing. They are chain resistant, but they also realize that they don't have a choice and they have to move to 454B. It only comes down to some of them, especially the high-end one will want to move sooner versus later because they are selling a high-end product and they are not at the bottom end of the range. Others who are more chuck in the truck and at the bottom end of the range, they will want to keep doing 410A as long as possible. On the positive side, it's been well accepted. People have gone through training. People understand how to install it. We are spending a lot of time doing training. Other distributors are doing a lot of time doing training, so that will happen. Is there a risk that some of them will stock up more on 410A at the end of the quarter because they do have garages and barns, they may not have warehouses? Yes, I think there is a risk to that. I mean, that's a risk we deal with every year.\nNigel Coe: Yes, okay. I'm -- just got the vision of barns being used to stock up HVAC units. We have to do some barn visits. And then just a...\nAlok Maskara: I was at a barn in Wisconsin, and actually, you saw that, so.\nNigel Coe: Yes, side-by-side with the cheese. Then just -- thinking then about just dis-conceptually the repair versus replace dynamic, if we're in a 454B world and you've got a 410A system or 20 system, you're going to have to replace the whole system as opposed -- if you're going to replace instead of just a component replacement, et cetera. So why wouldn't there be more kind of compressor replacements or motor replacements or whatever in a world where we're putting through another 10% price? So I'm just trying to figure out here whether we will see kind of more of a repair mix as we transition through this A2L. Does it make sense?\nAlok Maskara: I think fundamentally - you did, absolutely. I still think it comes down to the age of the unit. So if the unit is five-year-old and it's got a compressor broken, the dealer is likely to come and change the compressor. If it's a, 12 to 15-year-old unit where the compressors broken and the motor is making noises, they are likely to replace the whole system. In the 12 to 15-year-old unit, because the extra cost of 410A, once it spikes and it has not spiked yet, it becomes an additional factor that comes into play. So I don't think -- just like the R22 to 410A pieces, in the beginning years, it didn't change the repair to replace, but in the future years, it did move it more towards replacement versus repair. I think the same thing is going to happen, probably no impact in 2025 for repair versus replace, but in future years it will.\nNigel Coe: Great. And then just a quick one, I'm probably the last question here. Have you sized the dollar TAM for the emergency replacement market for commercial? What sort of share do you think you can get of that TAM?\nAlok Maskara: We haven't sized or broadcast that yet, but we know what we used to have, and we also know that the industry broadly has a healthy mix between emergency replacement and key account and we are essentially almost all key accounts. So the industry is 60:40. We are probably 90:10 in that, in terms of 90% key account and 10% emergency replacement. So we do know we have a significant opportunity for us to take that forward. You can take that and multiply it by AHRI industry data, but the industry is a lot more weighted towards emergency replacement than we are. Maybe next year we will come back and give you some sizing on that.\nNigel Coe: Great. That's great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for joining us today. Since there are no further questions, this will conclude Lennox's 2024 third quarter conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alok Maskara",
            "content": "Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning, everyone. Lennox delivered another record quarter, highlighted by double-digit revenue growth, operating margin exceeding 20%, and strong free cash flow. We also made solid progress on multiple key initiatives as part of our ongoing transformation plan. I am grateful for our talented team and the growth mindset of our customers who enabled these exceptionally strong results. Let's turn to Slide 3 for the highlights of this quarter. Core revenue grew 15% and our adjusted segment margin expanded 90 basis points to a Q3 record of 20.2%, resulting in adjusted earnings per share increase of 24% to $6.68. We generated an impressive $452 million in operating cash flow this quarter, which is $139 million or approximately 44% increase over the same quarter last year. Our industry-leading ROIC also grew to 47%. Both our segments, HCS and BCS, achieved 15% revenue growth in the quarter and both continued to deliver strong segment profit. Investments in manufacturing capacity and front-end redesign has enabled us to gain share and meet customer demand for R-410A products. In addition, investments in digital processes and distribution technologies led to improved order fill rates within Home Comfort Solutions. The new commercial factory startup remains on track and the Building Climate Solutions segment successfully integrated the AES acquisition ahead of schedule. These results reflect the dedication of our 14,000 employees and the continued support of our dealers and customers. Therefore, I am confident in raising our 2024 EPS guidance range to $20.75 to $21. Now please turn to Slide 4 for more details on our CLO transition. As announced earlier this morning, John Torres, Lennox's Chief Legal Officer has elected to retire. I want to take a moment to acknowledge John's outstanding 16 years of leadership and his lasting impact on Lennox. He led multiple acquisitions and divestitures to streamline our portfolio and ensure that we operate with the highest ethical standards by strengthening our ethics and compliance office. As a result of our thoughtful succession planning, we are excited for Monica Brown as she takes on the role of Chief Legal Officer effective January 1, 2025. Monica has been with Lennox for 12 years with a proven track record across our businesses and legal functions. Before joining Lennox, she spent nearly 13 years with the leading outside law firm. Looking ahead, Monica is well-positioned to continue John's legacy of success with a focus on advancing our digital capabilities and accelerating future growth. Now let me hand the call over to Michael to take us through the details of our Q3 financial performance. Thanks, Michael. All necessary preparations for design, engineering, and manufacturing of the low GWP products were completed earlier in the year, ensuring a successful launch in the third quarter. As part of this transition, we are also excited to introduce our new Lennox powered by Samsung Mini-Split and VRF heat pump systems. We have invested heavily in developing new low GWP products and minimizing disruptions during the transition. We anticipate continued manufacturing cost headwinds into the first quarter of next year as we continue to convert production lines in our factories. Our approach to reconfiguring our factories balances production flexibility with cost efficiency. In 2025, we expect a gradual shift in demand for the new low GWP Refrigerant products. The first half of the year, specifically the first quarter, we'll see continued R-410A sales from manufacturers, distributors, and dealers as everyone depletes their regular and pre-bought R-410A inventory. We still estimate that for the full year, approximately 65% of the end-market demand will transition to low GWP product, which will favorably impact mix. Looking further ahead, we anticipate existing 410A refrigerant will face price increases as supply items and demand moves towards low GWP products. This will increase cost pressure on repairs, leading to higher demand for system replacements. This transition also opens more service opportunities for dealers and contractors given additional safety features and components in the new R-454B products. We expect some of the low GWP price and mix benefits to extend into 2026 as the market fully transitions to the new low GWP product. With that, please turn to Slide 11 for our early thinking on the outlook for 2025. We are pleased with the resilience of the North America HVAC industry growth. We remain cautiously optimistic for 2025, given our sustained competitive momentum from our ongoing transformation journey. On the left-hand side of the slide, you will see several factors that will likely impact revenue growth in 2025. Mix benefits from the low GWP transition with 10% plus price increases will accelerate growth. Lennox has historically executed extremely well during these regulatory transitions, gaining share and confidence from our dealers and distributors. We plan to do the same thing next year. We anticipate higher manufacturing output from our commercial HVAC factories within our BCS segment. In conjunction with the investment we made in our sales team this year, we will be able to recapture some of the previously lost share in the emergency replacement market. Moreover, these improvements will instill greater confidence in our ability to serve national accounts with a full lifecycle value proposition. We are encouraged by the growth opportunities from partnering with Samsung for our ductless heat pump offering, strengthening brand recognition, and providing access to a broader customer base. Increased incentives for energy-efficient system may lead to higher replacement demand as well as a higher tier mix. While we are generally optimistic about 2025 revenue growth, it is important to recognize our outlook can be impacted by several end-market factors. Uncertain consumer confidence continues to pose challenges alongside a trend towards more value tiered products, which may negatively impact mix. Higher cost for the new products may also create complexities in the ongoing repair versus replace dynamics. From an industry perspective, we expect destocking in the first half of 2025 as distributors sell through R-410A pre-buys this year. Additionally, competitors may gain some share as they overcome their current availability challenges. On the right-hand side of the slide, we have highlighted key drivers for margin expansion. We anticipate margin improvements from the low GWP product mix with 30% incrementals, supported by our continued focus on price cost discipline. We also foresee improvements in productivity from higher distribution fill rates as our focus on digital inventory planning and our investment in distribution technologies start to generate results. Greater factory efficiency will also contribute to our margin expansion, particularly in the second half of next year as we begin to lap the ramp-up costs associated with the new commercial factory and low GWP transition. However, these gains may be partially offset by several factors. Our investments in digital capabilities and distribution network improvements are essential for enhancing operational efficiency and improving customer experience. While these investments are crucial for long-term growth, they may create some near-term pressure on margins. Additionally, we anticipate inflationary pressures for both commodities and component cost. We also expect increases in healthcare and employee benefit costs. Ultimately, our focus in 2025 remains on superior execution to drive differentiated growth and expand margins. We will provide further financial guidance when we report our Q4 earnings early next year. Now please turn to Slide 12. As we wrap up today's call, I want to emphasize our confidence in driving sustainable growth guided by five key elements of our strategic transformation plan. Our first focus is on accelerating growth by adding new customers as well as capturing a greater share of wallet from existing customers. Second, we will expand our margins from price cost productivity and leveraging the strength of our direct-to-dealer network. Third, the Lennox unified management system remains key to our success, helping us streamline operations, share best practices, and execute our strategy. Next, our ongoing investments in digital and heat pump technology keep us at the forefront of innovation to deliver cutting-edge solutions for our customers. And finally, our strong culture rooted in core values and reinforced by our pay-for-performance model drives our success. Our differentiated strategy continues to create sustained competitive advantages and will enable us to achieve our long-term goals. I'm incredibly proud of what we have accomplished so far and I have no doubt that our best days are still ahead of us. Thank you. We will be happy to take your questions now. Margo, let's go to Q&A. Good morning, Tommy. I would say both are true, Tommy. The third thing I would add to is the competitive share gain that we get normally during any regulatory transition, the confidence in achieving that in this transition is also higher. Yes, what we have seen so far is not a meaningful shift between repair and replace, and -- but we continue to be cautious about it, especially given that the price of new equipment will rise. So we continue to monitor that and that's why I want to call it out. On the value tier shift, as we went from sort of 13 SEER to 14 SEER and as we look at the overall state of the economy, we have seen a shift towards more people buying the minimum SEER. It already used to be about 60%, 65% of the industry, so now it might be 65% to 70% of the industry. So that's what we are calling out in the value tier. No surprises, no changes from any of our previous conversations, just wanted to lay out the positives and the potential watch out for 2025, but really no change in Q3 that we are calling out. Thanks, Tommy. It is a hard question, but Ryan, we are here to answer your hard questions. Listen, I think the risk right now is fairly balanced around the number 65%. If you remember earlier in the year, we were talking about 50% to 65%, but right now we feel more confident around the 65% number. I think if it's a little lower, it could be because there is more pre-buy in 410A, which we will see in Q4. And if it's higher, it will because a lot of the competitors already out of 410A inventory right now. So as we're selling 410A, it could be used this quarter versus being left over for next year. So those are kind of the two dynamics on the 410A that we are selling today, does that land up becoming pre-buy, which I think is some chances or it's just because competitors are short on that product. So those will be the pluses and minuses on that, Ryan. Sure. So on the pre-buy, I'm not sure how much it helped Q3. I mean, if you think about Q3, what helped us was three different factors. First of all, the end of destocking and beginning of restocking, I mean, that was probably the largest contributor. As you saw, our two-step business was up over 30% or around 30%, so I think that's the biggest factor for what helped in Q3. Second, I would call out is just share gains. I mean, we've been gaining share just because of better execution and there was some impact of competitors running out of inventory. So I think share gains were the second factor. Third, which may have happened a little bit towards the tail end of the quarter is pre-buy. But remember, most of our business goes to dealers and unless they go start renting out big bonds, I mean, they're not going to be able to do a lot of pre-buy, and distributor inventory levels are still pretty close to normal. So I just want to emphasize the point on the pre-buy on how we expect. What we would expect, as said, is in Q1 next year, there clearly will be some depletion or destocking of pre-buy, maybe some carryover in Q2, but that gives us confidence in the 65% number, saying majority of the sales next year will be 454B. Sure. I'll start by reaffirming what you said is that, yes, we have reversed those share losses and we are back on a positive trajectory. Because we do both one-step and two-step, share is a little difficult as we look at AHRI or any of those data. But today, where we stand because of all the moving pieces, we are confident that we have gained share and we continue to gain share. What we have to do next year is make sure that we can retain most of the captured share, because as competitors have inventory, which many of them don't right now on 410A product, then there would be like a lot of our effort going towards making sure our share gains are more permanent. On the commercial side, where also the share gain comment comes up, we have not been able to recover the share so far. That's part of our plan for 2025 on getting share back on the emergency replacement, because we are still constrained by manufacturing capacity, not demand in that segment. So I want to separate the shared comments into commercial and residential. I think as we finish Q4, when we have greater clarity on market movements and acceptance, we can talk about that in early Q1. Right now, the 10% is what we are looking to gain out of a price. But realize, we'll apply to only 65% of sales and only the products that are 454B, and we will also be raising price on 410A next year. So the 10% has to be taken in conjunction with 410A pricing today. So there are a lot of moving pieces and we can provide greater clarity. But the overall where we are seeing in the marketplace is the higher cost products that we're introducing, 454B, is being supported by our and competitive moves on 10% plus price increase into 2025. Hi, Jeff. If you think about res and we talked about this earlier in the year that we expected for a dealer the volume to be flat-to-down, then halfway through the year, we upgraded to be flat, and now we're going to say flat to maybe slightly up is where we are on the res side. And I'm talking about installed units, away from stocking, destocking, but think of flat as the conservative, flat to slightly up as maybe a little bit more, like aggressive numbers to look at. But it's hard to come to that in a firm number as you know with the different moving pieces. So we'll wait for AHRI, but I think flat to slightly up would be a good way to look at end-market non-residential. On commercial, since we remain supply-constrained, we just go with the industry figures, where I think the market has been growing slightly. It's still not fully recovered from the COVID decline that it happened, because our markets, remember, we don't have offices, we don't have as much multi-storey housing, what we call commercial is typically retail single-storey buildings. So from that perspective, we do see that market continuing to do -- grow low-single digits at the end-market. And on resi, I'm more optimistic about lower interest rates, better -- like market performance going into next year. We had not seen any signs of that market going back. Our exposure in education is probably less than some of our competitors, given like, historically, we have been so focused on retail, but we look at that as a good growth opportunity. But currently, we don't see any of that slowing down as we see also schools issuing bonds and other pieces, because these are very necessary maintenance and many of these units remain way past their useful life. Obviously, we don't know what's happening inside the hood with any of those competitors. What we know is our availability right now on 410A products is better than many of the other players and that's giving us an advantage. We also know that a lot of the investments we made last year in improving our sales team, being a better distributor, making sure we have higher fill rates, and ensuring that we have a decentralized model that gets more aggressive and focused on our typical AOR dealer, all that's paying off as well. So I do want to break out the share gains into two comments, right? One is totally consistent with everything we have been trying to do. And second, maybe some current advantage because of competition stumbles. It's part of the transition. We made a bet that throughout this year, 410A demand would be higher and the shift to 454B would only happen next year. I believe some of the competitors may have made a different bet and they may have run out of products. Yes, sure. First of all, we will get greater clarity next year because Q4 is still just starting and we got to work through that. Our 35 number was based on that even manufacturers will have some 410A inventory like we will have 410A inventory at the end of the year that we will be selling. So like as we look at our own distribution and I think other manufacturers will likely also have 410A inventory at the end of the year. So it's not just inventory at distributors, it's inventory at manufacturers and distributors. Q1 is where we will see the most impact. I think the FX starts waning away in Q2 and that's why the 65:35. But Jeff, I wish there was an exact science behind this or if we had full visibility and complete transparency. So this is just like us looking at what we know and coming up with an educated guess. We are going to be wrong. We just don't know whether it's going to be wrong on the upside or the downside. For the whole industry, which is what we care about deeply as well, I would hope that everybody runs out of 410A by the end of the year, so we get the better mix and the transition is more seamless for our dealers. For a dealer dealing with two different product lines and training their crews and all that is just very difficult. So we want to support our dealers and I hope the entire industry runs out, which is quite likely given that some competitors already running out of 410A. But from our perspective, yes, we would like our manufacturing transition to be clean and for us to move to 454B. At the same time, we don't want to be price-disadvantaged in the first quarter when others may have 410A. So that's a daily balance we got to drive, Jeff. Yes, the startup costs will go away definitely by Q2, a large part will go away in Q1. Right now, where we are is, we are on track from the timeline perspective. I would say the startup inefficiency maybe a shade higher than what we thought originally, just because we are putting extra focus on quality and sometimes we are paying more for freight to move products back-and-forth, and we want to make sure it's a really good quality product and we take care of our customers through their transition. So I would say, you should expect by mid-next year us to be kind of running up to as we thought the capacity of the factory would be. So think of another three quarters worth of ramp-up associated with inefficiencies fading away in Q1. Michael? We know we'll be in better balance. We may still be below capacity because remember, we're only getting 20% of the potential capacity in Saltillo up and running, and if demand continues to outstrip supply, we will put up another 20%. I mean, the factory is large enough for us to be able to double our current capacity, but we are doing it 20% at a time. But yes, we'll definitely better balance and better be able to serve our customers. I mean, currently, our customer satisfaction in that is very low because we just can't meet the amount of demand and orders we have. Approximately, the reason I say is, like remember, we are also a distributor and 70% of our sales act just like a distributor sale, and if we turn inventory five times a year, which I know we do around that much, I will have 410A inventory just from phase in, phase out perspective that we will sell through in Q1. So I think some of it is just practical constraints of transition, and other is, of course, we do want to remain competitive. So while it's not a goal, I think that's just largely how it will play out, because we will continue manufacturing till the time we can. First of all, we want to take care of our customers and be fair, but second, from a demand and supply perspective, if 410A is short in supply, which is what we are experiencing right now, then we fully expect to capture the incremental pricing in 2025 or any 410A product sold in 2025. When we do annual price increases, I mean cost of benefits are going up, cost of -- lot of the commodities continue to be around inflation in wages, so yes, we fully expect to have 410A sold in 2025 to be at higher price than 410A sold in 2024. Yes, and Julian, remember our long-term targets for Lennox margins that we have published, I mean, we are still not there. So we obviously want to keep making progress towards that over the next year, year and a half to get there. So I don't want to give you exact number because Q4 still has to play out depending on how that goes, but we do expect margin expansion next year for sure. First of all, you're not misunderstanding, Julian, this is the -- your classic quote, if I can quote back to you like analyzing storm and a teacup, right? I mean, our industry is over-analyzed sometimes. I think companies that execute well have a strong strategy to do better. But yes, your math is about correct. I mean, we -- 70% of our shares are kind of immune to this whole pre-buy discussion and that's going to work as planned. The other 30%, we believe majority of the effect right now is stocking, destocking, not pre-buy. Having said all of that, Q4 is still out there. I mean, if Q4 has a very heavy Q -- quarter and a lot of that's driven by pre-buy, then all our answers could change and we will have to talk about that in Q1. But so far, we are assuming there will be some pre-buy but not a heavy pre-buy that impacts us this year. I'll start by just saying that our new CFO is really helping to drive the free cash. He is bringing a new level of discipline, a new level of accountability, and a new level of focus on working capital management. With that, I will hand it over to Michael to actually answer that question. And I would add to that, remember, I mean, we are also trying to be more of a distributor versus just a manufacturer and there's a big opportunity for products that our dealers buy or our key accounts buy that we don't sell today. So if we could look at appropriate products and technologies, as Michael said, and bring them into our network, that would be significantly value enhancing to our shareholders. So we are very disciplined in capital allocation, and as Michael said, we will look at all those opportunities and balance those appropriately. But it starts with strong cash flow, which I think Michael and the team are doing a great job at. Good morning, Deane. Deane, that's a very good question. Thanks. I agree with you that the going back to emergency replacement requires a lot of effort, starts with us having more manufacturing capacity, then it goes into making sure we have appropriate inventory within 24 hours and in some cases, urban market, the same day. And then finally, it also comes down to having the right feet on the street and getting all the contractors who may have gone to something else or someone else to come back and look at that fold, and we are doing all of that. Most of that working capital impact will be in 2025 and we'll be happy to come back and look at it. But I can also tell you it won't be as material because today we have excess working capital, but it's on the raw product side as we are starting factories and transitioning factories. I would look to redeploy a lot of that working capital from raw materials more into finished goods and closer to the customer. So it's a pretty heavy move, but from a financial perspective, I would expect a lot of that come from the additional draw inventory we are carrying as part of startup. Yes. I think we're starting to see some green shoots in new housing, so we are like either bouncing along the bottom or we are coming off from the trough from new housing. So that's positive. And remember, we are kind of six months behind the new housing starts number that you might see. Our share position in there remains very strong. And on the replacement side, again, if you believe, even the recent Wall Street Journal article about homeowners starting to do more repairs and renovations, we think higher demand there will probably result from lower interest rates and consumer confidence. But all that said, there is just a lot of uncertainty. On the value tier, our comment was driven by because of the SEER changes, because of the pricing levels, and because of the higher interest rates that are prevailing versus a few years ago. So we just want to watch out for that going forward. So a lot more for us to analyze and evaluate before we come to you in 2025 and give you more firm guidance on those things. Good morning, Steve. Yes. And I think, Steve, depends on which type of distributors. I mean, we can talk about our distributors. We haven't seen our distributors stocking up. We are seeing our distributors going away from destocking, so they're going back to normal inventory levels that existed pre-COVID and we haven't seen them taking extraordinary measures to stock up. Now, I think in Q4, they might do some 410 pre-buy to get some price advantage versus 454B. But I have not seen any -- at least from our distributors that we work with, any big push to stock up. Yes. We'll get you greater clarity in 2025 because I do -- we'll have more clarity both on like 65, 35, 454B, but I think that's roughly the right math and the way you looked at it right now. ...most of this is going to look at mix -- most is going to look at mix versus price, right, because these are brand new products. ...mid-single digit is a good range. Listen, from my perspective, I would say the industry volume -- and this is installed on the ground, so away from any like distributor stock-in or stock-out and all that, I would think it's going to be flat to slightly up next year and a lot of that's just driven by the ongoing trends, age of units, and the cost of repair versus replays. But I wish I could predict that more accurately, Steve. Everybody is going to have a different view on that. Remember, new home construction is picking up, so right. Whenever somebody stumbles, some of that becomes permanent, like when we stumbled with the tornado, it took us years, like six years, to get that share back. So when I look at our past tumbles, some dealers will switch back, some won't, so -- I mean that's my part. Our comment is, our goal is to make them as permanent as possible. But that is where execution comes down and see what works. Yes, so talking about end contractors, I mean, the good news is we are belly-to-belly with 10,000 of them, and I can tell you all 10,000 have 10,000 -- like individual views. So depending on whom you ask, you will get that view. In general, I would say, most contractors would prefer to continue doing what they are doing. They are chain resistant, but they also realize that they don't have a choice and they have to move to 454B. It only comes down to some of them, especially the high-end one will want to move sooner versus later because they are selling a high-end product and they are not at the bottom end of the range. Others who are more chuck in the truck and at the bottom end of the range, they will want to keep doing 410A as long as possible. On the positive side, it's been well accepted. People have gone through training. People understand how to install it. We are spending a lot of time doing training. Other distributors are doing a lot of time doing training, so that will happen. Is there a risk that some of them will stock up more on 410A at the end of the quarter because they do have garages and barns, they may not have warehouses? Yes, I think there is a risk to that. I mean, that's a risk we deal with every year. I was at a barn in Wisconsin, and actually, you saw that, so. I think fundamentally - you did, absolutely. I still think it comes down to the age of the unit. So if the unit is five-year-old and it's got a compressor broken, the dealer is likely to come and change the compressor. If it's a, 12 to 15-year-old unit where the compressors broken and the motor is making noises, they are likely to replace the whole system. In the 12 to 15-year-old unit, because the extra cost of 410A, once it spikes and it has not spiked yet, it becomes an additional factor that comes into play. So I don't think -- just like the R22 to 410A pieces, in the beginning years, it didn't change the repair to replace, but in the future years, it did move it more towards replacement versus repair. I think the same thing is going to happen, probably no impact in 2025 for repair versus replace, but in future years it will. We haven't sized or broadcast that yet, but we know what we used to have, and we also know that the industry broadly has a healthy mix between emergency replacement and key account and we are essentially almost all key accounts. So the industry is 60:40. We are probably 90:10 in that, in terms of 90% key account and 10% emergency replacement. So we do know we have a significant opportunity for us to take that forward. You can take that and multiply it by AHRI industry data, but the industry is a lot more weighted towards emergency replacement than we are. Maybe next year we will come back and give you some sizing on that."

            "name": "Michael Quenzer",
            "content": "Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. We are pleased to report our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year adjusted earnings per share growth. This quarter, we increased our adjusted segment margin by 90 basis points and achieved a remarkable 15% revenue growth, resulting in 24% adjusted EPS growth. Now I will share more details on our third quarter financial results. Core revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, up nearly $200 million from last year, attributed mostly to volume gains in both segments. Adjusted segment profit increased by $52 million or 21%, driven by $86 million in volume as well as price and mix benefits. This was partially offset by regulatory transition costs and expenses related to our new commercial factory ramp-up. Ongoing investments also impacted profits as we are committed to strategic initiatives in sales and distribution to support consistent profitable growth. The tax rate was 18.7% and diluted shares outstanding were $35.8 million compared to $35.7 million in the prior year quarter. Let's now turn to Slide 6 and review the third quarter financial performance of the Home Comfort Solutions segment. The Home Comfort Solutions segment had an exceptional quarter, delivering 15% revenue growth, 25% segment profit growth, and an impressive 170 basis point expansion in segment profit margin. Sales volumes increased by 11%, fueled by over 30% growth in our two-step distributor channel, primarily reflecting normal restocking after several quarters of industry-wide destocking. Our one-step contractor channel saw modest volume growth supported by R-410A availability compared to the broader market. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw early signs of R-410A provide demand. Pricing execution has been a key focus for the HCS segment over the past year, driving 4% revenue growth in the quarter. Having successfully met our 2024 price improvement targets, we are now concentrating on pricing for the new R-454B products and these initiatives are progressing well. Finally, our quarterly profit was impacted by anticipated product cost challenges during our transition to our new R-454B products and for ongoing investments aimed at enhancing our distribution capabilities and improving the overall customer experience. Moving on to Slide 7. The Building Climate Solutions segment also delivered an impressive 15% revenue growth in the third quarter, 6% of which can be attributed to inorganic growth from our AES acquisition. We are very pleased with this acquisition, which was completed in the fourth quarter of last year. The integration was finished ahead of schedule and we have delivered better than expected AES profit margins, driven by additional synergies. From an organic growth perspective, sales volume was up 7% in the quarter but was constrained by manufacturing challenges and new factory ramp-up inefficiencies that limited production output. Segment profit increased by $9 million, though profit margin declined due to anticipated manufacturing ramp-up costs. Production startup at our new commercial factory in Saltillo, Mexico, remains on track. However, total manufacturing output for commercial HVAC continues to be below demand levels. For emergency replacement, we have started offering products in some pilot markets and early results are encouraging. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will review our cash flow performance and capital deployment strategies. Operating cash flow for the quarter totaled $452 million compared to $313 million in the same period last year. Capital expenditures were $40 million, representing $1 million increase year-over-year. Our cash flow performance has been solid this year, reflecting ongoing efforts to drive revenue growth, expand profit margins, and optimize working capital. Earlier this year, we implemented working capital initiatives with a focus on accounts payable, which has been a driver of the $183 million increase in year-to-date operating cash flow. In the coming years, we will unlock additional working capital by leveraging digital tools and efficient processes. Our return on invested capital, ROIC, stands at 47%, an industry-leading figure that remains resilient across business cycles due to high non-discretionary replacement demand. We continue to expand ROIC year-over-year, while also making capital investments that are poised to deliver substantial benefits in the coming years. Finally, we maintain a healthy balance sheet with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 0.8 times, down from 1.8 times in the prior year. Our free cash flow deployment strategy remains focused on driving annual dividend growth and executing bolt-on acquisitions. We have reinitiated buybacks in the third quarter and we'll continue leveraging share repurchases to efficiently return excess cash to shareholders. If you will now turn to Slide 9, I will review our revised 2024 financial guidance. After the third quarter results and more visibility into the last quarter of the year, we have raised our full year revenue guidance. The table on the left summarizes our full year revenue growth factors. Total company core revenue is now projected to increase by approximately 10%. We now expect mid-single digit improvement in sales volumes, combined price and mix to be up low-single digits, and our AES acquisition to contribute low-single digit growth. As a result of our strong third quarter profit performance, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance to $20.75 to $21 from the previously guided range of $19.50 to $20.25. We are also raising our free cash flow guidance to $575 million to $650 million. As you can see, most of our other guide points have not changed except for interest expense, which is now estimated to be approximately $45 million. Overall, year-to-date performance combined with increased clarity on industry demand has given us the confidence to significantly raise our earnings per share guidance. With that, please turn to Slide 10, and I'll turn it back over to Alok for an overview of the low GWP Refrigerant transition. Yes, I think what we need to do is see this Q4 pre-buy play out and see kind of how that impacts the end-market demand as well as share gain initiatives as we've talked about. Normally, we've executed better than others during this transition. So those are two unknowns that we need to see how they play out over the next quarter. Yes, I'll just add, a lot of these costs we're experiencing right now, we believe are temporary. Obviously, we're trying to launch a factory. So in the second half of next year, when that factory is fully operational, these temporary transition costs should abate. I think, overall, we expect our margins to expand at both next year, predominantly led by the mix benefits that we'll see. Then offsetting some of that will be some of the investments we're making. We're going to have at least a 30% incremental on the mix and then we'll get some more volume tailwinds hopefully in share, which is also 30% incremental. We'll have to go through all the puts and takes and some of the investments we're making, but 25% to 30% incremental sound in the range, but we got to go through all the details still. And I'll just add on that. That's one of the initiatives I started is trying to align the organization on working capital management, especially as we look to get 90% or even close to 100% of free cash to net income. So it's something we're focused on over the next couple of years. But yes, we are generating a lot of cash, and our deployment strategy is going to be basically consistent where every year we're going to increase our dividend. We're going to look at our dividend yield compared to growth companies in the S&P 500, so we'll do that. And then we're also evaluating bolt-on acquisitions that have to have the right fit with the right returns on it. So we're being very disciplined in that, but we're definitely focused there. And then thereafter, it's going to be about share repurchases. We started getting back into share repurchases this quarter. We'll continue to do those, but it will be kind of a tool to efficiently deploy that capital if we don't do acquisitions. Yes. I think what we've looked at is different technologies, kind of bolt-on technologies in the commercial space. They just give us a better product offering with our commercial customers. We've looked at distribution opportunities to have a full assortment of products that we can sell through our residential distribution network. Those are two big ones. And then there is just different technologies to make our product smarter, either on the thermostats, IQ, so it's a host of things that we're looking at, but again, they got to have the right fit and the right price. Yes, what I'll say is that our industry-leading ROIC is mostly driven by our organic disciplined approach to investments, so we've not done a lot of inorganic acquisitions. Obviously, when you do those, they will be dilutive. But when we look at acquisitions like we did with AES, it was a good ROIC, well above 20%, but still below the 47% that we're tracking. So we'll continue to look at bolt-on acquisitions that are above our cost of capital. And then from a capital expenditure perspective, we do the same thing. So we're not necessarily targeted on growing above 47%, but we want to stay 40% and have good ROI projects on these CapEx, and so we're looking at both on the organic capital expenditures and the inorganic acquisitions to have healthy ROIC above our cost of capital. Yes. What we're expecting is more of a kind of price cost. It will come through. We'll have mix-up for the pricing that we just talked about and then the drop-through on that mix will be at least 30% to maintain our gross margins and reflect the additional costs that we're having to put into the product and investments that we're making. Our volume incrementals are also similar to 30%. So we have both kind of dropping through 30% of the mix next year and our normal volume gains. And all that said, on top of comps, if you go back to Q3 last year, that channel is down 20% due to destocking, so definitely favorable comps year-over-year as they restock as Alok mentioned. And then I'll just add, the stick rate we normally see in regulatory transitions is high because we're making a lot of cost investment as we need to stick it. And interest rates are going to have a heavy influence in that as well."

All lines are currently in a listen-only mode and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chelsey Pulcheon from Lennox Investor Relations team. Chelsey, please go ahead.\nChelsey Pulcheon: Thank you, Madison. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We are excited to share our 2024 second quarter results. Joining me is CEO, Alok Maskara; and CFO, Michael Quenzer. Each will share their prepared remarks before we move to the Q&A session. Turning to Slide 2. A reminder that during today\u2019s call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as outlined on this page. We may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management considers relevant indicators of underlying business performance. Please refer to our SEC filings available on our Investor Relations website for additional details, including a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP measures. The earnings release, today\u2019s presentation and the webcast archive link for today\u2019s call are available on our Investor Relations website at investor.lennox.com. Now please turn to Slide 3 as I turn the call over to our CEO, Alok Maskara.\nAlok Maskara: Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning. I\u2019m pleased to share that Lennox delivered outstanding Q2 financial results and has also made significant progress on multiple strategic initiatives. I\u2019m proud to highlight that we have now achieved six consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. This demonstrates the power of our transformation plan and management\u2019s ability to consistently execute our growth acceleration initiatives. Turning our attention to Slide 3. Let\u2019s review some of the achievements of this quarter. Lennox\u2019s core revenue grew 8%, and our adjusted segment margin expanded 100 basis points to record 21.9%, resulting in an adjusted earnings per share increase of 11% to $6.83. We generated $184 million of operating cash flow and our industry-leading ROIC grew to 44%. Home Comfort Solutions delivered record segment margins of 23.3%, a 170 basis point expansion over prior year as we started experiencing the end of destocking in our two-step distribution business. Our Building Climate Solutions segment continued its track record of profit growth. In addition, we manufactured our first units at our new commercial factory in Saltillo, Mexico. As we continue to ramp up this factory, we know that there will be second half inefficiencies, but we are excited about the addition of growth capacity to better meet customer demand by year-end. One of our key accomplishments this quarter was the establishment of a joint venture with Samsung. This joint venture will open up exciting opportunities for both companies by combining Samsung\u2019s global reach and brand strength with our direct-to-dealer distribution network. This collaboration is expected to significantly enhance our heat pump market share. Strong first half results give us the confidence to increase our full year EPS guidance, raising it to a range of $19.50 to $20.25. Our focus on executing our transformation plan continues to pay off. But before moving on, I want to express my gratitude to our dedicated employees and loyal customers who have made this success possible. Now please turn to Slide 4 for more details on our recent joint venture with Samsung. I\u2019m excited to provide more insights on the Samsung-Lennox HVAC North America joint venture. Our collaboration is all about accelerating heat pump growth both for ducted and ductless products. Let\u2019s start with what makes this partnership a winning combination. Lennox and Samsung are mutually exclusive ductless HVAC partners in North America, combining our strengths to create a comprehensive and integrated portfolio that will benefit our customers. This integration allows us to leverage our direct channel strength with Samsung\u2019s global brand and technology, providing unparalleled value and service to our dealers. Heat pumps currently make up about 30% of the market and through our joint venture we can extend our reach within this fast-growing category. Our joint offerings include attractive ductless solutions, and we are particularly excited about our colder climate heat pumps, which are designed to deliver better performance in the Northern U.S. regions. Another key advantage of our joint venture is the enhanced technology it will provide our customers. Samsung\u2019s SmartThings controls and home automation platform are at the forefront of innovation providing seamless integration and superior energy monitoring for homeowners. Both companies are committed to North American specific new product development ensuring our offerings meet the highest quality standards and deliver superior comfort to our consumers. In the future, we expect to provide our dealers with combined ducted and ductless offerings in addition to more hybrid heat pump systems. This joint venture is set to accelerate heat pump growth for us through an industry-leading portfolio with advanced technology and strong brands. Ultimately, this partnership between Lennox, a North American Champion, and Samsung, a global champion, is poised to be a winning combination. We are looking forward to driving growth and innovation together. Now let me hand the call to Michael, who will take us through the details of our Q2 financial performance.\nMichael Quenzer: Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. As Alok mentioned at the start of this call, we are pleased to report our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year double-digit earnings per share growth. In addition to delivering double-digit profit growth, we have achieved year-over-year ROS expansion in each of those quarters. The strong second quarter financial performance underscores the effectiveness of our strategies and the dedication of our team. Now I will share more details on the second quarter financial results. Core revenue was $1.5 billion, up 8%, driven by sales volumes improvements, continued pricing excellence and benefits from the AES acquisition. Adjusted segment profit increased $38 million, or 13%. This improvement is largely due to $44 million of price and mix benefits and $19 million of organic and inorganic sales volume. These profit gains were partially offset by wage inflation, new factory ramp-up costs and investments in both SG&A distribution. Total adjusted segment margin was a record 21.9%, up approximately 100 basis points versus prior year. Our second quarter tax rate was 19.9% and diluted shares outstanding were $35.8 million compared to $35.6 million in the prior year quarter. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6 and review the financial performance of our Home Comfort Solutions segment. The Home Comfort Solutions segment had an exceptional quarter, delivering 5% revenue growth, 13% segment profit growth and an impressive 170 basis point expansion in segment profit margin. The 5% sales growth was primarily driven by our continued pricing excellence, which delivered 4% price yield in the quarter. In the second quarter, we achieved a volume growth of 1% driven by mid-single-digit increases in our 2-step distribution channel as industry destocking concluded midway through the quarter. Sales volumes through our direct-to-contractor business were flat to the prior year. We also experienced a $19 million year-over-year increase in expenses, driven by wage and general inflation as well as critical investments in distribution and sales to further our goal of improving the customer experience. Moving on to Slide 7. The Business Climate Solutions segment also continues to deliver strong revenue growth, up 15% this quarter. 6% of this revenue growth is attributed to the AES acquisition, which was completed in the fourth quarter of last year. We are very pleased with the integration progress of this new business and the substantial synergies we have already realized. In addition to inorganic growth, we achieved a notable 9% organic volume growth driven by gradual production improvements at our existing Stuttgart factory. While these improvements are positive, total production output still limits our ability to fully meet demand. We are encouraged by the progress of our new commercial factory, which remains on track, and we successfully built our first few units in early July. Profit for the segment increased $11 million, although this was moderated by approximately $5 million in ramp-up costs for our new commercial factory in Saltillo, Mexico. Please turn to Slide 8 where I will review our cash flow performance and capital deployment strategies. Operating cash flow generated in the quarter was $184 million compared to $196 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $33 million in the quarter, a decrease of $17 million compared to the prior year. In the second half, we anticipate temporary increases in working capital as we ramp up our new commercial factory in Saltillo, Mexico and prepare for the transition to the new low GWP product. The team also remains focused on accounts payable and accounts receivable process improvements to drive efficiencies. These factors are all included in our full year free cash flow guidance and long-term cash conversion targets. Maintaining our industry-leading ROIC is an important part of our investment strategy, additional factory capacity, enhancements to our distribution network and smooth regulatory transitions enable us to consistently deliver results and improve our competitiveness in the market. In addition, we\u2019re continually evaluating M&A opportunities that fit our strategic objectives positioning us for sustained growth market leadership. We have a very strong balance sheet with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 1.2x, down from 1.8x in the prior year. Our strategy for capital deployment remains focused on prioritizing high-return capital expenditure investments, increasing dividends annually and share repurchases dependent on M&A activity. We are also dedicated to maintaining our investment grade rating. If you will now turn to Slide 9, I will review our revised 2024 full year guidance. After the second quarter results and more visibility into the second half of the year, we have refined our full year revenue guidance for each segment. The table on the left summarizes our full year revenue growth factors. Total company revenue is still projected to increase by approximately 7%. We now expect low single-digit improvement in sales volumes, which reflects increases for both segments. Price and mix expectations remained relatively unchanged within the range of mid-single-digit revenue growth. As a result of our strong first half profit performance, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance to $19.50 to $20.25 from the previously guided $19 to $20. We\u2019re also maintaining our free cash flow guidance at $500 million to $600 million. Component cost inflation is now expected to be up low single digits compared to mid-single digits in our previous guide. We still anticipate year-over-year increases in R-410A refrigerant and commodity inflation. We anticipate ramp-up costs of approximately $10 million for the new Saltillo, Mexico factory along with approximately $10 million associated with refrigerant transition across both segments\u2019 manufacturing facilities. SG&A expenses are expected to increase in the year as a result of both inflationary pressures and investments. Our investments are focused on resources to improve customer experience and distribution growth initiatives. We will also be making investments in both sales and marketing to support our long-term growth targets. Capital expenditures are expected to remain unchanged at $175 million. Interest expense is still expected to be approximately $50 million. And tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. Overall, our performance in the first half of the year, combined with increased clarity on market risks, has given us the confidence to raise and narrow our EPS guide range. With that, please turn to Slide 10. And I\u2019ll turn it back over to Alok for an overview of end markets.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks, Michael. Let me provide updates on our outlook and share opportunities for both our segments. Within our Home Comfort Solutions segment, historically, Consumer Health has been a significant driver of the repair versus replace decision. Therefore, we are diligently monitoring macroeconomic factors, but have only seen minor shifts toward repairs. Encouragingly, industry inventory levels have largely returned to normal and recent updates on EPA ruling have provided greater clarity to the upcoming refrigerant transition. In the Home Comfort Solutions segment, the greater share opportunities will result from successfully executing the upcoming refrigerant transition, improving overall fulfillment rates and enhancing go-to-market capabilities. Within the Building Climate Solutions end market, we continue to watch for any indication of short-term disruptions due to the refrigerant transitions. However, order rates and backlog continue to be stable and feedback from our customers suggest that there is a strong pent-up demand for rooftop replacements. While we have seen project delays in some verticals, we are encouraged by the customer interest in our new cradle to grave services enabled by the recent AES acquisition. We remain excited about the opportunity to gain share in the emergency replacement market, leveraging our upcoming production capacity at Saltillo. The new production capacity at Saltillo will also free up capacity at our Stuttgart plant to target additional key accounts. Overall, our outlook for the year remains cautiously optimistic. Based on Lennox\u2019s history of successful regulatory transitions, we expect to benefit from new product mix and potential market share growth. Now please turn to Slide 11. As we conclude today\u2019s earnings call, I want to reaffirm our confidence in our ability to consistently deliver growth results by focusing on the five elements of our strategic transformation plan. First, we will continue to accelerate growth by improving our go-to-market effectiveness. Second, we will expand resilient margins through pricing excellence, increased productivity and by leveraging our direct-to-dealer network. Third, by leveraging the Lennox unified management system, we will streamline processes, leverage best practices, and consistently execute our strategy. Fourth, our continued technological advancement will enable Lennox to remain at the forefront of innovation for our customers. Finally, our core values and guiding behaviors are the foundation of our winning culture, supported by our pay-for-performance incentive structure. This comprehensive strategy not only supports our brand performance, but also reinforces our commitment to delivering long-term goals. I am immensely proud of our achievements, and I firmly believe that our greater successes are still ahead of us. Thank you for listening. We will be happy to take questions now. Madison, let\u2019s go to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ryan Merkel with William Blair.\nRyan Merkel: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start on the price mix contribution at up 3% versus the mid-single-digit guide. Are you expecting price mix to improve in the second half?\nMichael Quenzer: Hey Ryan, this is Michael. No, actually, what we\u2019re expecting is the second half of the year to be similar to the first half. So I think we were kind of low-single digits in the first half, I think we\u2019re applying slightly mid-single digits in the second half. If you recall in the first quarter, we had some unfavorable mix, mostly because of residential new construction in the HCS business. But overall, price mix should continue on similar to what we saw in Q2.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Okay. And then I had a question on the outlook. Just to clarify, residential, you lowered it to up 5, I think, it was up 6 last quarter, but you raised the volume to low single digits from flat. Can you just unpack that a little bit and talk about what you are expecting in the second half?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes. That\u2019s just cleaning up some of the guide points based off the year-to-date mix that we\u2019ve seen in both Q1 and Q2.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Okay. So nothing has really changed with the resi outlook. You mentioned minor shift to repair, but not a lot has changed.\nMichael Quenzer: Nope. Not a lot. We just cleaned up with the guide points.\nRyan Merkel: All right, thanks, I am passing on.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Damian Karas with UBS.\nDamian Karas: Hey good morning everyone.\nMichael Quenzer: Good morning.\nAlok Maskara: Good morning, Damian.\nDamian Karas: Congrats on the JV. Alok, maybe I just wanted to ask you about that, how are you thinking about the financial impact of the JV? You talked a little bit about it\u2019s really focused on heat pump and our opportunity to gain the market share, how much of an uplift to your organic growth profile for the residential Home Comfort Business? Do you think that represents? And any other kind of margin or cash flow impact to the JV we should be thinking about?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. Yes, thanks. So, let me start by saying it\u2019s going to impact both the Home Comfort Solutions and also the Building Climate Solutions because, obviously, we bring many splits mostly for HCS, and we bring VRF products mostly for BCS on both sides. As we looked at our long-term goals, we have always talked about that heat pump penetration is a pending opportunity for Lennox. And this essentially closes the gap between our portfolio and what the market leading portfolios were. The cash flow margins on that from a JV contribution, it\u2019s not going to be meaningful. What\u2019s going to be meaningful is the margins we make on selling the products, the share we gain by expanding our heat pump portfolio and the increased benefit of having a strong partner like Samsung as we develop new technology, whether it\u2019s core climate, heat pump technology, or just simply look at controls such as smart things and total integration for a home or building control. But the JV itself, the way we look at it is the financials are not going to be material to our bottom line numbers, but it\u2019s going to be the results of partnering and selling those products that we are super excited about. We went through a long process. We\u2019ve been exploring for this for about two years, spoke to several different potential partners, and we do believe Samsung is kind of the best partner for us given that we have \u2013 we can consider ourselves as the North American champion and they consider themselves and are a global champion. So putting that together, we are excited about the combination.\nDamian Karas: Makes sense, thanks for that. And I want to ask you about Home Comfort. I think investors were getting pretty bullish just experiencing some of the hot temperatures thus far this summer, so it feels like kind of your resi volumes are a little bit more stable. You did raise the expectations for the year to low single digits. Could you just maybe talk about kind of how your orders, trends have been progressing through the second quarter and kind of how July has been playing out so far?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So one of the things we \u2013 Michael and try I really, really hard is not to talk about weather in an earnings conference call. And I think there\u2019s a \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen any upside to talk about whether in the earnings conference call, but it does have an impact. But listen, the year is progressing along as we expected is a simple way to look at it. Yes, there was some price mix cleanup that we did based on results year-to-date. But overall, the volumes are as we expected. Last year, we talked about destocking ending in the first half. It ended in Q2. We had wished it ended in Q1. We think consumer demand is very stable, and that\u2019s reflected in our volume guide for the year and our first half performance. So nothing really has changed. What\u2019s exciting there is the upcoming 454B refrigerant, that the EPA rules and the clarification on EPA rules has just given us more confidence going forward on what it could be. But at the same time, there are quite a few uncertainties that remains in the second half. And those are around 454 transitions, how competition will do around that, will there be a large pre-buy or not, election years could be weird for consumer behavior, so we are watching out for all of that. So we built all of that uncertainty into our second half guide and try to reflect that.\nDamian Karas: Great, thanks for your thought. Best of luck.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc.\nTommy Moll: Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions.\nAlok Maskara: Good morning.\nMichael Quenzer: Good morning, Tommy.\nTommy Moll: First question for you on the Home Comfort Solutions volume, so the outlook for the year went from flat to up low singles. Can you just tell us what your underlying assumptions are there for two-step versus direct? And then on the two-step side, any context you can provide as to how the destocking ended through Q2, even if just anecdotal would be of interest. Thank you.\nMichael Quenzer: Sure, Tom. Yes, on the full year guide, what we\u2019re expecting on the sell-through of the direct side is approximately flat for the full year and down the two step up mid-single digits. So that kind of blends to up low single-digit increase. As you recall, when we went into the year, we expected the direct side through our Lennox channel to be down low single digits, that\u2019s performing a little bit better. And then the destocking, as we mentioned, yes, it definitely accelerated as we went through the quarter, and June was better than the beginning of the quarter. So pleased to see the destocking ending.\nTommy Moll: Thanks Michael. As a follow-up, I wanted to hit on the reference to product mix and inflation. Alok, this was on your 2024 slide. I\u2019m just talking to the drivers of some of the end markets. And I\u2019m just curious what was behind that comment. And maybe more importantly, Alok, do you continue to view ten plus percent as a cumulative realization on the A2L product? Thanks.\nAlok Maskara: Yes. Let me start with the 10%, yes, the answer is simple, and it\u2019s yes. We continue to expect ten-plus percentage pricing benefit on that. I think there\u2019s any change in the product mix that we talked about and Michael referenced earlier, were minor. It was more driven by the fact that we do see consumers continue to demand 410 products and we don\u2019t see the industry or ourselves having a significant share of 454B sales this year. If we had talked about in Q1, we\u2019re just kind of reconfirming that 454B is going to be about 10% plus pricing increase. We think majority of this year\u2019s sales are going to continue to be 410A even more than we thought previously. And we remain very bullish about 454B next year as a step change in the industry\u2019s profile around margin expectations and a step change in technology. And we are also very confident that we are in a strong, strong position to execute well and give up dealers exactly what they want, which is they want 410 products as long as possible, and then they want to switch to 454B as seamlessly as possible.\nTommy Moll: Thank you, Alok. I\u2019ll turn it back.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, thank you. Good morning everyone. Hey, speaking of election uncertainty, can you just level set us on what your \u2013 how much of your sales contribution is coming out of your Mexico facilities at this point? I think we had it sort of in the mid-20s when we did this fire drill in 2018 and 2019? Any update there would be helpful. Thank you.\nAlok Maskara: So sure. On the BCS side, we\u2019re just starting the Mexico facility, so it\u2019s close to zero on that one right now. On the HCS side, our low-end products are mostly made in Mexico. Overall, I would say it\u2019s about half of our products come from Mexico. And we have obviously all the standard protections around making sure we have the Maquiladora structure and all that set up. We\u2019ll see where the election goes. I mean, I think we are in a very strong position. We are taking steps to just like starting two years ago to reduce our reliance and sourcing more products locally and we continue to do that. But we do have half of our production coming from Mexico, which gives us substantial advantages even when we buy components and bring them from overseas into Mexico.\nMichael Quenzer: And I\u2019ll just add, our competition also manufacturers in Mexico is very similar to us.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Understood. And then, Michael, just on free cash flow, it\u2019s kind of a modest weak, right? But estimate \u2013 net income is going up, free cash flow isn\u2019t, it already wasn\u2019t a particularly strong free cash flow conversion year. Just kind of what\u2019s going on there? And maybe we know CapEx is probably going down in 2025, which will help on the conversion, but maybe just a little bit of additional color on what to expect \u2013 how things play out the remainder of the year and into the first part of next year?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes, I think some of that is just around flexibility. We want to work with the markets and our customers as this 410A transition occurs to the 454B and the ramp-up of the new factory to make sure we have sufficient raw materials and inventory there. So really, it\u2019s just more uncertainty in the second half of some of our inventory levels, but we\u2019re focused on driving that cash flow perspective. But then as we get into next year, we\u2019ve set targets at near 90% cash flow conversion. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on right now.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks. I\u2019ll leave it there.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. So Alok, I know would have a live just installed a bunch of Samsung heat pumps and they\u2019re great. So congratulations on that JV. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ve got a slice of that, by the way. It might have been before the JV was formed, but it\u2019s worked really well. So just talking about the sell-through down mid-single full year direct business, June had two few selling days. So I know you don\u2019t like to talk about the weather, but maybe just address what impact those two few selling days\u2019 motor pads [ph] on the Home Comfort performance this quarter.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So I think Home Comfort on the direct side, Q2 was flat to last year, and we are guiding the full year also to be flat. Our original guide was to say we would be down low single digits on a direct-to-dealer method. So implied guide is higher for us in terms of in a direct side. On the 2-step, we expect second half to be pretty strong. But as you can imagine, the destocking went on a little longer than we all had expected. That\u2019s kind of the only change that has happened in our outlook for HCS is midway through the year. As Michael said, we updated a bunch of our guide points. But the reality, the only change has been that we destocking lasted a little longer, but now we are confident is over our direct is doing a little better than we expected to be essentially flat compared to last year. And we think 454B is going to be on track and it\u2019s going to be launched and sold mostly in 2025. But there\u2019s no really change to our outlook beyond that.\nNigel Coe: Yes. But the June impact, did that have an impact in the quarter?\nAlok Maskara: Sorry, which impact?\nNigel Coe: The selling days, the two few selling days, did that have an impact?\nAlok Maskara: No. I think from a 2Q, we didn\u2019t see any specific impact of that, no.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Great. And then just digging into the commercial \u2013 the building control segments. Price mix, I think, was pretty flat this quarter. That\u2019s obviously been very strong. I know you got tougher comps as we sort of lap that impact. But anything to call out there? I know you\u2019re still calling for a mid-single-digit impact on price mix. So just wondering if there\u2019s anything intra-quarter that we should think about?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes. We have some normal transitory mix within that segment. As you recall, we have HVAC equipment. We have services and we have refrigeration business. We did see a little bit of unfavorable mix, mostly in the service and refrigeration business, but nothing to be concerned about just kind of transitory normal mix. We expect that to continue kind of mid-single digits for the balance of the year in that segment.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe I just wanted to start with the BCS segment. So the top-line outlook, you talked about sort of solid demand, and you mentioned again these project delays that you talked about last call, but obviously, you\u2019ve taken up the volume guide for that segment for the year a little. So maybe just sort of update us, are these project delays kind of more or less than you\u2019d thought a few months ago in BCS. And any kind of updated thoughts about how we should look at the education vertical within BCS just as that as a funding starts to sort of wind down over the next couple of years. Any sort of broad brush thoughts on that? And maybe too early to throw Mexico plant impact, but anything you could give us on the top-line.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. On the first part of the project delays, I think it\u2019s getting better, not worse, nothing to answer your question. When we called it out in Q1, there was a lot more noise. Part of it is everybody reads some news articles and we try and interpret our own results. But our backlog remains strong, orders remain strong, and we are still heavily supply constrained, not demand constrained. On the education vertical, it\u2019s kind of fairly steady. And I know there was some IRA funding, but we ran out. But education has been a good growth engine for us. Our share has been low. We are gaining share in that vertical, and we also feel really good about all the other verticals that have not picked up yet, especially around some of the food service and retail that went through the COVID lows and now they\u2019re kind of coming back up. So from our perspective, we don\u2019t think that makes a meaningful impact either way for us going forward, because we continue to be the end supply constrained or demand constrained in our BCS business.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks a lot. And then just my follow-up would be, I suppose, I know that you and Michael, for very good reasons, don\u2019t like to get too in the weeds on sort of quarterly color and all the rest of it. But just as we\u2019re halfway through the year. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any sort of points you could give us for the balance of the year. I think often, for example, the third quarter, we get that seasonal double-digit earnings decline sequentially. I just wondered if this year might be different because of something going on with the refrigerants change coming up or the Mexican plant just starting pilot production? And just on that Mexican plant sort of related, just any sort of pointers on revenue effects over the next 12 months?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. So I\u2019d say on the \u2013 let me start with the Mexican plant and then I\u2019ll come back to the other part of your question. On the Mexican plant, we had inefficiencies in Q2, and we called it out. Imagine we have like 300 to 400 people fully on our payroll, a building under construction, but zero sales. So from that perspective, something similar will happen in Q3 as well. So I think that\u2019s sort of embedded and built into our numbers and guide. From a revenue perspective, we expect the bulk of the revenue to start coming through only 2025. We want to make sure these products are really good, highest quality. We are going to test them fully. We\u2019re going to field try them before we start of mass market launch. And of course, there will be revenue in Q4 as well. But I think a meaningful revenue from Mexico would be in 2025. Not much has changed in terms of seasonality. I think the historical seasonality in Q2 and Q3 used to be similar, we may have had some situations back and forth. But I think that will be a similar. What we have to watch out for, honestly, is to think about is there going to be a significant amount of pre-buy a 410A product? And if there is demand, does the manufacturers have the capacity and ability to make additional 410A product. That\u2019s sort of the uncertainty that concerns us right now. But we sort of embedded that within the range of the guidance point we gave out. But I would expect nothing unusual besides the Mexican plant inefficiency that we mentioned [Technical Difficulty] early.\nJulian Mitchell: Got it. So third quarter is sort of similar to Q2 and then we have that Mexican caveat this year to watch.\nAlok Maskara: Yes, essentially with a normal seasonality bits like last year.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks so much for taking the questions. On the Samsung JV, Alok, can you kind of walk us through the game plan for how this gets operationalized when the Samsung products start to become available to the dealers and in distribution and sort of the strategy around how you\u2019re marketing that? And then Michael, I believe it was already said that it\u2019s not expected to be any material contribution this year. But presumably, there\u2019s going to be good growth and equity income at some point from this you\u2019re not consolidating it. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, so this should show up as an equity income contribution. Where will that actually show up in the financials? Will that be in corporate? Will be split among the segments? Because presumably, it\u2019s going to be margin accretive once it starts coming on.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. Let me start on the availability. So to minimize any dealer disruptions, we are going to launch the Samsung products in the A2L range. So we will run out with our current products and keep running through that through the 410A transition and that Samsung powering the Lennox product would be launched as the new R32 product, and so you would expect it towards the end of the year. So until then for our dealers and all, it\u2019s status quo. Obviously, in the background, we are doing everything from making sure we have sufficient inventory in hand, getting the branding right, doing test marketing with the dealers, going through the technology SPACs [ph], but essentially revenue 2025 launch this year. On the second aspect of it in the JV, the equity income, again, is not going to be meaningful. The whole point of this JV is going to be around technology development and the margins we make on selling the product through our channels. Samsung will make manufacturing margin. We would make distribution margin. And it\u2019s a great way for us to test and demonstrate how we are going to be a better distributor. Now we already do this with a different vendor. So it\u2019s not new, and you\u2019re not going to see a step change anywhere. If I were to model anything, I would just model greater heat pump market share for Lennox based on this JV, because we think this gives us a very strong offering, great brand name, and it gives us dealers a great choice to fight against other market-leading companies who are currently dominating this space.\nMichael Quenzer: And on, I\u2019ll just add specific to where it\u2019s going to land in the P&L. We already have equity income on our P&L. So it will be on top of that. But as Alok mentioned, it\u2019s going to be minimal. The biggest gain is going to be within the segments for sales and margins.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. Very helpful. That plays into the second question around distribution. You called out some increased investments. You\u2019ve been very clear that you have a strategy to become a best-in-class distributor, maybe unpack some of the use of those investments you\u2019re making here and through the back half of the year. Help us understand how the strategy is progressing.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. The strategy is progressing really well. We are pleased with what we are saying. Some leading indicators such as fill rate have improved substantially. So like at the end, all of this investment spend is worth nothing if we don\u2019t deliver the appropriate impact to the customer and if it doesn\u2019t reflect in our share. So all of those things are running positive for us. Fill rate, customer share, customer satisfaction, all of that\u2019s doing well. The investment is around, a lot of just around warehousing, logistics, a lot is around IT systems and making sure we have the appropriate systems to keep track of our products, do the appropriate [indiscernible]. And then finally, talent. We are now getting to world-class talent level, a lot from outside, some from inside, putting it all together. And we remain committed to putting those \u2013 in some cases, we were just behind. We started this as company-owned factory outlets, and we\u2019re now becoming a distributor, and we have raised the power on ourselves. But we are really pleased with the progress as we see all the leading indicators, which bodes well for us from continued market share gain going forward in the future as well.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks very much as always for the caller. Looking forward to seeing the progress.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey guys. Good morning. So I think I\u2019m going to start with the \u2013 in the Home Comfort Solutions business, you guys called out that $19 million drag to margins. I know that you\u2019ll give a lot more color in the queue, but \u2013 maybe if you could just give us some of the kind of moving pieces, whether it\u2019s SG&A, freight and then also component costs because you have seen probably a pretty material decline in your material cost. And I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about that through the rest of the year as well.\nMichael Quenzer: Yes. So the component costs are actually in that product cost buckets. So we are seeing a little bit better on the component costs, mostly material cost reduction programs. The $19 million of other, think of it about half of that related to freight and distribution and a good portion of that being investments in distribution, the other half being SG&A inflation and some of the IT and investments in head count that Alok mentioned.\nAlok Maskara: Yes. And just as a reminder on that, if I could jump in. I mean, we have broadcast very loudly that we\u2019re investing in additional sales resources. Our Lennox residential HVAC business has 20% additional sales resources. We are redoing our incentive comps. So this has all been under works for a while, but by the end of the year, we will start lapping ourselves on this, but these are all necessary and appropriate investments with very attractive payback.\nJoe Ritchie: Yes. That makes sense. And I guess maybe just a longer-term question, Alok, given the Bosch announcement on the JCI assets, whenever there\u2019s any kind of changing in the hands, there\u2019s sometimes some investor angst as to what that means for the kind of discipline of the industry. I\u2019d be curious to hear if you have any just initial thoughts on whether you think this kind of changes industry dynamics or your ability to continue to kind of gain share, particularly in the residential sector.\nAlok Maskara: Sure. Well, on that one, I\u2019ll first start congratulating the management team at Bosch and the management team at JCI on the transaction. I\u2019m sure it was hours and hours of hard work, lost leap of multiple weekends, not that I\u2019m speaking for experience on the same transaction or anything, but I just want to congratulate them and glad that is finally sealed and signed. From our perspective, I think Bosch is a very reputable company. I think they focus on technology. They have done wonderful things by investing in R&D and they plow a lot of money back into charitable and social causes. I mean we are looking forward to Bosch joining the list of very disciplined industry players and becoming another one of them. I mean they are much better than some of the other field owners of the JCI assets and I\u2019m super excited that the industry will remain disciplined going forward and we\u2019ll compete on technology. We\u2019ll compete on differentiation. We\u2019ll compete on better service and quality. So I\u2019m super excited about where we are.\nJoe Ritchie: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJeff Hammond: Hey, good morning.\nMichael Quenzer: Good morning.\nAlok Maskara: Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Hammond: Just \u2013 yes on the refrigerant change, I\u2019m just wondering have you guys introduced your new products and pricing into the market and gotten any feedback? And then we\u2019ve heard from a couple of other competitors that they\u2019ve kind of put out the last call for 410A which might start to indicate what level of pre-buy you might get. Just any color on those two fronts.\nAlok Maskara: Yes. It seems \u2013 Jeff, it seems that every competition has launched these products on social media. If you look at the nice pretty picture that we all put out. But I think from practice, you can\u2019t buy a 454B unit from anybody yet. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 we had a similar situation. Are we ready to launch it? Yes. Have we made a few trial units, yes, just like everybody else. We are on track to launch it as customer demand picks up, especially as we get into 2025. From overall last call perspective, we haven\u2019t made a last call, but we are working with our distribution partners and dealers to truly understand what their demand requirements are and tailor our manufacturing according to that. We have a very focused operation, as you know, and we want to remain flexible to give our dealers and distributors what they want. So for us, right now, our production is 410A and we\u2019ll continue producing it till the time the dealers want it until the time the law allows us to do it.\nJeff Hammond: So I guess the comment on trade down is that as you\u2019re getting feedback from your distributors and dealers that are wanting more of that 410A. But anything else within kind of the trade down dynamic where consumers are trading down, whether in SEER or future?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. The trade down, which is a mix comment Michael was saying. First of all, any reference is mostly just rounding and small. But yes, we are expecting to sell more 410A versus more 454B. But even beginning of the year, we were expecting to sell mostly 410A throughout the year. No major dynamics on the consumer as we went from 13 to 14 SEER, obviously, there\u2019s some compression in the product line, right? Like people who are buying 16 SEERs and I\u2019m often happy with the 14, so it\u2019s a bit of a natural thing as we can sell lower SEER products, but we don\u2019t see any meaningful trade down. If I think of our sales of Merit products, Elite products and Signature got a good, better, best, those ratios are relatively the same. So I don\u2019t see major trade down on that.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho.\nBrett Linzey: Hi. Good morning all. I wanted to come back to BCS. So the factory ramp costs unchanged at $10 million for the year. What was the total impact year-to-date? And I guess as the production ramps into next year, should we think of that capacity getting absorbed in that $10 million becomes a tailwind? Or is there still some under absorption you\u2019re going to fill there?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes. So year-to-date, it was $7 million, so $5 million in Q2, $2 million in the first quarter. And that\u2019s exactly right. So as we fully ramp up that factory to full efficiency second half of next year, we\u2019ll start to see the efficiencies \u2013 those inefficiencies go away.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Great. And then just on the pilot units in early July, so you\u2019re making the necessary factory investments. Where do you stand from a boots on the ground front-end selling standpoint as you look to reenter that emergency replacement market next year? Have you made the investments? Or is there more to go?\nAlok Maskara: We have made most of the investments. So at Q2 exit, the run rate would reflect most of the investments made in there. We were hiring starting kind of Q4 last year and over the past three quarters, Q4, Q1, Q2, we have made the necessary investment, and it is reflected in our Q2 exit rate. It\u2019s gone very well. I mean we\u2019re excited about the increase in our boots on the ground, we\u2019re excited about the process discipline that we are bringing along with that. We\u2019re also super excited about sort of putting our customers and dealers in a position to win again and getting them the confidence around our own availability, our lead time. And now we are in the process of setting up distribution points around the country to make sure that we can satisfy emergency replacement demand the same day in most cases and next day at the worst because that\u2019s sort of the critical portion of how you win this. So we know we\u2019re in that portion, and that\u2019s some of the distribution investment that we mentioned earlier.\nBrett Linzey: Appreciate the insight. Best of luck.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.\nSteve Volkmann: Hi. Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but just a couple of follow-ups. What is \u2013 how should we think about your heat pump share now in terms of trying to think about what the upside could be under the JV?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. I think we mentioned that heat pumps in the U.S. are around 30% of sales. We are closer to 20%, 25% of sales. So if you think about that like there\u2019s a significant delta between our sales and where the industry is. Share depends on, obviously, different players, so don\u2019t want to comment on shares, but think of that five to 10-point difference between us and the industry has an opportunity for us to win that amount and accelerate our growth. It\u2019s going to come from two things, right? One is the Samsung piece. Second is also launching on a unitary side or the ducted side, combined products are just more products on the heat pump that meet the cold climate requirement, and that\u2019s all going to happen in the first half of next year. As currently, all our innovation teams are focused on A2L, and once we take a breather out of it, we have a new lineup of heat pump ready to go on the unitary side as well. So super excited about what this brings to us and our ability to claw back and get into the industry average for heat pump share. So we are quite behind.\nSteve Volkmann: Perfect. Okay. Thanks. And then are you at all concerned that a change in administration might have some impact on the A2L transition either in terms of timing or amount or anything like that?\nAlok Maskara: No, we are not. This is kind of baked into law at this stage. And some of these changes happened when the administration was under a different political party. So I think at this stage, there\u2019s absolutely no chance of that happening.\nSteve Volkmann: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Hi. Good morning. Can you just give the cadence of the refrigerant conversion cost that $10 million you called out, how we see that kind of filtering over the course of the year?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes. It\u2019s all going to be second half. So we haven\u2019t experienced any of that yet, and it will be kind of equal Q3 and Q4.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Okay. And then Al, can you just expand a little on how you think about the ROI attached to the 20% increase in sales resources. What \u2013 and is that primarily focused on kind of emergency replacement and with the new facility coming online. So overall, kind of what your time line is? And how you\u2019re thinking about that ROI and the markets that you\u2019re going after?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. From an ROI perspective, I think Michael talks about this, right. I think our internal investments are the best ROI and adding these resources has a better ROI than putting in new machineries in our factories. So it\u2019s a pretty quick ROI. Most of these are two years or less payback. And most of the payback is around hiring process, getting people trained and ramp up, and they\u2019re not really very efficient for the first six to nine months, and they get pretty efficient after that. So it\u2019s good ROI. And the 20% comment, remember it applies both in our BCS and HCS. On HCS, it was about being a better distributor supporting our dealers better. And in BCS, yes, it was about focusing on emergency replacement and getting our district fully staffed up to do that, while maintaining our key accounts and investing in a key account from process and digital and separating those out in an appropriate way. So quick payback, super excited about it. What we need is production capacity and finally glad to see the SALTO factory with a roof on and with some units rolling through the conveyor belts.\nJoe O\u2019Dea: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nAlok Maskara: Good morning, Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: So most of my list has been answered. I guess maybe I\u2019ll ask one, two-part question. So BCS margins, I guess, is the expectation for continued year-on-year contraction in the second half as the plant ramps up? And I think you guys had expected kind of modest expansion for the full year. So I assume that\u2019s still the outlook. And then ditto on the resi HVAC side, I think you were also looking for modest expansion in margins in that segment for the full year. Just wondering if there\u2019s been any shift in that? Thank you.\nMichael Quenzer: No, that\u2019s generally what\u2019s implied in our guide. Overall, if you look at our total guide, we\u2019re projecting about a 50 basis margin expansion for the enterprise. And yes, there will be some contraction in the second half, mostly because of the ramp-up costs, both to transition to the new refrigerant and the second factor BCS. But those are the kind of headwinds we see in the second half that a little bit of a margin decline. But overall, full year margins up.\nNicole DeBlase: Thanks Michael. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nMichael Quenzer: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nAlok Maskara: Good morning, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Just had a quick first question on the emergency replacement share opportunity. Just to make sure I understand what \u2013 where does it stand today? What has been lacking? What are you intending to do better to capture that opportunity?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. Thanks, Deane. I mean that\u2019s an important portion of our future growth opportunity, both from revenue and margin. So thanks for bringing it up. So pre-disruption in Stuttgart, so think of like pre-2021, 2022, we had small share in emergency replacement. That went to essentially zero during the Stuttgart disruptions. We have started selling into emergency replacement now, but we are still selling drips and drabs, not in any sustained flow basis. We look at that as a significant opportunity for us. For the full industry, emergency replacement is up to half of the revenue, depending on which player you talk about. So think of us so far being focused only on the other half and having very little or no share on the emergency replacement piece. So over the multiyear horizon, we think it\u2019s a huge opportunity. Next year, we\u2019ll start making significant dent on it. And overall, our market share will still remain very low from \u2013 compared to the other large players remember, we are like third or fourth largest player in the industry. So from that perspective, I\u2019m not worried about disrupting the market because the whole industry is still running short of capacity.\nDeane Dray: Will that be a data point you\u2019ll be providing on a go-forward basis or just provide color?\nAlok Maskara: We just provide color. I don\u2019t want to get like too much into quarter-by-quarter emergency replacement share or trends versus share because it could be lumpy, not on the emergency replacement side on the key account side, where we have often big projects. And some of it becomes giving away competitive dynamics as well.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And then just a quick question on the colder climate heat pump technology. Is that something proprietary to Lennox, just give us some color there on what that edge is and what the efficiency is in terms of how it works in colder-climate?\nAlok Maskara: Sure. As you know, all colder-climate comes up using the vapor injection technology with like appropriate compressors in there. So that part itself is not proprietary because the entire industry uses the exact same technology. What\u2019s proprietary around that is the valves, the controls, the algorithm behind those controls and those are all proprietary to us. And obviously, on the mini-split VRF, those would be proprietary to Samsung. So I want to separate out the controls technology, which is proprietary versus the compressor and the vapor injection technology, which is fairly industry standard used by all of us. As everybody buys compressors on the same two or three vendors, so that\u2019s kind of where we stand. It impacts us the most because our market share in the Northern U.S. is higher than our market share in the Southern U.S. Some of the leading industry players have higher market share in the South easy warm regions and lower in the North. So for us, it just becomes a more meaningful change in penetration of heat pumps that impacts us more than others.\nDeane Dray: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hey good morning.\nAlok Maskara: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Thanks for fitting me in. Just on the \u2013 first of all, just on the EPS as a follow-up to Julian\u2019s question, I think the normal seasonality is maybe down in EPS, but you said effectively flat in line with normal seasonality? Is there something that\u2019s influencing that? Or maybe seasonality is tough to nail down over the last several years. But I just wanted to get a little more precision on that seems a little bit better than normal seasonality flat sequentially?\nAlok Maskara: Yes. So when we\u2019re talking about flat, we were referring to inefficiencies and other things such as the ramp-up cost and other pieces, those are flat. But no, we do expect normal seasonality Steve, the flat deal reference is...\nSteve Tusa: Get down \u2013 down sequentially?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes, normal revenue seasonality.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. So EPS, flat, up, down 3Q.\nMichael Quenzer: You\u2019re just going to have the headwinds of the ramp-up in investments that we talked about that are going to be similar in Q3 and Q4.\nAlok Maskara: Yes. And we \u2013 as Steve, we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance on EPS. We don\u2019t want to be kind of caught in trying to give one.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. All right. All right. You could have just said that before, I would have, wouldn\u2019t have pushed. So yes. I probably would have pushed anyway. So moving along. The commercial business, so what is the revenue breakout of that today from an end market perspective?\nMichael Quenzer: Yes, it\u2019s about 50% HVAC, 30% refrigeration, 20% service.\nSteve Tusa: But then like end market-wise, what I meant?\nMichael Quenzer: Oh, end market?\nSteve Tusa: For commercial equipment.\nAlok Maskara: Yes. Within commercial equipment we talked about majority fee account, a little bit in emergency replacement. We don\u2019t break it out by vertical. If you\u2019re looking for like what\u2019s education, what\u2019s retail, what\u2019s food service, we don\u2019t give that out.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Got it. All right. Thanks a lot.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks.\nMichael Quenzer: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gautam Khannal with TD Cowen.\nGautam Khannal: Hey, good morning guys.\nAlok Maskara: Good morning, Gautam.\nGautam Khannal: I wanted to ask about the state program to utilize some of the IRA incentives. It looks like a handful of states have been approved, and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re actually seeing it in, how you guys are going to market, how your dealers going to market? Is it actually stimulating sales at this point?\nAlok Maskara: First of all, I think it went better than I expected, Gautam. Last time you and I chatted, I thought we\u2019d never see that money, but the fact that a bunch of the states have actually applied and making progress. So that is better than we expected. Second, I would say, is we are very well positioned given our direct-to-dealer and our Lennox pros and our engines, which calculate all the rebates and incentives, all of that to put together the right proposal for dealers, I think we are better positioned than most. Thirdly, we\u2019ll let to really answer your question, no, we haven\u2019t seen a meaningful impact of that yet. If the current trend continues, and it\u2019s keep getting the approval and put that through, it still would be end of the year/early next year where we\u2019ll see \u2013 we\u2019ll start seeing some of those come through. There is some technical hurdles to be managed through that but the progress, honestly, better than the skeptical side of me had thought it would be six months ago.\nGautam Khannal: That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on the third-party channel. I\u2019m just curious, given the higher rate environment, we\u2019re done with destocking. Do you think there will be any meaningful lease stocking or will they be reticent to carry much inventory given the carrying costs are higher?\nAlok Maskara: Still a bit unknown there. I mean honestly, I would because a lot of those folks think more in terms of dollars versus units and dollars might still be up given the inflation impact over the past two years. I think folks are going to be more disciplined than, let\u2019s say, the R-22 transition in other places. But I do think there could be a meaningful amount of people building up inventory just because of uncertainty and the history of some of the manufacturers who don\u2019t always get this transition right. So I think it will be less than that. But a higher rate environment means we didn\u2019t bake in a lot around pre-buy and anything else in our forecast because of exactly what you said, Gautam, about the interest rate environment. But if industry starts not meeting demand or there\u2019s some disruption that\u2019s coming in the air, distributors are typically risk averse, and they will start building up inventory. Capital is still available. It just costs a little more.\nGautam Khannal: Thank you.\nAlok Maskara: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for joining us today. Since there are no further questions, this will conclude Lennox\u2019s 2024 Second Quarter Conference Call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alok Maskara",
            "content": "Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning. I'm pleased to share that Lennox delivered outstanding Q2 financial results and has also made significant progress on multiple strategic initiatives. I'm proud to highlight that we have now achieved six consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. This demonstrates the power of our transformation plan and management's ability to consistently execute our growth acceleration initiatives. Turning our attention to Slide 3. Let's review some of the achievements of this quarter. Lennox's core revenue grew 8%, and our adjusted segment margin expanded 100 basis points to record 21.9%, resulting in an adjusted earnings per share increase of 11% to $6.83. We generated $184 million of operating cash flow and our industry-leading ROIC grew to 44%. Home Comfort Solutions delivered record segment margins of 23.3%, a 170 basis point expansion over prior year as we started experiencing the end of destocking in our two-step distribution business. Our Building Climate Solutions segment continued its track record of profit growth. In addition, we manufactured our first units at our new commercial factory in Saltillo, Mexico. As we continue to ramp up this factory, we know that there will be second half inefficiencies, but we are excited about the addition of growth capacity to better meet customer demand by year-end. One of our key accomplishments this quarter was the establishment of a joint venture with Samsung. This joint venture will open up exciting opportunities for both companies by combining Samsung's global reach and brand strength with our direct-to-dealer distribution network. This collaboration is expected to significantly enhance our heat pump market share. Strong first half results give us the confidence to increase our full year EPS guidance, raising it to a range of $19.50 to $20.25. Our focus on executing our transformation plan continues to pay off. But before moving on, I want to express my gratitude to our dedicated employees and loyal customers who have made this success possible. Now please turn to Slide 4 for more details on our recent joint venture with Samsung. I'm excited to provide more insights on the Samsung-Lennox HVAC North America joint venture. Our collaboration is all about accelerating heat pump growth both for ducted and ductless products. Let's start with what makes this partnership a winning combination. Lennox and Samsung are mutually exclusive ductless HVAC partners in North America, combining our strengths to create a comprehensive and integrated portfolio that will benefit our customers. This integration allows us to leverage our direct channel strength with Samsung's global brand and technology, providing unparalleled value and service to our dealers. Heat pumps currently make up about 30% of the market and through our joint venture we can extend our reach within this fast-growing category. Our joint offerings include attractive ductless solutions, and we are particularly excited about our colder climate heat pumps, which are designed to deliver better performance in the Northern U.S. regions. Another key advantage of our joint venture is the enhanced technology it will provide our customers. Samsung's SmartThings controls and home automation platform are at the forefront of innovation providing seamless integration and superior energy monitoring for homeowners. Both companies are committed to North American specific new product development ensuring our offerings meet the highest quality standards and deliver superior comfort to our consumers. In the future, we expect to provide our dealers with combined ducted and ductless offerings in addition to more hybrid heat pump systems. This joint venture is set to accelerate heat pump growth for us through an industry-leading portfolio with advanced technology and strong brands. Ultimately, this partnership between Lennox, a North American Champion, and Samsung, a global champion, is poised to be a winning combination. We are looking forward to driving growth and innovation together. Now let me hand the call to Michael, who will take us through the details of our Q2 financial performance. Thanks, Michael. Let me provide updates on our outlook and share opportunities for both our segments. Within our Home Comfort Solutions segment, historically, Consumer Health has been a significant driver of the repair versus replace decision. Therefore, we are diligently monitoring macroeconomic factors, but have only seen minor shifts toward repairs. Encouragingly, industry inventory levels have largely returned to normal and recent updates on EPA ruling have provided greater clarity to the upcoming refrigerant transition. In the Home Comfort Solutions segment, the greater share opportunities will result from successfully executing the upcoming refrigerant transition, improving overall fulfillment rates and enhancing go-to-market capabilities. Within the Building Climate Solutions end market, we continue to watch for any indication of short-term disruptions due to the refrigerant transitions. However, order rates and backlog continue to be stable and feedback from our customers suggest that there is a strong pent-up demand for rooftop replacements. While we have seen project delays in some verticals, we are encouraged by the customer interest in our new cradle to grave services enabled by the recent AES acquisition. We remain excited about the opportunity to gain share in the emergency replacement market, leveraging our upcoming production capacity at Saltillo. The new production capacity at Saltillo will also free up capacity at our Stuttgart plant to target additional key accounts. Overall, our outlook for the year remains cautiously optimistic. Based on Lennox's history of successful regulatory transitions, we expect to benefit from new product mix and potential market share growth. Now please turn to Slide 11. As we conclude today's earnings call, I want to reaffirm our confidence in our ability to consistently deliver growth results by focusing on the five elements of our strategic transformation plan. First, we will continue to accelerate growth by improving our go-to-market effectiveness. Second, we will expand resilient margins through pricing excellence, increased productivity and by leveraging our direct-to-dealer network. Third, by leveraging the Lennox unified management system, we will streamline processes, leverage best practices, and consistently execute our strategy. Fourth, our continued technological advancement will enable Lennox to remain at the forefront of innovation for our customers. Finally, our core values and guiding behaviors are the foundation of our winning culture, supported by our pay-for-performance incentive structure. This comprehensive strategy not only supports our brand performance, but also reinforces our commitment to delivering long-term goals. I am immensely proud of our achievements, and I firmly believe that our greater successes are still ahead of us. Thank you for listening. We will be happy to take questions now. Madison, let's go to Q&A. Good morning, Damian. Sure. Yes, thanks. So, let me start by saying it's going to impact both the Home Comfort Solutions and also the Building Climate Solutions because, obviously, we bring many splits mostly for HCS, and we bring VRF products mostly for BCS on both sides. As we looked at our long-term goals, we have always talked about that heat pump penetration is a pending opportunity for Lennox. And this essentially closes the gap between our portfolio and what the market leading portfolios were. The cash flow margins on that from a JV contribution, it's not going to be meaningful. What's going to be meaningful is the margins we make on selling the products, the share we gain by expanding our heat pump portfolio and the increased benefit of having a strong partner like Samsung as we develop new technology, whether it's core climate, heat pump technology, or just simply look at controls such as smart things and total integration for a home or building control. But the JV itself, the way we look at it is the financials are not going to be material to our bottom line numbers, but it's going to be the results of partnering and selling those products that we are super excited about. We went through a long process. We've been exploring for this for about two years, spoke to several different potential partners, and we do believe Samsung is kind of the best partner for us given that we have \u2013 we can consider ourselves as the North American champion and they consider themselves and are a global champion. So putting that together, we are excited about the combination. Sure. So one of the things we \u2013 Michael and try I really, really hard is not to talk about weather in an earnings conference call. And I think there's a \u2013 I've never seen any upside to talk about whether in the earnings conference call, but it does have an impact. But listen, the year is progressing along as we expected is a simple way to look at it. Yes, there was some price mix cleanup that we did based on results year-to-date. But overall, the volumes are as we expected. Last year, we talked about destocking ending in the first half. It ended in Q2. We had wished it ended in Q1. We think consumer demand is very stable, and that's reflected in our volume guide for the year and our first half performance. So nothing really has changed. What's exciting there is the upcoming 454B refrigerant, that the EPA rules and the clarification on EPA rules has just given us more confidence going forward on what it could be. But at the same time, there are quite a few uncertainties that remains in the second half. And those are around 454 transitions, how competition will do around that, will there be a large pre-buy or not, election years could be weird for consumer behavior, so we are watching out for all of that. So we built all of that uncertainty into our second half guide and try to reflect that. Good morning. Yes. Let me start with the 10%, yes, the answer is simple, and it's yes. We continue to expect ten-plus percentage pricing benefit on that. I think there's any change in the product mix that we talked about and Michael referenced earlier, were minor. It was more driven by the fact that we do see consumers continue to demand 410 products and we don't see the industry or ourselves having a significant share of 454B sales this year. If we had talked about in Q1, we're just kind of reconfirming that 454B is going to be about 10% plus pricing increase. We think majority of this year's sales are going to continue to be 410A even more than we thought previously. And we remain very bullish about 454B next year as a step change in the industry's profile around margin expectations and a step change in technology. And we are also very confident that we are in a strong, strong position to execute well and give up dealers exactly what they want, which is they want 410 products as long as possible, and then they want to switch to 454B as seamlessly as possible. So sure. On the BCS side, we're just starting the Mexico facility, so it's close to zero on that one right now. On the HCS side, our low-end products are mostly made in Mexico. Overall, I would say it's about half of our products come from Mexico. And we have obviously all the standard protections around making sure we have the Maquiladora structure and all that set up. We'll see where the election goes. I mean, I think we are in a very strong position. We are taking steps to just like starting two years ago to reduce our reliance and sourcing more products locally and we continue to do that. But we do have half of our production coming from Mexico, which gives us substantial advantages even when we buy components and bring them from overseas into Mexico. Sure. So I think Home Comfort on the direct side, Q2 was flat to last year, and we are guiding the full year also to be flat. Our original guide was to say we would be down low single digits on a direct-to-dealer method. So implied guide is higher for us in terms of in a direct side. On the 2-step, we expect second half to be pretty strong. But as you can imagine, the destocking went on a little longer than we all had expected. That's kind of the only change that has happened in our outlook for HCS is midway through the year. As Michael said, we updated a bunch of our guide points. But the reality, the only change has been that we destocking lasted a little longer, but now we are confident is over our direct is doing a little better than we expected to be essentially flat compared to last year. And we think 454B is going to be on track and it's going to be launched and sold mostly in 2025. But there's no really change to our outlook beyond that. Sorry, which impact? No. I think from a 2Q, we didn't see any specific impact of that, no. Sure. On the first part of the project delays, I think it's getting better, not worse, nothing to answer your question. When we called it out in Q1, there was a lot more noise. Part of it is everybody reads some news articles and we try and interpret our own results. But our backlog remains strong, orders remain strong, and we are still heavily supply constrained, not demand constrained. On the education vertical, it's kind of fairly steady. And I know there was some IRA funding, but we ran out. But education has been a good growth engine for us. Our share has been low. We are gaining share in that vertical, and we also feel really good about all the other verticals that have not picked up yet, especially around some of the food service and retail that went through the COVID lows and now they're kind of coming back up. So from our perspective, we don't think that makes a meaningful impact either way for us going forward, because we continue to be the end supply constrained or demand constrained in our BCS business. Sure. So I'd say on the \u2013 let me start with the Mexican plant and then I'll come back to the other part of your question. On the Mexican plant, we had inefficiencies in Q2, and we called it out. Imagine we have like 300 to 400 people fully on our payroll, a building under construction, but zero sales. So from that perspective, something similar will happen in Q3 as well. So I think that's sort of embedded and built into our numbers and guide. From a revenue perspective, we expect the bulk of the revenue to start coming through only 2025. We want to make sure these products are really good, highest quality. We are going to test them fully. We're going to field try them before we start of mass market launch. And of course, there will be revenue in Q4 as well. But I think a meaningful revenue from Mexico would be in 2025. Not much has changed in terms of seasonality. I think the historical seasonality in Q2 and Q3 used to be similar, we may have had some situations back and forth. But I think that will be a similar. What we have to watch out for, honestly, is to think about is there going to be a significant amount of pre-buy a 410A product? And if there is demand, does the manufacturers have the capacity and ability to make additional 410A product. That's sort of the uncertainty that concerns us right now. But we sort of embedded that within the range of the guidance point we gave out. But I would expect nothing unusual besides the Mexican plant inefficiency that we mentioned [Technical Difficulty] early. Yes, essentially with a normal seasonality bits like last year. Sure. Let me start on the availability. So to minimize any dealer disruptions, we are going to launch the Samsung products in the A2L range. So we will run out with our current products and keep running through that through the 410A transition and that Samsung powering the Lennox product would be launched as the new R32 product, and so you would expect it towards the end of the year. So until then for our dealers and all, it's status quo. Obviously, in the background, we are doing everything from making sure we have sufficient inventory in hand, getting the branding right, doing test marketing with the dealers, going through the technology SPACs [ph], but essentially revenue 2025 launch this year. On the second aspect of it in the JV, the equity income, again, is not going to be meaningful. The whole point of this JV is going to be around technology development and the margins we make on selling the product through our channels. Samsung will make manufacturing margin. We would make distribution margin. And it's a great way for us to test and demonstrate how we are going to be a better distributor. Now we already do this with a different vendor. So it's not new, and you're not going to see a step change anywhere. If I were to model anything, I would just model greater heat pump market share for Lennox based on this JV, because we think this gives us a very strong offering, great brand name, and it gives us dealers a great choice to fight against other market-leading companies who are currently dominating this space. Sure. The strategy is progressing really well. We are pleased with what we are saying. Some leading indicators such as fill rate have improved substantially. So like at the end, all of this investment spend is worth nothing if we don't deliver the appropriate impact to the customer and if it doesn't reflect in our share. So all of those things are running positive for us. Fill rate, customer share, customer satisfaction, all of that's doing well. The investment is around, a lot of just around warehousing, logistics, a lot is around IT systems and making sure we have the appropriate systems to keep track of our products, do the appropriate [indiscernible]. And then finally, talent. We are now getting to world-class talent level, a lot from outside, some from inside, putting it all together. And we remain committed to putting those \u2013 in some cases, we were just behind. We started this as company-owned factory outlets, and we're now becoming a distributor, and we have raised the power on ourselves. But we are really pleased with the progress as we see all the leading indicators, which bodes well for us from continued market share gain going forward in the future as well. Yes. And just as a reminder on that, if I could jump in. I mean, we have broadcast very loudly that we're investing in additional sales resources. Our Lennox residential HVAC business has 20% additional sales resources. We are redoing our incentive comps. So this has all been under works for a while, but by the end of the year, we will start lapping ourselves on this, but these are all necessary and appropriate investments with very attractive payback. Sure. Well, on that one, I'll first start congratulating the management team at Bosch and the management team at JCI on the transaction. I'm sure it was hours and hours of hard work, lost leap of multiple weekends, not that I'm speaking for experience on the same transaction or anything, but I just want to congratulate them and glad that is finally sealed and signed. From our perspective, I think Bosch is a very reputable company. I think they focus on technology. They have done wonderful things by investing in R&D and they plow a lot of money back into charitable and social causes. I mean we are looking forward to Bosch joining the list of very disciplined industry players and becoming another one of them. I mean they are much better than some of the other field owners of the JCI assets and I'm super excited that the industry will remain disciplined going forward and we'll compete on technology. We'll compete on differentiation. We'll compete on better service and quality. So I'm super excited about where we are. Hi, Jeff. Yes. It seems \u2013 Jeff, it seems that every competition has launched these products on social media. If you look at the nice pretty picture that we all put out. But I think from practice, you can't buy a 454B unit from anybody yet. So I think that's \u2013 we had a similar situation. Are we ready to launch it? Yes. Have we made a few trial units, yes, just like everybody else. We are on track to launch it as customer demand picks up, especially as we get into 2025. From overall last call perspective, we haven't made a last call, but we are working with our distribution partners and dealers to truly understand what their demand requirements are and tailor our manufacturing according to that. We have a very focused operation, as you know, and we want to remain flexible to give our dealers and distributors what they want. So for us, right now, our production is 410A and we'll continue producing it till the time the dealers want it until the time the law allows us to do it. Yes. The trade down, which is a mix comment Michael was saying. First of all, any reference is mostly just rounding and small. But yes, we are expecting to sell more 410A versus more 454B. But even beginning of the year, we were expecting to sell mostly 410A throughout the year. No major dynamics on the consumer as we went from 13 to 14 SEER, obviously, there's some compression in the product line, right? Like people who are buying 16 SEERs and I'm often happy with the 14, so it's a bit of a natural thing as we can sell lower SEER products, but we don't see any meaningful trade down. If I think of our sales of Merit products, Elite products and Signature got a good, better, best, those ratios are relatively the same. So I don't see major trade down on that. We have made most of the investments. So at Q2 exit, the run rate would reflect most of the investments made in there. We were hiring starting kind of Q4 last year and over the past three quarters, Q4, Q1, Q2, we have made the necessary investment, and it is reflected in our Q2 exit rate. It's gone very well. I mean we're excited about the increase in our boots on the ground, we're excited about the process discipline that we are bringing along with that. We're also super excited about sort of putting our customers and dealers in a position to win again and getting them the confidence around our own availability, our lead time. And now we are in the process of setting up distribution points around the country to make sure that we can satisfy emergency replacement demand the same day in most cases and next day at the worst because that's sort of the critical portion of how you win this. So we know we're in that portion, and that's some of the distribution investment that we mentioned earlier. Thanks. Yes. I think we mentioned that heat pumps in the U.S. are around 30% of sales. We are closer to 20%, 25% of sales. So if you think about that like there's a significant delta between our sales and where the industry is. Share depends on, obviously, different players, so don't want to comment on shares, but think of that five to 10-point difference between us and the industry has an opportunity for us to win that amount and accelerate our growth. It's going to come from two things, right? One is the Samsung piece. Second is also launching on a unitary side or the ducted side, combined products are just more products on the heat pump that meet the cold climate requirement, and that's all going to happen in the first half of next year. As currently, all our innovation teams are focused on A2L, and once we take a breather out of it, we have a new lineup of heat pump ready to go on the unitary side as well. So super excited about what this brings to us and our ability to claw back and get into the industry average for heat pump share. So we are quite behind. No, we are not. This is kind of baked into law at this stage. And some of these changes happened when the administration was under a different political party. So I think at this stage, there's absolutely no chance of that happening. Sure. From an ROI perspective, I think Michael talks about this, right. I think our internal investments are the best ROI and adding these resources has a better ROI than putting in new machineries in our factories. So it's a pretty quick ROI. Most of these are two years or less payback. And most of the payback is around hiring process, getting people trained and ramp up, and they're not really very efficient for the first six to nine months, and they get pretty efficient after that. So it's good ROI. And the 20% comment, remember it applies both in our BCS and HCS. On HCS, it was about being a better distributor supporting our dealers better. And in BCS, yes, it was about focusing on emergency replacement and getting our district fully staffed up to do that, while maintaining our key accounts and investing in a key account from process and digital and separating those out in an appropriate way. So quick payback, super excited about it. What we need is production capacity and finally glad to see the SALTO factory with a roof on and with some units rolling through the conveyor belts. Good morning, Nicole. Good morning, Deane. Sure. Thanks, Deane. I mean that's an important portion of our future growth opportunity, both from revenue and margin. So thanks for bringing it up. So pre-disruption in Stuttgart, so think of like pre-2021, 2022, we had small share in emergency replacement. That went to essentially zero during the Stuttgart disruptions. We have started selling into emergency replacement now, but we are still selling drips and drabs, not in any sustained flow basis. We look at that as a significant opportunity for us. For the full industry, emergency replacement is up to half of the revenue, depending on which player you talk about. So think of us so far being focused only on the other half and having very little or no share on the emergency replacement piece. So over the multiyear horizon, we think it's a huge opportunity. Next year, we'll start making significant dent on it. And overall, our market share will still remain very low from \u2013 compared to the other large players remember, we are like third or fourth largest player in the industry. So from that perspective, I'm not worried about disrupting the market because the whole industry is still running short of capacity. We just provide color. I don't want to get like too much into quarter-by-quarter emergency replacement share or trends versus share because it could be lumpy, not on the emergency replacement side on the key account side, where we have often big projects. And some of it becomes giving away competitive dynamics as well. Sure. As you know, all colder-climate comes up using the vapor injection technology with like appropriate compressors in there. So that part itself is not proprietary because the entire industry uses the exact same technology. What's proprietary around that is the valves, the controls, the algorithm behind those controls and those are all proprietary to us. And obviously, on the mini-split VRF, those would be proprietary to Samsung. So I want to separate out the controls technology, which is proprietary versus the compressor and the vapor injection technology, which is fairly industry standard used by all of us. As everybody buys compressors on the same two or three vendors, so that's kind of where we stand. It impacts us the most because our market share in the Northern U.S. is higher than our market share in the Southern U.S. Some of the leading industry players have higher market share in the South easy warm regions and lower in the North. So for us, it just becomes a more meaningful change in penetration of heat pumps that impacts us more than others. Good morning, Steve. Yes. So when we're talking about flat, we were referring to inefficiencies and other things such as the ramp-up cost and other pieces, those are flat. But no, we do expect normal seasonality Steve, the flat deal reference is... Yes. And we \u2013 as Steve, we don't give quarterly guidance on EPS. We don't want to be kind of caught in trying to give one. Yes. Within commercial equipment we talked about majority fee account, a little bit in emergency replacement. We don't break it out by vertical. If you're looking for like what's education, what's retail, what's food service, we don't give that out. Thanks. Good morning, Gautam. First of all, I think it went better than I expected, Gautam. Last time you and I chatted, I thought we'd never see that money, but the fact that a bunch of the states have actually applied and making progress. So that is better than we expected. Second, I would say, is we are very well positioned given our direct-to-dealer and our Lennox pros and our engines, which calculate all the rebates and incentives, all of that to put together the right proposal for dealers, I think we are better positioned than most. Thirdly, we'll let to really answer your question, no, we haven't seen a meaningful impact of that yet. If the current trend continues, and it's keep getting the approval and put that through, it still would be end of the year/early next year where we'll see \u2013 we'll start seeing some of those come through. There is some technical hurdles to be managed through that but the progress, honestly, better than the skeptical side of me had thought it would be six months ago. Still a bit unknown there. I mean honestly, I would because a lot of those folks think more in terms of dollars versus units and dollars might still be up given the inflation impact over the past two years. I think folks are going to be more disciplined than, let's say, the R-22 transition in other places. But I do think there could be a meaningful amount of people building up inventory just because of uncertainty and the history of some of the manufacturers who don't always get this transition right. So I think it will be less than that. But a higher rate environment means we didn't bake in a lot around pre-buy and anything else in our forecast because of exactly what you said, Gautam, about the interest rate environment. But if industry starts not meeting demand or there's some disruption that's coming in the air, distributors are typically risk averse, and they will start building up inventory. Capital is still available. It just costs a little more. Thanks."

            "name": "Michael Quenzer",
            "content": "Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. As Alok mentioned at the start of this call, we are pleased to report our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year double-digit earnings per share growth. In addition to delivering double-digit profit growth, we have achieved year-over-year ROS expansion in each of those quarters. The strong second quarter financial performance underscores the effectiveness of our strategies and the dedication of our team. Now I will share more details on the second quarter financial results. Core revenue was $1.5 billion, up 8%, driven by sales volumes improvements, continued pricing excellence and benefits from the AES acquisition. Adjusted segment profit increased $38 million, or 13%. This improvement is largely due to $44 million of price and mix benefits and $19 million of organic and inorganic sales volume. These profit gains were partially offset by wage inflation, new factory ramp-up costs and investments in both SG&A distribution. Total adjusted segment margin was a record 21.9%, up approximately 100 basis points versus prior year. Our second quarter tax rate was 19.9% and diluted shares outstanding were $35.8 million compared to $35.6 million in the prior year quarter. Let's turn to Slide 6 and review the financial performance of our Home Comfort Solutions segment. The Home Comfort Solutions segment had an exceptional quarter, delivering 5% revenue growth, 13% segment profit growth and an impressive 170 basis point expansion in segment profit margin. The 5% sales growth was primarily driven by our continued pricing excellence, which delivered 4% price yield in the quarter. In the second quarter, we achieved a volume growth of 1% driven by mid-single-digit increases in our 2-step distribution channel as industry destocking concluded midway through the quarter. Sales volumes through our direct-to-contractor business were flat to the prior year. We also experienced a $19 million year-over-year increase in expenses, driven by wage and general inflation as well as critical investments in distribution and sales to further our goal of improving the customer experience. Moving on to Slide 7. The Business Climate Solutions segment also continues to deliver strong revenue growth, up 15% this quarter. 6% of this revenue growth is attributed to the AES acquisition, which was completed in the fourth quarter of last year. We are very pleased with the integration progress of this new business and the substantial synergies we have already realized. In addition to inorganic growth, we achieved a notable 9% organic volume growth driven by gradual production improvements at our existing Stuttgart factory. While these improvements are positive, total production output still limits our ability to fully meet demand. We are encouraged by the progress of our new commercial factory, which remains on track, and we successfully built our first few units in early July. Profit for the segment increased $11 million, although this was moderated by approximately $5 million in ramp-up costs for our new commercial factory in Saltillo, Mexico. Please turn to Slide 8 where I will review our cash flow performance and capital deployment strategies. Operating cash flow generated in the quarter was $184 million compared to $196 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $33 million in the quarter, a decrease of $17 million compared to the prior year. In the second half, we anticipate temporary increases in working capital as we ramp up our new commercial factory in Saltillo, Mexico and prepare for the transition to the new low GWP product. The team also remains focused on accounts payable and accounts receivable process improvements to drive efficiencies. These factors are all included in our full year free cash flow guidance and long-term cash conversion targets. Maintaining our industry-leading ROIC is an important part of our investment strategy, additional factory capacity, enhancements to our distribution network and smooth regulatory transitions enable us to consistently deliver results and improve our competitiveness in the market. In addition, we're continually evaluating M&A opportunities that fit our strategic objectives positioning us for sustained growth market leadership. We have a very strong balance sheet with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 1.2x, down from 1.8x in the prior year. Our strategy for capital deployment remains focused on prioritizing high-return capital expenditure investments, increasing dividends annually and share repurchases dependent on M&A activity. We are also dedicated to maintaining our investment grade rating. If you will now turn to Slide 9, I will review our revised 2024 full year guidance. After the second quarter results and more visibility into the second half of the year, we have refined our full year revenue guidance for each segment. The table on the left summarizes our full year revenue growth factors. Total company revenue is still projected to increase by approximately 7%. We now expect low single-digit improvement in sales volumes, which reflects increases for both segments. Price and mix expectations remained relatively unchanged within the range of mid-single-digit revenue growth. As a result of our strong first half profit performance, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance to $19.50 to $20.25 from the previously guided $19 to $20. We're also maintaining our free cash flow guidance at $500 million to $600 million. Component cost inflation is now expected to be up low single digits compared to mid-single digits in our previous guide. We still anticipate year-over-year increases in R-410A refrigerant and commodity inflation. We anticipate ramp-up costs of approximately $10 million for the new Saltillo, Mexico factory along with approximately $10 million associated with refrigerant transition across both segments' manufacturing facilities. SG&A expenses are expected to increase in the year as a result of both inflationary pressures and investments. Our investments are focused on resources to improve customer experience and distribution growth initiatives. We will also be making investments in both sales and marketing to support our long-term growth targets. Capital expenditures are expected to remain unchanged at $175 million. Interest expense is still expected to be approximately $50 million. And tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. Overall, our performance in the first half of the year, combined with increased clarity on market risks, has given us the confidence to raise and narrow our EPS guide range. With that, please turn to Slide 10. And I'll turn it back over to Alok for an overview of end markets. Hey Ryan, this is Michael. No, actually, what we're expecting is the second half of the year to be similar to the first half. So I think we were kind of low-single digits in the first half, I think we're applying slightly mid-single digits in the second half. If you recall in the first quarter, we had some unfavorable mix, mostly because of residential new construction in the HCS business. But overall, price mix should continue on similar to what we saw in Q2. Yes. That's just cleaning up some of the guide points based off the year-to-date mix that we've seen in both Q1 and Q2. Nope. Not a lot. We just cleaned up with the guide points. Good morning. Good morning, Tommy. Sure, Tom. Yes, on the full year guide, what we're expecting on the sell-through of the direct side is approximately flat for the full year and down the two step up mid-single digits. So that kind of blends to up low single-digit increase. As you recall, when we went into the year, we expected the direct side through our Lennox channel to be down low single digits, that's performing a little bit better. And then the destocking, as we mentioned, yes, it definitely accelerated as we went through the quarter, and June was better than the beginning of the quarter. So pleased to see the destocking ending. And I'll just add, our competition also manufacturers in Mexico is very similar to us. Yes, I think some of that is just around flexibility. We want to work with the markets and our customers as this 410A transition occurs to the 454B and the ramp-up of the new factory to make sure we have sufficient raw materials and inventory there. So really, it's just more uncertainty in the second half of some of our inventory levels, but we're focused on driving that cash flow perspective. But then as we get into next year, we've set targets at near 90% cash flow conversion. That's what we're focused on right now. Yes. We have some normal transitory mix within that segment. As you recall, we have HVAC equipment. We have services and we have refrigeration business. We did see a little bit of unfavorable mix, mostly in the service and refrigeration business, but nothing to be concerned about just kind of transitory normal mix. We expect that to continue kind of mid-single digits for the balance of the year in that segment. And on, I'll just add specific to where it's going to land in the P&L. We already have equity income on our P&L. So it will be on top of that. But as Alok mentioned, it's going to be minimal. The biggest gain is going to be within the segments for sales and margins. Yes. So the component costs are actually in that product cost buckets. So we are seeing a little bit better on the component costs, mostly material cost reduction programs. The $19 million of other, think of it about half of that related to freight and distribution and a good portion of that being investments in distribution, the other half being SG&A inflation and some of the IT and investments in head count that Alok mentioned. Good morning. Yes. So year-to-date, it was $7 million, so $5 million in Q2, $2 million in the first quarter. And that's exactly right. So as we fully ramp up that factory to full efficiency second half of next year, we'll start to see the efficiencies \u2013 those inefficiencies go away. Yes. It's all going to be second half. So we haven't experienced any of that yet, and it will be kind of equal Q3 and Q4. No, that's generally what's implied in our guide. Overall, if you look at our total guide, we're projecting about a 50 basis margin expansion for the enterprise. And yes, there will be some contraction in the second half, mostly because of the ramp-up costs, both to transition to the new refrigerant and the second factor BCS. But those are the kind of headwinds we see in the second half that a little bit of a margin decline. But overall, full year margins up. Yes. Yes, normal revenue seasonality. You're just going to have the headwinds of the ramp-up in investments that we talked about that are going to be similar in Q3 and Q4. Yes, it's about 50% HVAC, 30% refrigeration, 20% service. Oh, end market? Thanks."

And I would now like to turn the conference over to Chelsey Pulcheon from the Lennox Investor Relations team. Chelsey, please go ahead. \nChelsey Pulcheon: Thank you, Savanna. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We are excited to share our 2024 first quarter results. Joining me as CEO, Alok Maskara; and CFO, Michael Quenzer. Each will share their prepared remarks before we move into the Q&A session.  \n Turning to Slide 2. A reminder that during today's call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as outlined on this page. We may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management considers relevant indicators of underlying business performance. Please refer to our SEC filings available on our Investor Relations website for additional details, including a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP measures. The earnings release, today's presentation and the website archive link for today's call are available on our Investor Relations website at investor.lennox.com.  \n Now please turn to Slide 3 as I turn the call over to our CEO, Alok Maskara. \nAlok Maskara: Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning. I want to begin by expressing my gratitude to our customers and employees whose loyalty to Lennox helped us deliver strong Q1 results marked by record profit margins. Specifically, I want to extend my appreciation to our dealers, distributors and key account customers for trusting Lennox to deliver industry leading HVACR products and solutions across North America. The success of our transformational effort to strengthen our distribution network, elevate customer experience, advance innovative platforms, execute pricing excellence and drive productivity can be entirely credited to the unwavering support from our employees and customers.  \n This successful quarter further demonstrates our ability to maintain our growth momentum, navigate complex end markets and effectively prepare for the upcoming low GWP regulatory changes.  \n Now let's dive into the details of this quarter on Slide 3 where I would like to highlight 4 key messages: first, Lennox's core revenue grew 6% and our adjusted segment margin expanded 157 basis points to 15.9% resulting in our adjusted earnings per share increasing 23% to $3.47.  \n Our operating cash usage was $23 million, a significant improvement from $79 million usage in the prior year. Second, Home Comfort Solutions delivered a slight revenue decline alongside moderate EBIT growth.  \n With the destocking effect on volume, counterbalanced by price and mix, we delivered 30 basis point margin expansion, and we are all glad to see the destocking phase nearing its end. Third, our Building Climate Solutions team delivered record Q1 margins supported by both revenue and profit growth. We remain on track for the opening of our new Saltillo Mexico factory in early Q3, which will enable us to fully satisfy customer demand and outgrew presence in emergency replacement market segment.  \n Lastly, we are delighted to announce the updated fiscal guidance for this year as the Q1 results give us greater confidence in our earnings per share range. Michael will provide a detailed review of the guidance later in the call. But for now, let's turn to Slide 4 for more details on the upcoming low GWP refrigerant transition.  \n We are fully prepared and on schedule for the upcoming refrigerant transition. Our product designs, manufacturing processes and technology engineering have all been finalized. We are currently transitioning our raw material inventory to facilitate the product launches, and we plan to start shipping the new low GWP refrigerant product, later this year in time to meet expected demand, we anticipate price increase of 10-plus percent for the new product line.  \n During this low GWP transition, we will face manufacturing headwinds as we convert each production line in our factories. Our approach to reconfiguring our factories will effectively balance production flexibility with cost efficiency. Looking ahead, we foresee 2024 as predominantly in R-410A refrigerant year.  \n As we move into 2025, we expect the demand for the new low GWP product to reach approximately half to 2/3 of the end market. This shift in demand will benefit our product mix and also position us favorably to capture market share. Ultimately, we are well prepared and confident in our ability to navigate this transition successfully.  \n Now please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of our initiatives to become a better distributor of HVAC products. As you know, Lennox is a top-tier HVAC distributor in North America with substantial geographical coverage through over 250 outlets supported by more than 25 regional distribution centers. Nearly 45% of Lennox's residential sales are now through our digital platform, lennoxpros.com where our contractor partners also have access to a digital service dashboard for equipment prognosis, diagnosis and monitoring. We have the opportunity to grow our market share by expanding geographic coverage and improve our share of wallet through greater focus on parts and accessories.  \n We also have an opportunity to increase dealer loyalty with improved fill rate and an enhanced customer experience. The distribution network improvements and the 3 core changes highlighted on this page will accelerate our growth and increase our margin resiliency. First, we have established a decentralized and better aligned organization that is consistent with distribution best practices.  \n As a result, local leaders who have better visibility into local market conditions will have increased autonomy for faster decision-making. Furthermore, we have established 5 regional P&Ls led by experienced leaders who are accountable for both regional sales and stores. In addition, we are building our capabilities in critical areas such as revenue operations, pricing excellence and distribution management. This is a long-term journey, and we are pleased with the early progress we have seen thus far.  \n Second, to improve the quality of our customer service, we completed a physical distribution network analysis to ensure that we have sufficient growth capacity and optimal cost structure. We have streamlined and digitized our end-to-end demand and inventory deployment processes, and we are also implementing a modern warehouse management system throughout Lennox. It will take us a few years to fully realize the benefit of these changes. But thus far, we are pleased with the recent trend in our fulfillment rate.  \n Third, we have created customer charter for our businesses and have established Net Promoter Score practices across the company. This allows us to collect feedback and set numerical goals around our customer interactions. We are delighted with the improvements we are seeing in our Net Promoter Scores and know that this is a commitment that will continue to yield results over the long term.  \n To summarize, we are becoming a technology-enabled distributor, and we are investing in talent and resources to support this growth opportunity. While there are early signs of promising results, this is a multiyear endeavor that will accelerate growth and promote margin resiliency. Now let me hand the call over to Michael, who will take you through the details of Q1 financial performance. \nMichael Quenzer: Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. Expanding on to Alok's earlier comments, I'm excited to share our Q1 results, which not only reflect a strong start to the year, but also highlight record first quarter margins and an impressive 23% growth in adjusted earnings per share. Core revenue was $1 billion, up 6% as price gains and revenue from the AES acquisition were the main drivers of year-over-year improvement. Adjusted segment profit increased $25 million, where most of the growth came from $40 million of price and mix benefits. This was partially offset by continued inflation and investment in SG&A and distribution.  \n Total adjusted segment margin was 15.9%, up approximately 160 basis points versus prior year. Corporate expenses were $24 million, which includes $3 million of expenses previously considered noncore adjustments. Beginning in 2024, we will include certain previously categorized noncore adjustments in our adjusted earnings.  \n This approach aims to reduce recurring or immaterial adjustments, which improves our overall quality of earnings reported. Our adjusted earnings will continue to exclude the effects of business divestitures and significant nonrecurring items such as restructuring programs. Our first quarter tax rate was 19.4% and diluted shares outstanding were 35.8 million compared to 35.6 million in the prior year quarter.  \n Now let's direct our attention to Slide 7, where we can review the financial performance of our Home Comfort Solutions Segment. Revenue declined 1% to $681 million in the first quarter. The volume in our 2-step distribution channel continues to feel the effects of industry destocking and was down mid-teens. Our direct-to-contractor sales volumes were up low single digits with solid growth in the new construction channel as new homebuilding starts have rebounded.  \n Price yield was 3%, an improvement from the 2% price yield we earned in the second half of 2023, reflecting our successful execution of pricing initiatives in the quarter. The Home Comfort Solutions segment profit increased $1 million to $112 million, and segment margin also experienced approximately 30 basis points of growth to 16.6%, although pricing initiatives are progressing well, results are still impacted by inflation as well as the ongoing investments in distribution and sales.  \n Overall, given the challenging conditions in the end market, we are proud of our execution to increase profit margins even with volume and mix headwinds. We are prepared to launch the new low GWP product in the coming months and ensure the new product pricing material maintains gross margins.  \n Turning to Slide 8 in our Building Climate Solutions segment that delivered another strong quarter. The Building Climate Solutions revenue was up an impressive 21% this quarter, propelled by 7% volume growth and our best performance in many quarters. Combined price and mix were up 8%, and revenue from our AES acquisition contributed 6% revenue growth in the quarter. Building Climate Solutions profit grew by $28 million or 56% and segment margin expanded 480 basis points to 21%. These results were primarily driven by price and sales volume gains. Our profit results also reflect  $2 million headwind for our new Saltillo Mexico factory ramp-up expenses.  \n Despite ongoing production and supply chain challenges, unit production volume from the Stuttgart, Arkansas factory shows steady improvement. Additionally, we are excited for product output from the new Saltillo factory in early Q3 and we'll launch our new low GWP product in early 2025. We continue to be impressed by the Building Climate Solutions team's strong efforts in executing initiatives to pave the way for achieving our long-term targets.  \n If you will now turn to Slide 9, I will review our cash flow performance and capital deployment strategies. Operating cash flow used in the quarter was $23 million compared to $79 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $30 million for the quarter, a decrease of $5 million compared to the prior year. Later in 2024, we anticipate temporary increases in working capital as we ramp up our new Saltillo, Mexico factory and prepare for the transition to the new low GWP product.  \n Concurrently, the team is focused on improving processes and generating efficiencies in both accounts payable and accounts receivable. Both items are reflected in our full year free cash flow guidance and long-term cash conversion targets. Our commitment to high ROIC drives strategic and targeted investments that enhance our performance and competitiveness in the marketplace. As previously mentioned, the new Saltillo factory and the transition to the new refrigerant products is proceeding as planned and showing positive progress.  \n We also continue to look at bolt-on M&A opportunities that align closely with their overreaching company strategy. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.4x down from 2.1x in the prior year. Our approach to capital deployment remains consistent. We prioritize capital expenditure investments with strong returns, grow dividends with earnings, continue to explore M&A opportunities, and supplement with share repurchases when necessary. Additionally, we are committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating.  \n Turning to Slide 10. Let's review the 2024 full year guidance. Our outlook on revenue provided during our last conference call remains unchanged as first quarter trends performed as expected. As a reminder, I will reiterate a few revenue guidance points. RECONNECT The table on the left highlights full year revenue growth factors. Total company revenue is projected to increase by approximately 7%. We also expect stable sales volumes with a slight increase from Building Climate Solutions and flat for Home Comfort solutions. Price and mix are expected to drive a mid-single-digit revenue growth where price increases will ensure we remain price/cost positive.  \n As a result of our strong first quarter profit performance, we are also revising our full year earnings per share guidance to $19 to $20 from the previously guided range of $18.50 to $20. Our free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at $500 million to $600 million. Those product and other cost assumptions also remain unchanged. Component cost inflation is anticipated to be up mid-single digits including large increases in our cost to acquire R-410A refrigerant and recent inflation in commodity prices. We expect this cost inflation to be partially offset by material cost reduction programs. We anticipate ramp-up costs of approximately $10 million for the new Saltillo Mexico factory, along with approximately $5 million to $10 million associated with the refrigerant transition across our home comfort solutions manufacturing facilities. SG&A expenses are expected to increase in the year, a result of both inflationary pressures and investments. Our investments are focused on resources to improve customer service, information system advancements and distribution growth initiatives.  \n We will also be making investments in both sales and marketing to support our long-term growth targets. Capital expenditures remain unchanged at $175 million. Interest expense is still expected to be approximately $50 million and our tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%.  \n With that, please turn to Slide 11, and I'll turn it back to Alok for an overview of end markets. \nAlok Maskara: Thank you, Michael. On Slide 11, I will share our outlook on the end markets for both segments, which align with the full year guidance that Michael just went through. Within our Home Comfort Solutions segment, we have started to see a rebound in residential new construction, signaling consumer health resiliency. Nevertheless, we continue to closely monitor the repair versus replace dynamic amidst macro uncertainties. We are pleased to see distributor inventory return to near normal levels. However, the introduction of new low GWP refrigerant product and pending EPA updates on component manufacturing cutoff dates, does add inventory management ambiguity for dealers and distributors.  \n With that said, we anticipate that most of this year's sales will still come from R-410A products with limited adoption of the new R454B product towards the end of this year. Transitioning to the Building Climate Solutions segment, we expect deceleration in new construction accompanied by potential project delays. However, order rates and backlog remained strong driven by pent-up replacement demand. Insights from our National Account Services team highlight a significant upcoming need for replacements as well as increased interest in our new [indiscernible] services.  \n Our market share prospects in the BCS segment will be driven by volume from the new Saltillo Mexico factory and our expansion in the emergency replacement market. We are also securing additional wins in national accounts with our new integrated offerings made possible due to the AES acquisition. Overall, our outlook for this year remains cautiously optimistic. Given Lennox's track record of success during regulatory transitions, we anticipate benefit from new product pricing and potential market share gain. We acknowledge that the market remain uncertain, but we are confident in our proactive strategies aimed at driving growth, optimizing margins and delivering exceptional value to our customers and shareholders.  \n We do this by focusing on controllables and action items that we can drive. Now please turn to Slide 12. As a recap, Lennox operates in growth end markets, had resilient margins, demonstrates execution consistency and serves with customers through advanced technology and high-performance talent. The 5 reasons we remain confident in Lennox be a great investment opportunity is: first, we will continue to make strategic growth investments to improve our go-to-market effectiveness and support customer demand; second, margins remain a focus as we continue to evaluate our pricing strategy, implement innovative solutions to increase productivity and optimize our direct-to-dealer network; third, by leveraging the Lennox unified management system, our teams will be able to streamline processes, leverage best practices and consistently execute our strategy; fourth, our continued technological advancement will enable Lennox to remain at the forefront of innovation for our customers; finally, our team's focus on core values and guiding behaviors, is the foundation of a high-performance culture.  \n Our pay-for-performance incentive structure further aligns the talents of our team with the interest of our shareholders. Allow me to wrap up by saying thank you to each of our dedicated employees and valued customers. I'm proud of all that we have been able to accomplish, and I'm looking forward to the promising future that lies ahead of Lennox, as our best days are still ahead of us. Thank you. We'll be happy to take your questions now. Savannah, let's go to Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  And our first question will come from Tommy Moll with Stephens. \nThomas Moll: Alok, I wanted to start with a follow-up on the comments you made regarding strengthening the distribution network. You gave us a lot to think about. There are, I think, 9 different points on the slide that you introduced. You clarified it's a multiyear effort, so all very helpful context. And my question there is, if you were to focus our attention on this year and where we should look for early signs of progress where would you focus us, and to what extent can you quantify or frame some of the investments, whether in personnel, technology or elsewhere behind those efforts? \nAlok Maskara: Tommy, so on the investment side, as you see, our Q1 SG&A is up year-over-year. And so a large part of the investments that we're talking about are already in our numbers, are already in our guidance. Among the -- and this is a classic McKinsey training, right? There are 3 buckets of 3, hence, you get to 9, but that I blame on my McKinsey background or not anything else. The 2 things I would focus on would be both around our customers in terms of fulfillment rate and our net promoter score, which are both indicators -- early indicators of market share gain. And we are seeing solid progress in that. \n Third thing we will point out is pricing excellence, which is kind of embedded in there, but do you see that in our numbers anyway. The first 2, we don't talk about publicly, but that's what I monitor internally in significant amount of detail, looking at where is our NPS and where is the fulfillment rate. \nThomas Moll: That's helpful. For a follow-up, I wanted to ask -- this one probably goes to Michael for a couple clarifications on the raised EPS guidance midpoint. Michael, can you just refresh us on the seasonality here? Is 50-50 still the right way to think about it for first half, second half? And then related point, you mentioned a convention regarding the corporate expense and what is versus isn't included there. Any additional detail you could provide, especially if you can just give us a bogey for what you're assuming for the year would be helpful. \nMichael Quenzer: Sure. Yes. So on the seasonality from the revenue perspective, we've already mentioned that we think from a revenue perspective, Q1 is about 20% of the year. First half is about 50%, second half is about 50%. That's from a revenue perspective. And then on the items that we've now included in corporate, previously, we had some items for asbestos litigation, environmental expense, unique litigation. So these are kind of just small immaterial noisy items that were somewhat recurring, and it was about $0.25 of items last year that we've now moved into our adjusted earnings this year. \nThomas Moll: So that would be... \nAlok Maskara: If I could just pick you back on. Sorry, go ahead, Tommy. \nThomas Moll: Yes. I was going to say, Michael. So that would be a $0.25 unfavorable item from last year to this year. Am I hearing you correctly? \nMichael Quenzer: Yes. If those expenses are generally flat, which we think they are, yes, it's about a [$0.25] headwind. \nThomas Moll: Okay. Got it. Sorry, Alok. \nAlok Maskara: Yes, Tommy, I was saying we did that just to improve the quality of our earnings. I mean, these items are small. They became more recurring, and we think we should only exclude onetime items, extraordinary items. So this was just a bit of a cleanup as Michael came into this role because this was a good opportunity to take these items, which had all become recurring for past many years. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. \nJeffrey Hammond: Maybe just talk to me about residential. You called out negative mix. So I want to understand what's going on there. What are you seeing on repair, replace because we noted in our checks kind of discernible change more recently. And just as we go into the selling season, given kind of a weaker 4Q, 1Q, kind of what's the lean on kind of industry volumes for the year? \nAlok Maskara: Sure. If I could start on the mix for the first part. The mix that you're referring is just residential new construction, which was subdued last year is now coming back, and we sat and that's lower margin to us compared to replacement. So that's kind of the mix impact we were calling out that we've noticed. On the repair versus replacement, I think the jury is still out. I mean, I've read your channel checks, we've talked to our dealers, kind of depends on which part of the country and which dealer. We haven't noticed any significant change in part sales versus equipment sales, but we probably wouldn't be the first one to notice that anyway. There will be other distributors who would call that out. But our dealers remain pretty robustly optimistic on overall the life of equipment where repair may not be the most economical way to move forward. So I haven't noticed anything, but we mentioned that as a call-out because that's clearly a possibility as consumer health might get worse. \nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. And then just on the refrigerant transition pricing, I think you called out in the presentation greater than 10%. I think you've been saying 10% to 15%. Has anything really changed there other than maybe timing of when you get that? And then just what are you seeing from 410A refrigerant prices that might drive pricing changes this year? \nAlok Maskara: Sure. So if we -- on the first one, the 454 pricing, nothing has changed. Last year, we may not have been clear enough, but I think we talked a few times that we have said it will be about 15% over 2 years so that increased pricing was for '24 and '25, and we have made that statement in '23. Nothing has really changed because the fourth part of the price increase is already in process. We implemented price increases mid-Q1 and they're going to see that impact. So the remaining is 10%. So I just want to clarify that. Nothing has changed. It was just over 2 years. Now we're talking about 1 year. \n On 410A pricing, I think the picture is mixed. I think to be fair, the actual 410A pricing ramp-up is less than we expected, and it's almost flat. But we think that's still going to move. And from our perspective, that hasn't changed our price on the end product that we are selling this year. \nOperator: Next, we have a question from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. \nRyan Merkel: Congrats on the quarter. Alok, I wanted to also ask on the A2L. Just the 50% to 60% in '25 from A2L. Just why is that the right number? And then can you clarify, is the price increase, the 10%, is that both resi and commercial? Or is commercial potentially a little bit less? \nMichael Quenzer: So first, I'll answer on the price increase. We think it's probably going to be both in the same ballpark of 10%, if not higher, both products need significant investments in the factory and some of the sensors in the compression technology. And then why we think it's 50% to 65%. I mean what we're seeing is that you're going to have a bit of a carryover into next year from our 410A systems that are able to be sold next year that were kind of built this year. Then you also have, within the EPA guidance, that you can sell components in the next year. So we think those 2 combined are going to be the 35% to 40% of the market next year and then the balance would be new adoption of the 454B refrigerant product. \nRyan Merkel: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then I also wanted to ask on resi and just trends. So down 2% for volume in the first quarter, but I realize there's some destock, I think March, but the weather wasn't great. Are you just thinking resi volumes are up low single digits, is that the right cadence the rest of the way? \nMichael Quenzer: Yes. If you kind of look at our implied guidance, you had the balance of the year would be kind of low single digits, a little stronger on the indirect than the sell-through side, but balance kind of flat to slightly up for the rest of the year. \nAlok Maskara: And that's mostly for indirect. The comps get much easier starting Q2, and we are seeing the end of destocking. \nOperator: And next, we will hear from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. \nJoseph Ritchie: So yes, maybe I'll just kind of start on just the M&A appetite question, just given there are some assets out there that could be coming to market soon just based on what's been publicly disclosed. So talk a little bit about your appetite currently and what you're looking for in potential M&A transactions going forward. \nAlok Maskara: Sure. I mean, we read the same articles that you guys read. I do follow JCI pretty closely, but that's mostly because my good friend, Jim Lucas, is now the Investor Relations leader there, and I like Jim a lot. But if I think from our perspective, nothing has really changed compared to when we talked about it in Q1. And just to kind of reemphasize that. We believe industry consolidation is good, especially as regulatory changes accelerate, you need more scale to be successful. \n From our perspective, we have been public in the past about the interest for this asset that is rumored to be on sale and that hasn't changed either. What we are very focused on is making sure re-execute appropriately, we have a very strong path ahead of us. Our 3-year plan is going to create significant value and we have kind of talked about our long-term targets. There's so much opportunity for us to become a better distributor, improve our commercial volume through the new factory, working through pricing excellence on an ongoing basis and gain share as we successfully execute through the refrigerant changes. And we have a huge big pipeline of bolt-on opportunities as well. So while we can't talk about any specific process, we have sufficient scale to compete and we feel we are in a very good position and evaluate the opportunity that they come by. \nJoseph Ritchie: That's super helpful, Alok. My follow-up question maybe for Michael, just going back to that seasonality comment that you made. Just curious as you kind of think of just the cadence for 2Q specifically. You guys -- it seems like destocking is coming to an end. Shouldn't the seasonality be slightly better this year because you're kind of lapping destocking comps. Just any commentary around that would be helpful. \nMichael Quenzer: Yes. I think there's still some uncertainty, though in the end markets on the sell-through. I think we're trying to watch weather within Q2, it's cold here in Dallas. We'll see where it goes for the rest of the quarter. So I think there's some concerns on where weather could go. But I think the 50% of the sales in the first half still seems appropriate. \nAlok Maskara: Yes. And we don't want to call out whether for revenue upside or downside. I'm new to the industry. And whenever I worry about whether, business leaders who have been here for a longer term, say, \"hey, just wait until next week.\" and your concerns might go away. So still early in the quarter, May and June make up a significantly bigger portion of our sales than April does. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Damian Karas with UBS. \nDamian Karas: Thanks for all the detail thus far. I just have to ask -- so we've been hearing about the end of this destocking for a few quarters now. What's driving your confidence that this is the last time we're going to hear about this as a headwind in the quarter? \nAlok Maskara: Well, we've been wrong before, so we've got to keep that in mind as I answer the question. We talked about earlier, it ending by Q4. And then in Q4, we got a sense and we signaled that is likely going to continue in Q1. As we look at leading indicators, so things such as coils, we make universal coils and when we sell those, those are typically the canary in the coal mine in terms of first to go down and first to go up. \n So when I look at those product lines that went down first in sales, we sell them coming back up, and we had a pretty good march on those product lines and in addition conversations with our distributors. So those would be the 2 data points. But listen, we were wrong before. So maybe would be wrong again. But I think this time, we have much more data that supports it. \nDamian Karas: And then you guys have talked a little bit about stable, still solid orders in BCS. Could you maybe just give us a sense for what you're seeing different end markets, maybe national account versus emergency replacement, how that's kind of unpacked and how you're thinking about kind of book-to-bill going forward. \nAlok Maskara: Sure. If you think about our presence, remember, we don't do things like office buildings and large multistory apartment complexes. So from that perspective, our exposure to those areas, which we see were slowing last year and continue to be slow is limited, we are more in single-story building and in national accounts, whether I'd be large big boxes of any type and others. The replacement demand is what's kind of exciting, and that's what we are seeing really good momentum on as a lot of the supply constraints are behind us. \n Lead times are normalizing across the industry, and folks are more willing to put in the investments, especially given particularly the energy and the carbon savings they are going to get out of the new equipment. \n On emergency replacement, our share has dropped so low back. The market trends really don't matter to us. I mean it's all about share gain, and we are making good progress in getting back into our traditional dealers, our traditional accounts and we'll make a lot more progress in the second half of the year when our second factory gets up and running. So that's kind of behind what we talked about in terms of overall trend. Replacement, which is a vast majority of our sales, continues to be strong, and that's driving strong order rates. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. \nNoah Kaye: Just wanted to unpack a little bit more the price mix outlook for the balance of the year across segments like mathematically implied more of a dollar benefit in the resi segments. It sounds like that is primarily just the price increases, less so than mix, but would appreciate color on that as well as kind of color on the commercial side, what drives price mix for the balance of the year. \nMichael Quenzer: Yes. So within the quarter, we had pretty good price yield of 3%, but that was only a partial yield for some of the price increases that we announced in February and into March. So we're going to see a little bit more carryover and pick up on the pricing side. I also don't expect the new construction mix to continue like it did in Q1. So we think that, that will moderate later in the year. And then we'll also start to see some of the carryover benefit from the minimum SEER efficiency products as we get to the second half of this year, maybe late in the year, a very minor favorable mix for the 454B products not really much within the guide. But overall, it's just continued pricing within HCS. \n On the BCS guide, it's a similar story where we're lapping some really big price increases that we did last year. So you see a lot more of that in the first quarter that will then moderate in later quarters this year as we get some of the price increases that we announced in that segment as well. \nNoah Kaye: And then I really appreciate you guys taking a view on what the mix will look like on the refrigerant side next year. Just is it possible to quantify how much of a working capital headwind that is for this year because you're obviously going to have to build that inventory certainly for the direct channel before the cutoff date. \nMichael Quenzer: Yes. There's 2 things that we're focused on in working capital this year. It's inventory build. The first is some additional raw materials to help transition to the new building climate solutions factory in Mexico. So that's a piece of it. But then the other side of it is going to be to do a prebuild for some R-410A systems on the residential side depending on end market demand and how that's going to carry into next year. And then also on the BCS segment is that we can continue to build 410A unitary rooftops through the end of this year, and then we have 3 years to sell that through. So we want to make sure we have sufficient 410A demand to cover a few years of -- or continued volume for the next year or so on the BCS product. So that all adds up to about $50 million of inventory that we're going to have to add this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. \nBrett Linzey: I wanted to come back to the Building segment and really thinking about a way to dimension the new commercial capacity coming online, how does that ramp up in terms of revenue or units produced? And how should the factory utilization levels phase through the second half and then into next year? \nAlok Maskara: From a units produced, we have internal targets, but we haven't shared that externally. So I don't want to go there. I mean, over the long term, we did talk about that we got enough square footage to double the capacity. We think that happens over 5 years or more. So think of maybe perhaps at max 20% capacity slowly ramped up one line at a time. So I think that's kind of one way to think about it. But clearly, it will be prudent. We'll look at market conditions. And in some cases, we can obviously move in balance production between the existing factory and the new factory. So that's going to be one way to look at it. But we haven't put in machines in the ground to double the full capacity. We've got enough space to do that, but we'll put those investments as the demand materializes. \nBrett Linzey: Okay. Got it. Makes sense. And then just wanted to come back to the forecast on the composition of the new refrigerant products next year. I guess as the old refrigerant supply is reduced, is it reasonable to think the pricing on the legacy units also needs to step up again next year as you're dealing with less supply? \nMichael Quenzer: Yes. As we always do, we'll come out with a new price increase next year on the 410A system and depending where the cost of that gas goes up, which we expect to go up significantly. It could also have a pretty large increase similar to the 454B product. But we're monitoring that, and there will be another price increase on that next year for the 35% of the demand. \nAlok Maskara: And also keep in mind there will be manufacturing inefficiencies associated with manufacturing the older 410A units because the volume is going to go down and the factory has got to be more complex at higher cost for the 410A that we expect. \nOperator: Next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. \nJulian Mitchell: And thanks for the effort to improve earnings quality. I think most companies are hellbent ongoing in the other direction. Maybe my first question would be around -- the commentary around the sort of second quarter and the first half and so forth. So you've got about $1.5 billion sales, I suppose, or thereabout starting for Q2 based on that 50-50 first half split. When we're thinking about sort of margin profile. Classically, you've had sort of 35%, 40% sequential operating leverage in the second quarter just with the fixed cost absorption and so forth. I just wondered if that figure would be any different this year, whether because of the Mexico plant ramp-up or the phasing of, say, those A2L headwinds of 5 million to 10 million that you call out? Maybe just any sort of color around how those items play out from here and the sort of second quarter sequential leverage. \nMichael Quenzer: Yes, there will be some additional investments they're going to start to make in the second quarter that weren't fully impacted in the first quarter predominantly launching the new commercial factory as well as starting to transition to the new 454B product in HCS. Additionally, we had a bit of a onetime benefit within Q1 for margins for warranty adjustments, so that will also kind of not repeat in the next year or the next quarter. But overall, there will be some cost increases coming into the second and third quarters that weren't within the first quarter. \nJulian Mitchell: Got it. Okay. So still sort of decent leverage, but maybe with some offsets this year specifically. \nMichael Quenzer: Correct. Yes, some ramp-up costs that we're going to need to transition to get the product ready. \nJulian Mitchell: And then my second question, circling back to the BCS division. Certainly, the tone, I think, from Alok seems a little bit more cautious on that new construction aspect and project delays, and we see that more broadly in things like the ABI readings. Maybe to sort of -- if you could put a finer point, Alok, the project delays aspect, is that just an expectation of what could happen later in the year? Maybe any updated thoughts on the education vertical? Is that asset tailwind sort of starts to expire. And I guess the thrust of the question is really, you had 21% revenue growth in that BCS segment in the first quarter, the year is up 10%, is an implied decline at some point just pure conservatism? Or is there anything we're really seeing on those project delays or education vertical or something like that? \nAlok Maskara: Sure. I guess, Julian, the 2 biggest factors on that is we like to be conservative, and second we had fairly easy comps in Q1 compared to where we were last year. On the demand side, I'll start by saying we remain manufacturing or production capacity constrained, not demand constrained. So keep that in mind as I answer all the other different points in here. The new construction and the project push to the right is actually happening right now that only impacts 15% to 20% of our sales that was about -- 75%, 80% of that is, our sales are all replacement, but we needed to call that out just because it does impact a portion of our sales. But today, it's not an issue because again, being supply constrained versus demand constraint continues to hold for us. Education vertical, yes, it had some benefits last year, may have left this year, but it's really not a material mover for us nor was it last year. So it really doesn't impact us. \n The biggest driver of optimism there is the age of units, the units on the rooftop, whether it's a big box and others, they are way beyond the useful life. Many of them are like 18 years where the useful life is closer to 14 to 16. That's what drives our optimism about order rates and things going forward. But the delta that you officially asked for at the beginning is easier comps and some conservatism built in because no factory startup goes perfectly, Julian. As you know, factory startups always have some issues here or there. So we just didn't want to get ahead of ourselves. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. \nJoseph O'Dea: First question is just related to pricing strategy, and I think both on HCS and BCS, you had sort of engaged with consultants and have implemented pricing changes as a result. The question is just related to what inning you're in, in that, the degree to which that's complete, the degree to which we see it in the P&L. And as a result, was it a matter of you were pricing below market on a net pricing side of things and maybe you're above market? Just overall, kind of the outcome of those efforts, sort of where you are pricing relative to what you see pricing in the market being? \nAlok Maskara: If you just click it, I would tell you in the first inning, but since it's baseball, I have to say we are probably the third or fourth inning of that right now. Where we are is, yes, we were below market price in many of our key accounts where we have signed contracts after the tornado and pre-COVID and we did not have inflation clauses in that. So there was definitely a large portion of our sales where we were and in some cases, still below market their process to get up to the market level. So I think that's a big part of that. \n There is a second part of that, which is around giving the local leaders autonomy to an extent to get pricing adjusted, we used to do national pricing and then we realized there is no such thing as national pricing. Pricing in South is very different than pricing in the North. So we will be able to capture greater pricing excellence just by having more localized pricing and there's going to be upside on that working through that. \n The third aspect of pricing is simply around us continuing to capture pricing ahead of inflation because people think inflation has gone away, and it's not. So as we do price increases and the fact that we lost margin points during the COVID transition and during the tornado, we need to just work with all our channel partners and customers and make sure we get price ahead of inflation, not behind inflation because inflation continues to impact us, whether it's SG&A or materials or labor, all of that impacts SG&A. So those are the 3 aspects, I would say we are less than halfway complete, but pleased with progress so far, and especially pleased with some of the price actions we took on key accounts and gotten closer to market, but still below market in some cases. \nJoseph O'Dea: Got it. And then also just wanted to ask on leverage and when you think about the M&A opportunity set out there, you talked about a long-term target leverage range in the 1x to 1.5x. But if the right opportunity were to present itself, how high are you comfortable taking leverage to pursue that type of opportunity? \nMichael Quenzer: If the right opportunity materialize, we'd go up kind of 3%, maybe a little over 3% near term and then quickly want to get back to that 1 to 1.5x after that initial increase to above 3%. But the key is maintaining investment grade ratings. That's the key. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. \nDeane Dray: And I appreciate Alok that you're not going to use any cricket analogies because I would have no idea what you're talking about. Yes, on the manufacturing line conversion, just give us a sense, is this the clarify, is that the $5 million to $10 million that is in the assumption? And is this in the Mexico facility? And just give us a sense of how disruptive is this to the actual line to change over to the new refrigerants? Are you adding some new components? Is there new testing? Is it a higher pressurization, just what -- from a technology standpoint, logistics standpoint, how disruptive might that be? \nAlok Maskara: Sure. So the two inefficiencies we called out. One is the Saltillo Mexico start-up inefficiencies. And then we called out $5 million to $10 million of additional inefficiencies on residential for transitioning from 410A to 454B. The change is pretty big. We have to make sure that we are handling appropriately the new refrigerant, which is mildly flammable. So it has a different classification when it comes to DOT regulations, so it requires different piping, different storage, different testing, different test chambers. Though the compressors are new, the size of the product might change in some cases. So it's a fairly big change, but we're pretty used to it. We are very ready. This is not starting now. \n A lot of these changes started last year. So for example, the new refrigerants line already been in start and the new storage tanks already in the facility. We're already doing test runs. If we needed to make products today, we would. So the inefficiency costs that we called out would simply be lines shutting down for a few weeks while we make all the changes, test the product and then restart it. That's kind of the core source of inefficiencies. Most of the investments are already kind of on the floor now. \nDeane Dray: That's real helpful. And then the follow-up question for Michael, and I'll also add my shout out for the quality of earnings. I mean, we had to spend some time this morning to doublecheck that we weren't missing something. There were no eliminations, and that was the conclusion. I said, \"Oh my gosh, this is as close to gap as any company we follow.\" So thank you. \nAlok Maskara: Chelsey and I were listening to you, Deane, when you told us that at your conference, and we took that as a challenge. So it did start at your conference when you mentioned that to Chelsey and I. \nDeane Dray: All right. I appreciate that. And then so that's -- with all this buildup, I've got more of a mundane question on free cash flow. We know first quarter is typically a use, but it was less of a use. What are the dynamics there? And you said you've got some additional inventory build coming, where does buffer inventory as we distance ourselves from all the supply chain issues? Have you read yourself a buffer inventory entirely? Is that still winding down, but some color there would be helpful. \nMichael Quenzer: Yes. On the raw material side, yes, our inventories are still higher than we like. They are drifting down better as supply chains are healing. So they are coming down, but we're going to have to grow them a bit for this Building Climate Solutions transition to ramp up that new factory. But overall raw inventory is getting better. But yes, we will -- we're going to start to grow inventory later this year for the new 410A product and we're going to start to rebuild and grow some of that in the second half of this year. And then another element that we have within the free cash flow guide is that the CapEx is also going to be a little bit higher in the second half of this year than our normal guide. Normally, we have about $110 million of CapEx. It's about $175 million. You can see that there's going to be more in the second half to complete the ramp-up of the factory and get our transition to the new 454B product ready to go. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: I guess first thing is just on the commercial margins, obviously, really, really strong again this quarter. Thinking through all the puts and takes through the rest of the year and how the comp gets a lot harder through from 2Q to 4Q, I guess how much conviction do you guys have that you can continue to expand margins year-on-year through the rest of the year? \nMichael Quenzer: Yes. So we continue to do pricing excellence. And we've announced up to 8% price increase in Q1. So we're going to continue to drive price increase, even though it's going to lap some of the comps, which are going to be a little more challenging. Right now, our guide is volumes kind of flattish to up low single digits in the balance of the year. That normally comes with 30% incremental. So that should help drive our return on sales, operating profit margins up higher. But then working against that as a little bit of the headwinds that we have to ramp that new factory up. So absent of the factory ramp, we still see margins modestly moving up. \nNicole DeBlase: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then we've seen copper and aluminum costs rising recently. Can you just refresh us on when that could potentially impact your P&L? Would that be more of like a 2025 concern at this point or something to focus on. \nMichael Quenzer: Yes. So we see steel increases that are also starting to come up. That's more immediate. That kind of is on a quarterly lag. The copper and aluminum goes through a hedging process. It's kind of an 18-month blended hedging process. So we'll start to see some of that this year, but it will come into next year as well. We'll continue to monitor that. If it stays elevated, we'll have to see what type of pricing actions later this year we need to do. But definitely, that would be reflective in the new 454B product, if it continues on pricing and the [Indiscernible] pricing into next year. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Can you just help me reconcile some of the price and mix dynamics. I mean you guys had put through, I believe, Allied was in January 1 and then the rest of the business maybe in early February. I think they were upwards of like 10% price increases. Price was up 3% in the quarter. So maybe just help me reconcile that? And then what basically gets that to accelerate through the rest of the year. I mean, your price mix was basically 1% for the quarter with negative mix. So maybe just help me reconcile those data points with kind of the mid-single-digit guidance? \nMichael Quenzer: Specifically speak to the pricing. So within the quarter, we only had a partial quarter on the price increase. So we announced on the Lennox brand starting February. So that didn't even fully get all the way through February, seeing about a month on the Lennox side. So that should continue to increase as we go throughout the year on just the normal flow activity on Lennox. And then we also had price increases on some of our large PE and builder contracts that also was -- some of those were also a partial quarter. So you'll start to see that also expand later in the year. \n On the mix side, we don't think that the new construction mix is going to continue, so that should help going forward. But we're watching it to see if it does. But right now, we're assuming that, that mix basically slows down on the RNC side. \nC. Stephen Tusa: So that mix number that you put in there, the mix for sales is a mix driven by type of business like new construction versus like replace. That's what that negative 2% mix reflects? \nMichael Quenzer: Within the quarter, correct, yes. \nC. Stephen Tusa: I didn't -- have you guys always accounted for it that way? I thought that was more about like the SEER level of the product as opposed to the type of customer you're selling to? \nMichael Quenzer: Well, if you think within that customer, it is a SEER level of the product that normally do entry-level type products. So it's kind of a mix of both. \nAlok Maskara: Steve, we wanted to do it the same way. Last year, we called out the SEER-1 because that was the largest driver as we're going from older SEER standards to the newer one. But for us, mix has always been product types and RMC products are part of that mix change. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Right. I guess, but that's not really going to change, I guess, over the next several quarters, right? Mix should remain relatively new construction focused? Or does that mix change over the next several quarters? \nAlok Maskara: Well, as new housing starts had gone down, I think Q1 last year was abnormally low. So I think both start impacting, right? We're comping ourselves out of the dip that we had last year. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Got it. And then just one last one on commercial. What do you think the market did this quarter? I mean, the AHRI data, which is obviously a little more narrow than what some people define as a light commercial market. That looked pretty strong. you guys had volume that was up, I think, mid- to high single digits. What do you think the market did? And did you guys -- I guess, how do you perform relative to that in your estimation? \nMichael Quenzer: Our  AHRI reported rooftop units were up more than that 7%. We had some declines in our refrigeration volume within the quarter that were taking down some of the gains, but we think we grew faster than the AHRI on rooftops within the quarter, winning back some share. \nAlok Maskara: Yes. And you can take our entire segment and compare it. Michael is saying only a portion of our segment gets compared to that. So we did equal or better than the AHRI data. \nOperator: Next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. \nGautam Khanna: I had a couple of questions. First, was wondering in April, you talked about destocking in the third-party channel coming to an end. Can you talk about maybe April order trends in that channel and how that might inform your conviction? \nAlok Maskara: Yes. Given that we are having the call towards the end of April, conviction is already reflective of what we are seeing in April. So we remain convinced that the destocking is coming to an end. \nGautam Khanna: Do you anticipate that channel will be down in the second quarter still in terms of unit volumes? \nAlok Maskara: No. I would expect that channel to be up in unit volume in Q2. \nGautam Khanna: Okay. And that's irrespective -- I mean, assuming weather is not a big variable year-to-year. \nAlok Maskara: Yes. I'm going to call out weather, but listen, I don't want to get nervous just because I have to wear a sweatshirt in Texas in April. \nGautam Khanna: Got you. Okay. I was wondering if you could talk about the demand you think you'll have as the new Mexican capacity comes online. So maybe if you could talk about customers or business that you may not have been able to accommodate on the commercial side. So because obviously, people get concerned about commercial unitary demand starting to soften after a big run up of COVID. What gives you conviction that you'll be able to fulfill that capacity over time? \nAlok Maskara: Yes. So listen, great question. While there are no certainties. Here's what we know and we look at, right? I mean, our order rates continue to be higher than what we can manufacture, and we are still turning away businesses that we would rather not. So that's just internal way we are looking at, and that's been going out for 2 to 3 years now. So could [Indiscernible] tomorrow it might, but that's one. \n Second, we have made significant investments in preparing our sales team to go out and start adding -- in some cases, adding back contractors whom we had lost and working towards emergency replacement. And that's part of some of the investments that we talked about is leveraging our core contractors or Lennox dealers to be able to push that emergency replacement market. And finally, it's the key accounts and the conversations that we're having with them especially when it comes to 454B products because some of them had delayed replacement and want to do replacement with 454B products because they know that, that refrigerants will be around longer and will be lower global warming potential rated. So they get some carbon credits for that as well. \n So multiple factors in there goes down to our current rate investments we have made in drumming up extra demand, and lots and lots of conversations with our key accounts to pull that forward. But at the same time, I mean, current factory is running kind of overcapacity. So in case the demand fully doesn't come through, we've got lots of flexibility in where we produce and what we produce. And that flexibility is also super exciting to us and baked into our numbers going forward. \nGautam Khanna: That's helpful. And last one for me. On the JCI assets for sale, you guys have expressed an interest in the York resi unitary stuff. If it were -- if there were other assets embedded in whatever they're selling, is that something you guys would entertain? Or is that too much complexity for what you ultimately want and therefore not worth pursuing? I'm just curious how that -- because we hear that then we sell more of it, pull it once, then you got to divest it or whatever. \nAlok Maskara: Yes, sure. No, that's fair. Again, I don't want to comment on other company, but I'll tell you we are going to be focused on HVAC. I mean we are an  HVACR  company, and that's what we do, focused on that. And I don't think that's going to change just because opportunistically something else becomes available. And our strategy is working. We have the scale. We see a strong pathway ahead for us just doing execution on our [Indiscernible] business end. But we'll remain very focused. \nGautam Khanna: And that's North American HVAC, just to be clear, correct? \nAlok Maskara: No, I would say we are looking at North American HVAC as being the primary market. We do a lot of exports as well. And the heat pump technology that we use, we do get from overseas. As you know, we already have hundreds of millions of sales in that. \nOperator: And thank you for joining us today. With no further questions, this will conclude the Lennox's 2024 First Quarter Conference Call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Alok Maskara",
            "content": "Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning. I want to begin by expressing my gratitude to our customers and employees whose loyalty to Lennox helped us deliver strong Q1 results marked by record profit margins. Specifically, I want to extend my appreciation to our dealers, distributors and key account customers for trusting Lennox to deliver industry leading HVACR products and solutions across North America. The success of our transformational effort to strengthen our distribution network, elevate customer experience, advance innovative platforms, execute pricing excellence and drive productivity can be entirely credited to the unwavering support from our employees and customers.  \n This successful quarter further demonstrates our ability to maintain our growth momentum, navigate complex end markets and effectively prepare for the upcoming low GWP regulatory changes.  \n Now let's dive into the details of this quarter on Slide 3 where I would like to highlight 4 key messages: first, Lennox's core revenue grew 6% and our adjusted segment margin expanded 157 basis points to 15.9% resulting in our adjusted earnings per share increasing 23% to $3.47.  \n Our operating cash usage was $23 million, a significant improvement from $79 million usage in the prior year. Second, Home Comfort Solutions delivered a slight revenue decline alongside moderate EBIT growth.  \n With the destocking effect on volume, counterbalanced by price and mix, we delivered 30 basis point margin expansion, and we are all glad to see the destocking phase nearing its end. Third, our Building Climate Solutions team delivered record Q1 margins supported by both revenue and profit growth. We remain on track for the opening of our new Saltillo Mexico factory in early Q3, which will enable us to fully satisfy customer demand and outgrew presence in emergency replacement market segment.  \n Lastly, we are delighted to announce the updated fiscal guidance for this year as the Q1 results give us greater confidence in our earnings per share range. Michael will provide a detailed review of the guidance later in the call. But for now, let's turn to Slide 4 for more details on the upcoming low GWP refrigerant transition.  \n We are fully prepared and on schedule for the upcoming refrigerant transition. Our product designs, manufacturing processes and technology engineering have all been finalized. We are currently transitioning our raw material inventory to facilitate the product launches, and we plan to start shipping the new low GWP refrigerant product, later this year in time to meet expected demand, we anticipate price increase of 10-plus percent for the new product line.  \n During this low GWP transition, we will face manufacturing headwinds as we convert each production line in our factories. Our approach to reconfiguring our factories will effectively balance production flexibility with cost efficiency. Looking ahead, we foresee 2024 as predominantly in R-410A refrigerant year.  \n As we move into 2025, we expect the demand for the new low GWP product to reach approximately half to 2/3 of the end market. This shift in demand will benefit our product mix and also position us favorably to capture market share. Ultimately, we are well prepared and confident in our ability to navigate this transition successfully.  \n Now please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of our initiatives to become a better distributor of HVAC products. As you know, Lennox is a top-tier HVAC distributor in North America with substantial geographical coverage through over 250 outlets supported by more than 25 regional distribution centers. Nearly 45% of Lennox's residential sales are now through our digital platform, lennoxpros.com where our contractor partners also have access to a digital service dashboard for equipment prognosis, diagnosis and monitoring. We have the opportunity to grow our market share by expanding geographic coverage and improve our share of wallet through greater focus on parts and accessories.  \n We also have an opportunity to increase dealer loyalty with improved fill rate and an enhanced customer experience. The distribution network improvements and the 3 core changes highlighted on this page will accelerate our growth and increase our margin resiliency. First, we have established a decentralized and better aligned organization that is consistent with distribution best practices.  \n As a result, local leaders who have better visibility into local market conditions will have increased autonomy for faster decision-making. Furthermore, we have established 5 regional P&Ls led by experienced leaders who are accountable for both regional sales and stores. In addition, we are building our capabilities in critical areas such as revenue operations, pricing excellence and distribution management. This is a long-term journey, and we are pleased with the early progress we have seen thus far.  \n Second, to improve the quality of our customer service, we completed a physical distribution network analysis to ensure that we have sufficient growth capacity and optimal cost structure. We have streamlined and digitized our end-to-end demand and inventory deployment processes, and we are also implementing a modern warehouse management system throughout Lennox. It will take us a few years to fully realize the benefit of these changes. But thus far, we are pleased with the recent trend in our fulfillment rate.  \n Third, we have created customer charter for our businesses and have established Net Promoter Score practices across the company. This allows us to collect feedback and set numerical goals around our customer interactions. We are delighted with the improvements we are seeing in our Net Promoter Scores and know that this is a commitment that will continue to yield results over the long term.  \n To summarize, we are becoming a technology-enabled distributor, and we are investing in talent and resources to support this growth opportunity. While there are early signs of promising results, this is a multiyear endeavor that will accelerate growth and promote margin resiliency. Now let me hand the call over to Michael, who will take you through the details of Q1 financial performance. Thank you, Michael. On Slide 11, I will share our outlook on the end markets for both segments, which align with the full year guidance that Michael just went through. Within our Home Comfort Solutions segment, we have started to see a rebound in residential new construction, signaling consumer health resiliency. Nevertheless, we continue to closely monitor the repair versus replace dynamic amidst macro uncertainties. We are pleased to see distributor inventory return to near normal levels. However, the introduction of new low GWP refrigerant product and pending EPA updates on component manufacturing cutoff dates, does add inventory management ambiguity for dealers and distributors.  \n With that said, we anticipate that most of this year's sales will still come from R-410A products with limited adoption of the new R454B product towards the end of this year. Transitioning to the Building Climate Solutions segment, we expect deceleration in new construction accompanied by potential project delays. However, order rates and backlog remained strong driven by pent-up replacement demand. Insights from our National Account Services team highlight a significant upcoming need for replacements as well as increased interest in our new [indiscernible] services.  \n Our market share prospects in the BCS segment will be driven by volume from the new Saltillo Mexico factory and our expansion in the emergency replacement market. We are also securing additional wins in national accounts with our new integrated offerings made possible due to the AES acquisition. Overall, our outlook for this year remains cautiously optimistic. Given Lennox's track record of success during regulatory transitions, we anticipate benefit from new product pricing and potential market share gain. We acknowledge that the market remain uncertain, but we are confident in our proactive strategies aimed at driving growth, optimizing margins and delivering exceptional value to our customers and shareholders.  \n We do this by focusing on controllables and action items that we can drive. Now please turn to Slide 12. As a recap, Lennox operates in growth end markets, had resilient margins, demonstrates execution consistency and serves with customers through advanced technology and high-performance talent. The 5 reasons we remain confident in Lennox be a great investment opportunity is: first, we will continue to make strategic growth investments to improve our go-to-market effectiveness and support customer demand; second, margins remain a focus as we continue to evaluate our pricing strategy, implement innovative solutions to increase productivity and optimize our direct-to-dealer network; third, by leveraging the Lennox unified management system, our teams will be able to streamline processes, leverage best practices and consistently execute our strategy; fourth, our continued technological advancement will enable Lennox to remain at the forefront of innovation for our customers; finally, our team's focus on core values and guiding behaviors, is the foundation of a high-performance culture.  \n Our pay-for-performance incentive structure further aligns the talents of our team with the interest of our shareholders. Allow me to wrap up by saying thank you to each of our dedicated employees and valued customers. I'm proud of all that we have been able to accomplish, and I'm looking forward to the promising future that lies ahead of Lennox, as our best days are still ahead of us. Thank you. We'll be happy to take your questions now. Savannah, let's go to Q&A. Tommy, so on the investment side, as you see, our Q1 SG&A is up year-over-year. And so a large part of the investments that we're talking about are already in our numbers, are already in our guidance. Among the -- and this is a classic McKinsey training, right? There are 3 buckets of 3, hence, you get to 9, but that I blame on my McKinsey background or not anything else. The 2 things I would focus on would be both around our customers in terms of fulfillment rate and our net promoter score, which are both indicators -- early indicators of market share gain. And we are seeing solid progress in that. \n Third thing we will point out is pricing excellence, which is kind of embedded in there, but do you see that in our numbers anyway. The first 2, we don't talk about publicly, but that's what I monitor internally in significant amount of detail, looking at where is our NPS and where is the fulfillment rate. If I could just pick you back on. Sorry, go ahead, Tommy. Yes, Tommy, I was saying we did that just to improve the quality of our earnings. I mean, these items are small. They became more recurring, and we think we should only exclude onetime items, extraordinary items. So this was just a bit of a cleanup as Michael came into this role because this was a good opportunity to take these items, which had all become recurring for past many years. Sure. If I could start on the mix for the first part. The mix that you're referring is just residential new construction, which was subdued last year is now coming back, and we sat and that's lower margin to us compared to replacement. So that's kind of the mix impact we were calling out that we've noticed. On the repair versus replacement, I think the jury is still out. I mean, I've read your channel checks, we've talked to our dealers, kind of depends on which part of the country and which dealer. We haven't noticed any significant change in part sales versus equipment sales, but we probably wouldn't be the first one to notice that anyway. There will be other distributors who would call that out. But our dealers remain pretty robustly optimistic on overall the life of equipment where repair may not be the most economical way to move forward. So I haven't noticed anything, but we mentioned that as a call-out because that's clearly a possibility as consumer health might get worse. Sure. So if we -- on the first one, the 454 pricing, nothing has changed. Last year, we may not have been clear enough, but I think we talked a few times that we have said it will be about 15% over 2 years so that increased pricing was for '24 and '25, and we have made that statement in '23. Nothing has really changed because the fourth part of the price increase is already in process. We implemented price increases mid-Q1 and they're going to see that impact. So the remaining is 10%. So I just want to clarify that. Nothing has changed. It was just over 2 years. Now we're talking about 1 year. \n On 410A pricing, I think the picture is mixed. I think to be fair, the actual 410A pricing ramp-up is less than we expected, and it's almost flat. But we think that's still going to move. And from our perspective, that hasn't changed our price on the end product that we are selling this year. And that's mostly for indirect. The comps get much easier starting Q2, and we are seeing the end of destocking. Sure. I mean, we read the same articles that you guys read. I do follow JCI pretty closely, but that's mostly because my good friend, Jim Lucas, is now the Investor Relations leader there, and I like Jim a lot. But if I think from our perspective, nothing has really changed compared to when we talked about it in Q1. And just to kind of reemphasize that. We believe industry consolidation is good, especially as regulatory changes accelerate, you need more scale to be successful. \n From our perspective, we have been public in the past about the interest for this asset that is rumored to be on sale and that hasn't changed either. What we are very focused on is making sure re-execute appropriately, we have a very strong path ahead of us. Our 3-year plan is going to create significant value and we have kind of talked about our long-term targets. There's so much opportunity for us to become a better distributor, improve our commercial volume through the new factory, working through pricing excellence on an ongoing basis and gain share as we successfully execute through the refrigerant changes. And we have a huge big pipeline of bolt-on opportunities as well. So while we can't talk about any specific process, we have sufficient scale to compete and we feel we are in a very good position and evaluate the opportunity that they come by. Yes. And we don't want to call out whether for revenue upside or downside. I'm new to the industry. And whenever I worry about whether, business leaders who have been here for a longer term, say, \"hey, just wait until next week.\" and your concerns might go away. So still early in the quarter, May and June make up a significantly bigger portion of our sales than April does. Well, we've been wrong before, so we've got to keep that in mind as I answer the question. We talked about earlier, it ending by Q4. And then in Q4, we got a sense and we signaled that is likely going to continue in Q1. As we look at leading indicators, so things such as coils, we make universal coils and when we sell those, those are typically the canary in the coal mine in terms of first to go down and first to go up. \n So when I look at those product lines that went down first in sales, we sell them coming back up, and we had a pretty good march on those product lines and in addition conversations with our distributors. So those would be the 2 data points. But listen, we were wrong before. So maybe would be wrong again. But I think this time, we have much more data that supports it. Sure. If you think about our presence, remember, we don't do things like office buildings and large multistory apartment complexes. So from that perspective, our exposure to those areas, which we see were slowing last year and continue to be slow is limited, we are more in single-story building and in national accounts, whether I'd be large big boxes of any type and others. The replacement demand is what's kind of exciting, and that's what we are seeing really good momentum on as a lot of the supply constraints are behind us. \n Lead times are normalizing across the industry, and folks are more willing to put in the investments, especially given particularly the energy and the carbon savings they are going to get out of the new equipment. \n On emergency replacement, our share has dropped so low back. The market trends really don't matter to us. I mean it's all about share gain, and we are making good progress in getting back into our traditional dealers, our traditional accounts and we'll make a lot more progress in the second half of the year when our second factory gets up and running. So that's kind of behind what we talked about in terms of overall trend. Replacement, which is a vast majority of our sales, continues to be strong, and that's driving strong order rates. From a units produced, we have internal targets, but we haven't shared that externally. So I don't want to go there. I mean, over the long term, we did talk about that we got enough square footage to double the capacity. We think that happens over 5 years or more. So think of maybe perhaps at max 20% capacity slowly ramped up one line at a time. So I think that's kind of one way to think about it. But clearly, it will be prudent. We'll look at market conditions. And in some cases, we can obviously move in balance production between the existing factory and the new factory. So that's going to be one way to look at it. But we haven't put in machines in the ground to double the full capacity. We've got enough space to do that, but we'll put those investments as the demand materializes. And also keep in mind there will be manufacturing inefficiencies associated with manufacturing the older 410A units because the volume is going to go down and the factory has got to be more complex at higher cost for the 410A that we expect. Sure. I guess, Julian, the 2 biggest factors on that is we like to be conservative, and second we had fairly easy comps in Q1 compared to where we were last year. On the demand side, I'll start by saying we remain manufacturing or production capacity constrained, not demand constrained. So keep that in mind as I answer all the other different points in here. The new construction and the project push to the right is actually happening right now that only impacts 15% to 20% of our sales that was about -- 75%, 80% of that is, our sales are all replacement, but we needed to call that out just because it does impact a portion of our sales. But today, it's not an issue because again, being supply constrained versus demand constraint continues to hold for us. Education vertical, yes, it had some benefits last year, may have left this year, but it's really not a material mover for us nor was it last year. So it really doesn't impact us. \n The biggest driver of optimism there is the age of units, the units on the rooftop, whether it's a big box and others, they are way beyond the useful life. Many of them are like 18 years where the useful life is closer to 14 to 16. That's what drives our optimism about order rates and things going forward. But the delta that you officially asked for at the beginning is easier comps and some conservatism built in because no factory startup goes perfectly, Julian. As you know, factory startups always have some issues here or there. So we just didn't want to get ahead of ourselves. If you just click it, I would tell you in the first inning, but since it's baseball, I have to say we are probably the third or fourth inning of that right now. Where we are is, yes, we were below market price in many of our key accounts where we have signed contracts after the tornado and pre-COVID and we did not have inflation clauses in that. So there was definitely a large portion of our sales where we were and in some cases, still below market their process to get up to the market level. So I think that's a big part of that. \n There is a second part of that, which is around giving the local leaders autonomy to an extent to get pricing adjusted, we used to do national pricing and then we realized there is no such thing as national pricing. Pricing in South is very different than pricing in the North. So we will be able to capture greater pricing excellence just by having more localized pricing and there's going to be upside on that working through that. \n The third aspect of pricing is simply around us continuing to capture pricing ahead of inflation because people think inflation has gone away, and it's not. So as we do price increases and the fact that we lost margin points during the COVID transition and during the tornado, we need to just work with all our channel partners and customers and make sure we get price ahead of inflation, not behind inflation because inflation continues to impact us, whether it's SG&A or materials or labor, all of that impacts SG&A. So those are the 3 aspects, I would say we are less than halfway complete, but pleased with progress so far, and especially pleased with some of the price actions we took on key accounts and gotten closer to market, but still below market in some cases. Sure. So the two inefficiencies we called out. One is the Saltillo Mexico start-up inefficiencies. And then we called out $5 million to $10 million of additional inefficiencies on residential for transitioning from 410A to 454B. The change is pretty big. We have to make sure that we are handling appropriately the new refrigerant, which is mildly flammable. So it has a different classification when it comes to DOT regulations, so it requires different piping, different storage, different testing, different test chambers. Though the compressors are new, the size of the product might change in some cases. So it's a fairly big change, but we're pretty used to it. We are very ready. This is not starting now. \n A lot of these changes started last year. So for example, the new refrigerants line already been in start and the new storage tanks already in the facility. We're already doing test runs. If we needed to make products today, we would. So the inefficiency costs that we called out would simply be lines shutting down for a few weeks while we make all the changes, test the product and then restart it. That's kind of the core source of inefficiencies. Most of the investments are already kind of on the floor now. Chelsey and I were listening to you, Deane, when you told us that at your conference, and we took that as a challenge. So it did start at your conference when you mentioned that to Chelsey and I. Steve, we wanted to do it the same way. Last year, we called out the SEER-1 because that was the largest driver as we're going from older SEER standards to the newer one. But for us, mix has always been product types and RMC products are part of that mix change. Well, as new housing starts had gone down, I think Q1 last year was abnormally low. So I think both start impacting, right? We're comping ourselves out of the dip that we had last year. Yes. And you can take our entire segment and compare it. Michael is saying only a portion of our segment gets compared to that. So we did equal or better than the AHRI data. Yes. Given that we are having the call towards the end of April, conviction is already reflective of what we are seeing in April. So we remain convinced that the destocking is coming to an end. No. I would expect that channel to be up in unit volume in Q2. Yes. I'm going to call out weather, but listen, I don't want to get nervous just because I have to wear a sweatshirt in Texas in April. Yes. So listen, great question. While there are no certainties. Here's what we know and we look at, right? I mean, our order rates continue to be higher than what we can manufacture, and we are still turning away businesses that we would rather not. So that's just internal way we are looking at, and that's been going out for 2 to 3 years now. So could [Indiscernible] tomorrow it might, but that's one. \n Second, we have made significant investments in preparing our sales team to go out and start adding -- in some cases, adding back contractors whom we had lost and working towards emergency replacement. And that's part of some of the investments that we talked about is leveraging our core contractors or Lennox dealers to be able to push that emergency replacement market. And finally, it's the key accounts and the conversations that we're having with them especially when it comes to 454B products because some of them had delayed replacement and want to do replacement with 454B products because they know that, that refrigerants will be around longer and will be lower global warming potential rated. So they get some carbon credits for that as well. \n So multiple factors in there goes down to our current rate investments we have made in drumming up extra demand, and lots and lots of conversations with our key accounts to pull that forward. But at the same time, I mean, current factory is running kind of overcapacity. So in case the demand fully doesn't come through, we've got lots of flexibility in where we produce and what we produce. And that flexibility is also super exciting to us and baked into our numbers going forward. Yes, sure. No, that's fair. Again, I don't want to comment on other company, but I'll tell you we are going to be focused on HVAC. I mean we are an  HVACR  company, and that's what we do, focused on that. And I don't think that's going to change just because opportunistically something else becomes available. And our strategy is working. We have the scale. We see a strong pathway ahead for us just doing execution on our [Indiscernible] business end. But we'll remain very focused. No, I would say we are looking at North American HVAC as being the primary market. We do a lot of exports as well. And the heat pump technology that we use, we do get from overseas. As you know, we already have hundreds of millions of sales in that."

            "content": "Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. Expanding on to Alok's earlier comments, I'm excited to share our Q1 results, which not only reflect a strong start to the year, but also highlight record first quarter margins and an impressive 23% growth in adjusted earnings per share. Core revenue was $1 billion, up 6% as price gains and revenue from the AES acquisition were the main drivers of year-over-year improvement. Adjusted segment profit increased $25 million, where most of the growth came from $40 million of price and mix benefits. This was partially offset by continued inflation and investment in SG&A and distribution.  \n Total adjusted segment margin was 15.9%, up approximately 160 basis points versus prior year. Corporate expenses were $24 million, which includes $3 million of expenses previously considered noncore adjustments. Beginning in 2024, we will include certain previously categorized noncore adjustments in our adjusted earnings.  \n This approach aims to reduce recurring or immaterial adjustments, which improves our overall quality of earnings reported. Our adjusted earnings will continue to exclude the effects of business divestitures and significant nonrecurring items such as restructuring programs. Our first quarter tax rate was 19.4% and diluted shares outstanding were 35.8 million compared to 35.6 million in the prior year quarter.  \n Now let's direct our attention to Slide 7, where we can review the financial performance of our Home Comfort Solutions Segment. Revenue declined 1% to $681 million in the first quarter. The volume in our 2-step distribution channel continues to feel the effects of industry destocking and was down mid-teens. Our direct-to-contractor sales volumes were up low single digits with solid growth in the new construction channel as new homebuilding starts have rebounded.  \n Price yield was 3%, an improvement from the 2% price yield we earned in the second half of 2023, reflecting our successful execution of pricing initiatives in the quarter. The Home Comfort Solutions segment profit increased $1 million to $112 million, and segment margin also experienced approximately 30 basis points of growth to 16.6%, although pricing initiatives are progressing well, results are still impacted by inflation as well as the ongoing investments in distribution and sales.  \n Overall, given the challenging conditions in the end market, we are proud of our execution to increase profit margins even with volume and mix headwinds. We are prepared to launch the new low GWP product in the coming months and ensure the new product pricing material maintains gross margins.  \n Turning to Slide 8 in our Building Climate Solutions segment that delivered another strong quarter. The Building Climate Solutions revenue was up an impressive 21% this quarter, propelled by 7% volume growth and our best performance in many quarters. Combined price and mix were up 8%, and revenue from our AES acquisition contributed 6% revenue growth in the quarter. Building Climate Solutions profit grew by $28 million or 56% and segment margin expanded 480 basis points to 21%. These results were primarily driven by price and sales volume gains. Our profit results also reflect  $2 million headwind for our new Saltillo Mexico factory ramp-up expenses.  \n Despite ongoing production and supply chain challenges, unit production volume from the Stuttgart, Arkansas factory shows steady improvement. Additionally, we are excited for product output from the new Saltillo factory in early Q3 and we'll launch our new low GWP product in early 2025. We continue to be impressed by the Building Climate Solutions team's strong efforts in executing initiatives to pave the way for achieving our long-term targets.  \n If you will now turn to Slide 9, I will review our cash flow performance and capital deployment strategies. Operating cash flow used in the quarter was $23 million compared to $79 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $30 million for the quarter, a decrease of $5 million compared to the prior year. Later in 2024, we anticipate temporary increases in working capital as we ramp up our new Saltillo, Mexico factory and prepare for the transition to the new low GWP product.  \n Concurrently, the team is focused on improving processes and generating efficiencies in both accounts payable and accounts receivable. Both items are reflected in our full year free cash flow guidance and long-term cash conversion targets. Our commitment to high ROIC drives strategic and targeted investments that enhance our performance and competitiveness in the marketplace. As previously mentioned, the new Saltillo factory and the transition to the new refrigerant products is proceeding as planned and showing positive progress.  \n We also continue to look at bolt-on M&A opportunities that align closely with their overreaching company strategy. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.4x down from 2.1x in the prior year. Our approach to capital deployment remains consistent. We prioritize capital expenditure investments with strong returns, grow dividends with earnings, continue to explore M&A opportunities, and supplement with share repurchases when necessary. Additionally, we are committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating.  \n Turning to Slide 10. Let's review the 2024 full year guidance. Our outlook on revenue provided during our last conference call remains unchanged as first quarter trends performed as expected. As a reminder, I will reiterate a few revenue guidance points. RECONNECT The table on the left highlights full year revenue growth factors. Total company revenue is projected to increase by approximately 7%. We also expect stable sales volumes with a slight increase from Building Climate Solutions and flat for Home Comfort solutions. Price and mix are expected to drive a mid-single-digit revenue growth where price increases will ensure we remain price/cost positive.  \n As a result of our strong first quarter profit performance, we are also revising our full year earnings per share guidance to $19 to $20 from the previously guided range of $18.50 to $20. Our free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at $500 million to $600 million. Those product and other cost assumptions also remain unchanged. Component cost inflation is anticipated to be up mid-single digits including large increases in our cost to acquire R-410A refrigerant and recent inflation in commodity prices. We expect this cost inflation to be partially offset by material cost reduction programs. We anticipate ramp-up costs of approximately $10 million for the new Saltillo Mexico factory, along with approximately $5 million to $10 million associated with the refrigerant transition across our home comfort solutions manufacturing facilities. SG&A expenses are expected to increase in the year, a result of both inflationary pressures and investments. Our investments are focused on resources to improve customer service, information system advancements and distribution growth initiatives.  \n We will also be making investments in both sales and marketing to support our long-term growth targets. Capital expenditures remain unchanged at $175 million. Interest expense is still expected to be approximately $50 million and our tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%.  \n With that, please turn to Slide 11, and I'll turn it back to Alok for an overview of end markets. Sure. Yes. So on the seasonality from the revenue perspective, we've already mentioned that we think from a revenue perspective, Q1 is about 20% of the year. First half is about 50%, second half is about 50%. That's from a revenue perspective. And then on the items that we've now included in corporate, previously, we had some items for asbestos litigation, environmental expense, unique litigation. So these are kind of just small immaterial noisy items that were somewhat recurring, and it was about $0.25 of items last year that we've now moved into our adjusted earnings this year. Yes. If those expenses are generally flat, which we think they are, yes, it's about a [$0.25] headwind. So first, I'll answer on the price increase. We think it's probably going to be both in the same ballpark of 10%, if not higher, both products need significant investments in the factory and some of the sensors in the compression technology. And then why we think it's 50% to 65%. I mean what we're seeing is that you're going to have a bit of a carryover into next year from our 410A systems that are able to be sold next year that were kind of built this year. Then you also have, within the EPA guidance, that you can sell components in the next year. So we think those 2 combined are going to be the 35% to 40% of the market next year and then the balance would be new adoption of the 454B refrigerant product. Yes. If you kind of look at our implied guidance, you had the balance of the year would be kind of low single digits, a little stronger on the indirect than the sell-through side, but balance kind of flat to slightly up for the rest of the year. Yes. I think there's still some uncertainty, though in the end markets on the sell-through. I think we're trying to watch weather within Q2, it's cold here in Dallas. We'll see where it goes for the rest of the quarter. So I think there's some concerns on where weather could go. But I think the 50% of the sales in the first half still seems appropriate. Yes. So within the quarter, we had pretty good price yield of 3%, but that was only a partial yield for some of the price increases that we announced in February and into March. So we're going to see a little bit more carryover and pick up on the pricing side. I also don't expect the new construction mix to continue like it did in Q1. So we think that, that will moderate later in the year. And then we'll also start to see some of the carryover benefit from the minimum SEER efficiency products as we get to the second half of this year, maybe late in the year, a very minor favorable mix for the 454B products not really much within the guide. But overall, it's just continued pricing within HCS. \n On the BCS guide, it's a similar story where we're lapping some really big price increases that we did last year. So you see a lot more of that in the first quarter that will then moderate in later quarters this year as we get some of the price increases that we announced in that segment as well. Yes. There's 2 things that we're focused on in working capital this year. It's inventory build. The first is some additional raw materials to help transition to the new building climate solutions factory in Mexico. So that's a piece of it. But then the other side of it is going to be to do a prebuild for some R-410A systems on the residential side depending on end market demand and how that's going to carry into next year. And then also on the BCS segment is that we can continue to build 410A unitary rooftops through the end of this year, and then we have 3 years to sell that through. So we want to make sure we have sufficient 410A demand to cover a few years of -- or continued volume for the next year or so on the BCS product. So that all adds up to about $50 million of inventory that we're going to have to add this year. Yes. As we always do, we'll come out with a new price increase next year on the 410A system and depending where the cost of that gas goes up, which we expect to go up significantly. It could also have a pretty large increase similar to the 454B product. But we're monitoring that, and there will be another price increase on that next year for the 35% of the demand. Yes, there will be some additional investments they're going to start to make in the second quarter that weren't fully impacted in the first quarter predominantly launching the new commercial factory as well as starting to transition to the new 454B product in HCS. Additionally, we had a bit of a onetime benefit within Q1 for margins for warranty adjustments, so that will also kind of not repeat in the next year or the next quarter. But overall, there will be some cost increases coming into the second and third quarters that weren't within the first quarter. Correct. Yes, some ramp-up costs that we're going to need to transition to get the product ready. If the right opportunity materialize, we'd go up kind of 3%, maybe a little over 3% near term and then quickly want to get back to that 1 to 1.5x after that initial increase to above 3%. But the key is maintaining investment grade ratings. That's the key. Yes. On the raw material side, yes, our inventories are still higher than we like. They are drifting down better as supply chains are healing. So they are coming down, but we're going to have to grow them a bit for this Building Climate Solutions transition to ramp up that new factory. But overall raw inventory is getting better. But yes, we will -- we're going to start to grow inventory later this year for the new 410A product and we're going to start to rebuild and grow some of that in the second half of this year. And then another element that we have within the free cash flow guide is that the CapEx is also going to be a little bit higher in the second half of this year than our normal guide. Normally, we have about $110 million of CapEx. It's about $175 million. You can see that there's going to be more in the second half to complete the ramp-up of the factory and get our transition to the new 454B product ready to go. Yes. So we continue to do pricing excellence. And we've announced up to 8% price increase in Q1. So we're going to continue to drive price increase, even though it's going to lap some of the comps, which are going to be a little more challenging. Right now, our guide is volumes kind of flattish to up low single digits in the balance of the year. That normally comes with 30% incremental. So that should help drive our return on sales, operating profit margins up higher. But then working against that as a little bit of the headwinds that we have to ramp that new factory up. So absent of the factory ramp, we still see margins modestly moving up. Yes. So we see steel increases that are also starting to come up. That's more immediate. That kind of is on a quarterly lag. The copper and aluminum goes through a hedging process. It's kind of an 18-month blended hedging process. So we'll start to see some of that this year, but it will come into next year as well. We'll continue to monitor that. If it stays elevated, we'll have to see what type of pricing actions later this year we need to do. But definitely, that would be reflective in the new 454B product, if it continues on pricing and the [Indiscernible] pricing into next year. Specifically speak to the pricing. So within the quarter, we only had a partial quarter on the price increase. So we announced on the Lennox brand starting February. So that didn't even fully get all the way through February, seeing about a month on the Lennox side. So that should continue to increase as we go throughout the year on just the normal flow activity on Lennox. And then we also had price increases on some of our large PE and builder contracts that also was -- some of those were also a partial quarter. So you'll start to see that also expand later in the year. \n On the mix side, we don't think that the new construction mix is going to continue, so that should help going forward. But we're watching it to see if it does. But right now, we're assuming that, that mix basically slows down on the RNC side. Within the quarter, correct, yes. Well, if you think within that customer, it is a SEER level of the product that normally do entry-level type products. So it's kind of a mix of both. Our  AHRI reported rooftop units were up more than that 7%. We had some declines in our refrigeration volume within the quarter that were taking down some of the gains, but we think we grew faster than the AHRI on rooftops within the quarter, winning back some share."
