[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, please begin.\nTracy Ward: Thanks, Amy. And good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our fourth quarter result's press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA, that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and real-time market conditions as well as guidance. Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Dan Letter, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly and Colleen McEwan are also here with us today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom, will you please begin.\nThomas Olinger: Thank you, Tracy. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today. I want to begin by acknowledging our team and their great work this past year. In an incredibly challenging year, our accomplishments were significant and possible because of the work we've done over the last 10 years building the best-in-class portfolio that is critical to today's supply chain and centered on our customers. During the year we closed on $17 billion of M&A, further fortified our balance sheet with lower rates in line of maturities generated over $1.1 billion of free cash flow after dividends and importantly, continue to deliver sector-leading earnings growth. Since the merger in 2011, our earnings CAGR of 9.5% without promotes has outperformed the other logistics REITs by more than 350 basis points annually. This is the result of the unique business model which has consistently outperformed year-after-year. Turning to our view of the operating environment. Our proprietary data shows that the strong demand we experienced in the third quarter has continued, globally leases signed in the fourth quarter were a record 65 million square feet or more than 1 million square feet per business day. This was driven by new leasing, which rose 22% year-over-year on a size-adjusted basis. Broad range of customers signed new leases in the fourth quarter led by consumer products, food and beverage, electronics and health care segments. E-commerce activity accounted for 19.8% of new leasing. The need for speed and flexibility is also reflected in elevated short-term leasing which was up 58% in the quarter as 3PL, retail and transportation customers raised to secure space ahead of the holidays. Lease proposals remain at healthy levels. In the U.S., fourth quarter net absorption was the highest under record at 100 million square feet and in excess of new supply of 90 million square feet. Rents in our markets grew by 3.2% with all the growth coming in the back half of 2020, we anticipate rents to grow by approximately 5% in 2021. Houston is the only U.S. market on our watch list. As a reminder, we moved to Atlanta and Central Pennsylvania from our list in the second quarter. In 2021, we expect supply to decline year-on-year balanced with demand at 280 million square feet each. Conditions are also healthy in our other markets across the globe. In Europe, rents begin to rise in the fourth quarter and we expect 2.5% of additional growth in 2021, led by Northern Europe and the U.K. The implications of Brexit have been largely positive for us as we anticipated 4 years ago and Brexit was first announced. Inventory disaggregation will eventually lead to higher inventory levels in both the U.K. and the continent. We're watching new supply in Poland and Spain, but for context, these two markets account for just 1.7% of our share of NOI. In Tokyo and Osaka, historic high levels to supply are being met with very strong demand. Over two-third of the development pipeline is already pre-leased and we expect market vacancies to remain below 2%. For China, suppliers moderating even as the market remains soft. In our portfolio, we leased a record 10 million square feet in the second half of the year, a credit to the great work of our new China leadership team. Turning to valuations. Our logistics portfolio posted the largest sequential increase in a decade, rising 5% in the U.S. and globally and are now nearly 6% above pre-pandemic levels. Applying this increase to our $142 billion owned and managed portfolio, we estimate the value of our real estate rose by $7 billion in the fourth quarter. We expect continued fundamental improvement in 2021 and beyond, based on three drivers, first, a powerful economic recovery including the highest GDP growth in the U.S. in more than two decades. The combination of corporate and personal savings as well as significant governmental stimulus, is a loaded spring which will translate to significant economic growth in the back half as the vaccines continue to roll out. Second, the pandemic accelerates the retail revolution. The e-commerce penetration rate jumped 480 basis points to 20% of goods sold in the U.S. in 2020. Based on early reports, e-commerce holiday sales grew by at least 30%. While we expect the share of goods purchased online to grow further, a pause later this year would not surprise us, as consumers expand spending on services and experiences over goods. Our customers continue to plan for a long-term, retooling supply chains for increased, they should generate a cumulative incremental demand of 200 million square feet or more over the next several years. Third we expect higher inventory levels. Inventory to sales ratios remain near all-time lows. We believe that's had an impact on our customer space utilization as it ticked down to 83% in the fourth quarter. We see early signs of inventory restocking as containerized import volumes in the U.S. rose 24% in November and are on pace to set a quarterly record. Longer term, the need for more resilient supply chains will lead to higher inventory levels. We estimate that a 5% increase in inventory levels will produce incremental demand of nearly 300 million square feet in the U.S. alone. These changes will take years to play out, driving strong long-term demand. Turning to results, the work we've done to create the best-in-class portfolio, scale, and lowest cost structure in the industry is delivering exceptional financial results. 2020 core FFO excluding promotes grew by 14% and came in at the high end of our range at $3.58 per share. We also recognized record net promote income of $0.22 per share. Net effective rent change on rollover in the fourth quarter was 28% led by the U.S. at 32.1%, both high watermarks for the year. Our in-place to market rent spread now stands at 12.8%, up about 60 basis points sequentially. Collections continue to outpace 2019 level and as of this morning, we collected over 99% of fourth quarter rents and over 95% of January. Bad debt was 42 basis points for the quarter and 43 basis points for the year, both below our expectation. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 3% and led by the U.S. at 3.5%. We made a meaningful progress on the sale of non-strategic assets acquired from Liberty. We set all disputes related to the construction of the Philadelphia Four Seasons Hotel and the Comcast Technology Center. We completed the disposition of our 20% ownership interest in the hotel and the previously announced portfolio in the U.K. To date, we have sold more than $600 million of former Liberty assets, exceeding our underwritten value by more than 80%. We now have a less than $400 million of former Liberty non-logistics assets remaining consisting primarily of our interest in the Comcast headquarters. For strategic capital, our team raised $3.1 billion in 2020 with 40% from new investors we have yet to meet in person. Market and property tours as well as due diligence activities were all conducted virtually as our team capitalize on our early investments in digital infrastructure. Our balance sheet remains the best in the industry with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicle of more than $13 billion. Our capital markets activity in the quarter brought our total average interest rate down to 2%. We will look for additional opportunities to refinance at attractive rates. In fact, at current interest rates and our mix of currencies, we could issue 10-year debt at a blended all-in rate of 1%. Turning to our guidance for 2021, here are the key components on our share basis. We expect cash same-store NOI growth to range between 3.5% to 4.5%. We're estimating bad debt expense to range between 20 and 40 basis points of gross revenues and average occupancy for our operating portfolio to range between 95.5% and 96.5%. We expect a seasonal occupancy drop in the first quarter then trend higher as the year progresses. For strategic capital, we expect revenue excluding promotes to range between $435 million and $450 million. Promote revenue will be negligible in 2021. In fact we'll have net promote expenses of $0.02 per share for the year, which relates to the amortization of costs from prior period promotes. Our historic net promote income in average approximately 20 basis points for third-party AUM, which would be $0.06 to $0.07 of earnings per share based on current promotable AUM. Looking ahead, recent property appreciation leads us to expect net promote income per share in 2022 to be at or above this historic average. We expect to start between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion in new development with 45% new leases and for stabilizations to range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Dispositions will range between $1 billion and $1.4 billion with the majority expected to close in the first half of 2021. We are forecasting net deployment uses of $350 million at the midpoint and as a result, our leverage remains effectively flat in 2021. Putting this altogether, we expect core FFO, including the $0.02 of net promote expense to range between $3.88 to $3.98 per share. Core FFO excluding promotes will range between $3.90 and $4 per share with year-over-year growth at the midpoint of more than 10% delivering another year of exceptional growth. We entered 2021 with optimism and confidence, our ability to deliver value for our customers beyond real estate using our unmatched purchasing power and significant investments in technology, innovation and data are significant competitive advantages that will drive further our performance. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCaitlin Burrows: Your guidance for 2021 on development services almost 20% higher in terms of last year. So could you just go through what the balance of build-to-suit in speculative development and how much kind of visibility do you have on that, could it be increased further there?\nEugene Reilly: Yes, Caitlin. This is Gene. I'll take that question. And you are breaking up a little bit, but I think you're talking about the development activity in the coming year. So this year, about 85% of what we're guiding to are main transactions. So, we have very few placeholders. And as Tom mentioned, we're 45% build-to-suit in the forecast and it is really difficult to forecast how that's going to play out. But if there is a bias, it probably is to the upside. But at this point, we're comfortable with the forecast.\nCaitlin Burrows: And probably better but sorry if I'm still breaking out. And then if I could ask just second. Just, Tom, you mentioned that short-term leasing was up. So just wondering how did the short-term leases compared to regular leases in terms of points and rents and the thought process on competing those versus longer-term leases?\nEugene Reilly: Thanks, Caitlin. You broke up a little bit there. But I think just how the - our bond process runs short-term we think. I think we're going to continue to see short-term leasing probably stay at elevated levels, just given the tightness of the market and the need for customers to act and move quickly as we get into 2021. I hope that addresses your question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the questions. So maybe just first one going to the core guidance, same-store NOI guidance. If we sort of look at your components with the occupancy, on average, slight uptick, escalators, which I'm assuming 2.5%, 3% bumps that you're going to get from expiration, rent expiring. Seems to me that if I put all that together, you should be kind of well, if not well above, but above 4%. So, I'm just wondering if you can walk us through maybe what the puts are there and what would get you to the bottom end of that range?\nThomas Olinger: Yes. The simplest way to look at it for same-store in 2021 is it's all driven primarily by rent change on roll. So think about 25% roll and - I'm sorry, 15% lease roll, and from a GAAP perspective, think about 25%-ish rent change on roll. And as you mentioned, occupancy and bad debt are pretty consistent, don't move much year-over-year, so that drives the GAAP same-store. From a cash perspective, think about that same 15%, we'll call it 12-ish percent rent change on roll, you're going to see bumps from around 3.25% on the portfolio in place and then you'll see a little bit of normal free rent out of that. But those components should get you right near the midpoint of our guidance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Feldman: Thank you. I was hoping to take a step back a little bit and just get your perspectives on the election and what do you think it might mean in terms of policy or tentative reaction or customer reaction to just kind of new leadership in terms of what you think might change for warehouse demand, whether certain markets look more interesting? Or any themes or trends you think we should be watching? And I guess, thinking about the Biden's Buy America plan, wondering what your thoughts are on that as well? Thank you.\nThomas Olinger: Sure, Jamie. I'll take a stab at that. I think the most significant near-term thing is going to be the infrastructure spending and that will have a positive effect on demand for our product. With respect to Buy U.S. first and all, we had that in the previous administration but if you actually look at the numbers, they don't support the newspaper headlines. So, we don't think there's going to be a material change in that because we haven't had any of that in the last four years either in. That was pretty much the same, same promoted policy. But the big drivers of our business is not necessarily economic policy. It's just the mix of consumption between bricks and mortar and e-commerce and the underlying growth rate of the economy, which should be very strong bouncing from a down year basically, and recovering all of that in 2021. So, we think those are the two big drivers. And economic policy will be affected a little bit around the edges but not the main driver.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: I guess I wanted to take Tom's comment about the 65 million square feet of leasing in the quarter, which is exceptionally strong. And maybe just look at Page 4 of the supplemental where you have that chart that shows new lease proposals and then the space utilization. And I'm just trying to kind of square the proposals with kind of the strong leasing and then just curious why the utilization figure is trending downward and maybe not upward?\nThomas Olinger: Actually I'm going to take that. It's pretty simple. People are running out of inventory because they haven't pre-positioned enough inventory in the system to support the level of activity. And remember, we need more inventory in the online channel than we do in the offline channel. And one of the big issues with inventories is that we can't get the containers back to China. And so, actually, we could support a much higher utilization and lower levels of stock-outs, but that's what's going on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thanks. Good morning. In the fourth quarter, your development starts ramped up with a lower expected development margin of 23% despite lower build-to-suit activity this quarter. Can you just comment on this dynamic and if we could run rate going forward on margins?\nEugene Reilly: Yes. This is Eugene. I'll take that. So, you are going to see and have seen for the past several years that our forecasted margins are quite a bit lower than our margins historically because these are underwritten margins. Now, we have been beating these margins for a variety of reasons, rent growth, cap rate compression. So I would expect and I think we'll retain this for a long time that you will see over time margins will normalize. But that really depends on what the future cap rate environment looks like.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Yulico: Thank you. I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about expectations for rent growth in the different regions and this year? And maybe you can break that up, if you see a difference between gateway distribution markets versus multi-market distribution, city distribution and Last Touch?\nChris Caton: Hi, Nick. It's Chris here. Yes, we expect U.S. rent growth to be 5% in 2020 and a little bit better than 4% globally. In terms of the different product types, look, we highlighted a couple of geographies that we expect to outperform, for example, the UK and Northern Europe. And in United States, we've had a combination of the major Last Touch city distribution markets as well as some gateway distribution markets outperforming. I'm thinking New York, New Jersey, I'm thinking Toronto and Southern California. And they outperformed in 2020 and we expect them to outperform in 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDerek Johnston: I would like to hear more about the evolving demand and leasing dynamics in the European portfolio. And really specifically, when it comes to occupancy, which until last year was a bit of a headwind, it was slipping every quarter starting back in 4Q '18, now admittedly from a high point. But how do things feel on the ground in Europe? Have off-nets in fact stabilized and can we expect growth from here? I mean, I believe this is the first positive year-over-year comp in six quarters. Thanks.\nThomas Olinger: Yes. That may be the case in terms of the math I've read. Europe is generally a more balanced market than the U.S. Demand and supply seem to move in sync together and generally vacancy rates are lower. The two exceptions are probably I would say, the big exception is Poland. And from time-to-time you get Spain sort of moving up to that volatile end of the market, but the rest of Europe is very well occupied. So it's really the volume of rollovers in Poland and Spain that drive that balance and occupancy on the margin. But throughout, our occupancies in Europe have been higher than the rest of our portfolio and in the U.S. anyway.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nEmmanuel Korchman: Hamid, maybe this is one for you. Do you think that the Exeter ETT deal announced this morning provides any read through to your private capital business?\nHamid Moghadam: Well, I think our private capital business continues to be undervalued by the street. All you got to do is look at the comps of publicly traded investment management firms and once you consider the fact that well over 90% of our assets are in infinite life vehicles and they generate significant promotes from time to time, and that our margins keep on increasing. I think that multiple should be in the low 20s. But I think most of the NAV models that I see are in the low teens or maybe even 10. So I think the street continues so undervalue that business. Would it be worth more if we crystallize that value in a trans - very specific transaction? Sure. But is it worth the headache on a company that has a $140 billion of assets to move around the value by $0.50 or bucket share? Probably not. So, we think there is upside to our NAV from our Investment Management business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Carroll: Can you provide some color on tenant - the tenant demand you're seeing? I mean, I know in the beginning of the year, in the middle of the year, a lot of the demand - or Amazon specifically has been extremely active. And have you seen or do you expect to see that tenant interest to broaden out more meaningfully as we move into 2021?\nHamid Moghadam: Yes, let me start it then and then Mike can give you more color. But we think demand is pretty broad, I mean, sure e-commerce gets a lot of the headlines, because on the margin that is the source of new demand, but there is plenty of demand from other sectors that continues and forms a strong base. And within the e-commerce sector, of course Amazon is the biggest player, so they get a lot of play. But remember, Amazon is more in change of our total ABR and there are lots of other tenants that are doing well. In fact, I would say everybody is pretty much doing well with the exception of the uses that support hospitality like convention, exhibition, people and things of that nature. The rest of the market is pretty, pretty strong. Mike, you want to provide more color on that?\nMichael Curless: Yes, let's look at it in traditional leasing and in build-to-suits. On the leasing front their fourth quarter performance sort of normalized compared to typical Amazon numbers with us after a robust Amazon activity in quarters two and three. But the message there is, there's plenty of other companies' broad base that are driving traditional e-com leasing and I think that speaks to the philosophy going forward. And then on the build-to-suit side, yes, Amazon was very active. We did six build-to-suits with them in the quarter and call it 10 for the year out of 28. However, there was a ton of restructuring well underway with the home improvement folks, food and beverage, healthcare, well underway with restructuring pre COVID. Perhaps they took a couple of months pause during COVID but man they're coming back with a vengeance and marching forward with those restructurings. And so while we'll see plenty of Amazon, I am really encouraged the other uses. We just signed a big lease with Kraft about a month ago, and working with a ton of brand names next year, we'll be happy to talk more about.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Mailman: Maybe a follow-up to an earlier question, but I think last year we were talking about the cadence potentially of development stabilizations given kind of the build-up of starts in the resurgence there. And I'm just kind of curious, it looks, year-over-year like that pace of stabilizations is expected to slow. Is there something going on there that changed that outlook?\nHamid Moghadam: Well, the only thing I can think of is that we deferred some starts immediately when COVID hit, because we didn't know what kind of environment we were in. But we've essentially restarted most if not all of those things and will be restarting them. So I think we just got that pushed out, but the volume that's behind it is very significant. So I would say the total level of stabilizations will be increased in the next couple of years beyond what it would have been and what our expectations would have been certainly at the beginning of COVID. But I would say even more than our expectations at the beginning of the year - beginning of last year prior to COVID.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Let's proceed with your question.\nThomas Catherwood: I want to go back to something Chris had mentioned about above average rent growth for last touch assets, which makes a lot of sense. Obviously, we understand the supply-constrained nature of industrial markets in major cities, but it seems like nowadays every real estate developer is an industrial developer and especially in New York City. We're seeing a big jump in infill industrial projects. Could this jump in development activity create a supply-demand imbalance and potentially put the brakes on rent growth for some of your last touch assets?\nHamid Moghadam: It could, but I think what's going on in New York and elsewhere is that there is a lot of price discovery, nobody really knows what the ability to pay is for some of these customers and in all of these locations, we underestimated the rental value. So at least for the time being, all the price discovery has been good and the other thing you should take into account is that in these infill locations, you've got to have a lot of developers, but you're not going to have a lot more land or buildings that can be rehabilitated. So I think you'll see it in terms of pressure on pricing of those assets, more than you would see on absolute supply because the supply is pretty inelastic aspects and will show up in price.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nBlaine Heck: I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the investment sales market and your interest in acquisitions? There have been several large portfolios in the U.S. specifically that have traded either in the second half of last year or early on this year and I know you guys typically are looking at anything sizable that hits the market. So without getting into specifics, unless you want to, can you just talk about what kept you on the sidelines in these situations with the pricing and underwriting being stretched. Is it more of the geographic footprint that just doesn't overlap enough or maybe it's just your focus on - more on development at this point? Any color there would be helpful.\nHamid Moghadam: So all of the above. Let me give you a quick answer and Gene will fill in the blanks. We are not good buyers of core real estate auction by a brokerage house where there are 55 people showing up at the margin, a lot of these people have to build up their industrial capability and everybody is trying to get into that business because the other property types don't offer very many opportunities. So, those kind of just looking it out on price, is not our business. So that means that building out our land bank, doing value-added acquisitions where we can bring our leasing and operational expertise to the table, deals that are Hairy, et cetera, et cetera, but general framework for looking at deals is returns, how we can differentiate and have a competitive advantage and also in the case of portfolio deals, what that fit is if we have to buy 100 buildings and sell 90 of them, that's probably not a very attractive transaction for us. So the other thing I would just mention is that you meant - you posed the question in a sense that we're only going after big deals. We do a lot of $5 million only deals too, they just don't show up. So we're there looking at pretty much everything that moves out there and we're there with offers on most if not all of the ones that meet our quality standards, but thankfully in a lot of those core situations, we lose. So we're good with that. We're on the selling side of the lot of those transactions as well.\nEugene Reilly: Yes. I just had a couple of things. I mean last year we had 300 matters go through Investment Committee. So it means that we look at a range of deal sizes and we look at every single deal. Every single deal, we will underwrite it, look at it. We are bit picky on quality that's an explanation. And we were - we execute when it makes sense for us, but I wouldn't read into this that we're uninterested.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nDave Rodgers: Tom, I wanted to follow up on you said earlier a larger percentage of short-term leases I think in the fourth quarter, but we did see leave economics around just a little bit marginal, but we see it happen. I'm wondering if the economics were just a delay from COVID era or if you're going to be [indiscernible] are heading right amount of lease economics for the same lease have gone. [technical difficulty] 250,000 to 500,000 square feet boxes, really offset it with gain 1 to 255 range. Is this having an impact on the economics. I'm trying to figure really economics are going, and what's driving that is kind of economic occupancy trends.\nThomas Olinger: Yes, Dave. I'll take both of those. On the first one, remember leases less than one year are excluded from our leasing metrics that's consistent of what we do across our - the agreement we have with our - the other logistics around metrics. So that is what's happening is if you're looking at turnover costs, it's the higher mix of new leasing versus renewals. We saw that in Q3, we saw in Q4 and that is what is driving turnover costs slightly higher this quarter and same story last quarter. And then regarding economics, I wouldn't look at - yeah, we did see space sizes under 100,000 square feet and it actually went up 100 basis points. But I wouldn't look at the other segments they are quite strong. I think that's just some activity that happened at quarter end and its noise and all segments are doing quite well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Frankel: This might be related to blend or a question just about capital allocation. But you mentioned that you saw most of the non-industrial assets from Liberty portfolio, but looks like your held for sale portfolio is still somewhat elevated, so maybe you can talk about the pace of those sales going forward. And then secondly, we're on the operating portfolio looking at Bay Area occupancy went down about 300 basis points of sale quarter-over-quarter. So maybe just comment on how the local economic environment there is affecting industrial demand. Thank you.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes, on the pace of sales, we mentioned with our need for capital - we're - depending on how you measure it 19%-20% levered. So we don't want to dilute ourselves and those assets are doing nothing other than appreciating. So we'll be - we'll take our time with respect to selling the industrial assets and we'll match them with our capital needs, self-funding model. With respect to the Bay Area, my general comment and Gene may want to say more about this is that the Bay Area is soft. There is no question that the Bay Area - after almost a decade of straight lineup has gotten pretty hit - pretty hard in this downturn. So I would say it is softer than LA in a big way and - but the good news is that there has been so much rental appreciation that even as these leases expire, we still in many cases are rolling them up to market, to market is just not as high as it would have been say a year ago.\nEugene Reilly: Yes Eric. The only thing I'd add on, San Francisco, agree with everything Hamid said and one thing to keep in mind vacancy is 6%-6.5% in the San Francisco Bay area. So it isn't as if you have weak conditions on top of a very high vacancy rate. So we're watching it and obviously the performance is very much disconnected with the - with LA, but fundamentally vacancies are not dead right now.\nHamid Moghadam: One other thing I would say about the Bay Area. I think the number is 10 million square feet, maybe 12 million square feet has been taken out of supply in the last five years or so, and that trend continues because we're competing land uses just gobble up industrial. So actually it's one of those markets where supply in the core Bay Area submarkets is actually going down. It's been converted to - life science has been converted to apartments, all kinds of other things.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Dilts: Occupancy globally saw a nice improvement in 4Q, but could you talk about what drove the strong rebound in ending occupancy in Asia specifically.\nHamid Moghadam: We got a new team in place in China that has been very aggressive in leasing space and the vast majority of our expect vacancy in China was our vacancy in the company in the spec basis was in China and we're addressing that. And the new team is doing a fabulous job.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Petersen with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Petersen: Yes Hamid, I was hoping maybe you pick up on what you were just talking about with the Bay Area and maybe just think more broadly I'm just looking at your top four markets in the U.S., Southern California, New York-New Jersey, Bay Area and Chicago, obviously places that through the pandemic have seen decent outflows of people into the Southeast so - I realize the supply is constrained in those markets. So I'm just thinking in terms of incremental investment going forward. I mean do we expect more investment in places like Dallas and Atlanta and Florida, places that are benefiting demographically or do you think you kind of expect things go back to how they were?\nHamid Moghadam: Look I think all of the markets that you mentioned were running so far above trend for a decade and that had created so many imbalances that I actually think it's pretty good to take a breather for some of those markets. No, I don't really think California's falling into the ocean. There are a lot of people in the middle of the country cheering for that, but it's not going to happen. I mean just look at the last quarter, you've had - look at the market cap that's been created in this area, it's probably more than it's been created in the decade in some of those markets. So, no, I don't think - so the numbers are actually pretty interesting if you look at the overall California numbers. I don't have them specifically for the Bay Area, but this year - and the way they measure it's a June 30, year-end, but in the year ended June 30, you had 260,000 people move out of California that compares to the year before like a more normal year about 230,000 people. So there is always this churning that happened but all of that is that 0.5% of the total population of California and you still have internal growth. So, California is still growing, it's just not growing at the same pace as it was before. And I think some of the outflows have to do with temporary work from home kind of situations. We don't expect all of those things to last forever, so you'll have some people coming back to California. I think, housing prices have moderated, certainly on the rental side. So, yeah, I think California's softer than it's been, but it's been on such a tear that it would have had to come to some kind of a moderation and it has.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Trust. Your line is open.\nKi Bin Kim: You've already touched on this, but maybe I can follow-up on it. Have your underwriting standards parameters have changed at all looking to 2021 and on the margin, where do you think it's definite versus the average industrial builder or buyer?\nHamid Moghadam: I think our underwriting has moved down with the required returns have moved down in the same direction as the weighted average cost of capital has moved down, I mean capital market returns are lower. So real estate returns are lower as well. What we really look at is relative value and in a lot of the situations, the way that the money coming into the industrial sector has created the situation where good assets and bad assets or not so great assets. The yield is compressing between the two and people just want to pick that industrial box. So a lot of those people also tend to be leveraged buyer is in which they can take better advantage of those lower rates. So, but the way we underwrite the assets in terms of quality and the ability of those assets to compete in the marketplace that has never changed. That's the primary filter, but obviously because of higher rents and lower cap rates pricing has changed.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Mueller: Looking at USLV and PELP U.S. ownership stakes is about 50% there. Do you see that gravitating down anytime soon?\nHamid Moghadam: In USLV is our venture with Norges actually they're both our ventures with Norges and our deal with them was that we would have - be 50/50 partners. And we have certain rights that sell down to 20% in one of those ventures and but no, we like it, it's been a good investment and we continue to hold it and we've got plenty of capital coming from other places - mostly disposition. So we haven't tapped that source for capital. It's there if we need it, but I don't think we're going to need it for quite some time. We can sell fund out of the non-strategic dispositions and also our contributions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nSumit Sharma: This is Sumit here in for Nick. So you've been recently doing a lot more analysis on labor shed debt as well as availability in some of new markets for example in Atlanta and some market seem to sell themselves like Inland Empire no one puts out flyer more than a page long. So I'm interested in understanding whether the labor shed or labor availability issue, is it back or is it in certain markets and if you could shed some light on what markets. Is it a problem in if it is?\nHamid Moghadam: I think labor shortage of labor is, you weren't coming through perfectly, clearly, but I think your question was, is labor continuing to be a constraint. The answer is yes, pretty much everywhere. And so, I was really surprised frankly when I heard from our large customers, I think back in April and May in the early stages of COVID relatively early stages of COVID. That labor continues to be the number one, number two and number three problem. I thought it would have moderated given the downturn and the unemployment rate. And the key in that calculus is quality of labor. So we've taken a lot of steps as you know with our community workforce initiatives to try to address that for our customers. But no matter how hard we work or how large that initiative get. It's not going to even begin to make a dent in the problem that we have. Are there geographical differences from place-to-place for sure, but those geographical differences have already adjusted. Because people don't put their warehouses in places where there is no labor whatsoever. They put it in places where there is labor but there just not as much labor as they would like. So they're all competing with one another and the turnover rate in that kind of labor is very high, it's about 40% a year. So people move for relatively small changes in compensation than environment and customers are paying more attention to environment and all those amenities that can really be more attractive to labor in addition to paying more.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Feldman: Thanks for taking a follow-up. We've seen some news on Prologis buying some urban land lately. I'm just curious, how should we think about multi-storey as composition of your 2021 development starts. And similarly with the rotation from REIT to REIT - bricks and mortar to e-commerce any additional thoughts from the research you put out on retail conversions and maybe that becoming a larger part of your 2021 development starts?\nHamid Moghadam: Well Jamie, I don't know what papers you're referring to. But we've been buying urban land in terms of covered land place for at least seven or eight years in a pretty steady basis. So we've been at this business for a long time and we're broadening it in certain markets, but now we've been after it for quite some time and it's not just in the U.S. also in Europe. We're buying those covered land place and those can be either leased as staging areas. You can get very good returns on those, while you wait for the market or rents or entitlements to convert them to industrial land. We don't have a multi-storey strategy specifically, we have an infill strategy and that infill strategy drives you to multi-storey in certain locations with certain land economics, but there is nothing in our business plan. That says thou shall build three multi-storey building this year. I mean and we were very opportunistic in that sense.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nEmmanuel Korchman: Tom earlier, I think you discuss 200 million square feet of incremental demand over the next few years? How much of that do you think can get taken care of by just innovation with existing boxes rejiggering, automation, more racking et cetera versus true incremental demand is going to lead to leasing from your end or others?\nHamid Moghadam: Actually, Chris is probably in a better position to answer that. We've done a lot of work around automation and modernizing space. So Chris why don't you talk to that?\nChris Caton: Yes sure, so the stat that Manny's referring to e-commerce specifically, we expect it will generate 150 million square feet perhaps more in the U.S. 200 million square feet likely more globally. Manny no, I don't think it's about efficiency and the introduction of technologies. I think this is about needing to strengthen supply chains over time. As it relates to specific to automation, the research we've done is to take a look at the productivity of assets, both - through the brick-and-mortar supply chain as well as the e-commerce, supply chain. We don't see a lot of change there. Instead, when we look at that incremental 200 million square feet going forward, I think you're going to see that focus on - Last Touch locations and city distribution locations, particularly in the world's global markets, those 24-hour cities. And as - Mike was referring to earlier, it couldn't be a lot of diversity in that customer mix. A lot of customers are starting to reassess how they want to go to market with e-commerce in 2021 and beyond, and I think you're going to see a lot of diversity there. So it's much more about bringing in new real estate requirements rather than introducing technology.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes, and if I can jump at the end of that. I didn't answer part of Jamie's question about retail conversions, once you have our latest thinking in that and Chris's paper. So I don't have a whole lot to add to that. I think you will see more headlines about that than actual space converted, but you will see some space converted. So, for a variety of reasons that you can read about in the paper.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. On the Liberty portfolio, originally you considered $3.5 billion of dispositions, now it looks like you're looking to sell about $1 billion, partially because you don't really need the proceeds. But can you just refresh with us how much of Liberty's original portfolio you considered non-core for the company going forward?\nHamid Moghadam: Yes, that view hasn't changed it's about $3.5 billion still. Of that $3.5 billion, if I remember correctly, about $700 million of it is not logistics and - well put it this way, it's an office - it's a suburban office, we sold some of that. The only thing that really remains on that front is the downtown Philly assets leased to Comcast. So the rest of the assets that are available for sale are just straight up industrial. And these assets would be considered in the top, I don't know 25% of most portfolios out there. It's just that they don't quite meet our standards. But they're perfectly fine assets and they're appreciating and as you've heard. I think Tom mentioned that even on the non-industrial ones we picked up 18% more value than we underwrote. So on industrial I think we're even going to do better than that. It's just no sense of - we could sell that at a really high price right now, but if the capital is sitting around not doing anything, we'll give a bunch of it back in terms of dilution. So we're going to be patient with that. John, that was the last question so again, everyone thank you for being on our call and we look forward to talking to you during the course of the coming quarter. Take care.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Eugene Reilly",
            "content": "Yes, Caitlin. This is Gene. I'll take that question. And you are breaking up a little bit, but I think you're talking about the development activity in the coming year. So this year, about 85% of what we're guiding to are main transactions. So, we have very few placeholders. And as Tom mentioned, we're 45% build-to-suit in the forecast and it is really difficult to forecast how that's going to play out. But if there is a bias, it probably is to the upside. But at this point, we're comfortable with the forecast. Thanks, Caitlin. You broke up a little bit there. But I think just how the - our bond process runs short-term we think. I think we're going to continue to see short-term leasing probably stay at elevated levels, just given the tightness of the market and the need for customers to act and move quickly as we get into 2021. I hope that addresses your question. Yes. This is Eugene. I'll take that. So, you are going to see and have seen for the past several years that our forecasted margins are quite a bit lower than our margins historically because these are underwritten margins. Now, we have been beating these margins for a variety of reasons, rent growth, cap rate compression. So I would expect and I think we'll retain this for a long time that you will see over time margins will normalize. But that really depends on what the future cap rate environment looks like. Yes. I just had a couple of things. I mean last year we had 300 matters go through Investment Committee. So it means that we look at a range of deal sizes and we look at every single deal. Every single deal, we will underwrite it, look at it. We are bit picky on quality that's an explanation. And we were - we execute when it makes sense for us, but I wouldn't read into this that we're uninterested. Yes Eric. The only thing I'd add on, San Francisco, agree with everything Hamid said and one thing to keep in mind vacancy is 6%-6.5% in the San Francisco Bay area. So it isn't as if you have weak conditions on top of a very high vacancy rate. So we're watching it and obviously the performance is very much disconnected with the - with LA, but fundamentally vacancies are not dead right now."

            "name": "Chris Caton",
            "content": "Hi, Nick. It's Chris here. Yes, we expect U.S. rent growth to be 5% in 2020 and a little bit better than 4% globally. In terms of the different product types, look, we highlighted a couple of geographies that we expect to outperform, for example, the UK and Northern Europe. And in United States, we've had a combination of the major Last Touch city distribution markets as well as some gateway distribution markets outperforming. I'm thinking New York, New Jersey, I'm thinking Toronto and Southern California. And they outperformed in 2020 and we expect them to outperform in 2021. Yes sure, so the stat that Manny's referring to e-commerce specifically, we expect it will generate 150 million square feet perhaps more in the U.S. 200 million square feet likely more globally. Manny no, I don't think it's about efficiency and the introduction of technologies. I think this is about needing to strengthen supply chains over time.

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Hamid Moghadam",
            "content": "Well, I think our private capital business continues to be undervalued by the street. All you got to do is look at the comps of publicly traded investment management firms and once you consider the fact that well over 90% of our assets are in infinite life vehicles and they generate significant promotes from time to time, and that our margins keep on increasing. I think that multiple should be in the low 20s. But I think most of the NAV models that I see are in the low teens or maybe even 10. So I think the street continues so undervalue that business. Would it be worth more if we crystallize that value in a trans - very specific transaction? Sure. But is it worth the headache on a company that has a $140 billion of assets to move around the value by $0.50 or bucket share? Probably not. So, we think there is upside to our NAV from our Investment Management business. Yes, let me start it then and then Mike can give you more color. But we think demand is pretty broad, I mean, sure e-commerce gets a lot of the headlines, because on the margin that is the source of new demand, but there is plenty of demand from other sectors that continues and forms a strong base. And within the e-commerce sector, of course Amazon is the biggest player, so they get a lot of play. But remember, Amazon is more in change of our total ABR and there are lots of other tenants that are doing well. In fact, I would say everybody is pretty much doing well with the exception of the uses that support hospitality like convention, exhibition, people and things of that nature. The rest of the market is pretty, pretty strong. Mike, you want to provide more color on that? Well, the only thing I can think of is that we deferred some starts immediately when COVID hit, because we didn't know what kind of environment we were in. But we've essentially restarted most if not all of those things and will be restarting them. So I think we just got that pushed out, but the volume that's behind it is very significant. So I would say the total level of stabilizations will be increased in the next couple of years beyond what it would have been and what our expectations would have been certainly at the beginning of COVID. But I would say even more than our expectations at the beginning of the year - beginning of last year prior to COVID. It could, but I think what's going on in New York and elsewhere is that there is a lot of price discovery, nobody really knows what the ability to pay is for some of these customers and in all of these locations, we underestimated the rental value. So at least for the time being, all the price discovery has been good and the other thing you should take into account is that in these infill locations, you've got to have a lot of developers, but you're not going to have a lot more land or buildings that can be rehabilitated. So I think you'll see it in terms of pressure on pricing of those assets, more than you would see on absolute supply because the supply is pretty inelastic aspects and will show up in price. So all of the above. Let me give you a quick answer and Gene will fill in the blanks. We are not good buyers of core real estate auction by a brokerage house where there are 55 people showing up at the margin, a lot of these people have to build up their industrial capability and everybody is trying to get into that business because the other property types don't offer very many opportunities. So, those kind of just looking it out on price, is not our business. So that means that building out our land bank, doing value-added acquisitions where we can bring our leasing and operational expertise to the table, deals that are Hairy, et cetera, et cetera, but general framework for looking at deals is returns, how we can differentiate and have a competitive advantage and also in the case of portfolio deals, what that fit is if we have to buy 100 buildings and sell 90 of them, that's probably not a very attractive transaction for us. So the other thing I would just mention is that you meant - you posed the question in a sense that we're only going after big deals. We do a lot of $5 million only deals too, they just don't show up. So we're there looking at pretty much everything that moves out there and we're there with offers on most if not all of the ones that meet our quality standards, but thankfully in a lot of those core situations, we lose. So we're good with that. We're on the selling side of the lot of those transactions as well. Yes, on the pace of sales, we mentioned with our need for capital - we're - depending on how you measure it 19%-20% levered. So we don't want to dilute ourselves and those assets are doing nothing other than appreciating. So we'll be - we'll take our time with respect to selling the industrial assets and we'll match them with our capital needs, self-funding model. With respect to the Bay Area, my general comment and Gene may want to say more about this is that the Bay Area is soft. There is no question that the Bay Area - after almost a decade of straight lineup has gotten pretty hit - pretty hard in this downturn. So I would say it is softer than LA in a big way and - but the good news is that there has been so much rental appreciation that even as these leases expire, we still in many cases are rolling them up to market, to market is just not as high as it would have been say a year ago. One other thing I would say about the Bay Area. I think the number is 10 million square feet, maybe 12 million square feet has been taken out of supply in the last five years or so, and that trend continues because we're competing land uses just gobble up industrial. So actually it's one of those markets where supply in the core Bay Area submarkets is actually going down. It's been converted to - life science has been converted to apartments, all kinds of other things. We got a new team in place in China that has been very aggressive in leasing space and the vast majority of our expect vacancy in China was our vacancy in the company in the spec basis was in China and we're addressing that. And the new team is doing a fabulous job. Look I think all of the markets that you mentioned were running so far above trend for a decade and that had created so many imbalances that I actually think it's pretty good to take a breather for some of those markets. No, I don't really think California's falling into the ocean. There are a lot of people in the middle of the country cheering for that, but it's not going to happen. I mean just look at the last quarter, you've had - look at the market cap that's been created in this area, it's probably more than it's been created in the decade in some of those markets. So, no, I don't think - so the numbers are actually pretty interesting if you look at the overall California numbers.

Because people don't put their warehouses in places where there is no labor whatsoever. They put it in places where there is labor but there just not as much labor as they would like. So they're all competing with one another and the turnover rate in that kind of labor is very high, it's about 40% a year. So people move for relatively small changes in compensation than environment and customers are paying more attention to environment and all those amenities that can really be more attractive to labor in addition to paying more. Well Jamie, I don't know what papers you're referring to. But we've been buying urban land in terms of covered land place for at least seven or eight years in a pretty steady basis. So we've been at this business for a long time and we're broadening it in certain markets, but now we've been after it for quite some time and it's not just in the U.S. also in Europe. We're buying those covered land place and those can be either leased as staging areas. You can get very good returns on those, while you wait for the market or rents or entitlements to convert them to industrial land. We don't have a multi-storey strategy specifically, we have an infill strategy and that infill strategy drives you to multi-storey in certain locations with certain land economics, but there is nothing in our business plan. That says thou shall build three multi-storey building this year. I mean and we were very opportunistic in that sense. Actually, Chris is probably in a better position to answer that. We've done a lot of work around automation and modernizing space. So Chris why don't you talk to that? Yes, and if I can jump at the end of that.

I think you will see more headlines about that than actual space converted, but you will see some space converted. So, for a variety of reasons that you can read about in the paper. Yes, that view hasn't changed it's about $3.5 billion still. Of that $3.5 billion, if I remember correctly, about $700 million of it is not logistics and - well put it this way, it's an office - it's a suburban office, we sold some of that.

            "name": "Thomas Olinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Tracy. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today. I want to begin by acknowledging our team and their great work this past year. In an incredibly challenging year, our accomplishments were significant and possible because of the work we've done over the last 10 years building the best-in-class portfolio that is critical to today's supply chain and centered on our customers. During the year we closed on $17 billion of M&A, further fortified our balance sheet with lower rates in line of maturities generated over $1.1 billion of free cash flow after dividends and importantly, continue to deliver sector-leading earnings growth. Since the merger in 2011, our earnings CAGR of 9.5% without promotes has outperformed the other logistics REITs by more than 350 basis points annually. This is the result of the unique business model which has consistently outperformed year-after-year. Turning to our view of the operating environment. Our proprietary data shows that the strong demand we experienced in the third quarter has continued, globally leases signed in the fourth quarter were a record 65 million square feet or more than 1 million square feet per business day. This was driven by new leasing, which rose 22% year-over-year on a size-adjusted basis. Broad range of customers signed new leases in the fourth quarter led by consumer products, food and beverage, electronics and health care segments. E-commerce activity accounted for 19.8% of new leasing. The need for speed and flexibility is also reflected in elevated short-term leasing which was up 58% in the quarter as 3PL, retail and transportation customers raised to secure space ahead of the holidays. Lease proposals remain at healthy levels. In the U.S., fourth quarter net absorption was the highest under record at 100 million square feet and in excess of new supply of 90 million square feet. Rents in our markets grew by 3.2% with all the growth coming in the back half of 2020, we anticipate rents to grow by approximately 5% in 2021. Houston is the only U.S. market on our watch list. As a reminder, we moved to Atlanta and Central Pennsylvania from our list in the second quarter. In 2021, we expect supply to decline year-on-year balanced with demand at 280 million square feet each. Conditions are also healthy in our other markets across the globe. In Europe, rents begin to rise in the fourth quarter and we expect 2.5% of additional growth in 2021, led by Northern Europe and the U.K. The implications of Brexit have been largely positive for us as we anticipated 4 years ago and Brexit was first announced. Inventory disaggregation will eventually lead to higher inventory levels in both the U.K. and the continent. We're watching new supply in Poland and Spain, but for context, these two markets account for just 1.7% of our share of NOI. In Tokyo and Osaka, historic high levels to supply are being met with very strong demand. Over two-third of the development pipeline is already pre-leased and we expect market vacancies to remain below 2%. For China, suppliers moderating even as the market remains soft. In our portfolio, we leased a record 10 million square feet in the second half of the year, a credit to the great work of our new China leadership team. Turning to valuations. Our logistics portfolio posted the largest sequential increase in a decade, rising 5% in the U.S. and globally and are now nearly 6% above pre-pandemic levels. Applying this increase to our $142 billion owned and managed portfolio, we estimate the value of our real estate rose by $7 billion in the fourth quarter. We expect continued fundamental improvement in 2021 and beyond, based on three drivers, first, a powerful economic recovery including the highest GDP growth in the U.S. in more than two decades. The combination of corporate and personal savings as well as significant governmental stimulus, is a loaded spring which will translate to significant economic growth in the back half as the vaccines continue to roll out. Second, the pandemic accelerates the retail revolution. The e-commerce penetration rate jumped 480 basis points to 20% of goods sold in the U.S. in 2020. Based on early reports, e-commerce holiday sales grew by at least 30%. While we expect the share of goods purchased online to grow further, a pause later this year would not surprise us, as consumers expand spending on services and experiences over goods. Our customers continue to plan for a long-term, retooling supply chains for increased, they should generate a cumulative incremental demand of 200 million square feet or more over the next several years. Third we expect higher inventory levels. Inventory to sales ratios remain near all-time lows. We believe that's had an impact on our customer space utilization as it ticked down to 83% in the fourth quarter. We see early signs of inventory restocking as containerized import volumes in the U.S. rose 24% in November and are on pace to set a quarterly record. Longer term, the need for more resilient supply chains will lead to higher inventory levels. We estimate that a 5% increase in inventory levels will produce incremental demand of nearly 300 million square feet in the U.S. alone. These changes will take years to play out, driving strong long-term demand. Turning to results, the work we've done to create the best-in-class portfolio, scale, and lowest cost structure in the industry is delivering exceptional financial results. 2020 core FFO excluding promotes grew by 14% and came in at the high end of our range at $3.58 per share. We also recognized record net promote income of $0.22 per share. Net effective rent change on rollover in the fourth quarter was 28% led by the U.S. at 32.1%, both high watermarks for the year. Our in-place to market rent spread now stands at 12.8%, up about 60 basis points sequentially. Collections continue to outpace 2019 level and as of this morning, we collected over 99% of fourth quarter rents and over 95% of January. Bad debt was 42 basis points for the quarter and 43 basis points for the year, both below our expectation. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 3% and led by the U.S. at 3.5%. We made a meaningful progress on the sale of non-strategic assets acquired from Liberty. We set all disputes related to the construction of the Philadelphia Four Seasons Hotel and the Comcast Technology Center. We completed the disposition of our 20% ownership interest in the hotel and the previously announced portfolio in the U.K. To date, we have sold more than $600 million of former Liberty assets, exceeding our underwritten value by more than 80%. We now have a less than $400 million of former Liberty non-logistics assets remaining consisting primarily of our interest in the Comcast headquarters. For strategic capital, our team raised $3.1 billion in 2020 with 40% from new investors we have yet to meet in person. Market and property tours as well as due diligence activities were all conducted virtually as our team capitalize on our early investments in digital infrastructure. Our balance sheet remains the best in the industry with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicle of more than $13 billion. Our capital markets activity in the quarter brought our total average interest rate down to 2%. We will look for additional opportunities to refinance at attractive rates. In fact, at current interest rates and our mix of currencies, we could issue 10-year debt at a blended all-in rate of 1%. Turning to our guidance for 2021, here are the key components on our share basis. We expect cash same-store NOI growth to range between 3.5% to 4.5%. We're estimating bad debt expense to range between 20 and 40 basis points of gross revenues and average occupancy for our operating portfolio to range between 95.5% and 96.5%. We expect a seasonal occupancy drop in the first quarter then trend higher as the year progresses. For strategic capital, we expect revenue excluding promotes to range between $435 million and $450 million. Promote revenue will be negligible in 2021. In fact we'll have net promote expenses of $0.02 per share for the year, which relates to the amortization of costs from prior period promotes. Our historic net promote income in average approximately 20 basis points for third-party AUM, which would be $0.06 to $0.07 of earnings per share based on current promotable AUM. Looking ahead, recent property appreciation leads us to expect net promote income per share in 2022 to be at or above this historic average. We expect to start between $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion in new development with 45% new leases and for stabilizations to range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Dispositions will range between $1 billion and $1.4 billion with the majority expected to close in the first half of 2021. We are forecasting net deployment uses of $350 million at the midpoint and as a result, our leverage remains effectively flat in 2021. Putting this altogether, we expect core FFO, including the $0.02 of net promote expense to range between $3.88 to $3.98 per share. Core FFO excluding promotes will range between $3.90 and $4 per share with year-over-year growth at the midpoint of more than 10% delivering another year of exceptional growth. We entered 2021 with optimism and confidence, our ability to deliver value for our customers beyond real estate using our unmatched purchasing power and significant investments in technology, innovation and data are significant competitive advantages that will drive further our performance. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Yes. The simplest way to look at it for same-store in 2021 is it's all driven primarily by rent change on roll. So think about 25% roll and - I'm sorry, 15% lease roll, and from a GAAP perspective, think about 25%-ish rent change on roll. And as you mentioned, occupancy and bad debt are pretty consistent, don't move much year-over-year, so that drives the GAAP same-store. From a cash perspective, think about that same 15%, we'll call it 12-ish percent rent change on roll, you're going to see bumps from around 3.25% on the portfolio in place and then you'll see a little bit of normal free rent out of that. But those components should get you right near the midpoint of our guidance. Sure, Jamie. I'll take a stab at that. I think the most significant near-term thing is going to be the infrastructure spending and that will have a positive effect on demand for our product. With respect to Buy U.S. first and all, we had that in the previous administration but if you actually look at the numbers, they don't support the newspaper headlines. So, we don't think there's going to be a material change in that because we haven't had any of that in the last four years either in. That was pretty much the same, same promoted policy. But the big drivers of our business is not necessarily economic policy. It's just the mix of consumption between bricks and mortar and e-commerce and the underlying growth rate of the economy, which should be very strong bouncing from a down year basically, and recovering all of that in 2021. So, we think those are the two big drivers. And economic policy will be affected a little bit around the edges but not the main driver. Actually I'm going to take that. It's pretty simple. People are running out of inventory because they haven't pre-positioned enough inventory in the system to support the level of activity. And remember, we need more inventory in the online channel than we do in the offline channel. And one of the big issues with inventories is that we can't get the containers back to China. And so, actually, we could support a much higher utilization and lower levels of stock-outs, but that's what's going on. Yes. That may be the case in terms of the math I've read. Europe is generally a more balanced market than the U.S. Demand and supply seem to move in sync together and generally vacancy rates are lower. The two exceptions are probably I would say, the big exception is Poland. And from time-to-time you get Spain sort of moving up to that volatile end of the market, but the rest of Europe is very well occupied. So it's really the volume of rollovers in Poland and Spain that drive that balance and occupancy on the margin. But throughout, our occupancies in Europe have been higher than the rest of our portfolio and in the U.S. anyway. Yes, Dave. I'll take both of those. On the first one, remember leases less than one year are excluded from our leasing metrics that's consistent of what we do across our - the agreement we have with our - the other logistics around metrics. So that is what's happening is if you're looking at turnover costs, it's the higher mix of new leasing versus renewals. We saw that in Q3, we saw in Q4 and that is what is driving turnover costs slightly higher this quarter and same story last quarter. And then regarding economics, I wouldn't look at - yeah, we did see space sizes under 100,000 square feet and it actually went up 100 basis points. But I wouldn't look at the other segments they are quite strong. I think that's just some activity that happened at quarter end and its noise and all segments are doing quite well."

            "content": "Yes, let's look at it in traditional leasing and in build-to-suits. On the leasing front their fourth quarter performance sort of normalized compared to typical Amazon numbers with us after a robust Amazon activity in quarters two and three. But the message there is, there's plenty of other companies' broad base that are driving traditional e-com leasing and I think that speaks to the philosophy going forward. And then on the build-to-suit side, yes, Amazon was very active. We did six build-to-suits with them in the quarter and call it 10 for the year out of 28. However, there was a ton of restructuring well underway with the home improvement folks, food and beverage, healthcare, well underway with restructuring pre COVID. Perhaps they took a couple of months pause during COVID but man they're coming back with a vengeance and marching forward with those restructurings. And so while we'll see plenty of Amazon, I am really encouraged the other uses. We just signed a big lease with Kraft about a month ago, and working with a ton of brand names next year, we'll be happy to talk more about."

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Also note, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward; Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Tracy, you may begin.\nTracy Ward: Thanks Carol, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly and Colleen McKeown are also here with us today. And with that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Tom. Tom, will you please begin?\nThomas Olinger: Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. Our third quarter results were strong and the team on the ground executed extremely well in this COVID environment, demonstrated by our operating performance and robust capital deployment activity. Our results plus continued improvement in market conditions have upgraded our outlook. Starting with our view of the market, our proprietary data reveals that operating conditions are meaningully better than they were 90 days ago and as a results our earnings are now ahead of pre-COVID levels. The Prologis IBI activity index rebounded sharply to more than 59 in September above our long-term average and up from 50 in June. Space utilization, which is based solely on data source from our customers was 84% at quarter end and indicates that our properties are returning to near key capacity. On a size adjusted basis, signings were up 31% in the third quarter and up 4% year-to-date. Customers continue to make decisions faster than ever of lease gestation less than 50 days. Proposals remain at healthy level up 3% sequentially and up 12% on a year-to-date basis. This positive momentum have led us to raise our market forecast for 2020. In the US, we now estimate net absorption of 210 million square feet and completions of 295 million square feet, each up approximately 50 million square feet from our prior forecast. Net absorption in the quarter was robust at 65 million square feet, pointing a very healthy finish to the year. We've also upgraded our yearend vacancy forecast for Europe and Japan to 4.3% and 1.3% respectively. Notably vacancy in Tokyo reached an all-time low of 50 basis points and rent growing as a result. As we look to space size demand broaden across segments this quarter to include a 100,000 million square feet and above. Spaces under 100,000 square feet in several markets notably the San Francisco Bay Area have lagged the other segment sizes in both occupancy and market rent growth. For customer segments, demand is also broadening and diversifying in our portfolio. E-commerce continues to grow, representing 37% of the new leasing in the quarter, well above its historical average of 21%. The dramatic structural shift to online shopping is generating demand in three ways. First, a wide range of Omni channel and pure online retailers are growing and while Amazon is very active particularly with build-a-suit, they represented just 13% of our new leasing. Second, three 3PLs represented more than a third of new e-commerce leasing in the quarter, a record of customers raise to augment their fulfillment networks and third, many of the parcel carriers are also expanding their networks. Our other segments represented 63% of new leasing the quarter, the most active segment support essential industries including food and beverage, healthcare and consumer products. Another new emerging structural drivers that lead for resilient supply chains and higher inventory levels, the inventory for sales is follow-on to the world [ph] on record and many customers are operating with a razor thin inventories. We see time for restocking process has begun. [indiscernible] our results, we had a strong third-quarter with core FFO per share of $0.97. We outperformed our forecast due to higher NOI, strategic capital revenue and termination fees partially offset by slightly higher G&A. Rent change on rollovers continues to be strong at 25.9% and led by the US at 30.7%. Rent collections remain ahead of 2019 levels. As of this morning we collected over 99% of third quarter rents and over 94% of October. In addition, we received 95% of deferred rents due to date. Net debt is trending lower than forecast and was 43 basis points of rental revenues in the quarter. This was roughly half of what we had forecasted. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 2.2% despite the impact of lower debt, occupancy and bad debt. This peaks to the underlying strength of our rent change, the primary driver of same store growth in quarter and the long-term. Looking to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain exceptional financial strength with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicle, totaling more than $13 billion. We also continue to refinance debt opportunistically setting records in the quarter for the lowest REIT and third lowest US investment grade 10 and third year coupons and history. For strategic capital, investor demand is unabated. Our team rights over $800 million of new equity this quarter and the cues in our open-ended vehicles currently stand at $2.6 billion. Turning to guidance for 2020, our outlook continues to improve given what we see in our proprietary data,, our customer dialogue and lower bad debt. While there may be headwinds until we put forward behind us our revised guidance range has taken that into account. Here are the key components of significant guidance changes on an odd share basis. We're narrowing our cash same-store NOI range between 2.75% and 3.25%. At the midpoint this assume a 25 basis point reduction of bad debt with a new range between 45 basis points and 55 basis points of gross revenues. Globally market rents grew in the quarter and we now expect growth of 2% for the year, approximately 250 basis point ahead of our prior forecast. After prioritizing occupancy for most of the year, we resumed pushing rent in a handful of leading markets including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Southern California, Dallas and Northern Europe, as well as a few regional markets. On the other hand, we're still striving for occupancy in Houston, Denver, West China and Madrid. Our in-place market rent spread now stands at over 12% and represents future incremental organic NOI growth potential of approximately $450 million annually. For strategic capital, we expect revenue excluding from a range between $380 million to $385 million. The revenue growth of our business has been excellent with a five-year revenue CAGR excluding promotes of over 16%. The vast majority of this revenue is derived from occurring asset management fees from our perpetual or life vehicles. When we look at multiples being ascribed to this business, our view is that they're far too low. The comparison public asset managers are valued at a multiple of more than 20 X on par less 50 AUM with much higher promotes. For development, we expect to start $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter with the full year ranging between $1.6 billion and $2 billion up $800 million from our prior forecast. Build a suites will remain elevated and comprise about 45% of the annual volume. In addition by year-end, we expect to restart about $180 million or approximately half of the development projects we suspended in the first quarter. At the midpoint, we're increasing both contributions and dispositions by $350 million. Based on our third quarter valuation and current market activity, pricing for our properties is now pushing well beyond pre-COVID levels. Taking these assumptions into account, we're narrowing our range and increasing our 2020 core FFO midpoint by $0.045 to $3.76 to $3.78 per share. This includes $0.21 of net promote income which is up a penny from our prior guidance. Year-to-date growth at the midpoint excluding promotes is 13.7% while keeping leverage flat. Interestingly, while there's been a lot of noise over the past seven months since the beginning of the pandemic, [indiscernible] were ahead of our pre-COVID earnings expectations. In clothing our performance is a assessment to the foundation we've been building for more than a decade. Our three-year earnings phase 11% has outperformed the other logistics REITs by more than 500 basis points annually, despite a greater relative decline in leverage. The work that we've done indicates the best-in-class portfolio and balance sheet is clearly paying off. The business is proving to be incredibly resilient and is delivering exceptional growth, which we expect to continue. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your question.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Emanual Korchman from Citigroup.\nManny Citigroup: Tom, just in terms of collections, they're obviously strong and they continue to be strong but there is a downward trend. Is there any [indiscernible] in those numbers that we should be mindful of or anything that you think might drive a quick recovery there than we're looking for?\nThomas Olinger: Manny, collections have been excellent. Actually there's no downward trend. If anything, they're trending up. If you looked at our collections, we're up over 94% this morning and we had a call in Q2 July collections were at 92%. So we're 200 basis points ahead of where we were comparably. We're ahead of 2019 levels across the board and I think collections are actually accelerating a bit from the last quarter, so I am very, very pleased with where collections are.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nDerek Johnston: So the lease spreads continue to be robust even as we progress through COVID '19. How do you view the pandemic's impact on the portfolio in terms of rent growth? So when you look at the overall portfolio, do you believe you could've pushed rents harder without the pandemic or has the pandemic perhaps propelled rent growth? And then lastly, do current rent trends have lagged in your opinion? Thank you.\nHamid Moghadam: Hi Derek, it's a good question and one that we ask ourselves often, but there is no going back and playing that hand again because when you're looking at -- you're sitting there in March and looking at what could happen, you make certain decisions. I think generally we could have push rents harder have we known how this was going to play out, of course we didn't. I think that its gas in the tank for the next 12 months. So I am pretty optimistic about our ability to continue to grow rents and we turn over 15%, 16% a year. So if we were a quarter or two late on pushing rents by a little bit, by the time you worked through that 15% and a little bit of rent growth change, the numbers become minuscule in terms of what we may have missed, but whatever that was I think is fueled for our future growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim from BMO. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kim: This quarter you had sequential occupancy declines of 200 basis points in both Chicago and Houston. I am assuming this is based on new supplies, but just wondering about the case and also other markets we're concerned from both supply sectors.\nEugene Reilly: It's Gene. I'll take that and others may pile on. Houston for sure is going to face headwinds. There's a ton of supply in that market and you guys know the story there. Chicago, we feel a little bit better about. Actually that market is fairly strong and elsewhere in the US from a supply perspective, things actually look pretty good. We have seen in this quarter a significant increase in absorption and a corresponding increase in supply in supply during a very low vacancy rates across the board. So we actually feel pretty good and in the US, Houston would be the concern on supply at this point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJamie Feldman: Thank you. Tom, you talked about $13 billion or so of liquidity. Can you help us understand just think through what if there is any opportunistic acquisitions out there where you might be able to put some of the capital to work over the midterm?\nThomas Olinger: I think we're \u2013 the key for us is for opportunity for expand our growth potential and when those things occur, target determined, but we're always ready. We always maintain significant liquidity. So when the time is right, we're ready to go, but we're certainly not seeing large portfolios on the markets these days. The pricing for our product is well above where we were pre-COVID. So there's a lot of interest for product.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nBlaine Heck: Tom, you noted that you guys are assuming parts of a little bit more than $1 billion that your share in the fourth quarter. Can you guys still talk about how much of those are built-a-suite versus spec and whether this is just pent-up demand from clients that didn't want to pull the trigger earlier in the pandemic or what else is kind of driving your confidence to start that much in the fourth quarter?\nThomas Olinger: I'll start with that question and I'll kick it over to Mike, but it's probably good to talk about spec development overall and with what our picture looks like. So it's more a reminder we suspended 16 projects in the spring in 18 markets and that was almost $400 million of activity and through last quarter and what we expect in the fourth quarter, we'll restart 10 of those projects and about half of that volume. So we're generally positive on speculative development. And if you look at the next quarter, we will start more spec projects somewhat less than we would've anticipated in January, but it's pretty close to those volumes. So we will be down slightly with respect to spec development during 2020 versus the January forecast. We're actually up significantly with respect to the build-a-suite value. So that's what coming. And Mike you provide some color on that.\nMike Curless: Yeah Blane, let me add to that. We saw a really strong Q3 in terms of build-a-suit particular in Europe with six project starts there across a diverse set of customers and our overall prospect list, you heard us say this last time, there is probably a little bit shorter than it\u2019s been in the past, but the prospects on that list are as active and moving as quickly as we've seen in a long time, in fact never seen in a quite at the pace. Of course Amazon is a big part of that, but it's certainly not all of it and there is quite a bit of activity in the structural changes that we announced by the home improvements, the food customers, pre-COVID that they're now acting on at a quicker pace than even anticipated. So we're confident in the diversity of our build-a-suite pipeline and the strength of it. So we're optimistic for the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from mongooses from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Sumit [ph] for Nick. Thank you guys for putting together some great research on the retail conversion opportunity. I guess I'm interested if you could share your insights regarding why the free standing retail component that guys you estimated 40 million square feet of conversions or 50 Bps to 150 Bps of your market share. Why is it so little when these are located in more densely traffic routes as well as are more supportive are most supportive parcel sizes. Since you did, I think one of the developments in the Bronx is built over a 2 acre lot which is far less than the 5 acres to 6 acres that is typically required. So shouldn\u2019t this support more conversions across other areas and obviously putting full conversions aside, what drives the convictions that tenants could actually lease up these boxes or other nonperforming shopping centers for smaller delivery operations? Any color, any insights in attendance would be great.\nChris Caton: Hey Sumit its Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. First for those who aren\u2019t familiar what you're talking about, moderately talking about Prologis Research published a paper on Prologis.com. We size the retail to logistics trend. We estimated it being 5 million to 10 million square feet per year over the next decade and this amounts to really a small part of our overall business, less than 5% of last touch, less than 1% of its existing logistics real estate facilities for a lot of reasons. So Sumit focused on the freestanding retail, that is in fact the largest category and so that is where we expect to see the most conversion opportunities. Well, if the challenges are many and varied in terms of conversion trends, whether it's physical and the ability simply view the site whether it's economic and land versus development cost and higher and better use opportunity, whether it's local politics or whether it's just the legal situation at the site.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah, the other thing I would add to that is that in freestanding retail by large is more western and southern phenomenon because by definition those cities are less spends and actually that's kind of not where you want to have freestanding and last touch retail you want to have it in dense metro areas and if somebody has got a retail box in that metro area, they're likely to be doing pretty well with retail on it anyway. So it's sort of a catch-22 that places where you can find these boxes are not the places that there is heavy duty last touch that demand. The trick is getting the availability and the demand picture in the same spot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the question. Just to build off the question on moving spread, you alluded to the fact that you sort of extended the trajectory into next year. I'm just wondering can you give us your updated thoughts on actual market rent growth and from the key areas in the US, but also maybe in some of the global markets, just wondering if all the factors you laid out as potentially accelerated that trend as well into '21 in terms of actual market growth. Thanks.\nHamid Moghadam: Hi Vikram, thanks for the question. So as Tom shared in his remarks, global rent growth is on pace for 2% this year of Prologis share basis, higher than that in the US, roughly flat in Europe and the US and better than that call it 1% in Japan, that's a good number for Japan. What that looks like in 2021, we don't disclose the numbers, but what I do think about other headwinds and tailwinds for our business and to an earlier question, these trends suggest an improving trajectory for rent growth. When I think about the positives for our business, I think about low vacancy in a lot of markets around the world, the structural drivers that Tom outlined in his script are really revealing themselves both e-commerce and inventory levels. We've seen positive momentum in the third quarter and solid proprietary data and there is this potential decline in COVID uncertainty COVID economic weakness. You got to say that against the lack of clarity on COVID and some of the challenges that are intended with the recession that will play out in 2021.\nThomas Olinger: Yeah but in terms of implications of rent growth on earnings, I mean basically rent growth globally this year is a little over 2% and probably 2.5% in the US, unless something really strange happens, I expect that number to be pointed up. Now how much up in the last 106 years we've always underestimated rental growth. So I don't know, but the primary driver of earnings growth is going mark-to-market anyway whether on the margin rents growth 3% or 4% or 5%, that incremental amount at least for the next year or two is going to be determined of earnings growth. So I'm not duck to your question. I'm just given that the kind of small changes we're talking about here, I don't think the earnings implications are significant.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks, just a quick question here, Tom, I guess you pretty much raised all the metrics in the press release with the exception of same-store NOI growth, but you took your bad debt expenses down again this quarter. Is the headwind here just some short-term issues on occupancy number one and then I guess it's a late development need to the extent that the e-commerce trend does continue and it looks like it's going to continue to go up towards probably the mid-20s. How long and sustainable do you think the development pipeline can stay over $2 billion, given the -- it seems like the growing demand pipeline you got from not just e-commerce but other categories that Tom mentioned.\nThomas Olinger: I'll take the first question. So with capital and cash same-store, it's lot at the midpoint at it's all timing because we have significantly high rates in both the second and third quarter and new leasing was significantly higher and as a result, what you're seeing is free rent from all of those lease commencement really hitting Q4. So that's a little bit of a danger of using cash same-store here is because of that free rent. It's just kind of hitting in Q4. You'll note that that same-store went up 25 basis points another bad debt. So it's really a timing issue from that initial drag on cash same-store.\nHamid Moghadam: I think with respect to the legs of e-commerce and the effects on development going forward, I would still say we're in the very early innings of that in the long term and I think as long as we're in COVID, the growth rate in e-commerce is going to be very, very significant, but as we come off of COVID, I expect that could take a little bit of a pause. It still would be at a very elevated level compared to where it was below COVID and it will start growing off of that elevated level. But I think it will pause, because I think a lot of people will just want to get out just somewhat back to normal, but in effect had a reset in the demographics that really have evolving e-commerce because the whole generation of people that before did everything analogs are now using digital. With the exception of wanting to get out in the short term and do some things that they miss filling, but if we could go back and figure out where e-commerce was before COVID and it's likely to grow off of post COVID I would guess there is an 8% or 9% maybe 10% change between those two levels pre and post COVID. So we got one in five maybe seven years of e-commerce penetration that will be sustainable as a result of COVID.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCaitlin Burrows: Just maybe on the customer retention pricing side, customer retention was 73% in the third quarter which is a low expense I think the end of 2018. So could you just about some of the drivers of that, whether tenants impacted by general economic uncertainty, customers moving from our stated results and some pushing price or what are some of the factors of that retention metric were in the third quarter?\nThomas Olinger: Let me take a stab at that Caitlin because that's are really interesting question. I think you\u2019ve heard many, many times from different people that this economic recovery is still occasional. There is the world of haves and the world of have-not and relatively literally in the middle compared to most other periods. While both of those things drive [ph] attention now, the companies that are doing really well and expanding their business need more space by definition against same space and lead to secure new space and the companies that are at the bottom of the K are going out of business or doing poorly, so they're going back of their space. So I think as long as you're divulging from the middle for some period in time, you'll see declining retention together with the fact that we're pushing rents more than we were in Q2, certainly Q2 now and that's likely to drive retention downwards, but having said all that as margins in our portfolio if of the billion square feet, once you go through how much of its quarterly turns, which is about 40 million feet one of the few retails can move that percentage around between 70% and 80% pretty significantly. So I don't get that excited quarter-to-quarter. I look at trailing fourth quarters as an indicator and if you look at that, our numbers have been forever, so anchored around 75% and little higher and little lower, but around that average.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Frankel from Green Street. Please go ahead.\nEric Frankel: Thank you. Just first, can you comment on China's portfolio? Simply obviously it's more part of your portfolio, there is obviously quite the opposite, it's quite different from the rest of your portfolio? And then second, that values are higher than were in the pre-COVID days, can you comment on the routine valuation between your larger global markets and the regional markets or whether you think there's a big valuation different at this point. Thank you.\nHamid Moghadam: Okay. Let me take a stab at both questions and Eugene may have more comments certainly on the second one. China occupancy is concentrated in Western China in Chengdu and [indiscernible] and then you know it shows the operating metrics in a big way but in terms of our share of that way pretty de minimis kind of number. Having said that, the way land allocations work in China is that it opens up they allocated by Thailand and the requirement value that you have to start construction in two years and that obviously does not allow development to be matched with demand fees because you have this sort of worst development starts that they impose on you for giving you that scarce plan. So that happened on a number of projects in Western China that we will had of course to start all at once and that one right into when China shut down and Western China is very auto centric. So the combination of all those things got a bunch of vacancy in Western China. It's about 70% of total spec vacancies in the whole company, but again the impact on our P&L has been relatively small given our interest, but we need to get a belief and we are going through a strategy of actually going for occupancy and be less rent sensitive because leases in China are very short in duration and we're going to get that back and we've seen exactly the same movie in years past in other regions in China. So we're pretty confident that it will not be an issue long-term. With respect to valuation differences, I can't think of a place in the world where valuation has not increased post-COVID. Now maybe there are individuals market-by-market differences, but in terms of US, Canada and Mexico, Brazil, China, Japan, Europe, Europe is probably the number one declining CapEx among the global locations and it has a direct relation to two things. One interest rates are at historic lows and everybody is pretty much concluded that they're going to be lower for longer and secondly the money that was otherwise being allocated to other sectors of real estate like retail and hospitality and office is actually not going there. So everybody has become a logistics aficionado, so a lot of that money. We're sort of seeing people show up that the number we saw before. So there are a lot more players on the device space and I think that's a pretty good thing if you own a billion square feet of this stuff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carroll: Can you provide some color on the tenants in those sectors that are currently being negatively impacted by the pandemic? Has Prologis already worked through both of these issues or should we continue to expect higher churn, lower retention over the next how many quarters, several quarters?\nHamid Moghadam: I think our retention is going to be between 70% and 80% likely it has been forever and there's always churn in the portfolio and the normal characters are probably concentrated in retailers and big box retailers are being dis-intermediated by e-commerce, but there are some retailers that are doing extremely well. Obviously there are home improvement sectors as Mike mentioned and the groceries and the like are doing pretty well and a lot of the ones that are doing sort of well but not super well are actually taking this opportunity to redo their networks and community lease space because they now realize that e-commerce is not a theoretical threat to them, but they better next time get going on this because what they expected to see happen over five or ten years has happened in the last six months. So I think, I'm not trying to duck your question, but you look at the list of the troubled retailers the Penny's and the [indiscernible] world and all that included the day portfolio, we have two of them that frankly been below my radar screen. They're still de minimis but our teams are very focused on moving and there are frankly many, cases those boxes are at least substantially below market. So we're happy to get them back and it's not an issue we usually look at.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: You talked a lot about accelerating e-commerce and inventory builds, but could you speak in a bit more detail as to how those trends are developing in each of the global regions where you operate?\nHamid Moghadam: I'm not sure what you mean by detail. I think we were pretty early and adamant that its inventory rebuilt. We went out and quantified at 5% to 10% and we gave you a projection of what that would mean in terms of incremental demand and the evident that's come into that time is pointing more to the high end of that range that it puts to the line of that range, that is a general trend, so it's expected more of less to affect our all markets evenly. The general people are carrying more inventory. The cost of carrying inventory is much lower because of the interest rates and the cost of making sales is very high. So people are generally carrying more inventory. With respect to e-commerce, I think they've been pretty specific about the percentages of sales that are going to go through the e-commerce channel and what the implications of that are on demand based on the 3X factor. So I think it can us through facts and apply to historical demand pictures in every market and cost of demand, but I don't think it's would be good for me to try to go through the markets we're in with the prediction that are not going to be correct anyway.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Petersen from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJon Petersen: Hoping you guys can maybe talk a little bit about expectations around the election specific maybe just high level if there is anything you're looking for that could impact your portfolio, but more specifically, California is a big market for you guys and Prop 15 would increase property taxes on commercial properties. So curious how we should be thinking about the impacts of that if it does. And there has also been talk about Biden [ph] getting rid of 1031 exchanges and just curious if you have any thoughts on what that would do to evaluations and transaction volumes for the warehouse space?\nEugene Reilly: Yeah it's Gene, I'll take the Prop 15 and probably take the other question Tom. So with respect to Prop 15 first of all, we've to see passes, the polling looks right now like it probably won't pass, but if it does, there are a few things to keep in mine. One it's going to take a couple of years for the individual county assessors to respond, mobilize and put it into action. The other thing is relative to Prologis, our average tax vintage is 2012. So we're in relatively better shape than for example local owners and of course this has passed through revenue to customers our real concern is taking care of our customers and we hope this doesn\u2019t pass. It's just another tax in California to these businesses. But bottom line is long-term not a big impact to us. Undeniably, there will be some effect on rent growth, but we got to see if this passes first. And on 1031, Tom will take that.\nThomas Olinger: Yeah I'll take that. 1031s are very embedded in real estate transactions. As I think it's been around for almost a 100 years, but I think there is reason why we think clearly manage in fact change does happen, I don't know the probability of that change, but if it does happen, we can manage it extremely well. The first thing is from a sales perspective, we've always thought we're going to be extremely patient. We're very under-levered, but frankly under-deployed a bit. We're getting back to probably Jamie's initial question and so we can be very, very patient on sales. And then the second thing would be our dividend payout ratios in the low 60%, close to 60% this year and we're generating about $1.1 billion of excess cash flow. So what would happen at the 1031 exchange? If eliminated right, our taxable income could go up to the extent we sold assets and capital gaining component of our dividend would increase and that would upward pressure on our dividend, but you can read that significantly well payout ratio and we're generating $1.1 billion free cash flow. So while we utilize it, we can certainly manage around it.\nHamid Moghadam: I think the bigger issue have been the two specific things you asked about is that California is becoming increasingly difficult place to do business in and it's not just these two things, but it's all the crazy propositions that are on the ballot this year and if you really want to be entertained you can read the ones that apply to San Francisco that are even funnier. But California better get it back together because otherwise they're going to kill the base and that is a concern for everybody. Having said that, it is the world's largest, the fifth largest economy and continues to be the center of innovation and a lot of adventure in the world. So we model through but sure the politicians they're making it very difficult for this economy to remain competitive. So that's much more concerning than our 1031 specifically at least to me.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Rodgers from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Rodgers: Tom, as we follow up on maybe those earlier comments that you made about the K shape recovery and that lower leg of the K that everyone's trying to figure out, is there a way you can give us straight-line rent right off that you've seen in the third quarter and year to date to kind of provide some color on that? And maybe just to follow-up on the deferral it think you said 95% have been paid to date. Can you give us a rundown just on the level of direction of the deferral that you think might maybe they were up a little bit in the third quarter versus second, but it may just be the way it's been quoted. So any color there would be helpful as well. Thank you.\nEugene Reilly: Sure Dave, thanks. So on your first one just regarding straight-line rents, those are netted down again termination fees. So when you see a termination fee, those are net of those. Listen it's termination fees are probably about where it's $3 million in the quarter if you looked over a long period of time. I don\u2019t have a precise number, but it's a straight line of that component of $1 million net of it. So it's calculated, we certainly take into consideration and the fact that calculation as well. Regarding deferrals, I've been very happy with deferral collection. So we build deferrals. To date are about $40 million of the deferrals, it's 61 basis points of annual growth rent. We've build two $20 million of that or half of its due. We collected 95% of that already. Most of that's 5% to collect is really in October, but it's trending very normally with prior months. So I'd expect the vast majority of all that to come in. Of the $40 of deferrals, we'll build a total of 80% of that this year. So we'll knock that out of the way. We've got about half of it collected already and we'll get another 30% by the time of the end of the year. So I think this should be wrapped up by the time we get to the end of the end of year. We'll have some of that evolving to '21 but if they're get taken care of and due to our stock feel very good about collections and very good about deferrals.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMike Mueller: If you look at upcoming development starts into 2021, are there any significant seismic and graphical devices to the pipeline?\nEugene Reilly: This is Gene. Let me start. Chris, you probably have something to add, it sounds like there really isn't Mike and in fact I think that's unique about the situation that we're in other than spaces under 100,000 square feet, which we generally don't develop much in that sector anyway, demand has been and it's becoming even more broad-based. So I really don't think there's any particular market. Our product I call out, obviously there's some very significant strength in the big-box sector and we're going to need to have demand, but I don't think the composition of the deals looks much different than for example they did last year. Chris?\nChris Caton: I'd say in Europe, France and Poland are going to be low on that list. It's been some places where I expect less trend line development and I think Japan is going to be busier given the strength of those markets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nTom Catherwood: Thank you. Tom, going back to your opening comments, you talked about rent growth and occupancy lagging in spaces under 100,000 square feet and then Gene you just mentioned that that is kind of broad-based demand center for certain tenants, but is the lagging occupancy and rent growth have to deal with the K-shape recovery because these tend to be smaller tenants in these smaller spaces or is it that companies are finding they could accomplish e-commerce fulfillment out of larger facilities that are close to but not directly in population centers?\nThomas Olinger: It's the former and frankly that smaller spaces have two kinds of tenants and they have big tenants in smaller spaces where they're more closer industry issues and those are just feeling fine and then there are smaller spaces, smaller businesses that are more vulnerable to this economic downturn and therefore there is more churn there. I expect that to and sort of the market getting better is because a lot of that churn took place in the early days and as the data that goes by, the survivors are surviving all the odds. So I expect that to decline. The problems in these small spaces and the small tenants the decline and at some point it will flip because during the aftermath of economic downturns, in the past business formations have really skyrocketed and I expect a lot of people that are either being laid off or moving their businesses will get back little bit. So that will come back but it may be a lag but things are relatively small spaces are just fine, no problem.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nCraig Mailman: Maybe just going back e-commerce and as it relates to maybe the US specifically, can you guys throw out what Amazon was and what the PL's were. I'm just kind of curious, as you run the data and see what you think expected demand incrementally would be from kind of that pull forward of e-commerce demand versus what you've already kind of put in the books or with the pipeline looks like, do you have a sense of maybe describe as a way to win that wave crest from a quarter perspective and then kind of hit the peak of that demand and then kind of trails off and how that is impacting potential development starts as you look out, not just for you guys the market clearly you guys are turning spec back on, I am just kind of curious if others are turning spec on in anticipation of this and how that could potentially impact that rent growth as the expectations that past '21 development deliveries would kind of really moderate if that may just not happen given kind of other dynamics going on.\nThomas Olinger: I think we're in the early stages of shipping earlier than mid stages of e-commerce to go up and I think what happened in the last several months is exactly five to seven years of growth. So I don't we're going to give any of that back. I think you going to plateau for a while as people go back to regular shopping and restaurants and uniting at home and all those things and then light backup at a more elevated level. So the big way to keep your eye on is that if the tsunami of e-commerce coming through. What happened to the ripples on top of that big wave frankly in which quarter, I have no idea honest and it varies market by market. But we don\u2019t run our business based on the ripples on top of the big wave. In terms of our dynamics in the marketplace that could make it difficult for the demand of that wave to be fulfilled, the answer is yes, the most desirable markets are the ones with the tightest land. The most difficult in finding large pieces of flat land that you can build these buildings that e-commerce player's demand etcetera, etcetera. So with every passing day, we're having more demand for that sector. Now it's elevated and it's stabilizing with a much higher level off of which it's going to continue to grow and it's showing up a lot of the land that there is short supply in the more desirable markets. So I think that's the positive trend.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Emanuel Korchman from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nManny Citigroup: I think I wanted to come to clearly your view on the asset management business, Tom had made a comment in the opening remarks about your business perpetual and preparing it relative to most of the asset managers in terms of how they're being valued versus how the business within Prologis is being valued? And I think you've shown tremendous amount of creativity in terms of structuring your enterprise leveraging a lot of different structures whether they're external managed entities, leasing funds and centralizing management with part of the compensation structure in that business. I guess are you thinking about taking one step further in somehow making this entity that are public or a private to highlight that value or do you view this just as within Prologis and we just hope the market would review the appropriate value.\nHamid Moghadam: Excellent question and let me just pile on to your question. I think there are two businesses, one is the development business and one of the investment management business, that I guarantee if I took the numbers of our development business and part of use for each family business and by the way, we have those numbers going back to year 2000 okay and show that to your home analyst at Citi, I bet you truly will value at 2.5 times book, with book to development business and a multiple that's more in the team. And if I did the same thing, the investment management business actually showed them the numbers, the trends in those numbers the permanent capital nature of most of those funds well over 90% and the stickiness of those and the promote history of those funds, I am willing to bet you that they\u2019ll put a 25 multiple on the pre-promote number and will give us the present value of the promotes on top of that and net of it is I think both of those businesses are valued at about 30% to 40% of what they should be. Now that leads to really under my spend and we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what you can do with sections all that kind of stuff. The government issues that come along with that are very difficult and complicated and painful, where do you develop, how do you change where it's done and frankly it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. It's $140 billion enterprise and whether it's couple billion dollars here and there in terms of incremental value, eventually people will get it and will give us credit for it. So I guess to answer your question in a very straightforward way, the latter statement that we make, we're trying to give enough the complexities are not worth, the incremental value that we may get in the short term. I'm sure we'll better do long time because the evidence it's becoming so indisputable that it's kind of actually meaningful at this moment more than annoying.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJamie Feldman: You were talking about upping your outlook for in the direction to 210 square feet and completions 290 million square feet. Can you just talk more about what you're seeing from taking on REIT competitors in terms of their appetite to speculative development and then also we have this delay in construction, but what does this all look like heading into '21 and given early read on what your supply-demand forecast were quite there?\nHamid Moghadam: The answer to your second question is yes. We have an idea whether it will, we will share with you on the next call when we provide guidance for 2021. With respect to non-REIT players, they continue to be by far but they just in aggregate sector of development have always been and will continue to be the better REITs as large as they may be. I don\u2019t know 20% of the business may be in the more relevant markets. So really the part of my case was vast majority of the 30s and I'd say yeah there is some undisciplined development in the private area, but I would say other than Poland, I can't really think of a crazy example of that. Maybe Houston, maybe Houston and Poland but by factor of five, it's Poland and maybe somewhere. And the reason for it is not that these private developers or public developers have forgotten how to build buildings or any less interest in building, and just really cost define the land being had on them to build the buildings of their size that the market demand to meet a lot of this virtually demand from the big day commerce.0 So I think it's just tough and so development levels are going to be muted because of the difficulties of navigating that. I mean advisory large pieces of land in the desirable markets and our belief that the West Coast and all that are initially three to four years on large pieces of land and you got to jump through all kinds of needs and complexities. So it becomes difficult to tie up with this piece of land to take it through their impediment process. We get a lot here a lot there and it's just difficult. So that's what I would say about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hamid, I think before you mentioned that there is a lot more people showing up at it relates to the transaction market. For Prologis' 2020 guidance it would increase I think now it's $750 million estimate point from $600 million originally and lower than that last quarter. So could we just talk about the current transaction market and how those two pieces wind up? It seems Prologis is more confident on your ability put in that commentary that there are a lot more players?\nHamid Moghadam: There are a lot more players and our acquisitions are not sort of the no brainer acquisition that are a race to who accepts the lowest IRR. Just to say that there are lesser business. We're not in that business. We show up that every one of those options to get people on that been going on but honestly that they're not buying a whole lot of clean perfect brochure quality. I think the pipeline market on some of those things that we've seen recently just beyond ridicule. I think most of our volume comes from more infill, more reposition plays, last touch plays, urban plays. So the stuff that the ratio of the cost of money to the level that we're compelling you towards level of effort and talent and customer relationships. So we know where our strengths are. If it's a race to who accepts the lowest IRR, that's not the business we're in. We leave it to the people who really like that business and there seem to be more and more of them every day. But we have great visibility and as you know you may remember that people always ask me about acquisition guidance and I say I'm $0 billion to $10 billion and we've exceeded the top end in the path and we've been zero at the time. We don\u2019t have a budget for acquisitions because it all depends on pricing and availability and quality of properties. You can make your acquisition guidance Q1 as we hear, but it would not be equivalent thing to do it. But when you get this close to the end of the year, you have visibility on really what's happening not only this year but through the middle of the fourth quarter next year and that's what's the recent confidence to increase those numbers. They're mostly high effort value-added types of things, not that passive and no brainer.\nHamid Moghadam: Caitlin, I think that was the last comment. So I want to thank everyone for attending our call and we look forward to meeting with you in the new year and sharing our 2021 guidance. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed concludes today's conference call. Thank you again for participating. You may now disconnect.",

We saw a really strong Q3 in terms of build-a-suit particular in Europe with six project starts there across a diverse set of customers and our overall prospect list, you heard us say this last time, there is probably a little bit shorter than it's been in the past, but the prospects on that list are as active and moving as quickly as we've seen in a long time, in fact never seen in a quite at the pace. Of course Amazon is a big part of that, but it's certainly not all of it and there is quite a bit of activity in the structural changes that we announced by the home improvements, the food customers, pre-COVID that they're now acting on at a quicker pace than even anticipated. So we're confident in the diversity of our build-a-suite pipeline and the strength of it. So we're optimistic for the fourth quarter."

Chicago, we feel a little bit better about. Actually that market is fairly strong and elsewhere in the US from a supply perspective, things actually look pretty good. We have seen in this quarter a significant increase in absorption and a corresponding increase in supply in supply during a very low vacancy rates across the board. So we actually feel pretty good and in the US, Houston would be the concern on supply at this point. Yeah it's Gene, I'll take the Prop 15 and probably take the other question Tom. So with respect to Prop 15 first of all, we've to see passes, the polling looks right now like it probably won't pass, but if it does, there are a few things to keep in mine.

First for those who aren't familiar what you're talking about, moderately talking about Prologis Research published a paper on Prologis.com. We size the retail to logistics trend. We estimated it being 5 million to 10 million square feet per year over the next decade and this amounts to really a small part of our overall business, less than 5% of last touch, less than 1% of its existing logistics real estate facilities for a lot of reasons. So Sumit focused on the freestanding retail, that is in fact the largest category and so that is where we expect to see the most conversion opportunities. Well, if the challenges are many and varied in terms of conversion trends, whether it's physical and the ability simply view the site whether it's economic and land versus development cost and higher and better use opportunity, whether it's local politics or whether it's just the legal situation at the site. I'd say in Europe, France and Poland are going to be low on that list.

I think generally we could have push rents harder have we known how this was going to play out, of course we didn't. I think that its gas in the tank for the next 12 months. So I am pretty optimistic about our ability to continue to grow rents and we turn over 15%, 16% a year. So if we were a quarter or two late on pushing rents by a little bit, by the time you worked through that 15% and a little bit of rent growth change, the numbers become minuscule in terms of what we may have missed, but whatever that was I think is fueled for our future growth. Yeah, the other thing I would add to that is that in freestanding retail by large is more western and southern phenomenon because by definition those cities are less spends and actually that's kind of not where you want to have freestanding and last touch retail you want to have it in dense metro areas and if somebody has got a retail box in that metro area, they're likely to be doing pretty well with retail on it anyway. So it's sort of a catch-22 that places where you can find these boxes are not the places that there is heavy duty last touch that demand. The trick is getting the availability and the demand picture in the same spot. Hi Vikram, thanks for the question. So as Tom shared in his remarks, global rent growth is on pace for 2% this year of Prologis share basis, higher than that in the US, roughly flat in Europe and the US and better than that call it 1% in Japan, that's a good number for Japan. What that looks like in 2021, we don't disclose the numbers, but what I do think about other headwinds and tailwinds for our business and to an earlier question, these trends suggest an improving trajectory for rent growth. When I think about the positives for our business, I think about low vacancy in a lot of markets around the world, the structural drivers that Tom outlined in his script are really revealing themselves both e-commerce and inventory levels. We've seen positive momentum in the third quarter and solid proprietary data and there is this potential decline in COVID uncertainty COVID economic weakness. You got to say that against the lack of clarity on COVID and some of the challenges that are intended with the recession that will play out in 2021. I think with respect to the legs of e-commerce and the effects on development going forward, I would still say we're in the very early innings of that in the long term and I think as long as we're in COVID, the growth rate in e-commerce is going to be very, very significant, but as we come off of COVID, I expect that could take a little bit of a pause. It still would be at a very elevated level compared to where it was below COVID and it will start growing off of that elevated level. But I think it will pause, because I think a lot of people will just want to get out just somewhat back to normal, but in effect had a reset in the demographics that really have evolving e-commerce because the whole generation of people that before did everything analogs are now using digital. With the exception of wanting to get out in the short term and do some things that they miss filling, but if we could go back and figure out where e-commerce was before COVID and it's likely to grow off of post COVID I would guess there is an 8% or 9% maybe 10% change between those two levels pre and post COVID. So we got one in five maybe seven years of e-commerce penetration that will be sustainable as a result of COVID. Okay. Let me take a stab at both questions and Eugene may have more comments certainly on the second one. China occupancy is concentrated in Western China in Chengdu and [indiscernible] and then you know it shows the operating metrics in a big way but in terms of our share of that way pretty de minimis kind of number. Having said that, the way land allocations work in China is that it opens up they allocated by Thailand and the requirement value that you have to start construction in two years and that obviously does not allow development to be matched with demand fees because you have this sort of worst development starts that they impose on you for giving you that scarce plan. So that happened on a number of projects in Western China that we will had of course to start all at once and that one right into when China shut down and Western China is very auto centric. So the combination of all those things got a bunch of vacancy in Western China. It's about 70% of total spec vacancies in the whole company, but again the impact on our P&L has been relatively small given our interest, but we need to get a belief and we are going through a strategy of actually going for occupancy and be less rent sensitive because leases in China are very short in duration and we're going to get that back and we've seen exactly the same movie in years past in other regions in China. So we're pretty confident that it will not be an issue long-term. With respect to valuation differences, I can't think of a place in the world where valuation has not increased post-COVID. Now maybe there are individuals market-by-market differences, but in terms of US, Canada and Mexico, Brazil, China, Japan, Europe, Europe is probably the number one declining CapEx among the global locations and it has a direct relation to two things. One interest rates are at historic lows and everybody is pretty much concluded that they're going to be lower for longer and secondly the money that was otherwise being allocated to other sectors of real estate like retail and hospitality and office is actually not going there. So everybody has become a logistics aficionado, so a lot of that money. We're sort of seeing people show up that the number we saw before. So there are a lot more players on the device space and I think that's a pretty good thing if you own a billion square feet of this stuff. I think our retention is going to be between 70% and 80% likely it has been forever and there's always churn in the portfolio and the normal characters are probably concentrated in retailers and big box retailers are being dis-intermediated by e-commerce, but there are some retailers that are doing extremely well. Obviously there are home improvement sectors as Mike mentioned and the groceries and the like are doing pretty well and a lot of the ones that are doing sort of well but not super well are actually taking this opportunity to redo their networks and community lease space because they now realize that e-commerce is not a theoretical threat to them, but they better next time get going on this because what they expected to see happen over five or ten years has happened in the last six months. So I think, I'm not trying to duck your question, but you look at the list of the troubled retailers the Penny's and the [indiscernible] world and all that included the day portfolio, we have two of them that frankly been below my radar screen. They're still de minimis but our teams are very focused on moving and there are frankly many, cases those boxes are at least substantially below market. So we're happy to get them back and it's not an issue we usually look at. I'm not sure what you mean by detail. I think we were pretty early and adamant that its inventory rebuilt. We went out and quantified at 5% to 10% and we gave you a projection of what that would mean in terms of incremental demand and the evident that's come into that time is pointing more to the high end of that range that it puts to the line of that range, that is a general trend, so it's expected more of less to affect our all markets evenly. The general people are carrying more inventory. The cost of carrying inventory is much lower because of the interest rates and the cost of making sales is very high. So people are generally carrying more inventory. With respect to e-commerce, I think they've been pretty specific about the percentages of sales that are going to go through the e-commerce channel and what the implications of that are on demand based on the 3X factor. So I think it can us through facts and apply to historical demand pictures in every market and cost of demand, but I don't think it's would be good for me to try to go through the markets we're in with the prediction that are not going to be correct anyway. I think the bigger issue have been the two specific things you asked about is that California is becoming increasingly difficult place to do business in and it's not just these two things, but it's all the crazy propositions that are on the ballot this year and if you really want to be entertained you can read the ones that apply to San Francisco that are even funnier. But California better get it back together because otherwise they're going to kill the base and that is a concern for everybody. Having said that, it is the world's largest, the fifth largest economy and continues to be the center of innovation and a lot of adventure in the world. So we model through but sure the politicians they're making it very difficult for this economy to remain competitive. So that's much more concerning than our 1031 specifically at least to me. Excellent question and let me just pile on to your question. I think there are two businesses, one is the development business and one of the investment management business, that I guarantee if I took the numbers of our development business and part of use for each family business and by the way, we have those numbers going back to year 2000 okay and show that to your home analyst at Citi, I bet you truly will value at 2.5 times book, with book to development business and a multiple that's more in the team. And if I did the same thing, the investment management business actually showed them the numbers, the trends in those numbers the permanent capital nature of most of those funds well over 90% and the stickiness of those and the promote history of those funds, I am willing to bet you that they'll put a 25 multiple on the pre-promote number and will give us the present value of the promotes on top of that and net of it is I think both of those businesses are valued at about 30% to 40% of what they should be. Now that leads to really under my spend and we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what you can do with sections all that kind of stuff. The government issues that come along with that are very difficult and complicated and painful, where do you develop, how do you change where it's done and frankly it doesn't matter anymore. It's $140 billion enterprise and whether it's couple billion dollars here and there in terms of incremental value, eventually people will get it and will give us credit for it. So I guess to answer your question in a very straightforward way, the latter statement that we make, we're trying to give enough the complexities are not worth, the incremental value that we may get in the short term. I'm sure we'll better do long time because the evidence it's becoming so indisputable that it's kind of actually meaningful at this moment more than annoying. The answer to your second question is yes. We have an idea whether it will, we will share with you on the next call when we provide guidance for 2021. With respect to non-REIT players, they continue to be by far but they just in aggregate sector of development have always been and will continue to be the better REITs as large as they may be. I don't know 20% of the business may be in the more relevant markets. So really the part of my case was vast majority of the 30s and I'd say yeah there is some undisciplined development in the private area, but I would say other than Poland, I can't really think of a crazy example of that. Maybe Houston, maybe Houston and Poland but by factor of five, it's Poland and maybe somewhere. And the reason for it is not that these private developers or public developers have forgotten how to build buildings or any less interest in building, and just really cost define the land being had on them to build the buildings of their size that the market demand to meet a lot of this virtually demand from the big day commerce.0 So I think it's just tough and so development levels are going to be muted because of the difficulties of navigating that. I mean advisory large pieces of land in the desirable markets and our belief that the West Coast and all that are initially three to four years on large pieces of land and you got to jump through all kinds of needs and complexities. So it becomes difficult to tie up with this piece of land to take it through their impediment process. We get a lot here a lot there and it's just difficult. So that's what I would say about it. There are a lot more players and our acquisitions are not sort of the no brainer acquisition that are a race to who accepts the lowest IRR. Just to say that there are lesser business. We're not in that business. We show up that every one of those options to get people on that been going on but honestly that they're not buying a whole lot of clean perfect brochure quality. I think the pipeline market on some of those things that we've seen recently just beyond ridicule. I think most of our volume comes from more infill, more reposition plays, last touch plays, urban plays. So the stuff that the ratio of the cost of money to the level that we're compelling you towards level of effort and talent and customer relationships. So we know where our strengths are. If it's a race to who accepts the lowest IRR, that's not the business we're in. We leave it to the people who really like that business and there seem to be more and more of them every day. But we have great visibility and as you know you may remember that people always ask me about acquisition guidance and I say I'm $0 billion to $10 billion and we've exceeded the top end in the path and we've been zero at the time. We don't have a budget for acquisitions because it all depends on pricing and availability and quality of properties. You can make your acquisition guidance Q1 as we hear, but it would not be equivalent thing to do it. But when you get this close to the end of the year, you have visibility on really what's happening not only this year but through the middle of the fourth quarter next year and that's what's the recent confidence to increase those numbers. They're mostly high effort value-added types of things, not that passive and no brainer. Caitlin, I think that was the last comment. So I want to thank everyone for attending our call and we look forward to meeting with you in the new year and sharing our 2021 guidance. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call today. Our third quarter results were strong and the team on the ground executed extremely well in this COVID environment, demonstrated by our operating performance and robust capital deployment activity. Our results plus continued improvement in market conditions have upgraded our outlook. Starting with our view of the market, our proprietary data reveals that operating conditions are meaningully better than they were 90 days ago and as a results our earnings are now ahead of pre-COVID levels. The Prologis IBI activity index rebounded sharply to more than 59 in September above our long-term average and up from 50 in June. Space utilization, which is based solely on data source from our customers was 84% at quarter end and indicates that our properties are returning to near key capacity. On a size adjusted basis, signings were up 31% in the third quarter and up 4% year-to-date. Customers continue to make decisions faster than ever of lease gestation less than 50 days. Proposals remain at healthy level up 3% sequentially and up 12% on a year-to-date basis. This positive momentum have led us to raise our market forecast for 2020. In the US, we now estimate net absorption of 210 million square feet and completions of 295 million square feet, each up approximately 50 million square feet from our prior forecast. Net absorption in the quarter was robust at 65 million square feet, pointing a very healthy finish to the year. We've also upgraded our yearend vacancy forecast for Europe and Japan to 4.3% and 1.3% respectively. Notably vacancy in Tokyo reached an all-time low of 50 basis points and rent growing as a result. As we look to space size demand broaden across segments this quarter to include a 100,000 million square feet and above. Spaces under 100,000 square feet in several markets notably the San Francisco Bay Area have lagged the other segment sizes in both occupancy and market rent growth. For customer segments, demand is also broadening and diversifying in our portfolio. E-commerce continues to grow, representing 37% of the new leasing in the quarter, well above its historical average of 21%. The dramatic structural shift to online shopping is generating demand in three ways. First, a wide range of Omni channel and pure online retailers are growing and while Amazon is very active particularly with build-a-suit, they represented just 13% of our new leasing. Second, three 3PLs represented more than a third of new e-commerce leasing in the quarter, a record of customers raise to augment their fulfillment networks and third, many of the parcel carriers are also expanding their networks. Our other segments represented 63% of new leasing the quarter, the most active segment support essential industries including food and beverage, healthcare and consumer products. Another new emerging structural drivers that lead for resilient supply chains and higher inventory levels, the inventory for sales is follow-on to the world [ph] on record and many customers are operating with a razor thin inventories. We see time for restocking process has begun. [indiscernible] our results, we had a strong third-quarter with core FFO per share of $0.97. We outperformed our forecast due to higher NOI, strategic capital revenue and termination fees partially offset by slightly higher G&A. Rent change on rollovers continues to be strong at 25.9% and led by the US at 30.7%. Rent collections remain ahead of 2019 levels. As of this morning we collected over 99% of third quarter rents and over 94% of October. In addition, we received 95% of deferred rents due to date. Net debt is trending lower than forecast and was 43 basis points of rental revenues in the quarter. This was roughly half of what we had forecasted. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 2.2% despite the impact of lower debt, occupancy and bad debt. This peaks to the underlying strength of our rent change, the primary driver of same store growth in quarter and the long-term. Looking to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain exceptional financial strength with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicle, totaling more than $13 billion. We also continue to refinance debt opportunistically setting records in the quarter for the lowest REIT and third lowest US investment grade 10 and third year coupons and history. For strategic capital, investor demand is unabated. Our team rights over $800 million of new equity this quarter and the cues in our open-ended vehicles currently stand at $2.6 billion. Turning to guidance for 2020, our outlook continues to improve given what we see in our proprietary data,, our customer dialogue and lower bad debt. While there may be headwinds until we put forward behind us our revised guidance range has taken that into account. Here are the key components of significant guidance changes on an odd share basis. We're narrowing our cash same-store NOI range between 2.75% and 3.25%. At the midpoint this assume a 25 basis point reduction of bad debt with a new range between 45 basis points and 55 basis points of gross revenues. Globally market rents grew in the quarter and we now expect growth of 2% for the year, approximately 250 basis point ahead of our prior forecast. After prioritizing occupancy for most of the year, we resumed pushing rent in a handful of leading markets including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Southern California, Dallas and Northern Europe, as well as a few regional markets. On the other hand, we're still striving for occupancy in Houston, Denver, West China and Madrid. Our in-place market rent spread now stands at over 12% and represents future incremental organic NOI growth potential of approximately $450 million annually. For strategic capital, we expect revenue excluding from a range between $380 million to $385 million. The revenue growth of our business has been excellent with a five-year revenue CAGR excluding promotes of over 16%. The vast majority of this revenue is derived from occurring asset management fees from our perpetual or life vehicles. When we look at multiples being ascribed to this business, our view is that they're far too low. The comparison public asset managers are valued at a multiple of more than 20 X on par less 50 AUM with much higher promotes. For development, we expect to start $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter with the full year ranging between $1.6 billion and $2 billion up $800 million from our prior forecast. Build a suites will remain elevated and comprise about 45% of the annual volume. In addition by year-end, we expect to restart about $180 million or approximately half of the development projects we suspended in the first quarter. At the midpoint, we're increasing both contributions and dispositions by $350 million. Based on our third quarter valuation and current market activity, pricing for our properties is now pushing well beyond pre-COVID levels. Taking these assumptions into account, we're narrowing our range and increasing our 2020 core FFO midpoint by $0.045 to $3.76 to $3.78 per share. This includes $0.21 of net promote income which is up a penny from our prior guidance. Year-to-date growth at the midpoint excluding promotes is 13.7% while keeping leverage flat. Interestingly, while there's been a lot of noise over the past seven months since the beginning of the pandemic, [indiscernible] were ahead of our pre-COVID earnings expectations. In clothing our performance is a assessment to the foundation we've been building for more than a decade. Our three-year earnings phase 11% has outperformed the other logistics REITs by more than 500 basis points annually, despite a greater relative decline in leverage. The work that we've done indicates the best-in-class portfolio and balance sheet is clearly paying off. The business is proving to be incredibly resilient and is delivering exceptional growth, which we expect to continue. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your question. Manny, collections have been excellent. Actually there's no downward trend. If anything, they're trending up. If you looked at our collections, we're up over 94% this morning and we had a call in Q2 July collections were at 92%. So we're 200 basis points ahead of where we were comparably. We're ahead of 2019 levels across the board and I think collections are actually accelerating a bit from the last quarter, so I am very, very pleased with where collections are. I think we're \u2013 the key for us is for opportunity for expand our growth potential and when those things occur, target determined, but we're always ready. We always maintain significant liquidity. So when the time is right, we're ready to go, but we're certainly not seeing large portfolios on the markets these days. The pricing for our product is well above where we were pre-COVID. So there's a lot of interest for product. I'll start with that question and I'll kick it over to Mike, but it's probably good to talk about spec development overall and with what our picture looks like. So it's more a reminder we suspended 16 projects in the spring in 18 markets and that was almost $400 million of activity and through last quarter and what we expect in the fourth quarter, we'll restart 10 of those projects and about half of that volume. So we're generally positive on speculative development. And if you look at the next quarter, we will start more spec projects somewhat less than we would've anticipated in January, but it's pretty close to those volumes. So we will be down slightly with respect to spec development during 2020 versus the January forecast. We're actually up significantly with respect to the build-a-suite value. So that's what coming. And Mike you provide some color on that. Yeah but in terms of implications of rent growth on earnings, I mean basically rent growth globally this year is a little over 2% and probably 2.5% in the US, unless something really strange happens, I expect that number to be pointed up. Now how much up in the last 106 years we've always underestimated rental growth. So I don't know, but the primary driver of earnings growth is going mark-to-market anyway whether on the margin rents growth 3% or 4% or 5%, that incremental amount at least for the next year or two is going to be determined of earnings growth. So I'm not duck to your question. I'm just given that the kind of small changes we're talking about here, I don't think the earnings implications are significant. I'll take the first question. So with capital and cash same-store, it's lot at the midpoint at it's all timing because we have significantly high rates in both the second and third quarter and new leasing was significantly higher and as a result, what you're seeing is free rent from all of those lease commencement really hitting Q4. So that's a little bit of a danger of using cash same-store here is because of that free rent. It's just kind of hitting in Q4. You'll note that that same-store went up 25 basis points another bad debt. So it's really a timing issue from that initial drag on cash same-store. Let me take a stab at that Caitlin because that's are really interesting question. I think you've heard many, many times from different people that this economic recovery is still occasional. There is the world of haves and the world of have-not and relatively literally in the middle compared to most other periods. While both of those things drive [ph] attention now, the companies that are doing really well and expanding their business need more space by definition against same space and lead to secure new space and the companies that are at the bottom of the K are going out of business or doing poorly, so they're going back of their space. So I think as long as you're divulging from the middle for some period in time, you'll see declining retention together with the fact that we're pushing rents more than we were in Q2, certainly Q2 now and that's likely to drive retention downwards, but having said all that as margins in our portfolio if of the billion square feet, once you go through how much of its quarterly turns, which is about 40 million feet one of the few retails can move that percentage around between 70% and 80% pretty significantly. So I don't get that excited quarter-to-quarter. I look at trailing fourth quarters as an indicator and if you look at that, our numbers have been forever, so anchored around 75% and little higher and little lower, but around that average. Yeah I'll take that. 1031s are very embedded in real estate transactions. As I think it's been around for almost a 100 years, but I think there is reason why we think clearly manage in fact change does happen, I don't know the probability of that change, but if it does happen, we can manage it extremely well. The first thing is from a sales perspective, we've always thought we're going to be extremely patient. We're very under-levered, but frankly under-deployed a bit. We're getting back to probably Jamie's initial question and so we can be very, very patient on sales. And then the second thing would be our dividend payout ratios in the low 60%, close to 60% this year and we're generating about $1.1 billion of excess cash flow. So what would happen at the 1031 exchange? If eliminated right, our taxable income could go up to the extent we sold assets and capital gaining component of our dividend would increase and that would upward pressure on our dividend, but you can read that significantly well payout ratio and we're generating $1.1 billion free cash flow. So while we utilize it, we can certainly manage around it. It's the former and frankly that smaller spaces have two kinds of tenants and they have big tenants in smaller spaces where they're more closer industry issues and those are just feeling fine and then there are smaller spaces, smaller businesses that are more vulnerable to this economic downturn and therefore there is more churn there. I expect that to and sort of the market getting better is because a lot of that churn took place in the early days and as the data that goes by, the survivors are surviving all the odds. So I expect that to decline. The problems in these small spaces and the small tenants the decline and at some point it will flip because during the aftermath of economic downturns, in the past business formations have really skyrocketed and I expect a lot of people that are either being laid off or moving their businesses will get back little bit. So that will come back but it may be a lag but things are relatively small spaces are just fine, no problem. I think we're in the early stages of shipping earlier than mid stages of e-commerce to go up and I think what happened in the last several months is exactly five to seven years of growth. So I don't we're going to give any of that back. I think you going to plateau for a while as people go back to regular shopping and restaurants and uniting at home and all those things and then light backup at a more elevated level. So the big way to keep your eye on is that if the tsunami of e-commerce coming through. What happened to the ripples on top of that big wave frankly in which quarter, I have no idea honest and it varies market by market. But we don't run our business based on the ripples on top of the big wave. In terms of our dynamics in the marketplace that could make it difficult for the demand of that wave to be fulfilled, the answer is yes, the most desirable markets are the ones with the tightest land. The most difficult in finding large pieces of flat land that you can build these buildings that e-commerce player's demand etcetera, etcetera. So with every passing day, we're having more demand for that sector. Now it's elevated and it's stabilizing with a much higher level off of which it's going to continue to grow and it's showing up a lot of the land that there is short supply in the more desirable markets. So I think that's the positive trend."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Also note, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin.\nTracy Ward: Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our second quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we'll hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly and Colleen McKeown are also with us today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. And Tom, will you please begin?\nThomas Olinger: Thanks, Tracy. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We hope you and yours are all well. The second quarter played out better than our expectations in terms of both our results for the period and outlook for 2020 and beyond. Leasing activity in our portfolio, market fundamentals, valuations and rent collections are all trending favorably. Starting with results, core FFO for the second quarter was $1.11 a share, which included $0.23 of net promote income. Core FFO, excluding promotes, came in above our forecast due to higher NOI and higher strategic capital revenues. The increase in NOI was driven by lower bad debt and higher occupancy. For comparison, the quarterly results were in line with our initial 2020 guidance that we provided back in January. Overall, rent collection trends are excellent. And as of yesterday, we've collected 98% and 92.1% of June [Technical Difficulty]. We've seen the pace of rent receipts accelerate each month since March, with collections ahead of 2019 levels for each month as well. As a result, our bad debt provision for the second quarter was 58 basis points of rental revenues versus our forecast of 160 basis points. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 2.9%, which included a 42 basis point negative impact from bad debt. Turning to leasing and customer activity, segments benefiting [Technical Difficulty] economy remain very strong and continue to represent about 60% of our customer base. Leasing in the quarter by industry was well diversified, including from non-essential industries. E-commerce normalized to 24% of new leases. You'll recall from the first quarter, that number was 40% in the early days of COVID. Negatively impacted segments include restaurants, hospitality, oil and gas and conventions. These segments represent just 1.7% of our annual rent. Over the last 30 days in our operating portfolio, we've signed leases amounting to [60.3] [ph] million square feet, up 24% year-over-year. Lease proposals have risen 21% year-over-year and lease gestation has declined by 14 days to 44 days. Market fundamentals were stronger than we expected in the quarter and we are now forecasting the following for the US in 2020. Completion to total 250 million square feet, a 4% year-over-year decline, net absorption to total 160 million square feet, a 60% increase from our April view but down 40% year-over-year and year-end vacancy of 5%. Our forecast for year-end vacancy rates in Europe and Japan have also improved now at 4.5% and 2%, respectively. Strong leasing activity in the quarter has moved the following markets off of our watchlist; Central PA, Phoenix bulk, Atlanta bulk and Guadalajara. Our watchlist includes Houston, West China, Spain and Poland, which moved back into the list this quarter due to extremely undisciplined spec development by one private developer in that country. For strategic capital, the promote for USLF came in above our guidance, as Q2 valuations were higher than our forecast. Investor demand for our private funds remains very strong. Year-to-date, we've raised more than $2.2 billion of equity, approximately 17% ahead of our pace in 2019, which was a record year. Our open-ended funds currently have equity cues totaling $1.8 billion, with an incremental $1.4 billion in due diligence. In Q2, a $448 million secondary trade in our health fund was made with nine investors at a slight premium to NAV, and $421 million will be redeemed in our USLF fund in July. Post these transactions, redemption cues for our open-ended funds will total just $10 million. Looking to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain exceptional financial strength with liquidity of $4.6 billion in combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicles at levels in line with current ratings, totaling over $13 billion. Turning to guidance for 2020. Our outlook has improved from last quarter, given what we see in our proprietary data, our customer dialogue and the pace of rent collections. While there may be some headwinds in the back half of the year related to the timing and nature of economies reopening, we believe that our revised guidance range has taken those factors into account. Here are the key components of our guidance on an our share basis. We are raising the midpoint by 50 basis points and narrowing the range of our cash same-store guidance to between 2.5% and 3.5%. This assumes a reduction of bad debt by 50 basis points with a range between 60 basis points and 90 basis points of gross revenues. This means at the midpoint we're forecasting to reserve about 110 basis points of bad debt in the second half of the year. To date, we've granted rent deferrals of 48 basis points of annual rental revenues and continue to expect that grants for the full year will be less than 90 basis points. We are increasing our expected average occupancy midpoint by 25 basis points and narrowing the range to between 95% and 95.5%. Occupancy was slipped slightly in the second half, so not as much as we guided to in April and end the year at a very healthy level. Globally, net effective rents declined by 1.4% in the quarter as a result of higher concessions, essentially giving back the growth from the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect rents to be roughly flat for the back half of the year. Our in-place-to-market rent spread now stands at 13% and represents future growth potential of over $450 million of annual NOI. We expect rent change on rollovers to be more than 20% in the second half of the year. For strategic capital, we expect revenue, excluding promotes, to increase by $15 million relative to our prior guidance, and now range between $360 million and $370 million. We're increasing our net promote income for the full year to $0.20 per share and we do not expect to earn any material promote revenue in the back half of the year. As a reminder, there will be a timing mismatch in the second half of the year, as we will recognize promote expenses of about $0.03 per share. We are forecasting a G&A range of $265 million to $275 million, down $5 million from our prior forecast. Our outlook for capital deployment has improved significantly since April, and we now expect to start $100 million of new spec in the second half. Our revised starts range is $800 million to $1.2 billion for the full year, with build-to-suits comprising 65% of this volume. In addition to this range, we plan to resume construction on $150 million of projects that were previously suspended. We are currently negotiating leases on roughly 40% of the TEI of these suspended projects. At the midpoint, we're increasing acquisitions by $100 million, contributions by $150 million and dispositions by $400 million. We are now projecting net uses of capital to be $100 million at the midpoint. Taking these assumptions into account, we're increasing our 2020 core FFO midpoint by $0.125 and narrowing the range to $3.70 per share to $3.75 per share, including $0.20 of net promote income. This compares to our original guidance midpoint at the beginning of the year of $3.71 a share. Year-over-year growth at the midpoint, excluding promotes of sector-leading at over 12.5%, while keeping leverage flat. Our three-year CAGR has been 10.5%, outperforming the other logistics REITs by more than 500 basis points annually. We continue to maintain significant dividend coverage of 1.6 times, and our 2020 guidance implies a payout ratio in the mid-60% range and free cash flow after dividends of $1 billion. Looking forward, the long-term growth outlook of our business has strengthened. Our investments in data and technology provide us with the tools to identify pockets of risk and opportunity within our markets and portfolio, a significant competitive advantage. I want to repeat some comments at the beginning because I'm not sure my sound was coming through. So, I just want to repeat our results for the quarter. Core FFO for the second quarter was a $0.11 a share, which included $0.23 of promote income. Core FFO, excluding promotes, came in above our forecast due to higher NOI and higher strategic capital revenues. The increase in NOI was driven by lower bad debt and higher occupancy. For comparison, the quarter results were in line with our initial 2020 guidance that we provided back in January. Overall, rent collection trends are excellent and as of yesterday, we have collected 98% and 92.1% of our June and July rents, respectively. We have seen the pace of rent receipts accelerate each month since March, with collections ahead of 2019 levels for each month as well. As a result, our bad debt provision for the second quarter was 58 basis points of rental revenues versus our forecast of 150 -- 160 basis points. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 2.9%, which included a 42 basis point negative impact from bad debt. Turning to leasing and customer activity segments benefiting from COVID economy remain very strong and continue to represent about 60% of our customer base. Leasing in the quarter by industry was well diversified, including from non-essential industries. E-commerce normalized at 24% of new leases. You'll recall from the first quarter, that number was 40% in the early days of COVID. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jason for your questions\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Good morning, Tom. Thanks for repeating some of that. I just wanted to circle back on just kind of the leasing activity. I know in the supplemental, you guys provide leases commenced and not leases actually signed in the quarter. Is there any -- and you did provide a little bit about the leasing activity in the last 30 days. But could you maybe just help us the actual leasing activity in perspective in Q2? How much of that was impacted and how does that maybe change month to month to get to that [16] [ph] million square foot number for the last 30 days? And then could you just also comment on the drop in occupancy in Asia? Thanks.\nThomas Olinger: Okay. I'll start with that. So from a leasing perspective, we certainly saw leasing activity picked up materially in June. June was a very high month. And as I mentioned in the last 30 days, we've certainly seen our leasing accelerate. As it relates to occupancy in Asia, it's related primarily to China and small spaces under 100,000 square feet.\nOperator: Your next question is -- my apologies. Go ahead.\nThomas Olinger: Next question, please.\nOperator: Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nCraig Mailman: Hey guys. Just a quick question on kind of what activity you're seeing big box or small box. I know there were some concern earlier post COVID. Just curious, I know you guys took Phoenix and Atlanta big bulk off. I mean, are you guys seeing better activity across the board or is it still kind of primarily in some of the bigger spaces?\nEugene Reilly: Yeah, this is Gene. I'll take that one. We are certainly seeing better activity with bigger spaces and that is where the -- has led to taking those markets off the list. And conversely, small spaces have struggled. We see more softness in this category. And this is -- these are segments that we're focused on. But having said that, our property quality is excellent in those segments and we'll expect recovery. But right now, you certainly see better activity in the bulk spaces.\nThomas Olinger: Okay. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open.\nKi Bin Kim: So a couple of questions. The higher leasing proposals that you've seen over the past 30 days, I think you said 21% higher. I'm just trying to get a sense of, is that mostly renewal activity for expansionary space? And second question, when you mentioned all the positive leasing stats and you obviously increased your guidance for same-store NOI and build-to-suit activity. But if there are one or two things that you really looked at to give you confidence midway through the year to increase guidance, how much of it was based on customer feedback and the confidence your corporate customers are seeing versus hard metrics like leasing stats?\nThomas Olinger: Yes. Let me -- let me start by answering that question. Obviously, we're having some difficulties here with our conference operator. Yeah, the activity accelerated obviously in the month of June and it's pretty broad based. And I think, for the best indication of that, you can look at our build-to-suit volume because it's up substantially in terms of percentage and absolute amount. And that tells you something about the scarcity of space out there because that's what people will have to turn to get their spacing needs met. So Mike, do you want to -- you want to elaborate on that somewhat?\nMike Curless: Yeah. We're seeing broad-based activity, everybody. If you believed all the hype you saw there, you would think it's all Amazon. But Amazon clearly is ramping up their activity, but we're seeing definite broad-based activity across a lot of sectors. Home improvements picked up. Appliance business is strong and actually seen quite a bit of activity from the food crowd on our build-to-suit list. Then you got to remember is there's been plenty of structural rollouts that were announced and well underway pre-COVID. And so it's not just Amazon. They are a big part of it, but look, for a lot of broad-based demand and keep that build-to-suit list strong.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nSumit Sharma: Hi. This is Sumit here for Nick. Just a quick question actually, following up on the build-to-suit. So there was, I think 100% of the pipeline this quarter was build-to-suit with a 48% margin. What's so special about these development spec that they are so accretive to the margin and there is such a wide spread between the development cap rate and the stabilized sort of market cap rate that would one -- one would anticipate? And secondly, as a follow-up, just thinking about promotes. I know that fourth quarter has something coming up from Brazil, a core fund in Europe and the USLV. So, what's driving the lower expectations on promote income for those?\nMike Curless: Sumit, it's Mike. I'll hit the first one on the higher than normal build-to-suit margins. You're looking at a small sample that said, there are a couple of deals there that were more of the parking lot, leased parking lot flavor. And those tend to be very well located, have relatively low incremental investments, paired up with strong rents. Therefore, you see really strong margins, but I would look for those margins to blend in well over the year and normalized to the overall build-to-suit body of work in the mid 20s. Tom, you want to deal with the other one?\nThomas Olinger: Yeah. Sumit, on your second question on promotes in the second half, it's going to be lower, really small because the promotes are effectively just based on development. There is very little AUM in those funds. That is promote eligible in the second half. And remember, we've got $0.03 of promote expenses that will also will be incurring in the second half of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nDerek Johnston: Hi, everybody. Thank you. Has COVID induced e-commerce acceleration pulled demand forward in your view? And secondly, where are we in the shifting secular landscape? Does it feel like we're mid to early late innings? Just would love your take. Thanks.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah, I think this is more like the Borg-McEnroe match back in the late '70s. We don't know how many innings are in this game. We keep going into overtime. And I think we're very early in the rollout of e-commerce. E-commerce started the year in the low teens in the US. The numbers vary in different places. And there is no telling how far it can go. If it goes to 20% to 25%, which is where it was at the beginning early stages of COVID or stabilizes higher than that, this could be very, very early in the e-commerce rollout. And initially, obviously, we've had a clear market leader, which is Amazon in excess of 40% of the total volume, but we are seeing breadth in terms of different e-tailers that are now growing their businesses and have founded their footing. So, I think we're in very early stages and as you know, e-commerce has a sort of a supercharged effect on logistics' demand.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nManny Korchman: Hi, everyone. There's been, I guess, a rebounding concern in supply coming up. So two questions related to that. One, what are you seeing in terms of our conversion of use, whether that be retail properties or maybe even office properties and some anecdotal stuff that we've seen? And secondly, are all developers being of this point of view and trying to keep their build-to-suit volumes high and their spec volumes lower? Are we running the risk that we're going to see a lot more spec not from Prologis, but from your competitors or peers?\nEugene Reilly: Yeah. Let me take the second part of that first. The places that we see undisciplined development are few. Poland is clearly one and I would say Houston is seeing more buildings than they should. I mean there's more product coming online in Houston than the demand warrants. But generally, I would not say there is an older building problem or anywhere near it. And if you look at the numbers that I think Tom talked about at 250 million square feet, that's about the normal run rate for construction. And it's actually a little bit down from our forecast at the beginning of the year. So, I think this year demand will fall short of that level of construction, but it's not because the supply is excessive. It's because demand temporarily will take a dip. And in my view, we'll accelerate as we come out of this thing because of the growing percentage of e-commerce and also the need to carry more inventories. With respect to the first part of your question, could you ask that again because I'm kind of a little unclear about it, oh, conversions, conversions. Look, there is a lot of talk about it and I think in time, you will see conversion, particularly of retail. And -- but there are obstacles and we should talk about those obstacles. Number one, a box in the middle of the shopping center is subject to all kinds of reciprocal easement agreements, and it's not really easy to go back and just redevelop one box. Obviously, those boxes are in the right locations because they are in the middle of dense populations and high levels of income. So the locations are good, but there are internal dynamics that make it difficult to do that. So you have to respect the REAs and all the other arrangements. Also zoning is an issue because you need to convert from retail to industrial zoning and that takes longer than you can imagine because neighborhoods don't want trucks and traffic there. And finally, there is an economic issue where these retail boxes are in somebody's books for several hundred dollars of square foot, and you need a number much lower than that to make sense for logistics because you need to also spend money to convert them to logistics uses. It's not like that they're set up that way. So, I think in time, you'll see more and more of this kind of development, but it's not a surge. And I think we are involved in a number of them, but it's tougher and it takes longer than you can imagine. The stuff that you hear about hotel rooms or offices being temporarily used for logistics, we've seen that before during the holiday season when things get really crazy. But those are really for last touch distribution purposes. They're not really permanent space because economically, they're not viable for long-term logistics use.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the question. Just two questions. One, could you give a bit more color on kind of how market rent growth may have trended month over that -- over the last few months and particularly in the US versus global? And then second, if you can give us a little bit more color on kind of utilization of the cost of capital that you now have, which -- there may have been questions few months ago, but today it's pretty robust. So I'm just wondering, can you give us a little bit more color between utilizing that for development acquisitions and maybe even M&A?\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. Thank you, Vikram. So two questions. With respect to market rents in the US, I think the best way to think about them is that we are basically on the same track were before, but with a pause and interruption. In other words, I would say in this era of COVID, the growth hasn't continued. I believe they will flatten for the balance of this year just like our guidance suggests. And then we'll pick up on the path of growth. And the reason I believe that is because there has never been a cycle growing into it or going into it. We've had high occupancies, vacancy being under 5%, and also very high utilization rate in the mid 80s. And there is no sign that those numbers are in anyway deteriorating. So, I think the market continues to be strong and I think it will be back on a trajectory of rental growth, not too dissimilar with -- from what we were projecting at beginning of the year. With respect to use of capital, I continue to believe that there is relatively little differentiation between different companies. So M&A is usually pretty tough. I mean, we've done it successfully in a couple of instances, but increasingly the targets are less and less compatible with our portfolio in terms of quality. And also, there is a pretty -- the companies are trading right on top of each other in terms of multiples. Don't ask me to explain that because the growth rates, at least, historically been substantially different. But I don't make the market react to it. The place that is always the best use of capital for us is building out our land bank because we already have the land and the incremental returns on capital are the most attractive, particularly with the kind of margins that we were talking about earlier and Mike referred to now. That's a pretty disciplined business. You can't do an infinite amount of that kind of development, but that's the first place we would go to. On straight acquisition of assets, look, I'd just like to -- I said last quarter, I don't think pricing of logistics real estate is going to soften. In fact, I think cap rates are going to compress because there is a lot of capital that's placed to go into real estate and obviously, there are sectors that are not going to attract their fair share capital like they did before. So that capital is piling in the few sectors that are performing well. So, I think the best use of capital is building out our land bank.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. You talked about leasing volume being healthy, sounds like it's picking up. But you also discussed the dip in occupancy in the second half of the year. Is this an indication that you're looking to push rents over occupancy? Is it greater downtime from bad debt expense or this -- or are there other factors that contribute to this?\nEugene Reilly: Yeah, John. It's Gene. I'll take that one. I wouldn't -- I wouldn't draw a conclusion from the next two quarters forecast on our optimism about the demand. Demand has been good. As we mentioned at the outset and have, about 60% of our portfolio, customers are expanding, but some are shrinking. So it's a balanced view for the rest of the year. And the reality is that until we come out of COVID and we see economies reopening, we won't have complete clarity. So, I would actually point to later in the year 2021, we're going to come out of this. And I think as Hamid said a few moments ago, I think you'll see a continuation of the rent growth. But until there is clarity on reopening, there has to be -- you have to have a balanced view.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. And the only other thing I would add to that is at the beginning of the year, we're forecasting essentially 260 million feet of demand and supply, and now we're projecting 250 million feet of demand and -- sorry, supply, and 160 million square feet of demand, which is down from our original forecast. So if you forecast 90 million square feet of demand, obviously, you have to go along with a pause in rental growth. So that sort of outlook is consistent both between demand and the rental picture that goes along with it. But when we come out of this thing, I think for reasons we've described before, namely an increase in inventory generally 5% to 10% and also the stabilizing share of e-commerce of the higher level than before will actually lead to a surge in demand, which will make up, in my view, more than the 90 million feet we lost or we project to lose this year. But nobody knows, I mean, these are all our best guesses.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJon Petersen: Great. Thank you. Good quarter, guys. I was -- first of all, hoping you could update us on how IPT and LPT are doing versus underwriting. But then also was curious with both those transactions, it greatly increased your exposure to the US. How are you thinking right now considering international markets seem to be getting back on their feet quicker than the US on exposure to the US versus exposure to international markets?\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. International is a big spectrum. And on one side of it, you have places like Poland, which is suffering from overbuilding. You have Spain, which has weakened demand and then you have places on the other end of the spectrum that you would never get. Tokyo is under 1% vacancy. Osaka where the vacancy was in the teens is now in the 5% range, and we're leasing up pretty much everything we are building ahead of schedule. So obviously, there is a wide variety overseas. But if you sort of throw all of the overseas markets together, I would say generally, they are a tad slower than the US, but not materially so. And Gene may have more granular comments on that, but very consistent actually in terms of -- in terms of market strength.\nEugene Reilly: Yeah. And you asked Jon about underwriting -- and we're actually a little bit ahead of underwriting on both of those portfolios, even through then what we've seen in the last few months. And we'll revisit that at the end of the year. But things are looking good. Obviously, for Liberty, the Houston exposure is going to be challenging for a bit. But on the other hand, Pennsylvania portfolio, which is the biggest piece of it, has actually done quite well, leading us, by the way, to bring Central Pennsylvania [indiscernible] a lot to us, so a little bit ahead of plan so far.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. I was hoping to get your thoughts on two points. Number one is, I know you mentioned what the -- this year's development pipeline looks like or deliveries look like. Can you give some color on what things look like heading into '21, given that there was this pullback in starts? And then also just given that you did increase guidance, just thinking about the lingering risks ahead, whether it's the election, PPP subsidies burning off, cases rising in other markets. Like what gave you comfort to get more positive here even though there are some things lingering out there?\nHamid Moghadam: Customer behavior in short. Jamie, Gene is going to give you the real answer, but the short answer is customer behavior. We don't make the market. We just observe what happens on a real-time basis. But, Gene, go ahead and talk about the details.\nEugene Reilly: Yeah. I mean, specifically, Jamie, we're adding sort of a net of $250 million of spec to the plan. We're still way below the January forecast, and those are like 15 projects in 15 different markets. So, there are bets that are being placed based on the customer demand in those markets. And I wouldn't be surprised if that number increases. You also asked about what happens going into 2021. I think we'll wait to see what happens before we talk about 2021, but we obviously have a much more confident view on building spec today than we did in April.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers from Baird. Your line is open.\nDave Rodgers: Yeah. Good morning out there. And just -- was thinking about your portfolio as you've moved more infill with respect to maybe service-oriented customers versus distribution-oriented customers. Wanted to kind of think about how those conversations are going with those customers and are you guys still targeting rents from the end of the year and they're accepting that? Is there a big differential between what they're anticipating in rents and what you are? So that's the first question. The second is just for cap rate compression, do we need to get past the point of increasing vacancies? Do we need to see rents grow again before we see that materially happen? Or is the debt side of the equation enough to make that happen? Thank you.\nHamid Moghadam: Dave, let me just start, and Gene will give you more details. On cap rate compression, we are already seeing it, particularly in Europe. And there is plenty of transaction evidence that those cap rates are holding and in some cases declining. And by the way that's in sync generally with our valuations that have been held flat and remember valuations are backwards looking. I mean if they were -- if they had the evidence of the last month of transactions, I think those values would be up. With respect to distribution of space, as we've said many times, Prologis operates in all four categories of space, whether it's last touch, all the way to gateway cities, the larger spaces in major markets. And that distribution is pretty balanced. And in fact, we have a paper out there that's not too out of date, that shows exactly what our portion is in each category. So, we haven't really materially changed our allocation to different markets. It's just that we get more questions about the last such markets these days than we did before. The old -- and this strategy was very much large markets than infill locations. So, that's where that portion of the portfolio in general is coming from, which is getting a lot of attention these days. Gene, do you want to elaborate on that?\nEugene Reilly: Yeah. The only thing I'd add is, you asked specifically about rent growth in infill locations. And to date, we have certainly seen much more, much higher rent growth in these locations. And as you can imagine, there is a bit of market pricing discovery going on because these are submarkets that generally are immature for this kind of use and the product types basically span a huge range. But so far those -- the growth in rents has actually surprised us to the upside.\nHamid Moghadam: One other thought that I will just join there, you've heard us talk about this many times, but logistics rents are only 2% to 5%, call it or give it a wide range of total logistic costs and the rest being made by labor and transportation. So really the ability to pay for the customer is not the issue because even if they paid 20% more rent on an item that's 4% of their total logistics costs, that's 80 basis points more in costs. So that's not what drives it. What drives really rental growth is how anxious is your best next competitor in terms of dropping out rents. That's what determines this, not the customers' ability to pay rent. And generally speaking, when you're operating at around 5% vacancy, which is where we are, there aren't that many competing spaces around. So, we continue to do -- we continue to have pricing power generally in most markets. Obviously, the Houston's of the worlds are different.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nBlaine Heck: Great. Thanks. Good morning out there. So just a couple of questions here on rent collections and same-store. I think you gave rent collection figures for June that might be excluding deferred rents. If that's the case, can you give us the June and second quarter collection numbers based on the cash that's come in relative to kind of your pre-COVID billing expectations? And then secondly, you guys have reported strong rent collection results relative to a lot of REITs out there. But it just seems to me like the amount of uncollected cash rents, it's still a pretty tangible headwind then for you guys to still post 3% cash same-store in the face of that headwind is very impressive, frankly. So maybe you can reconcile how cash same-store can be 2.9% with even a few percentage points of uncollected cash rents. That would be really helpful.\nThomas Olinger: Okay, Blaine. So on the rent collection, as I'll restate, so in June, we collected 98%. In July, we collected 92.1%. We deferred about 195 basis points of rent in June and about 70 basis points of rent in July. So that rents not due. So it's not in those numbers of those collections numbers. Now our collections, as I stated, are doing extremely well. We're ahead of last year since March. Every month, we're ahead of schedule. Now, we believe we are going to collect all the cash with the exception of what we think we've covered in a bad debt reserve. So, we've assessed. We've gone through -- we've assessed industries, we've assessed space sizes. We've looked at all the different metrics. We've looked at individual customers across our portfolio and we feel really good about that bad debt range of 60 basis points to 90 basis points. Now it's lower than we had projected in April, for sure, meaningfully lower, but it's because of the collections are so strong. And if -- I would anchor back also to the fact that our bad debt history on average is about 20 basis points. If you go back 14 years, 15 years, we've averaged 20 basis points of bad debt. Now, our high was 56 basis points in the GFC, and that's kind of what we saw here in Q2. So, I think we've got the second half bad debt adequately covered in the range probably and then some. And I feel good about getting the rest of this cash in the door.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC. Your line is open.\nMichael Carroll: Yeah. Thanks. Gene, I wanted to dig in a bit -- individual market trends that you highlighted. Can you provide some color on what drove the improvement in Central PA? Is it just better demand? And then also with the issues that you're seeing in Houston, is that simply just supply in a weak energy market? And are developers slowing down construction activities? So it's just going to take time to absorb that space or are these longer-term issues that we have to deal with?\nEugene Reilly: Yeah. So in Pennsylvania, it's all leasing. So the improvement is related to leasing. In Houston, you have obviously two headwinds in demand. You've got energy pricing as well as COVID. And you have a huge amount of construction in progress at the beginning of this year. Now, some of that was suspended. But frankly, the vast majority was not. So, you're going to have an overhang of space in Houston easily going into next year some time, because there's just so much supply. In terms of developers being disciplined or not, I think, frankly, the jury is out on that. Right now, things appear to be disciplined. But I would have hoped frankly that we would have seen more projects stopped. We didn't see that. So I think we -- I think we need to monitor that aspect of it, but unfortunately in Houston, you have a supply issue as well as the demand issue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Frankel from Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.\nEric Frankel: Thank you. Just to talk about e-commerce again. Obviously, Amazon has been quite active. And Mike, you commented on some of the longer, longstanding supply chain reconfiguration efforts by home improvement -- home improvement companies, appliance companies, food and beverage. Could you talk about how some of the big box retailers are adjusting to because they obviously had a huge surge in e-commerce sales. I'm just curious if they've adjusted there or they looking to adjust their warehouse footprints at all?\nMike Curless: Yes, Eric. Thank you. We are seeing activity from those retailers, not at the pace we're seeing from the traditional e-commerce, but we certainly have on our prospect list some household names that you would consider in the retail business that are looking to shift from brick and mortar and to more warehouse to consumer shipments. So, we're definitely seeing an uptick in that segment.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. Home improvement and grocery sectors are particularly strong.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Your line is open.\nTom Catherwood: Thank you and good morning. I just wanted to actually follow on Eric's question about retail and specifically from the bricks and mortar side. Since 2011, obviously, you've reduced your exposure to lower growth industries. But I assume no one is immune to the pain that's happening in brick and mortar retail. So first off, I know it's a small number, but can you remind us what your exposure is to brick and mortar retailers, especially on the apparel side? And then second, is there a risk that challengers could show up for some of your other tenants like 3PLs that have retail exposure of their own, almost like shadow retail exposure for Prologis?\nChris Caton: Hey. This is Chris. Thanks for the question. So first, as it relates to apparel specifically, that is roughly 7% of our customer base and there is going to be both native e-commerce and traditional brick and mortar retailers in there. So, you're going to have a diversity. Our approach, our analysis looks through the organization. So whether it's a retailer, whether it's a 3PL, so we think through that exposure just like you described in. So the way we've been talking about it for the whole decade has been consistent with how you're thinking about risk.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMike Mueller: Yeah. Hi. Are there any changes to the lease durations for the bumps that you've been getting in recent leasing activity?\nHamid Moghadam: Not materially. Mike, not materially. Right before this thing, the lease durations had extended, probably the longest we've seen in about a decade. But -- and basically leases that are of term has stayed about the same level of duration. While we have higher month-to-month leases and that is pretty typical of what happens in this part of the cycle where normally somebody who's business was growing may be coming out of a smaller space going to the bigger space or going the other way frankly. But moving is expensive and committing to a new space is expensive. So, sometimes the best solution is just to basically pay overage rent and kick it out couple of months. So, we have a higher percentage of leases under one year. But the ones that go longer than a year are about the same profile as they were before. And with respect to escalation structures, pretty much consistent with before, slightly more free rent on the front end, which is how the effective rent comes down. I think Tom mentioned that the effective rents were down 1.7%. Face rents haven't changed all that much in most markets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nSumit Sharma: Hi, guys. Sumit here again. Thank you for taking my question again. So Walmart is closed on Thanksgiving, and that goes to assume that they are expecting more online sales traffic. Layering in Prologis' US portfolio and thinking about it from a infill perspective, how does that manifest in terms of increased rent growth for those properties? What I'm thinking of is not your properties off of Tracy or Exit 8 New York City, but more kind of stuff that you have in, let's say, the Meadowlands in New York City or Bronx. When you're underwriting these properties, what's the sort of rent growth you're putting in today? And how does situations on the grounds like what we are hearing with Walmart and other retailers change your view?\nHamid Moghadam: The thing I would say about Walmart specifically is that, obviously, we had them in one property in the Bronx. And as you probably have read in the headlines, they no longer needed that property because of what you described and we were able to re-lease it with no interruption to another major e-commerce player at actually very attractive economics. So that's the only direct impact that I can see from Walmart if your question is specific to Walmart. And they didn't have much of a presence in the New York area anyway too, for it to be a headwind. So, they were just really getting started. They had tried for many years to get into that market, but it had proven to be a difficult market to get into. And it appeared for a while that e-commerce was the way they were going to come into the market and apparently, they've changed their mind. I don't know if your question was broader than Walmart. But that's the story with Walmart.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manny Korchman from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nMichael Bilerman: Hi. It's Michael Bilerman with Manny. Hamid, at the November Investor Day, one of the topics the team has spent a lot of time focused on was trying to have value beyond the real estate and really trying to find solutions to a lot of the supply chain costs that would essentially allow you to be able to garner more rent. So looking at transportation, digital data solutions, looking at labor costs and trying to find opportunities for your tenants to reduce those costs and ergo allow them to pay you more rent. And I think you talked a little bit earlier before about how rent is a smaller part of the overall cost structure. Therefore, if we're able to get benefits from all those other items, we should be allowed to charge more rent. Where do you sort of stand? And have you been able to advance any of these initiatives further, ultimately getting to that, I think it was like a $150 million of potential upside over time as you implemented these things?\nHamid Moghadam: Sure, Michael. I'm glad you brought that up because that's a very important part of what we are spending time on. And I'll let Gary give you the real answer. But from my vantage point, our performance there has been mixed. So with respect to the things that are going very well, I would say our LED initiative, our procurement initiatives, our services and our product offerings that go with the use of warehouse are going pretty well and are generally on track. The more aspirational aspects of our product offerings, transportation, IoT, I would say those are too early to have a result. On the labor front, we're actually making really good progress as well. So it's a mixed picture. COVID has also obviously interrupted our ability to market some of those services to our customers. They are frankly focused on other problems right now. But we come up with new products to offer to them in this time, like deep-cleaning services and other things that we rolled out were specifically targeted towards COVID. And so I would say, our enthusiasm for that business is the same or stronger than it was before and I would say materially stronger than before. Our execution of it has been pretty good in some areas and has been interrupted by COVID in some other areas, but we haven't changed our objectives in the medium term on that. Gary, do you want to provide more color there?\nGary Anderson: Yeah, just a little bit. Michael, if you remember, we had shown a bull's eye at our Investor Day. And the kind of the bull's eye is the area that we were currently focused. Those are the areas that Hamid was talking about. In that period that we've gotten some pretty good traction. So -- and growing revenues there, it's not huge. [Technical Difficulty] delayed for transportation and IoT and we believe that those are little bit longer term. In [indiscernible], I think we're more optimistic about essentials, then we would leave it at that point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from SunTrust. Your line is open.\nKi Bin Kim: So if I remember correctly, when you guys bought Liberty and IPT, it was part of the original plan to sell off assets. And you've done a lot of it already, but I believe 2021 was supposed to be a kind of material year for dispositions. Any update to those plans?\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah, Ki Bin, if you remember in the last call and actually the call before that, we pushed that back. We are very under deployed right now. Our leverage is under 20%. And so there is no rush whatsoever to sell those properties. If you do a little bit of poking around, you pretty quickly figure out that we've got a pretty significant portfolio from IPT -- from Liberty for sale in the UK. And that one, we are in the process of collecting letters of interest and offers. And I would tell you that demand for that product is triple or quadruple what we expected. And I think we're going to have a very strong execution on that. But on the rest of it, we're not -- we haven't even put out the packages because why do it? We don't need to do it right now and we can adjust a bit. That's very liquid real estate and we can do that anytime and our decision is to push that out until we have more deployment and meet the capital frankly more.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJon Petersen: Great. Just a quick one. I know we are top on the hour here. Any chance you guys could break out rent collection between Europe and the US? Asia is smaller, but maybe there too. I'm just curious if there is any material difference between those markets.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. We actually look at that on a daily basis and, obviously, even more detail than what you just asked. We look at it by country, and we can have the ability to actually drill it down by market. So obviously, we're always focused on collections. But I would say we are a lot more focused on collections in the last four months or five months. And we have very good data on that. I would say there are two countries that stand out as collections being materially lower than elsewhere. And those are France and the UK. And part of it is that the government has gone out there and basically said, you don't have to pay your rents. And so a lot of people are -- and a lot of very healthy companies, I mean, household names are just choosing not to pay the rent for now. But their ultimate collection of those numbers, of those rents are not subject to those regulations. And we believe we'll collect the vast majority of them. But if you take those two markets out, Asia is on the other side, we have no deferrals or no late payments almost or no defaults to speak up in Asia. So if you throw it all in the blend there, the numbers are very comparable between the US. They are within a couple of 100 basis points between the US and the rest of the world. And with the two that I mentioned being the meaningful deviations. I think that was the last question. So, really want to thank you for your participation. Sorry about all the logistical glitches today, but that's the world we live in. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Take care.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call.

            "name": "Mike Curless",
            "content": "Yeah. We're seeing broad-based activity, everybody. If you believed all the hype you saw there, you would think it's all Amazon. But Amazon clearly is ramping up their activity, but we're seeing definite broad-based activity across a lot of sectors. Home improvements picked up. Appliance business is strong and actually seen quite a bit of activity from the food crowd on our build-to-suit list. Then you got to remember is there's been plenty of structural rollouts that were announced and well underway pre-COVID. And so it's not just Amazon. They are a big part of it, but look, for a lot of broad-based demand and keep that build-to-suit list strong. Sumit, it's Mike. I'll hit the first one on the higher than normal build-to-suit margins. You're looking at a small sample that said, there are a couple of deals there that were more of the parking lot, leased parking lot flavor. And those tend to be very well located, have relatively low incremental investments, paired up with strong rents. Therefore, you see really strong margins, but I would look for those margins to blend in well over the year and normalized to the overall build-to-suit body of work in the mid 20s. Tom, you want to deal with the other one? Yes, Eric. Thank you. We are seeing activity from those retailers, not at the pace we're seeing from the traditional e-commerce, but we certainly have on our prospect list some household names that you would consider in the retail business that are looking to shift from brick and mortar and to more warehouse to consumer shipments. So, we're definitely seeing an uptick in that segment."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Eugene Reilly",
            "content": "Yeah, this is Gene. I'll take that one. We are certainly seeing better activity with bigger spaces and that is where the -- has led to taking those markets off the list. And conversely, small spaces have struggled. We see more softness in this category. And this is -- these are segments that we're focused on. But having said that, our property quality is excellent in those segments and we'll expect recovery. But right now, you certainly see better activity in the bulk spaces. Yeah. Let me take the second part of that first. The places that we see undisciplined development are few. Poland is clearly one and I would say Houston is seeing more buildings than they should. I mean there's more product coming online in Houston than the demand warrants. But generally, I would not say there is an older building problem or anywhere near it. And if you look at the numbers that I think Tom talked about at 250 million square feet, that's about the normal run rate for construction. And it's actually a little bit down from our forecast at the beginning of the year. So, I think this year demand will fall short of that level of construction, but it's not because the supply is excessive. It's because demand temporarily will take a dip. And in my view, we'll accelerate as we come out of this thing because of the growing percentage of e-commerce and also the need to carry more inventories. With respect to the first part of your question, could you ask that again because I'm kind of a little unclear about it, oh, conversions, conversions. Look, there is a lot of talk about it and I think in time, you will see conversion, particularly of retail. And -- but there are obstacles and we should talk about those obstacles. Number one, a box in the middle of the shopping center is subject to all kinds of reciprocal easement agreements, and it's not really easy to go back and just redevelop one box. Obviously, those boxes are in the right locations because they are in the middle of dense populations and high levels of income. So the locations are good, but there are internal dynamics that make it difficult to do that. So you have to respect the REAs and all the other arrangements. Also zoning is an issue because you need to convert from retail to industrial zoning and that takes longer than you can imagine because neighborhoods don't want trucks and traffic there. And finally, there is an economic issue where these retail boxes are in somebody's books for several hundred dollars of square foot, and you need a number much lower than that to make sense for logistics because you need to also spend money to convert them to logistics uses. It's not like that they're set up that way. So, I think in time, you'll see more and more of this kind of development, but it's not a surge. And I think we are involved in a number of them, but it's tougher and it takes longer than you can imagine. The stuff that you hear about hotel rooms or offices being temporarily used for logistics, we've seen that before during the holiday season when things get really crazy. But those are really for last touch distribution purposes. They're not really permanent space because economically, they're not viable for long-term logistics use. Yeah, John. It's Gene. I'll take that one. I wouldn't -- I wouldn't draw a conclusion from the next two quarters forecast on our optimism about the demand. Demand has been good. As we mentioned at the outset and have, about 60% of our portfolio, customers are expanding, but some are shrinking. So it's a balanced view for the rest of the year. And the reality is that until we come out of COVID and we see economies reopening, we won't have complete clarity. So, I would actually point to later in the year 2021, we're going to come out of this. And I think as Hamid said a few moments ago, I think you'll see a continuation of the rent growth. But until there is clarity on reopening, there has to be -- you have to have a balanced view. Yeah. And you asked Jon about underwriting -- and we're actually a little bit ahead of underwriting on both of those portfolios, even through then what we've seen in the last few months. And we'll revisit that at the end of the year. But things are looking good. Obviously, for Liberty, the Houston exposure is going to be challenging for a bit. But on the other hand, Pennsylvania portfolio, which is the biggest piece of it, has actually done quite well, leading us, by the way, to bring Central Pennsylvania [indiscernible] a lot to us, so a little bit ahead of plan so far. Yeah. I mean, specifically, Jamie, we're adding sort of a net of $250 million of spec to the plan. We're still way below the January forecast, and those are like 15 projects in 15 different markets. So, there are bets that are being placed based on the customer demand in those markets. And I wouldn't be surprised if that number increases. You also asked about what happens going into 2021. I think we'll wait to see what happens before we talk about 2021, but we obviously have a much more confident view on building spec today than we did in April. Yeah. The only thing I'd add is, you asked specifically about rent growth in infill locations. And to date, we have certainly seen much more, much higher rent growth in these locations. And as you can imagine, there is a bit of market pricing discovery going on because these are submarkets that generally are immature for this kind of use and the product types basically span a huge range. But so far those -- the growth in rents has actually surprised us to the upside. Yeah. So in Pennsylvania, it's all leasing. So the improvement is related to leasing. In Houston, you have obviously two headwinds in demand. You've got energy pricing as well as COVID. And you have a huge amount of construction in progress at the beginning of this year. Now, some of that was suspended. But frankly, the vast majority was not. So, you're going to have an overhang of space in Houston easily going into next year some time, because there's just so much supply. In terms of developers being disciplined or not, I think, frankly, the jury is out on that. Right now, things appear to be disciplined. But I would have hoped frankly that we would have seen more projects stopped. We didn't see that. So I think we -- I think we need to monitor that aspect of it, but unfortunately in Houston, you have a supply issue as well as the demand issue."

            "name": "Hamid Moghadam",
            "content": "Yeah, I think this is more like the Borg-McEnroe match back in the late '70s. We don't know how many innings are in this game. We keep going into overtime. And I think we're very early in the rollout of e-commerce. E-commerce started the year in the low teens in the US. The numbers vary in different places. And there is no telling how far it can go. If it goes to 20% to 25%, which is where it was at the beginning early stages of COVID or stabilizes higher than that, this could be very, very early in the e-commerce rollout. And initially, obviously, we've had a clear market leader, which is Amazon in excess of 40% of the total volume, but we are seeing breadth in terms of different e-tailers that are now growing their businesses and have founded their footing. So, I think we're in very early stages and as you know, e-commerce has a sort of a supercharged effect on logistics' demand. Yeah. Thank you, Vikram. So two questions. With respect to market rents in the US, I think the best way to think about them is that we are basically on the same track were before, but with a pause and interruption. In other words, I would say in this era of COVID, the growth hasn't continued. I believe they will flatten for the balance of this year just like our guidance suggests. And then we'll pick up on the path of growth. And the reason I believe that is because there has never been a cycle growing into it or going into it. We've had high occupancies, vacancy being under 5%, and also very high utilization rate in the mid 80s. And there is no sign that those numbers are in anyway deteriorating. So, I think the market continues to be strong and I think it will be back on a trajectory of rental growth, not too dissimilar with -- from what we were projecting at beginning of the year. With respect to use of capital, I continue to believe that there is relatively little differentiation between different companies. So M&A is usually pretty tough. I mean, we've done it successfully in a couple of instances, but increasingly the targets are less and less compatible with our portfolio in terms of quality. And also, there is a pretty -- the companies are trading right on top of each other in terms of multiples. Don't ask me to explain that because the growth rates, at least, historically been substantially different. But I don't make the market react to it. The place that is always the best use of capital for us is building out our land bank because we already have the land and the incremental returns on capital are the most attractive, particularly with the kind of margins that we were talking about earlier and Mike referred to now. That's a pretty disciplined business. You can't do an infinite amount of that kind of development, but that's the first place we would go to. On straight acquisition of assets, look, I'd just like to -- I said last quarter, I don't think pricing of logistics real estate is going to soften. In fact, I think cap rates are going to compress because there is a lot of capital that's placed to go into real estate and obviously, there are sectors that are not going to attract their fair share capital like they did before. So that capital is piling in the few sectors that are performing well. So, I think the best use of capital is building out our land bank. Yeah. And the only other thing I would add to that is at the beginning of the year, we're forecasting essentially 260 million feet of demand and supply, and now we're projecting 250 million feet of demand and -- sorry, supply, and 160 million square feet of demand, which is down from our original forecast. So if you forecast 90 million square feet of demand, obviously, you have to go along with a pause in rental growth. So that sort of outlook is consistent both between demand and the rental picture that goes along with it. But when we come out of this thing, I think for reasons we've described before, namely an increase in inventory generally 5% to 10% and also the stabilizing share of e-commerce of the higher level than before will actually lead to a surge in demand, which will make up, in my view, more than the 90 million feet we lost or we project to lose this year. But nobody knows, I mean, these are all our best guesses. Yeah. International is a big spectrum. And on one side of it, you have places like Poland, which is suffering from overbuilding. You have Spain, which has weakened demand and then you have places on the other end of the spectrum that you would never get. Tokyo is under 1% vacancy. Osaka where the vacancy was in the teens is now in the 5% range, and we're leasing up pretty much everything we are building ahead of schedule. So obviously, there is a wide variety overseas. But if you sort of throw all of the overseas markets together, I would say generally, they are a tad slower than the US, but not materially so. And Gene may have more granular comments on that, but very consistent actually in terms of -- in terms of market strength. Customer behavior in short. Jamie, Gene is going to give you the real answer, but the short answer is customer behavior. We don't make the market. We just observe what happens on a real-time basis. But, Gene, go ahead and talk about the details. Dave, let me just start, and Gene will give you more details. On cap rate compression, we are already seeing it, particularly in Europe. And there is plenty of transaction evidence that those cap rates are holding and in some cases declining. And by the way that's in sync generally with our valuations that have been held flat and remember valuations are backwards looking. I mean if they were -- if they had the evidence of the last month of transactions, I think those values would be up. With respect to distribution of space, as we've said many times, Prologis operates in all four categories of space, whether it's last touch, all the way to gateway cities, the larger spaces in major markets. And that distribution is pretty balanced. And in fact, we have a paper out there that's not too out of date, that shows exactly what our portion is in each category. So, we haven't really materially changed our allocation to different markets. It's just that we get more questions about the last such markets these days than we did before. The old -- and this strategy was very much large markets than infill locations. So, that's where that portion of the portfolio in general is coming from, which is getting a lot of attention these days. Gene, do you want to elaborate on that? One other thought that I will just join there, you've heard us talk about this many times, but logistics rents are only 2% to 5%, call it or give it a wide range of total logistic costs and the rest being made by labor and transportation. So really the ability to pay for the customer is not the issue because even if they paid 20% more rent on an item that's 4% of their total logistics costs, that's 80 basis points more in costs. So that's not what drives it. What drives really rental growth is how anxious is your best next competitor in terms of dropping out rents. That's what determines this, not the customers' ability to pay rent. And generally speaking, when you're operating at around 5% vacancy, which is where we are, there aren't that many competing spaces around. So, we continue to do -- we continue to have pricing power generally in most markets. Obviously, the Houston's of the worlds are different. Yeah. Home improvement and grocery sectors are particularly strong. Not materially. Mike, not materially. Right before this thing, the lease durations had extended, probably the longest we've seen in about a decade. But -- and basically leases that are of term has stayed about the same level of duration. While we have higher month-to-month leases and that is pretty typical of what happens in this part of the cycle where normally somebody who's business was growing may be coming out of a smaller space going to the bigger space or going the other way frankly. But moving is expensive and committing to a new space is expensive. So, sometimes the best solution is just to basically pay overage rent and kick it out couple of months. So, we have a higher percentage of leases under one year. But the ones that go longer than a year are about the same profile as they were before. And with respect to escalation structures, pretty much consistent with before, slightly more free rent on the front end, which is how the effective rent comes down. I think Tom mentioned that the effective rents were down 1.7%. Face rents haven't changed all that much in most markets. The thing I would say about Walmart specifically is that, obviously, we had them in one property in the Bronx. And as you probably have read in the headlines, they no longer needed that property because of what you described and we were able to re-lease it with no interruption to another major e-commerce player at actually very attractive economics. So that's the only direct impact that I can see from Walmart if your question is specific to Walmart. And they didn't have much of a presence in the New York area anyway too, for it to be a headwind. So, they were just really getting started. They had tried for many years to get into that market, but it had proven to be a difficult market to get into.

That's very liquid real estate and we can do that anytime and our decision is to push that out until we have more deployment and meet the capital frankly more. Yeah. We actually look at that on a daily basis and, obviously, even more detail than what you just asked. We look at it by country, and we can have the ability to actually drill it down by market. So obviously, we're always focused on collections. But I would say we are a lot more focused on collections in the last four months or five months. And we have very good data on that. I would say there are two countries that stand out as collections being materially lower than elsewhere. And those are France and the UK. And part of it is that the government has gone out there and basically said, you don't have to pay your rents. And so a lot of people are -- and a lot of very healthy companies, I mean, household names are just choosing not to pay the rent for now. But their ultimate collection of those numbers, of those rents are not subject to those regulations. And we believe we'll collect the vast majority of them. But if you take those two markets out, Asia is on the other side, we have no deferrals or no late payments almost or no defaults to speak up in Asia. So if you throw it all in the blend there, the numbers are very comparable between the US. They are within a couple of 100 basis points between the US and the rest of the world. And with the two that I mentioned being the meaningful deviations. I think that was the last question. So, really want to thank you for your participation. Sorry about all the logistical glitches today, but that's the world we live in. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Take care."

            "content": "Thanks, Tracy. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We hope you and yours are all well. The second quarter played out better than our expectations in terms of both our results for the period and outlook for 2020 and beyond. Leasing activity in our portfolio, market fundamentals, valuations and rent collections are all trending favorably. Starting with results, core FFO for the second quarter was $1.11 a share, which included $0.23 of net promote income. Core FFO, excluding promotes, came in above our forecast due to higher NOI and higher strategic capital revenues. The increase in NOI was driven by lower bad debt and higher occupancy. For comparison, the quarterly results were in line with our initial 2020 guidance that we provided back in January. Overall, rent collection trends are excellent. And as of yesterday, we've collected 98% and 92.1% of June [Technical Difficulty]. We've seen the pace of rent receipts accelerate each month since March, with collections ahead of 2019 levels for each month as well. As a result, our bad debt provision for the second quarter was 58 basis points of rental revenues versus our forecast of 160 basis points. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 2.9%, which included a 42 basis point negative impact from bad debt. Turning to leasing and customer activity, segments benefiting [Technical Difficulty] economy remain very strong and continue to represent about 60% of our customer base. Leasing in the quarter by industry was well diversified, including from non-essential industries. E-commerce normalized to 24% of new leases. You'll recall from the first quarter, that number was 40% in the early days of COVID. Negatively impacted segments include restaurants, hospitality, oil and gas and conventions. These segments represent just 1.7% of our annual rent. Over the last 30 days in our operating portfolio, we've signed leases amounting to [60.3] [ph] million square feet, up 24% year-over-year. Lease proposals have risen 21% year-over-year and lease gestation has declined by 14 days to 44 days. Market fundamentals were stronger than we expected in the quarter and we are now forecasting the following for the US in 2020. Completion to total 250 million square feet, a 4% year-over-year decline, net absorption to total 160 million square feet, a 60% increase from our April view but down 40% year-over-year and year-end vacancy of 5%. Our forecast for year-end vacancy rates in Europe and Japan have also improved now at 4.5% and 2%, respectively. Strong leasing activity in the quarter has moved the following markets off of our watchlist; Central PA, Phoenix bulk, Atlanta bulk and Guadalajara. Our watchlist includes Houston, West China, Spain and Poland, which moved back into the list this quarter due to extremely undisciplined spec development by one private developer in that country. For strategic capital, the promote for USLF came in above our guidance, as Q2 valuations were higher than our forecast. Investor demand for our private funds remains very strong. Year-to-date, we've raised more than $2.2 billion of equity, approximately 17% ahead of our pace in 2019, which was a record year. Our open-ended funds currently have equity cues totaling $1.8 billion, with an incremental $1.4 billion in due diligence. In Q2, a $448 million secondary trade in our health fund was made with nine investors at a slight premium to NAV, and $421 million will be redeemed in our USLF fund in July. Post these transactions, redemption cues for our open-ended funds will total just $10 million. Looking to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain exceptional financial strength with liquidity of $4.6 billion in combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicles at levels in line with current ratings, totaling over $13 billion. Turning to guidance for 2020. Our outlook has improved from last quarter, given what we see in our proprietary data, our customer dialogue and the pace of rent collections. While there may be some headwinds in the back half of the year related to the timing and nature of economies reopening, we believe that our revised guidance range has taken those factors into account. Here are the key components of our guidance on an our share basis. We are raising the midpoint by 50 basis points and narrowing the range of our cash same-store guidance to between 2.5% and 3.5%. This assumes a reduction of bad debt by 50 basis points with a range between 60 basis points and 90 basis points of gross revenues. This means at the midpoint we're forecasting to reserve about 110 basis points of bad debt in the second half of the year. To date, we've granted rent deferrals of 48 basis points of annual rental revenues and continue to expect that grants for the full year will be less than 90 basis points. We are increasing our expected average occupancy midpoint by 25 basis points and narrowing the range to between 95% and 95.5%. Occupancy was slipped slightly in the second half, so not as much as we guided to in April and end the year at a very healthy level. Globally, net effective rents declined by 1.4% in the quarter as a result of higher concessions, essentially giving back the growth from the first quarter. Looking forward, we expect rents to be roughly flat for the back half of the year. Our in-place-to-market rent spread now stands at 13% and represents future growth potential of over $450 million of annual NOI. We expect rent change on rollovers to be more than 20% in the second half of the year. For strategic capital, we expect revenue, excluding promotes, to increase by $15 million relative to our prior guidance, and now range between $360 million and $370 million. We're increasing our net promote income for the full year to $0.20 per share and we do not expect to earn any material promote revenue in the back half of the year. As a reminder, there will be a timing mismatch in the second half of the year, as we will recognize promote expenses of about $0.03 per share. We are forecasting a G&A range of $265 million to $275 million, down $5 million from our prior forecast. Our outlook for capital deployment has improved significantly since April, and we now expect to start $100 million of new spec in the second half. Our revised starts range is $800 million to $1.2 billion for the full year, with build-to-suits comprising 65% of this volume. In addition to this range, we plan to resume construction on $150 million of projects that were previously suspended. We are currently negotiating leases on roughly 40% of the TEI of these suspended projects. At the midpoint, we're increasing acquisitions by $100 million, contributions by $150 million and dispositions by $400 million. We are now projecting net uses of capital to be $100 million at the midpoint. Taking these assumptions into account, we're increasing our 2020 core FFO midpoint by $0.125 and narrowing the range to $3.70 per share to $3.75 per share, including $0.20 of net promote income. This compares to our original guidance midpoint at the beginning of the year of $3.71 a share. Year-over-year growth at the midpoint, excluding promotes of sector-leading at over 12.5%, while keeping leverage flat. Our three-year CAGR has been 10.5%, outperforming the other logistics REITs by more than 500 basis points annually. We continue to maintain significant dividend coverage of 1.6 times, and our 2020 guidance implies a payout ratio in the mid-60% range and free cash flow after dividends of $1 billion. Looking forward, the long-term growth outlook of our business has strengthened. Our investments in data and technology provide us with the tools to identify pockets of risk and opportunity within our markets and portfolio, a significant competitive advantage. I want to repeat some comments at the beginning because I'm not sure my sound was coming through. So, I just want to repeat our results for the quarter. Core FFO for the second quarter was a $0.11 a share, which included $0.23 of promote income. Core FFO, excluding promotes, came in above our forecast due to higher NOI and higher strategic capital revenues. The increase in NOI was driven by lower bad debt and higher occupancy. For comparison, the quarter results were in line with our initial 2020 guidance that we provided back in January. Overall, rent collection trends are excellent and as of yesterday, we have collected 98% and 92.1% of our June and July rents, respectively. We have seen the pace of rent receipts accelerate each month since March, with collections ahead of 2019 levels for each month as well. As a result, our bad debt provision for the second quarter was 58 basis points of rental revenues versus our forecast of 150 -- 160 basis points. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 2.9%, which included a 42 basis point negative impact from bad debt. Turning to leasing and customer activity segments benefiting from COVID economy remain very strong and continue to represent about 60% of our customer base. Leasing in the quarter by industry was well diversified, including from non-essential industries. E-commerce normalized at 24% of new leases. You'll recall from the first quarter, that number was 40% in the early days of COVID. So with that, I'll turn it over to Jason for your questions Okay. I'll start with that. So from a leasing perspective, we certainly saw leasing activity picked up materially in June. June was a very high month. And as I mentioned in the last 30 days, we've certainly seen our leasing accelerate. As it relates to occupancy in Asia, it's related primarily to China and small spaces under 100,000 square feet. Next question, please. Okay. Next question, please. Yes. Let me -- let me start by answering that question. Obviously, we're having some difficulties here with our conference operator. Yeah, the activity accelerated obviously in the month of June and it's pretty broad based. And I think, for the best indication of that, you can look at our build-to-suit volume because it's up substantially in terms of percentage and absolute amount. And that tells you something about the scarcity of space out there because that's what people will have to turn to get their spacing needs met. So Mike, do you want to -- you want to elaborate on that somewhat? Yeah. Sumit, on your second question on promotes in the second half, it's going to be lower, really small because the promotes are effectively just based on development. There is very little AUM in those funds. That is promote eligible in the second half. And remember, we've got $0.03 of promote expenses that will also will be incurring in the second half of the year. Okay, Blaine. So on the rent collection, as I'll restate, so in June, we collected 98%. In July, we collected 92.1%. We deferred about 195 basis points of rent in June and about 70 basis points of rent in July. So that rents not due. So it's not in those numbers of those collections numbers. Now our collections, as I stated, are doing extremely well. We're ahead of last year since March. Every month, we're ahead of schedule. Now, we believe we are going to collect all the cash with the exception of what we think we've covered in a bad debt reserve. So, we've assessed. We've gone through -- we've assessed industries, we've assessed space sizes. We've looked at all the different metrics. We've looked at individual customers across our portfolio and we feel really good about that bad debt range of 60 basis points to 90 basis points. Now it's lower than we had projected in April, for sure, meaningfully lower, but it's because of the collections are so strong. And if -- I would anchor back also to the fact that our bad debt history on average is about 20 basis points. If you go back 14 years, 15 years, we've averaged 20 basis points of bad debt. Now, our high was 56 basis points in the GFC, and that's kind of what we saw here in Q2. So, I think we've got the second half bad debt adequately covered in the range probably and then some. And I feel good about getting the rest of this cash in the door."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Also note that this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tracy Ward. Tracy, you may begin.\nTracy Ward: Thanks, Mariana, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our first quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we'll hear from Gene Reilly, our Chief Investment Officer who will comment on real time market condition; and Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Ed Nekritz, Colleen McKeown and Tim Arndt are also here with us today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Gene. And Gene, will you please begin? \nEugene Reilly: Thanks, Tracy. We appreciate everyone joining us today and we hope you and yours are all well. We're glad to report that our teams are healthy and working productively on a remote basis. Our first quarter was very strong in all types of the business and Tom will cover these details. I'm going to focus on what we're seeing right now and our outlook for the year. While we are just 30 to 90 days into the COVID economy, we are seeing short-term effects play out very differently across our customer industry sectors. At this time, roughly 60% of our customers are growing and 40% are shrinking.  Next week Chris Caton will be issuing his fourth COVID white paper specifically on this topic of customer demand segmentation. At the extreme ends of the spectrum categories like food and beverage and consumer staples have sales up significantly; and conversely, cloth and sporting goods and home furnishings are all down sharply.  Our customers in contraction are going through a short-term shock, some will recover fairly quickly, others face a longer transition to normalcy, and unfortunately certain businesses will not survive. At the same time, the pandemic has led to significant growth for the industries I mentioned, serving the stay at home economy. And we continue to experience elevated e-commerce demand, a 40% share of new leasing versus 23% pre-crisis.  With the benefit of customer dialogue and applied research, we factored in tailwinds and headwinds to arrive at our revised 2020 earnings guidance. Our portfolio quality, customer composition and balance sheet strength are mitigating the headwinds and our disciplined efforts to dispose off $15 billion of non-strategic assets over the past several years, that is paying dividends today.  Turning to the long-term impacts, we believe some of the changes brought on by the pandemic will be durable. COVID is very likely to accelerate a share shift from brick and mortar to e-commerce retail. We also believe the growing importance of safety stock will lead to higher global inventory levels over time. These trends will increase demand for logistics real estate in the long-term, but will also have a positive effect on 2020 activity and we're already seeing this. Chris and his team have updated our forecast for logistics real estate market fundamentals and now expect the following for full year 2020.  In the U.S. supply will total 225 million square feet, an 18% year over year decline. U.S. net absorption will total a 100 million square feet, the lowest level since 2010 and a 55% year-over-year decline driving the vacancy rate up 90 basis points to 5.4%. Europe will have similar reductions in the supply and demand resulting in a 130 basis point vacancy rate increase to 5.2%. Japan's vacancy rate will increase from a record low of 1.4% to 2.8%. In summary, occupancies in all geographies will decline but also end the year at very healthy levels historically.  Our proprietary leasing data shows that the spike in leasing activities we witnessed in March, and talked you all about a couple of weeks ago, has settled down. We are now seeing volumes generally in line with historical trends. Forward-looking data continues to be encouraging.  During the last 30 days we signed 198 leases amounting to 17.5 million square feet, that's up 21% year-over-year and roughly flat adjusted for portfolio size. Our lease proposal generations are up 21% year-over-year. Lease negotiation gestation periods for new leases have declined by about 14 days year-over-year and retention was just over 80%, a couple hundred basis points higher than comparable historical periods.  After slicing the data in several different ways, we see three clear themes at this point. First, essential consumer product sectors are driving the demand. Second, e-commerce is driving demand across industry sectors. And third, our larger customers are fairing much better than smaller customers in this environment.  Now an update on rent relief requests, growth has slowed here. And to-date, we have received requests representing 4.3% of gross annual rent. Of these requests, 70% were not granted, 23% remain under review and 7% have been granted in the form of rent deferral loans representing 27 basis points of gross annual rent and an average of about 33 days of rent per customer.  As mentioned on our last call, this release is targeted at our smaller customers with legitimate need stemming from COVID and not through opportunistic requests. We believe the total rent deferral loans granted will eventually amount to about 90 basis points of gross annual rent with these loans scheduled for repayment over the remainder of 2020.  Turning to the strategic capital business, our investors remain very positive on the logistics real estate sector. As noted on our last call, the vast majority of redemptions to-date were in progress prior to COVID-19 and there appears to be good secondary market interest for some portion of the redemption activity, but to-date we have seen no trades on the secondary market. Next I would like to provide some context for the updated capital deployment guidance Tom detail in a moment. This guidance assumes virtually no incremental activity in acquisitions, dispositions, speculative development or contributions. Rather than to speculate on future market conditions, we are guiding to volumes that have largely been accomplished already. Most of the volume predicted between now and the year end is build-to-suit activity where the pipeline remains active with multiple leases signed post-COVID actually.  We continue to work closely with customers and municipalities on 30 ongoing projects in 14 markets. Construction continues on 22 of these projects with eight having been halted by local authorities. And to-date we have yet to stop a project at the request of a customer.  While our current leasing data is holding up very well and we see extremely encouraging trends with e-commerce leasing, we\u2019re planning on a reduced demand environment through the end of 2020. We will have opportunities to serve our customer segments in expansion mode and we will need to support others not so fortunate.  We expect to serve as a reliable alternative for build-to-suit customers, take advantage of investment opportunities as they emerge and manage our strategic capital vehicles prudently and opportunistically in this environment.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom. \nThomas Olinger: Thanks, Gene. First and foremost, I want to echo Gene\u2019s introductory comments and wish you and your families the best of health during these challenging times. I'll briefly discuss Q1 and then take you through our updated guidance. Starting with results, core FFO for the first quarter was $0.83 a share which was in line with our pre-COVID expectations. We did recognize an expense of $5 million in the quarter or a little less than $0.01 per share related to our donation to the Prologis Foundation for COVID-19 relief efforts.  During the quarter we completed the acquisition and integration for both the IPT and Liberty portfolios. We hit our synergy targets and both portfolios are performing well and in line with our expectations. We leased 34.7 million square feet in the quarter with ending occupancy of 95.5%, down a 100 basis points sequentially as expected. Rent change on rollover remains strong at 25% and was led by the U.S. at 31%. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 4.6% which was about 30 basis points above our forecast.  Same-store average occupancy for the quarter was 85 basis points lower year-over-year, again, consistent our expectations. As of yesterday, we've collected 85% of April rent, which is in 1% of our normal pace. Rent due dates vary by country and about 5% of our rent isn't due until the back half of the month. As Gene noted, we've granted $18 million in rent deferrals, [$9 million] of which relates to April. All granted deferrals are structured to be repaid in 2020.  For deployment, we started $300 million in new development projects which were 85% pre-leased. Stabilizations were $690 million with an estimated margin of 39% and value creation of $270 million. Additionally, we realized more than $280 million in development gains through early April.  Looking to the balance sheet, we enter this crisis in a position of strength with significant liquidity and borrowing capacity. Liquidity at quarter end was $4.6 billion and we have cleared out our debt maturities until 2022. The combined leverage capacity of Prologis and our open-ended vehicles at levels in line with current ratings is well over $10 billion.  Turning to guidance for 2020. Our approach is twofold; first, to exercise prudence; and second, use a broader range of outcomes given the uncertainty. While the full economic impact is difficult to quantify, our guidance assumes reduced demand into the third quarter with the operating environment beginning to recover towards the end of the year. Here are the key components of our guidance on our share basis. Our cash same store NOI, we\u2019re decreasing the midpoint by 225 basis points and now expect growth to range between 1.75% and 3.25%. The decrease in the midpoint assumes average occupancy will be down a 100 basis points in range between 94.5% and 95.5%.  We expect retention to increase about 500 basis points and be in the mid 70% range. We are estimating bad debt expense to range between 100 basis points and 150 basis points of gross revenues. The midpoint of 125 basis points compares to 20 basis points of bad debt expense embedded in our prior guide. It's important to note this bad debt midpoint is on an annual basis, which means we've reserved a much higher percentage based on the remaining 2020 revenue, particularly if our positive cash collection trends continue. As we discussed in our call earlier this month, our bad debt expense peaked at 56 basis points during the GFC. At the midpoint, our annual guidance for bad debt is more than double that historical high and almost 3 times that level at the upper end of the range, again, on an annualized basis.  As Gene mentioned, we believe rent deferrals granted will amount to about 90 basis points. While we expect these deferrals to be repaid, we have factored in the potential for credit loss for the deferrals as well as elsewhere in the portfolio. We have included the impact of downtime resulting from potential bad debt in our occupancy forecast. We're assuming no rent growth for the remainder of the year. Rents for leases signed since March 1st have been about 200 basis points ahead of our expectations, while rents for lease assigned in the first two months of this year were about a 100 basis points better.  We expect rent change to be in the mid 20% range and keep in mind our in place to market rent spread is currently approximately 15%. For strategic capital, we expect revenue excluding promotes the range between $345 million and $355 million, down $5 million due to lower forecasted deployment by our funds. We are maintaining our net promote income for the full year of $0.15 per share based on quarter end valuations. The vast majority of the 2020 promote revenue will be recognized in the second quarter.  For net G&A we're forecasting a range between $270 million and $280 million, down $5 million at the midpoint. Our G&A for the year is down about $10 million due primarily to lower T&E, offset by the $5 million contribution to the Foundation. From a foreign currency standpoint, we continue to be extremely well insulated from FX movements through the next three years and our U.S. dollar net equity is over 95%.  As Gene mentioned we stopped all new speculate development and have halted construction on many spec projects that had recently started. We now expect development starts for the year to the range between $500 million and $800 million with build-to-suits comprising more than 70% of this volume. The cost to complete our active development pipeline is currently $1.6 billion.  For acquisitions and dispositions and contributions guidance, while not our expectation, we are simply forecasting no incremental activity other than a few transactions currently under contract. For net deployment uses we're now projecting $200 million at the midpoint, down $450 million from our prior guidance. The net deployment changes had a minimal impact on earnings given the timing of that activity.  Taking these assumptions into account, we are lowering our 2020 core FFO guidance midpoint by $0.11. We now expect a range between $3.55 and $3.65 per share, which includes $0.15 of net promote income. We believe we've approached the forecast quite conservatively with no assumption reasonably made more severe given what we know today. We have limited roll, dramatically reduced deployment and reserve for bad debt and multiples of the GFC. And even with that year-over-year growth at the midpoint excluding promotes remained strong at over 10%, all while keeping leverage flat.  We continue to maintain significant dividend coverage at 1.5 times and our 2020 guidance implies a payout ratio in the mid 60% range. Longer term, we feel more positive about our business given the emergence of two new structural demand drivers. First, there will be a need for more inventory as supply chains emphasize resiliency over efficiency; and second, an acceleration of e-commerce adoption.  In closing, 2020 will be a tough year for many. However, despite the uncertainty, Prologis is very well prepared. We enter this unprecedented time with the healthiest fundamentals on record, an extremely well positioned portfolio, a significant in place to market rent spread and a strong balance sheet.  And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jeremy Metz with BMO. Your line is open. \nJeremy Metz : Gene you gave some good high level color here at the start. I was just wondering if you could break it down a little further here in terms what you're seeing or if you foresee any outside impact from any particular region or city, big box or small box, infill or secondary markets, maybe just a little color what you're seeing across those channels, what your expectations are? And then as a follow-up question outside the same-store pool, are your occupancy and bad debt assumptions similar to the recent portfolios you closed, Liberty in particular? Thanks. \nEugene Reilly: Okay. I\u2019ll -- Jeremy, I may have Tom comment on the last question. But in terms of the sort of the composition of what's happening on the demand front, I mean probably it's really more industry segment and size segment than any particular geography. Obviously our Houston operation is facing headwinds from both COVID and plummeting oil prices. So that's our toughest market right now. But otherwise, the industry segments I mentioned are strongest. And clearly in this environment, smaller customers are having a tougher time than larger. And with respect to the -- one of the market I'd probably throw in there is Atlanta, which, in Atlanta we actually have a fairly high percentage of our smaller customers as well. So Tom, I don\u2019t know if you want to take the...\nThomas Olinger: Yes, Jeremy. From a bad death perspective, we looked at the portfolio across the entire stack. We looked by industry, the customer composition and we looked at it consistently across the entire portfolio. So we don't see anything unique about any of our recently acquired portfolios. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. \nManny Korchman: It might be too early to be asking about 2021. But just given the sort of slowdown in pace or trajectory in \u201820, how do we think about your 2021 growth? And how that's going to sort of either slow or maybe rebound quicker as we sit today? \nEugene Reilly: I think our business is going to be somewhat slower before the vaccine and much higher after the vaccine. So you tell me when the vaccine is going to come through, which is a real permanent solution and I'll tell you how that makes us going to work for the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Your line is open. \nJamie Feldman : Thank you. I was hoping you could focus a little bit more on the smaller tenant discussion. I mean, what have you seen in terms of government stimulus being able to actually help out those tenants? Just maybe some more color in terms of, how bad is it really for small versus large and what are the factors you guys are watching to see if they can get help or they're not going to get help or just as much color as you can provide would be great? \nEugene Reilly: So Jamie, let me first make a distinction. Smaller tenants don't necessarily mean smaller companies that occupy those spaces. So you got to distinguish between the mom and pops and smaller locations for creditworthy company. So not all small tenants are under pressure. Secondly, the -- if you're a contractor or a supplier to a residential construction or some kind of an auto related use, for sure your business is down and you're going to be struggling in this environment. Too soon to tell how the government support is going to help. But at least on the levels of support that we've talked about so far, I don't think it fully replaces the revenue and the margins that they've lost during this period. But I can tell you, a lot of the demand for their products is deferred demand.  And if they can make it through this crisis, I think they'll be the beneficiary of the spring back, on the other side of this. So, tough to tell. The stimulus has been in place for a little less than two weeks. But also the other thing I would say is that there is a ton of monetary stimulus, on top of the fiscal stimulus that's come in. So -- and the attitude that I see with the banking system this time around because the banks are -- and you guys by the way, would know better than I would because you work for a lot of banks, but the banks are oftentimes -- well, they're certainly better capitalized and people seem to be much more cooperative in terms of working with their customers by accommodating them. Because everybody realizes that this is not anybody's problem. It's something that happened differently. This is a definite change in attitude with the government, fiscal, monetary, and with the banking system that's distributing the funds. So I think they're going to work with their customers, including the smaller ones, but some of them unfortunately won't make it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. \nVikram Malhotra : Two quick ones really, just one on the bad debt that you've baked in. Can you just clarify, have you seen any bad debt in the first quarter and can you talk about the second quarter? And then just second question on market rent growth. You referenced baking in no rent growth. I just want to clarify, are you referring to market rent growth in 2020? And just give us a little bit more color maybe by major regions? \nEugene Reilly: Let me pick up on the rent growth question and then I'll pitch it over to Tom for the first part of your question on credit loss. Let me give you the facts on rent growth. Rent growth in January and February were a 100 basis points higher than what we had projected for those specific spaces. Rent growth for March surprisingly was 200 basis points higher than what we had projected for those spaces. So, so far we haven't seen evidence of rental decline or deceleration in growth.  However, we've assumed that in the forecast that Tom shared with you, because absent perfect information, you got to be conservative with respect to rental growth forecast. So those are two specific data points. The third data point I'll give you is that we have projected certain grants for the two acquired portfolios, IPT and LPT. And in both cases the spaces that we've rolled over have been on the range of 4% to 5% higher rents than we had forecast for those portfolios late last year when we underwrote them.  Tom, you want to talk about the credit loss? \nThomas Olinger : Ys. So on bad debt experienced in the first quarter, we saw write-offs of 25 basis points. And in April, we've seen nothing unusual, as I talked about our April collections are trending normally, as did March. And as I mentioned, we are conservative here by almost any measure you can look at on the bad debt and we're reserved appropriately to cover a really severe downside on the AR side. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. \nBlaine Heck : So you guys mentioned that you guys are moving forward with the 30 build-to-suits under construction, are there other build-to-suits that might've been in the plan to start construction later this year. And if so, can you talk about the probability of those continuing as planned as well and whether there are any kind of renegotiations happening on those with respect to the rent side of the equation?\nMike Curless: Hey, Blaine. It\u2019s Mike Curless. The 30 build-to-suits are well underway. We haven't heard anything from any customers to say differently. So that is a very good sign. And in terms of the prospect list, I would say it's a bit shorter in number, but the people on that list are as active as ever. E-commerce is a big driver of those. You've read a lot about Amazon's activity across the board. We've seen signed leases this year. In order of magnitude we signed 10 leases this year compared to seven this time last year. And three of those, as Gene mentioned, came in the last several weeks. So it\u2019s a bunch of good signs with respect to the underpinning of e-commerce relative to build-to- suit. There's -- I'm not seeing any renegotiations underway and we have really good opportunities for tailwind here, given the lack of spec that you're going to see in the marketplace. So I'd say the prospect list is naturally a bit shorter, but pretty robust. And we're optimistic about the build-to-suit activity this year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Green with Evercore. Your line is open.\nJason Green: Good morning. Just a question on bad debt guidance, on the business update call you mentioned that bad debt could trend as high as 100 basis points and now guidance incorporates 125 basis points at the midpoint. I know these are similar figures, but just curious if you saw anything in the last few weeks that made that estimate trend higher?\nThomas Olinger : No, just let me clarify. We did not actually guide on bad debt in any way and we were very careful to draw the distinction between operating performance and any kind of financial guidance. The number that we talked about 100 basis points on that call is the equivalent of the 90 basis points that Gene talked about. That is the forecast amount of total rent that is going to be subject to deferral. That is at related but not the same concept as the write off, because we fully expect obviously the ones that we have deferred to make good on that deferral. Now a portion of them will probably default. And a portion of the ones that didn't ask for a deferment could default. So the 90 basis points of deferral is very different than the 125 basis points on average of credit loss. The other thing I want to make sure you understand is that the 125 basis point is applied across the year. And certainly as you heard from Tom, the first quarter was 20 basis points and we know what that was. So we're carrying another 100 basis points of room from the first quarter into future quarters, and we've got 125 basis points to start with across the whole year. So the amount that we have reserved for anything that could default is significantly higher than what appears on the surface. Let me be even more specific. Not all tenants are going to default that are going to default are going to default on April 1st. If they default, they're likely to default during the course of the year. So on average, they're going to default in July. If you just ratably divide it, which means on that basis alone we\u2019re almost 3 times the actual number covered for default risk and default outcomes. And another way you can get at it is that in the global financial crisis, the total written off debt averaged 56 basis points annually and the midpoint this time around is 125 basis points for the remaining, more than 125 basis points for the remaining three quarters significantly higher. So we've got a scenario multiples of times of the global financial crisis factored in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nCraig Mailman: Just curious, any of the rent referral requests from tenants that paid April, but are worried about being able to pay May. And then just separately maybe for Chris, you kind of put out a hundred, or you put out your net absorption figures and construction figures this year. Just as we think about \u201921, I know you're giving guidance. But do you think the slowdown in deliveries in \u201821 and with the rebound in absorption, could result in better than expected snap backs in \u201921?\nEugene Reilly: I do, I don't know what, Chris, thinks. But again, snapbacks is not going to happen until everybody's got the all clear signal on the health front. [Multiple Speakers] Everybody talks about the government, when are they going to put people back to work and open up the country for business and all these demonstrations that we see, that's got nothing to do with it. Even if they open up the place for business, a lot of people will have to go back to work and will, but the lot of people who don't have to go to work won\u2019t. So I don't think the government action is going to be the trigger for that. I think the all clear is going to have to come from the health front.\nChris Caton: And I think, let me just finish up the answer here, which is to me he's already given me a view on the demand, but it's also important to remember a view on supply. Right now in the marketplace, we were seeing projects the way or not started and that's kind of a material impact on the outlook for delivery in 2021.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Your line is now open.\nTom Catherwood: Tom, you mentioned that customers are focusing on resiliency over efficiency now. How do you see this playing out and how are you positioning your portfolio and investments or built to suit activity to assist either with the shift or what it take part in this shift?\nThomas Olinger: So I think our portfolio is already positioned to capture that activity, number one, just given the proximity of portfolio to the consumption base and as we see the acceleration, further acceleration long-term of e-commerce trends, I think we are right there to capture that. And then on the resiliency versus efficiency comment, its clear customers will carry more inventories to protect themselves against future shocks. We'll see that and they're going to want that inventory close to the consumption base to meet consumer demands for delivery time. So I think our portfolio today is positioned and we're going to continue to build out our land bank and further solidify our portfolio.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Peterson with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJohn Peterson: I think about six weeks ago or so, you guys announced the share buyback program. Just curious given public perception around share buybacks and landlords for that matter. Do you think it makes sense to buyback even if the stock price does fall substantially? And if I could sneak in a second unrelated question, I'm just curious what social distancing might mean for some of the different industries in your space. Obviously, some users have very few people in the facilities at any one time, while maybe [Technical Difficulty].\nThomas Olinger : I think you cut off, but I get the gist of your question. On social distancing, I think there are certain categories of our customers that their businesses will continue to suffer like the people servicing the convention trade and hospitality, I think -- or airlines, I think those businesses will continue to suffer. If you mean what is it mean in terms of the actual occupants of our buildings, the people who work in our building. The most people intensive operations that we have are the e-commerce players and you have read the same things I have about Amazon and other e-commerce players, and some of the controversy that's been out there. But I think those companies have been very responsible actually in terms of not only providing a lot of employment during this difficult time, but also having a lot of controls in terms of checking people's temperatures. And now I understand they're going to go to some pretty regular testing, serology testing. So, I think they're doing the best they can to actually get people back to business. So you and I can actually get our groceries and other things. And I actually commend them for that. With respect to the share buyback program, you know we did buyback $35 million of stock when the stock got into the 60s. And we felt that that was a very, very significant discount to NAV and it was a compelling opportunity. And to be honest with you, after doing that I changed my mind and then thought the perception of that is not going to be great. So we took all the profits that we made there and our intention is to put all those profits back into the Prologis foundation, and it was a pretty substantial amount of profit. So I think actually we're going to do some good with it going forward. But we haven't, I haven't fully thought through the perception of it and -- but we made some money and we're going to spend it for a good cause.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Sumit] for Nick. Just a quick question on short term leasing and lease terminationss actually. So lease terminations while too small have almost doubled as a percent of revenue this quarter versus Q1 last year and versus the last quarter that is Q4 of 2019. So just trying to understand besides the bad debt and all that, just trying to understand what you're seeing in terms of tenants from markets that are seeing elevated levels of terminations? Any color would be useful.\nThomas Olinger: This is Tom, Sumit. On the lease terminations, there's nothing unique, they\u2019re episodic. And what we saw in Q1 was not particularly unusual. It was just related to a tenant\u2019s needs and we helped them out in another space as well. There were couples like that. So it\u2019s episodic. There's no trending that we see with termination fees being foreshadowing any other type of activity. I just don't see it.\nEugene Reilly: So the only thing I would add to Tom's answer is that it's a billion square foot portfolio. And in our business unlike the office business, there's not a lot of lease termination fee anyway. So it's one of those things where a very small number could have increased by a large percentage and it's still a very small number, and those things moved around by very specific decision. Keep in mind we have 15% spread to market and that spread, if anything, is still there and maybe as we expanded a little bit. So sometimes the lease terminations are an opportunity for us to make some money on buying out a tenant and actually make some more money by re-leasing the space.  So lease terminations are not necessarily bad in our business and they're minuscule in the scale of the portfolio. And I apologize if we don't remember every single one of them. We have over 8,000 leases.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nKi Bin Kim: So first question, can you just talk about your exposure to at risk tenancy or industry? And the second, just taking a step back, if I put your comments about rent spreads and market rent being flat, putting it all together. It kind of seems a little bit optimistic given what's going on the macro fund. So, what am I missing from your views? Is it really the tenant by tenant leasing that you're doing that gives you confidence in that or something else?\nThomas Olinger : Well, first of all, I don't think I gave you a forecast for market rent. I was very careful to tell you, let me tell you actually what has happened. And I distinguish between the activity in January and February, which was up 1% compared to our expectations versus March that was up 2%. But our forecast don't incorporate rents going up, we basically pushed that out for the balance of this year. And as someone else pointed out, we haven't issued guidance for next year but we do think there's going to be a snap back next year that's going to result in rent growth. If you were going ask me right now, it's not a fully baked idea. So our official view on rent growth is that it's flat for the year and we're writing out some rent growth. So you can think of it as a slight decline or something, but we're not smart enough to be able to forecast those things with precision. The good news is that market rent growth has very little to do with our numbers in the near future. We have only 8% of the space that rolls over and we have 15% mark to market and a greater amount on the ones that roll over this year. So really what drives rent and operating results is the mark-to-market and the small percentage of rollover. So I don't think it's going to be a big deal.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Frankel with Green Street Advisors. Your line is open.\nEric Frankel: Just two quick questions. Do you have an economic forecast that underlies your operating guidance this year? And then just regarding kind of the safety stock and inventory resilience team, have you talked with any customers and specific industries that have brought this up, or is this kind of your assumptions just based on your experience or your internal data? Thank you.\nThomas Olinger : Eric, honestly, I'm really surprised with your question. Have we talked to any customers? That just really blows me away. We are very customer centric. We have a Chief Customer Officer, who in addition, as part of the executive team, who spends all his time and a dedicated team talking to our major customers. And we have over 500 customer facing people in the field that are in constant dialog with our customers. So yes, we do speak to our customers quite a bit. As to economic forecast, I don't spend a lot of time looking at economic forecasts, because I've seen much smarter people than Prologis have forecasts that are down 5% a year and some that have down 40% this year. So I don't know what it is. I just look at customer behavior when we forecast our business. And yes, in the long term, our business is completely correlated with consumption, which is highly correlated with economic growth or decline. But in the short term, the dynamics of e-commerce, the stay at home economy and the need to carry more inventory overwhelm those kinds of longer term considerations.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMichael Carroll: I was hoping you could provide some more color on the rent deferments, the 33 days of average rent that is being deferred on those specific tenants. Is that enough for them to survive this type of market turmoil? I mean, I'm assuming you've done that type of analysis. And I think as the second part. What percentage of these smaller tenants qualify for the stimulus package? And does that give you more confidence that you're going to be able to collect these deferments by the end of the year?\nMike Curless: Yes, there's a high percentage of our customers that we've been interacting with and that we think will qualify for the stimulus and we're seeing evidence of that already in the U. S. We've had several examples where customers initially contacted us only to call us two weeks later and say, hey, look, this stimulus kicked in. So you know, May will be a little bit of a wait and see but we expect high percentage of those customers receiving that, that activity. And then with respect to the 33 days, again as Hamid mentioned, we know our customers very well. We've had a very thorough process. We've looked at their financials, they filled out the questionnaires. And that's been our best estimate of what's going to be necessary to bridge them to the next opportunity for them. So that's where we are.\nEugene Reilly: And just kind as to the last question, as you heard in our update call and I think you heard somewhere today about 20% to 25% of our customer base at some point has had a discussion with respect to some kind of rent deferral. And of course on those we've granted a very small portion of it. We expect to ultimately maybe grant 30% and today it\u2019s more like 5%. So that alone means we've had direct discussion with 25% of the customer base. Well, on a billion square foot portfolio that's 250 million square feet. So we've had conversations, multiple sizes of many, many big companies in the sector with our customers, just about that topic during this period of time. So yes, we're really talking to customers all the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Guinee with Stifel. Your line is open.\nJohn Guinee: I might've missed this and if I did, just tell me. But I don't think you mentioned anything about near shoring or on shoring as effect on your business. And then second, Tom, it looks to me like back of the envelope midpoint of your guidance is a pretty strong ramp, $0.85, to $0.87 to $0.89. Could you talk a little bit about how GAAP accounting plays into your rent deferrals?\nEugene Reilly: Yes, on the on shoring. So most of the stuff is going to get onshore from China and possibly from Mexico to the U. S. at least with respect to the U. S. and with respect to Europe, I don't think that much is going to change. It's probably going to be China shifting to European production. And as you know, our Chinese strategy, first of all, it's a very, very small part of our portfolio. It's about 1.5% of our income is in China. And secondly, it's totally focused towards domestic consumption. We learnt very quickly that the export business doesn't generate a lot of industrial demand, because containers are the warehouse. So to the extent that there's more on shoring in the consumption markets, the U. S. and Europe, I'm not counting on it but by definition, that's incremental demand on top of the consumption demand. So it should help on the margin. And the reason we haven't really factored in it is that those are likely to go to really lower cost locations and where real estate is cheap and labor is cheap, and we're really well positioned for the infill large urban market. So likely you're not going to put a plant to on shore in downtown San Francisco or any place like that, or LA, you're going to go to a cheaper environment. So I think it will be important positive for U. S. and European demand. But I'm not sure we, because of our geography, are going to be the biggest beneficiaries of that. I think people who are in more remote locations will probably benefit from that. Tom, you want to take the other part of the question?\nThomas Olinger: Yes, your other question on the rent deferrals and the accounting analysis of that. So the way we're structuring our rent deferrals is extending the payment term. And as we mentioned, the payment term, the due dates are within 2020. We certainly expect them to be paid, but the whole analysis on the collectability when you book that revenue, you gain that revenue to be collectible and that's just assessment. So this is relating to April revenue that's being deferred and you make the assessment in April as to the collectability of that revenue and you either book that revenue or you book a reserve, or portion reserve against that based on your assessment of collectability. And then regarding the ramping or what is earnings look like from a quarterly perspective, clearly, Q2 will be heavily influenced by the promote, because that's when the bulk of that will land. And then it's really a function of what we see, quite frankly, from a bad debt experience. As we said, we've got a lot of bad debt reserve that's sitting there for the rest of the year. And I think our results are going to move relative to what happens there.\nEugene Reilly: The only thing that I would add John to that is that prior to these adjustments, downward adjustments, our year-over-year growth was on the order of I think 13%, 14% FFO growth, 14% FFO growth, actually. And that's a big number. So it's come down 4%. So maybe another way of asking your question is how come your guidance previously was so high and still is high. And the reason for that is primarily that the volume of development starts in prior years that we're just having capitalized interest in them are now coming on, and there are a lot of built of suits in those and those are now fully income producing. So we had them in the denominator as capital expenditures where we weren\u2019t earning a whole lot on them. And as they stabilized and they're leased those extra earnings are coming online. So it has nothing to do with this changed environment. It was just high to start with because of that and remains pretty healthy. I mean, I think 10% growth year-over-year even in the strongest environments without increasing leverage.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dave Rodgers with Baird. Your line is open.\nDave Rodgers: Maybe for Tom and Hamid, just about asset values. I know Tom, you talked about the promote being consistent in the guidance and the reason why is the pricing at the end of the first quarter. I guess I just wanted to drill on that if I could and the idea that you guys have taken market rents to more of a neutral stance this year, you've taken market vacancy outlook higher. I guess maybe why wouldn't that impact the valuation of assets as you sit here in a very point in time and is there any risk to that promote? And then maybe just a follow up to that, Gene you\u2019d said something earlier that the number of leases that you were doing, I think was flat on a portfolio size adjusted basis. Did you give the square footage for those and are they smaller deals in the pipeline, or larger ones? Any color there would be helpful as well? Thank you.\nThomas Olinger : On the appraisals, what we've seen in the first quarter appraisals is that generally the numbers are up very slightly but the appraiser is like 1% or 2% quarterly. And appraisers have basically stickered the appraisals as they normally do and markets with turmoil that talk about that there are no cons et cetera, et cetera. But the real answer on that is that because promotes are such a sensitive calculation to the terminal value, these are generally three year promotes. And if you move around the terminal value a little bit the promotes can move around we're generally very conservative and projecting and guiding promotes. And we feel like we've got sufficient room to absorb any kind of a downside there. The other thing I would say is that more than half of the projected promote is a hold back of promote from three years ago, and the amount of which was determined and calculated and is known and that number will not change. So a big portion of that number we know exactly what it is more than 50%. So to the extent there's variabilities on that last I would say 40% of it, 60% of it is backed.\nEugene Reilly: Well, let me just answer the second part of the question, which is the experience in the last 30 days of leasing. We have seen more leasing in the bigger size segments so we'll happy to clarify that for you later on but definitely bigger customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nDerek Johnston: You've covered a lot, so let's do this. So PLDs grown rapidly and I will say accretively over the past few years and in 2019 had additional large acquisitions. Meanwhile, investor sentiment has so far remained positive on industrial rates. However, amid this serious pause and probable tenant shakeout, what is it about the larger portfolio and positioning, you know which makes you most optimistic in these uncertain times?\nEugene Reilly: Well, we've had a half of experience on the two latest acquisitions. And Tom, last time we talked about this couple of days ago, we were up about 5% on our underwriting of those portfolios based on activity that's already taking place. So we feel really good about it. Oh, sure, Houston energy is worse than we thought and Liberty had a pretty significant presence in Houston, and we did too but again it is a billion square foot portfolio. And on the other hand, Pennsylvania has done a lot better than we thought previously, because a lot of the New York adjacent demand and the big boxes have, for some strange reason, taking up a lot of space in Pennsylvania. So that's looking better and that's actually a bigger portfolio. So net, net all the reasons for which we did those investments that we articulated before stand. And on top of that, they've just performed better than we expected, so that's a really good start. I don't know whether that will continue for the next 10 years, but it's better to be 5% ahead of the game than behind the game when you're getting off the block. Does that answer your question? Let's give him an opportunity to ask it again, because it was a complicated question. So if  we didn't answer it, ask it again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Manny Korchman with Citi. Your line is open. \nMichael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman here with Manny. I was wondering if you can address a little bit on the capital deployment of what you've changed and you know, looking at the press release, you've brought down your acquisition volumes, both building as well as land by a billion and a quarter. And commensurately, you've got down your disposition volumes as well and you've obviously made a big cut to the development side in terms of starts, which obviously had capital commitments out in the future. And I want to know two things, one, why not take advantage of the marketplace and continue to sell and build liquidities and continue to reshape the portfolio, which you\u2019ve done in a number of years to improve its quality and location? So why not sell more? And then the second part is on the development side where you've taken a much more conservative approach and ramped down your development. What are you seeing from the industry at large in terms of development? So two separate sort of topics somewhat connected, if you can address that that would be great.\nThomas Olinger : We are chickens and chickens live longer. I mean, when the world is going or falling off the cliff and everybody's talking about GDP going down 40% this quarter or whatever. We had some spec developments, we can try them anytime, they\u2019re entitled they're ready to go. And if we see the demand, we'll start them two months later. We're not saying that that's our forecast. We're saying every quarter we've got to get in front of you guys and give you some assessment of what we think is going to happen. And this is a very turbulent time. I think the fact that we've even put out a guidance and by the way, we don't have an advantage of looking at all the other people and figuring out what they're doing to sort of tailor our message accordingly. We're going back first and we got to stick our neck out. And we have and we've given a range. But we have taken a conservative approach, saying that we're not going to deploy any new capital on discretionary starts of speculative projects, and we're not going to buy anything at yesterday's prices. If prices become different, for sure we're going to use our resources. We have over $10 billion, $11 billion of capacity between the funds and the balance sheet, and we will certainly start those developments once there is leasing that we feel really comfortable about going forward. But we can't predict that, there is no cost to waiting, there's only upside in waiting. So we've covered the downside. We're still well positioned for the upside. And it's not intended to be a forecast. It's just a prudent thing to do. And I hope we're wrong about that and we'll do closer to what we have planned on doing before. But we're not going to get over our skis.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJamie Feldman: I get something along the same lines just a quick follow up and then a question. One is, if you could just talk about when you see occupancy bottoming in the portfolio? I know you guys said kind of towards year end things improved. But I'm curious more detailed how you see things through, what the trajectory is for occupancy? And then bigger picture as we think about potential cracks, obviously, there's a lot it cracks. But are you seeing distress among competitors or just versus prior downturns that you've seen? Where do you think, where's the most risk that maybe people aren't thinking about?\nEugene Reilly: Yes, I think we will get a significant increase in occupancy the quarter or the quarter after the vaccine is likely available, maybe even when it's announced and it's definite that it's coming, based on the anticipation of it coming. So you tell me again the date and I'll tell you when that will be. From everything I hear, it's going to be more like next summer-ish, although, there's some really positive developments that I've been hearing about from the scientific community. I mean, we've got a couple of really big medical centers here and I'm in constant dialog with them. And on the therapeutic side, there's some really good stuff happening that we may even hear about in the August, September timeframe. So I think that's when the occupancies will turn around. In terms of the cracks, I would say as I guess Warren Buffett says we'll find out who's been swimming naked as the tide recedes. There are some people that have been, mostly on the private side, by the way, I'm pretty proud of my public brethren by enlarge they've really behaved well throughout the cycle. And I think everybody's kind of pretty disciplined in the sector. But there are a couple of private players, particularly in parts of Europe, Central and Eastern Europe being good example that have really gotten out there on their skis and we'll see what happens. Maybe they're really good skiers. But I would say of all the cycles I've seen, whether it's the \u201887 collapse or the SNL crisis or dot com or the GSV, I would say there is less of that around much, less of that around than any one of those cycles. I think we are over our time allotment, and we've taken way too much of your time this quarter with two calls. So let me thank you for your interest in the company and invite you to our next quarterly call. And hopefully, we'll all be much more optimistic than we are in this environment. And everyone stay healthy. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Right now in the marketplace, we were seeing projects the way or not started and that's kind of a material impact on the outlook for delivery in 2021."

            "content": "Hey, Blaine. It's Mike Curless. The 30 build-to-suits are well underway. We haven't heard anything from any customers to say differently. So that is a very good sign. And in terms of the prospect list, I would say it's a bit shorter in number, but the people on that list are as active as ever. E-commerce is a big driver of those. You've read a lot about Amazon's activity across the board. We've seen signed leases this year. In order of magnitude we signed 10 leases this year compared to seven this time last year. And three of those, as Gene mentioned, came in the last several weeks. So it's a bunch of good signs with respect to the underpinning of e-commerce relative to build-to- suit. There's -- I'm not seeing any renegotiations underway and we have really good opportunities for tailwind here, given the lack of spec that you're going to see in the marketplace. So I'd say the prospect list is naturally a bit shorter, but pretty robust. And we're optimistic about the build-to-suit activity this year. Yes, there's a high percentage of our customers that we've been interacting with and that we think will qualify for the stimulus and we're seeing evidence of that already in the U. S. We've had several examples where customers initially contacted us only to call us two weeks later and say, hey, look, this stimulus kicked in. So you know, May will be a little bit of a wait and see but we expect high percentage of those customers receiving that, that activity. And then with respect to the 33 days, again as Hamid mentioned, we know our customers very well. We've had a very thorough process. We've looked at their financials, they filled out the questionnaires. And that's been our best estimate of what's going to be necessary to bridge them to the next opportunity for them. So that's where we are."

            "content": "Thanks, Gene. First and foremost, I want to echo Gene's introductory comments and wish you and your families the best of health during these challenging times. I'll briefly discuss Q1 and then take you through our updated guidance. Starting with results, core FFO for the first quarter was $0.83 a share which was in line with our pre-COVID expectations. We did recognize an expense of $5 million in the quarter or a little less than $0.01 per share related to our donation to the Prologis Foundation for COVID-19 relief efforts.  During the quarter we completed the acquisition and integration for both the IPT and Liberty portfolios. We hit our synergy targets and both portfolios are performing well and in line with our expectations. We leased 34.7 million square feet in the quarter with ending occupancy of 95.5%, down a 100 basis points sequentially as expected. Rent change on rollover remains strong at 25% and was led by the U.S. at 31%. Our share of cash same-store NOI growth was 4.6% which was about 30 basis points above our forecast.  Same-store average occupancy for the quarter was 85 basis points lower year-over-year, again, consistent our expectations. As of yesterday, we've collected 85% of April rent, which is in 1% of our normal pace. Rent due dates vary by country and about 5% of our rent isn't due until the back half of the month. As Gene noted, we've granted $18 million in rent deferrals, [$9 million] of which relates to April. All granted deferrals are structured to be repaid in 2020.  For deployment, we started $300 million in new development projects which were 85% pre-leased. Stabilizations were $690 million with an estimated margin of 39% and value creation of $270 million. Additionally, we realized more than $280 million in development gains through early April.  Looking to the balance sheet, we enter this crisis in a position of strength with significant liquidity and borrowing capacity. Liquidity at quarter end was $4.6 billion and we have cleared out our debt maturities until 2022. The combined leverage capacity of Prologis and our open-ended vehicles at levels in line with current ratings is well over $10 billion.  Turning to guidance for 2020. Our approach is twofold; first, to exercise prudence; and second, use a broader range of outcomes given the uncertainty. While the full economic impact is difficult to quantify, our guidance assumes reduced demand into the third quarter with the operating environment beginning to recover towards the end of the year. Here are the key components of our guidance on our share basis. Our cash same store NOI, we're decreasing the midpoint by 225 basis points and now expect growth to range between 1.75% and 3.25%. The decrease in the midpoint assumes average occupancy will be down a 100 basis points in range between 94.5% and 95.5%.  We expect retention to increase about 500 basis points and be in the mid 70% range. We are estimating bad debt expense to range between 100 basis points and 150 basis points of gross revenues. The midpoint of 125 basis points compares to 20 basis points of bad debt expense embedded in our prior guide. It's important to note this bad debt midpoint is on an annual basis, which means we've reserved a much higher percentage based on the remaining 2020 revenue, particularly if our positive cash collection trends continue. As we discussed in our call earlier this month, our bad debt expense peaked at 56 basis points during the GFC. At the midpoint, our annual guidance for bad debt is more than double that historical high and almost 3 times that level at the upper end of the range, again, on an annualized basis.  As Gene mentioned, we believe rent deferrals granted will amount to about 90 basis points. While we expect these deferrals to be repaid, we have factored in the potential for credit loss for the deferrals as well as elsewhere in the portfolio. We have included the impact of downtime resulting from potential bad debt in our occupancy forecast. We're assuming no rent growth for the remainder of the year. Rents for leases signed since March 1st have been about 200 basis points ahead of our expectations, while rents for lease assigned in the first two months of this year were about a 100 basis points better.  We expect rent change to be in the mid 20% range and keep in mind our in place to market rent spread is currently approximately 15%. For strategic capital, we expect revenue excluding promotes the range between $345 million and $355 million, down $5 million due to lower forecasted deployment by our funds. We are maintaining our net promote income for the full year of $0.15 per share based on quarter end valuations. The vast majority of the 2020 promote revenue will be recognized in the second quarter.  For net G&A we're forecasting a range between $270 million and $280 million, down $5 million at the midpoint. Our G&A for the year is down about $10 million due primarily to lower T&E, offset by the $5 million contribution to the Foundation. From a foreign currency standpoint, we continue to be extremely well insulated from FX movements through the next three years and our U.S. dollar net equity is over 95%.  As Gene mentioned we stopped all new speculate development and have halted construction on many spec projects that had recently started. We now expect development starts for the year to the range between $500 million and $800 million with build-to-suits comprising more than 70% of this volume. The cost to complete our active development pipeline is currently $1.6 billion.  For acquisitions and dispositions and contributions guidance, while not our expectation, we are simply forecasting no incremental activity other than a few transactions currently under contract. For net deployment uses we're now projecting $200 million at the midpoint, down $450 million from our prior guidance. The net deployment changes had a minimal impact on earnings given the timing of that activity.  Taking these assumptions into account, we are lowering our 2020 core FFO guidance midpoint by $0.11. We now expect a range between $3.55 and $3.65 per share, which includes $0.15 of net promote income. We believe we've approached the forecast quite conservatively with no assumption reasonably made more severe given what we know today. We have limited roll, dramatically reduced deployment and reserve for bad debt and multiples of the GFC. And even with that year-over-year growth at the midpoint excluding promotes remained strong at over 10%, all while keeping leverage flat.  We continue to maintain significant dividend coverage at 1.5 times and our 2020 guidance implies a payout ratio in the mid 60% range. Longer term, we feel more positive about our business given the emergence of two new structural demand drivers. First, there will be a need for more inventory as supply chains emphasize resiliency over efficiency; and second, an acceleration of e-commerce adoption.  In closing, 2020 will be a tough year for many. However, despite the uncertainty, Prologis is very well prepared. We enter this unprecedented time with the healthiest fundamentals on record, an extremely well positioned portfolio, a significant in place to market rent spread and a strong balance sheet.  And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions. Yes, Jeremy. From a bad death perspective, we looked at the portfolio across the entire stack. We looked by industry, the customer composition and we looked at it consistently across the entire portfolio. So we don't see anything unique about any of our recently acquired portfolios. Ys. So on bad debt experienced in the first quarter, we saw write-offs of 25 basis points. And in April, we've seen nothing unusual, as I talked about our April collections are trending normally, as did March. And as I mentioned, we are conservative here by almost any measure you can look at on the bad debt and we're reserved appropriately to cover a really severe downside on the AR side. No, just let me clarify. We did not actually guide on bad debt in any way and we were very careful to draw the distinction between operating performance and any kind of financial guidance. The number that we talked about 100 basis points on that call is the equivalent of the 90 basis points that Gene talked about. That is the forecast amount of total rent that is going to be subject to deferral. That is at related but not the same concept as the write off, because we fully expect obviously the ones that we have deferred to make good on that deferral. Now a portion of them will probably default. And a portion of the ones that didn't ask for a deferment could default. So the 90 basis points of deferral is very different than the 125 basis points on average of credit loss. The other thing I want to make sure you understand is that the 125 basis point is applied across the year. And certainly as you heard from Tom, the first quarter was 20 basis points and we know what that was. So we're carrying another 100 basis points of room from the first quarter into future quarters, and we've got 125 basis points to start with across the whole year. So the amount that we have reserved for anything that could default is significantly higher than what appears on the surface. Let me be even more specific. Not all tenants are going to default that are going to default are going to default on April 1st. If they default, they're likely to default during the course of the year. So on average, they're going to default in July. If you just ratably divide it, which means on that basis alone we're almost 3 times the actual number covered for default risk and default outcomes. And another way you can get at it is that in the global financial crisis, the total written off debt averaged 56 basis points annually and the midpoint this time around is 125 basis points for the remaining, more than 125 basis points for the remaining three quarters significantly higher. So we've got a scenario multiples of times of the global financial crisis factored in. So I think our portfolio is already positioned to capture that activity, number one, just given the proximity of portfolio to the consumption base and as we see the acceleration, further acceleration long-term of e-commerce trends, I think we are right there to capture that. And then on the resiliency versus efficiency comment, its clear customers will carry more inventories to protect themselves against future shocks. We'll see that and they're going to want that inventory close to the consumption base to meet consumer demands for delivery time. So I think our portfolio today is positioned and we're going to continue to build out our land bank and further solidify our portfolio. I think you cut off, but I get the gist of your question. On social distancing, I think there are certain categories of our customers that their businesses will continue to suffer like the people servicing the convention trade and hospitality, I think -- or airlines, I think those businesses will continue to suffer. If you mean what is it mean in terms of the actual occupants of our buildings, the people who work in our building. The most people intensive operations that we have are the e-commerce players and you have read the same things I have about Amazon and other e-commerce players, and some of the controversy that's been out there. But I think those companies have been very responsible actually in terms of not only providing a lot of employment during this difficult time, but also having a lot of controls in terms of checking people's temperatures. And now I understand they're going to go to some pretty regular testing, serology testing. So, I think they're doing the best they can to actually get people back to business. So you and I can actually get our groceries and other things. And I actually commend them for that. With respect to the share buyback program, you know we did buyback $35 million of stock when the stock got into the 60s. And we felt that that was a very, very significant discount to NAV and it was a compelling opportunity. And to be honest with you, after doing that I changed my mind and then thought the perception of that is not going to be great. So we took all the profits that we made there and our intention is to put all those profits back into the Prologis foundation, and it was a pretty substantial amount of profit. So I think actually we're going to do some good with it going forward. But we haven't, I haven't fully thought through the perception of it and -- but we made some money and we're going to spend it for a good cause. This is Tom, Sumit. On the lease terminations, there's nothing unique, they're episodic. And what we saw in Q1 was not particularly unusual. It was just related to a tenant's needs and we helped them out in another space as well. There were couples like that. So it's episodic. There's no trending that we see with termination fees being foreshadowing any other type of activity. I just don't see it. Well, first of all, I don't think I gave you a forecast for market rent. I was very careful to tell you, let me tell you actually what has happened. And I distinguish between the activity in January and February, which was up 1% compared to our expectations versus March that was up 2%. But our forecast don't incorporate rents going up, we basically pushed that out for the balance of this year. And as someone else pointed out, we haven't issued guidance for next year but we do think there's going to be a snap back next year that's going to result in rent growth. If you were going ask me right now, it's not a fully baked idea. So our official view on rent growth is that it's flat for the year and we're writing out some rent growth. So you can think of it as a slight decline or something, but we're not smart enough to be able to forecast those things with precision. The good news is that market rent growth has very little to do with our numbers in the near future. We have only 8% of the space that rolls over and we have 15% mark to market and a greater amount on the ones that roll over this year. So really what drives rent and operating results is the mark-to-market and the small percentage of rollover. So I don't think it's going to be a big deal. Eric, honestly, I'm really surprised with your question. Have we talked to any customers? That just really blows me away. We are very customer centric. We have a Chief Customer Officer, who in addition, as part of the executive team, who spends all his time and a dedicated team talking to our major customers. And we have over 500 customer facing people in the field that are in constant dialog with our customers. So yes, we do speak to our customers quite a bit. As to economic forecast, I don't spend a lot of time looking at economic forecasts, because I've seen much smarter people than Prologis have forecasts that are down 5% a year and some that have down 40% this year. So I don't know what it is. I just look at customer behavior when we forecast our business. And yes, in the long term, our business is completely correlated with consumption, which is highly correlated with economic growth or decline. But in the short term, the dynamics of e-commerce, the stay at home economy and the need to carry more inventory overwhelm those kinds of longer term considerations. Yes, your other question on the rent deferrals and the accounting analysis of that. So the way we're structuring our rent deferrals is extending the payment term. And as we mentioned, the payment term, the due dates are within 2020. We certainly expect them to be paid, but the whole analysis on the collectability when you book that revenue, you gain that revenue to be collectible and that's just assessment. So this is relating to April revenue that's being deferred and you make the assessment in April as to the collectability of that revenue and you either book that revenue or you book a reserve, or portion reserve against that based on your assessment of collectability. And then regarding the ramping or what is earnings look like from a quarterly perspective, clearly, Q2 will be heavily influenced by the promote, because that's when the bulk of that will land. And then it's really a function of what we see, quite frankly, from a bad debt experience. As we said, we've got a lot of bad debt reserve that's sitting there for the rest of the year. And I think our results are going to move relative to what happens there. On the appraisals, what we've seen in the first quarter appraisals is that generally the numbers are up very slightly but the appraiser is like 1% or 2% quarterly. And appraisers have basically stickered the appraisals as they normally do and markets with turmoil that talk about that there are no cons et cetera, et cetera. But the real answer on that is that because promotes are such a sensitive calculation to the terminal value, these are generally three year promotes. And if you move around the terminal value a little bit the promotes can move around we're generally very conservative and projecting and guiding promotes. And we feel like we've got sufficient room to absorb any kind of a downside there. The other thing I would say is that more than half of the projected promote is a hold back of promote from three years ago, and the amount of which was determined and calculated and is known and that number will not change. So a big portion of that number we know exactly what it is more than 50%. So to the extent there's variabilities on that last I would say 40% of it, 60% of it is backed. We are chickens and chickens live longer. I mean, when the world is going or falling off the cliff and everybody's talking about GDP going down 40% this quarter or whatever. We had some spec developments, we can try them anytime, they're entitled they're ready to go. And if we see the demand, we'll start them two months later. We're not saying that that's our forecast. We're saying every quarter we've got to get in front of you guys and give you some assessment of what we think is going to happen. And this is a very turbulent time. I think the fact that we've even put out a guidance and by the way, we don't have an advantage of looking at all the other people and figuring out what they're doing to sort of tailor our message accordingly. We're going back first and we got to stick our neck out. And we have and we've given a range. But we have taken a conservative approach, saying that we're not going to deploy any new capital on discretionary starts of speculative projects, and we're not going to buy anything at yesterday's prices. If prices become different, for sure we're going to use our resources. We have over $10 billion, $11 billion of capacity between the funds and the balance sheet, and we will certainly start those developments once there is leasing that we feel really comfortable about going forward. But we can't predict that, there is no cost to waiting, there's only upside in waiting. So we've covered the downside. We're still well positioned for the upside. And it's not intended to be a forecast. It's just a prudent thing to do. And I hope we're wrong about that and we'll do closer to what we have planned on doing before. But we're not going to get over our skis."

            "name": "Eugene Reilly",
            "content": "Thanks, Tracy. We appreciate everyone joining us today and we hope you and yours are all well. We're glad to report that our teams are healthy and working productively on a remote basis. Our first quarter was very strong in all types of the business and Tom will cover these details. I'm going to focus on what we're seeing right now and our outlook for the year. While we are just 30 to 90 days into the COVID economy, we are seeing short-term effects play out very differently across our customer industry sectors. At this time, roughly 60% of our customers are growing and 40% are shrinking.  Next week Chris Caton will be issuing his fourth COVID white paper specifically on this topic of customer demand segmentation. At the extreme ends of the spectrum categories like food and beverage and consumer staples have sales up significantly; and conversely, cloth and sporting goods and home furnishings are all down sharply.  Our customers in contraction are going through a short-term shock, some will recover fairly quickly, others face a longer transition to normalcy, and unfortunately certain businesses will not survive. At the same time, the pandemic has led to significant growth for the industries I mentioned, serving the stay at home economy. And we continue to experience elevated e-commerce demand, a 40% share of new leasing versus 23% pre-crisis.  With the benefit of customer dialogue and applied research, we factored in tailwinds and headwinds to arrive at our revised 2020 earnings guidance. Our portfolio quality, customer composition and balance sheet strength are mitigating the headwinds and our disciplined efforts to dispose off $15 billion of non-strategic assets over the past several years, that is paying dividends today.  Turning to the long-term impacts, we believe some of the changes brought on by the pandemic will be durable. COVID is very likely to accelerate a share shift from brick and mortar to e-commerce retail. We also believe the growing importance of safety stock will lead to higher global inventory levels over time. These trends will increase demand for logistics real estate in the long-term, but will also have a positive effect on 2020 activity and we're already seeing this. Chris and his team have updated our forecast for logistics real estate market fundamentals and now expect the following for full year 2020.  In the U.S. supply will total 225 million square feet, an 18% year over year decline. U.S. net absorption will total a 100 million square feet, the lowest level since 2010 and a 55% year-over-year decline driving the vacancy rate up 90 basis points to 5.4%. Europe will have similar reductions in the supply and demand resulting in a 130 basis point vacancy rate increase to 5.2%. Japan's vacancy rate will increase from a record low of 1.4% to 2.8%. In summary, occupancies in all geographies will decline but also end the year at very healthy levels historically.  Our proprietary leasing data shows that the spike in leasing activities we witnessed in March, and talked you all about a couple of weeks ago, has settled down. We are now seeing volumes generally in line with historical trends. Forward-looking data continues to be encouraging.  During the last 30 days we signed 198 leases amounting to 17.5 million square feet, that's up 21% year-over-year and roughly flat adjusted for portfolio size. Our lease proposal generations are up 21% year-over-year. Lease negotiation gestation periods for new leases have declined by about 14 days year-over-year and retention was just over 80%, a couple hundred basis points higher than comparable historical periods.  After slicing the data in several different ways, we see three clear themes at this point. First, essential consumer product sectors are driving the demand. Second, e-commerce is driving demand across industry sectors. And third, our larger customers are fairing much better than smaller customers in this environment.  Now an update on rent relief requests, growth has slowed here. And to-date, we have received requests representing 4.3% of gross annual rent. Of these requests, 70% were not granted, 23% remain under review and 7% have been granted in the form of rent deferral loans representing 27 basis points of gross annual rent and an average of about 33 days of rent per customer.  As mentioned on our last call, this release is targeted at our smaller customers with legitimate need stemming from COVID and not through opportunistic requests. We believe the total rent deferral loans granted will eventually amount to about 90 basis points of gross annual rent with these loans scheduled for repayment over the remainder of 2020.  Turning to the strategic capital business, our investors remain very positive on the logistics real estate sector. As noted on our last call, the vast majority of redemptions to-date were in progress prior to COVID-19 and there appears to be good secondary market interest for some portion of the redemption activity, but to-date we have seen no trades on the secondary market. Next I would like to provide some context for the updated capital deployment guidance Tom detail in a moment. This guidance assumes virtually no incremental activity in acquisitions, dispositions, speculative development or contributions. Rather than to speculate on future market conditions, we are guiding to volumes that have largely been accomplished already. Most of the volume predicted between now and the year end is build-to-suit activity where the pipeline remains active with multiple leases signed post-COVID actually.  We continue to work closely with customers and municipalities on 30 ongoing projects in 14 markets. Construction continues on 22 of these projects with eight having been halted by local authorities. And to-date we have yet to stop a project at the request of a customer.  While our current leasing data is holding up very well and we see extremely encouraging trends with e-commerce leasing, we're planning on a reduced demand environment through the end of 2020. We will have opportunities to serve our customer segments in expansion mode and we will need to support others not so fortunate.  We expect to serve as a reliable alternative for build-to-suit customers, take advantage of investment opportunities as they emerge and manage our strategic capital vehicles prudently and opportunistically in this environment.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom. Okay. I'll -- Jeremy, I may have Tom comment on the last question. But in terms of the sort of the composition of what's happening on the demand front, I mean probably it's really more industry segment and size segment than any particular geography. Obviously our Houston operation is facing headwinds from both COVID and plummeting oil prices. So that's our toughest market right now. But otherwise, the industry segments I mentioned are strongest. And clearly in this environment, smaller customers are having a tougher time than larger. And with respect to the -- one of the market I'd probably throw in there is Atlanta, which, in Atlanta we actually have a fairly high percentage of our smaller customers as well. So Tom, I don't know if you want to take the... I think our business is going to be somewhat slower before the vaccine and much higher after the vaccine. So you tell me when the vaccine is going to come through, which is a real permanent solution and I'll tell you how that makes us going to work for the year. So Jamie, let me first make a distinction. Smaller tenants don't necessarily mean smaller companies that occupy those spaces. So you got to distinguish between the mom and pops and smaller locations for creditworthy company. So not all small tenants are under pressure. Secondly, the -- if you're a contractor or a supplier to a residential construction or some kind of an auto related use, for sure your business is down and you're going to be struggling in this environment. Too soon to tell how the government support is going to help. But at least on the levels of support that we've talked about so far, I don't think it fully replaces the revenue and the margins that they've lost during this period. But I can tell you, a lot of the demand for their products is deferred demand.  And if they can make it through this crisis, I think they'll be the beneficiary of the spring back, on the other side of this. So, tough to tell. The stimulus has been in place for a little less than two weeks. But also the other thing I would say is that there is a ton of monetary stimulus, on top of the fiscal stimulus that's come in. So -- and the attitude that I see with the banking system this time around because the banks are -- and you guys by the way, would know better than I would because you work for a lot of banks, but the banks are oftentimes -- well, they're certainly better capitalized and people seem to be much more cooperative in terms of working with their customers by accommodating them. Because everybody realizes that this is not anybody's problem. It's something that happened differently. This is a definite change in attitude with the government, fiscal, monetary, and with the banking system that's distributing the funds. So I think they're going to work with their customers, including the smaller ones, but some of them unfortunately won't make it. Let me pick up on the rent growth question and then I'll pitch it over to Tom for the first part of your question on credit loss. Let me give you the facts on rent growth. Rent growth in January and February were a 100 basis points higher than what we had projected for those specific spaces. Rent growth for March surprisingly was 200 basis points higher than what we had projected for those spaces. So, so far we haven't seen evidence of rental decline or deceleration in growth.  However, we've assumed that in the forecast that Tom shared with you, because absent perfect information, you got to be conservative with respect to rental growth forecast. So those are two specific data points. The third data point I'll give you is that we have projected certain grants for the two acquired portfolios, IPT and LPT. And in both cases the spaces that we've rolled over have been on the range of 4% to 5% higher rents than we had forecast for those portfolios late last year when we underwrote them.  Tom, you want to talk about the credit loss? I do, I don't know what, Chris, thinks. But again, snapbacks is not going to happen until everybody's got the all clear signal on the health front. [Multiple Speakers] Everybody talks about the government, when are they going to put people back to work and open up the country for business and all these demonstrations that we see, that's got nothing to do with it. Even if they open up the place for business, a lot of people will have to go back to work and will, but the lot of people who don't have to go to work won't. So I don't think the government action is going to be the trigger for that. I think the all clear is going to have to come from the health front. So the only thing I would add to Tom's answer is that it's a billion square foot portfolio. And in our business unlike the office business, there's not a lot of lease termination fee anyway. So it's one of those things where a very small number could have increased by a large percentage and it's still a very small number, and those things moved around by very specific decision. Keep in mind we have 15% spread to market and that spread, if anything, is still there and maybe as we expanded a little bit. So sometimes the lease terminations are an opportunity for us to make some money on buying out a tenant and actually make some more money by re-leasing the space.  So lease terminations are not necessarily bad in our business and they're minuscule in the scale of the portfolio. And I apologize if we don't remember every single one of them. We have over 8,000 leases. And just kind as to the last question, as you heard in our update call and I think you heard somewhere today about 20% to 25% of our customer base at some point has had a discussion with respect to some kind of rent deferral. And of course on those we've granted a very small portion of it. We expect to ultimately maybe grant 30% and today it's more like 5%. So that alone means we've had direct discussion with 25% of the customer base. Well, on a billion square foot portfolio that's 250 million square feet. So we've had conversations, multiple sizes of many, many big companies in the sector with our customers, just about that topic during this period of time. So yes, we're really talking to customers all the time. Yes, on the on shoring. So most of the stuff is going to get onshore from China and possibly from Mexico to the U. S. at least with respect to the U. S. and with respect to Europe, I don't think that much is going to change. It's probably going to be China shifting to European production. And as you know, our Chinese strategy, first of all, it's a very, very small part of our portfolio. It's about 1.5% of our income is in China. And secondly, it's totally focused towards domestic consumption. We learnt very quickly that the export business doesn't generate a lot of industrial demand, because containers are the warehouse. So to the extent that there's more on shoring in the consumption markets, the U. S. and Europe, I'm not counting on it but by definition, that's incremental demand on top of the consumption demand. So it should help on the margin. And the reason we haven't really factored in it is that those are likely to go to really lower cost locations and where real estate is cheap and labor is cheap, and we're really well positioned for the infill large urban market. So likely you're not going to put a plant to on shore in downtown San Francisco or any place like that, or LA, you're going to go to a cheaper environment. So I think it will be important positive for U. S. and European demand. But I'm not sure we, because of our geography, are going to be the biggest beneficiaries of that. I think people who are in more remote locations will probably benefit from that. Tom, you want to take the other part of the question? The only thing that I would add John to that is that prior to these adjustments, downward adjustments, our year-over-year growth was on the order of I think 13%, 14% FFO growth, 14% FFO growth, actually. And that's a big number. So it's come down 4%. So maybe another way of asking your question is how come your guidance previously was so high and still is high. And the reason for that is primarily that the volume of development starts in prior years that we're just having capitalized interest in them are now coming on, and there are a lot of built of suits in those and those are now fully income producing. So we had them in the denominator as capital expenditures where we weren't earning a whole lot on them. And as they stabilized and they're leased those extra earnings are coming online. So it has nothing to do with this changed environment. It was just high to start with because of that and remains pretty healthy. I mean, I think 10% growth year-over-year even in the strongest environments without increasing leverage. Well, let me just answer the second part of the question, which is the experience in the last 30 days of leasing. We have seen more leasing in the bigger size segments so we'll happy to clarify that for you later on but definitely bigger customers. Well, we've had a half of experience on the two latest acquisitions. And Tom, last time we talked about this couple of days ago, we were up about 5% on our underwriting of those portfolios based on activity that's already taking place. So we feel really good about it. Oh, sure, Houston energy is worse than we thought and Liberty had a pretty significant presence in Houston, and we did too but again it is a billion square foot portfolio. And on the other hand, Pennsylvania has done a lot better than we thought previously, because a lot of the New York adjacent demand and the big boxes have, for some strange reason, taking up a lot of space in Pennsylvania. So that's looking better and that's actually a bigger portfolio. So net, net all the reasons for which we did those investments that we articulated before stand. And on top of that, they've just performed better than we expected, so that's a really good start. I don't know whether that will continue for the next 10 years, but it's better to be 5% ahead of the game than behind the game when you're getting off the block. Does that answer your question? Let's give him an opportunity to ask it again, because it was a complicated question. So if  we didn't answer it, ask it again. Yes, I think we will get a significant increase in occupancy the quarter or the quarter after the vaccine is likely available, maybe even when it's announced and it's definite that it's coming, based on the anticipation of it coming. So you tell me again the date and I'll tell you when that will be. From everything I hear, it's going to be more like next summer-ish, although, there's some really positive developments that I've been hearing about from the scientific community. I mean, we've got a couple of really big medical centers here and I'm in constant dialog with them. And on the therapeutic side, there's some really good stuff happening that we may even hear about in the August, September timeframe. So I think that's when the occupancies will turn around. In terms of the cracks, I would say as I guess Warren Buffett says we'll find out who's been swimming naked as the tide recedes. There are some people that have been, mostly on the private side, by the way, I'm pretty proud of my public brethren by enlarge they've really behaved well throughout the cycle. And I think everybody's kind of pretty disciplined in the sector. But there are a couple of private players, particularly in parts of Europe, Central and Eastern Europe being good example that have really gotten out there on their skis and we'll see what happens. Maybe they're really good skiers. But I would say of all the cycles I've seen, whether it's the \u201887 collapse or the SNL crisis or dot com or the GSV, I would say there is less of that around much, less of that around than any one of those cycles. I think we are over our time allotment, and we've taken way too much of your time this quarter with two calls. So let me thank you for your interest in the company and invite you to our next quarterly call. And hopefully, we'll all be much more optimistic than we are in this environment. And everyone stay healthy. Take care."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Prologis Q4 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Jill Sawyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJill Sawyer: Thanks Brent, and good morning, everyone. I am standing in for Tracy today. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our fourth quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we will hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam; Gary Anderson; Chris Caton; Mike Curless Dan Letter; Ed Nekritz; Gene Reilly; and Colleen Mckeown are also with us today.  With that, I will turn the call over to Tom. Tom, will you please begin?\nThomas Olinger: Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. The fourth quarter closed at a year of record setting activity across our business. Core FFO was $1.12 per share, with net promote earnings of $0.05. For the full year, core FFO was $4.15 per share, with net promote earnings of $0.06. Excluding promotes, core FFO grew 14% year-over-year. Net effective rent change on rollover accelerated to 33%, up 510 basis points sequentially and was led by the U.S. at over 37%. Average occupancy was 97.4%, up 80 basis points sequentially. Cash same-store NOI growth remained strong at 7.5% for the quarter and 6.1% for the full year. I want to point out that we're modifying our in place to market rent disclosure to standardize this metric among what logistics REITs. This collaboration is an extension of the work we've done to harmonize other property operating metrics. We have a collectively defined net effective lease mark-to-market of our operating portfolio as the growth rate from in-place rents to market rents. This now aligns with how rent change on rollover is expressed. Using this new definition consistently applied our net effective lease mark-to-market at year-end jumped almost 800 basis points sequentially to 36%. This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI of more than $1.2 billion or $1.55 per share that we will capture without any further market rank growth. Turning to Strategic Capital. This business continues to drive tremendous growth and value. In Q4, we completed the early windup of our highly successful UKLV venture. UKLV's $1.7 billion of operating assets were contributed to our PELP and PELP ventures. We earned net promote income of $0.05 in connection with the closeout of this venture and our percentage of infinite life vehicles has consequently grown to 95% of our $66 billion of third-party assets under management. For the year, our team raised $4.4 billion of third-party equity. After drawing down $1.9 billion in our open ended funds for acquisitions during the year equity queues stood at a record $4 billion at year-end. On the deployment front, we had a very productive and profitable year. Development starts totaled $3.6 billion, with margins of 32%. We continue to maintain a long development runway with a land portfolio able to support $26 billion of future starts. Stabilizations totaled to $2.5 billion with estimated value creation of $1.3 billion and average margin of 53%, both all time highs. Realized development gains were $817 million for the year, also an all time high. These results are the product of our highly disciplined team and an incredibly strong operating environment. For our customers, the importance of the health of their supply chain and the real estate that underpins it has never been so critical. We believe the current global supply chain challenges will continue well beyond this year. Fortunately, the scale of our 1 billion square foot portfolio puts us in a unique position to help our customers address these current supply chain challenges. This includes shortening construction delivery times by navigating raw material shortages and leveraging our Essentials platform to procure warehouse equipment and services, so our customers can focus on their core operations. We're also investing in technology and talent to support our industry leading sustainability objectives, including our efforts around renewable energy. Market dynamics today are highly favorable and demand has never been stronger. During the quarter, we signed 62 million square feet of leases and issued proposals on 90 million square feet. Demand is diverse across a range of industry end customers. E-commerce made up 19% of our new leasing this quarter, with further broadening of customer diversity. We signed 357 new leases with 265 unique e-commerce customers in 2021, both of which are high watermarks. Demand is fueled by three forces. First, overall consumption and demographic growth require our customers to expand. Second, customer supply chains are still repositioning to address the massive shift to e-commerce, as well as preparing for higher growth and service expectations. And third, they need to create more resiliency in supply chains. The inventory to sales ratios are more than 10% below pre-pandemic levels. Our customers not only need to restock at this 10% shortfall, but build additional safety stock of 10% or greater. This combination has the potential to produce 800 million square feet or more of future demand in the U.S. alone. Collectively these forces have placed a premium on speed to market and flexibility driving demand for years to come. From a supply perspective, construction underway in the U.S. is approximately 70% preleased, which is well above the historical average. We believe demand will balance out with supply in 2022 and vacancy rates will remain at record lows in both our U.S. and international markets. Competition for limited availabilities produced yet another quarter of record rent and value growth. In the fourth quarter, rents in our portfolio grew 5.7% globally, and 6.5% in the U.S. bringing full year growth to records 18% and 20% respectively, far exceeding our initial forecast. This growth paired with continued compression and cap rates is translating to record valuation increases. Our portfolio posted its highest quarterly value increase rising more than 12.5% globally, bringing the full year increase to a remarkable 39%. Now moving to guidance for 2022. Here are the components are on an our share basis. We expect cash same-store NOI growth to range between 6% and 7%, and average occupancy to range between 96.5% to 97.5%. We are forecasting rent growth in our markets to be 11% in the U.S. and 10% globally. For Strategic Capital, we expect revenue excluding promotes to range between $540 million and $560 million. We expect net promote income of $0.55 per share for the year, almost all of which will occur in the third quarter and is driven by our PELP venture. While a record, given the significant increase in rents and valuations, we would expect to see similar or higher promote levels in 2023. In response to continued strong demand, we are forecasting development starts of $4.5 billion to $5 billion with approximately 35% build-to-suits. Dispositions will range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion, two-thirds of which we expect to close this quarter. We're forecasting net deployment uses of $2.3 billion at the midpoint, which we plan to fund with $1.6 billion of free cash flow after dividends and a modest increase in leverage. We project core FFO, including the $0.55 of net promote income, to range between $5 and $5.10 share, representing 22% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.45 and $4.55 per share or year- over-year growth of 10% at the midpoint. Since our investor forum in 2019, our three-year earnings CAGR has been 13% excluding promotes, well ahead of the 8% to 9% CAGR forecast we originally provided. Before closing out, I want to spend a minute on the quality of our earnings drivers and differentiator, which set Prologis apart from other real estate companies. We continue to drive strong organic growth and aren't reliant upon external growth to achieve sector leading results. In fact, approximately 75% of the increase to our core FFO for 2022, excluding promotes is derived from organic growth, principally same-store NOI and Strategic Capital fee related earnings. It's important to point out that in 2022, our Strategic Capital revenue including promotes will be over $1 billion, a new milestone. This high margin business generates very durable fee stream with asset management fees marked to fair values each quarter all while requiring minimal capital. In addition, we see growing earnings from our Essentials business, which allows us to expand our services and solutions beyond rent. When we introduce this business back in 2018, we set a target of $300 million from procurement savings and Essentials revenue. We will hit that target this year with more than $225 million from procurement and $75 million from Essentials. In light of our success with procurement and the fact that we have embedded this initiative into our platform, we will not provide specific procurement reporting going forward, instead focusing on Essentials. We also have a long development runway of $26 billion, much of which comes from our international opportunity set, positioning us for continued strong value creation well into the future. Lastly, these differentiators are all underpinned by the lowest cost of capital among REITs and unmatched scale that minimizes operating costs. In closing, while 2021 was a year of many records, the bulk of the benefit from the current environment will be realized in the future, providing a clear, tangible runway for sector leading growth for many years to come. We are confident our best years are still ahead of us. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. I wanted to ask if you could provide some color on the yields on development starts, which compressed 50 basis points sequential this quarter. I'm pretty sure this does not include the uplifting market rental growth of 10% you're expecting this year, but I just wanted to double check that the case. But also was wondering how you view development yields and cap rates trending this year in the rising rate environment.\nThomas Olinger: Yeah. So, the answer to your question is yes. We have not included the forecasted rent. So, we underwrite based on what we see currently. So, we're -- in this environment we're seeing returns compress. You should expect to see some compression in the development yield. Now mix also has a lot to do that -- with that. And that's something we can check out and maybe get back to you guys in the call down. In terms of cap of trends, I don't think you want to pay any attention to our forecast since we've been consistently wrong for the last five years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.\nEmmanuel Korchman: Hey, good morning. In terms of your ramping start guidance and commentary from lots of other competitors in the logistic space, when should people start worrying about the amount of supply coming? And maybe an easy way to answer that is how much of your starts are preleased, or do you expect to get preleased over the next couple months and sort of a switch that supply issue?\nThomas Olinger: Well, I'll start then Chris will have some data for you too, Manny. I think every year we've all forecasted the supply exceeding demand and we yet have to see that happen after the global financial crisis. It will happen in some year. I just don't know whether it's this coming year or some other year, but I've never seen 70% preleasing in 40 years of doing this in the development portfolio. And also, the interest in built-to-suits, I think is a pretty good indication that the product just isn't there. And I'm willing to bet this is a counterfactual, but I'm willing to bet if there were more supply, there would be more absorption of more demand. People simply cannot get the space that they need. But I think it will be several years. And the other thing you need to pay attention to is that overall supply numbers are interesting, but our portfolio is very differentiated in terms of the markets -- high barrier markets that our portfolio lives in. And let's not forget about overseas, because the dynamic overseas in terms of supply are very different than they are in the U.S. So, I think it's a complicated soup. I'm not trying to avoid your answer, but that's not on the first page of my worry list. It will be at some point, but it's not this year and I don't think it's going to be next year, Chris?\nChris Caton: Yeah. Sure, Manny. So, the numbers for this year look very strong market environment, 375 to 400 million square feet of both delivery and net absorption in our 30 markets. That'll leave the market vacancy rate at an ultra low all-time record 3.4%, 3.5% vacancy. So, very low. Now this is especially true in our U.S. global markets where we have an overweight strategy. In those markets the under construction pipeline is just 3% of stock and is 70% preleased. 2021 net absorption, so demand was 14% higher than that under construction pipeline. Now by comparison, our regional markets have 4.8% of their markets under construction. So, our global markets are 180 basis points better. 2021 demand that net absorption was 12% below this under construction pipeline in the regional markets. So, our global markets are 25% better.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thanks for that color. Just -- as you think about when supply chain -- well, first -- the first question, where are we, or how much longer before you think supply chains, do you start to smooth out, but I guess even more importantly, because that's probably impossible to take a date. What is warehouse demand look like when supply chains too smooth out? So, of the type of demand that Tom outlined, the different categories of demand, when supply chains smooth out how much of that goes away?\nHamid Moghadam: Okay. I think Tom answered your second question, but let me take another stab at it. We know this is a fact, it's not opinion that supply -- that inventory levels -- in terms of inventory to sales ratios are 10 points below what they were prior to the pandemic. And the reason for that is that people are sitting at home and the goods economy has been on fire and people are buying a lot of stuff and not spending as much money on experience, et cetera. So that dynamic will change. But regardless, that 10% will have to snap back to a normal level. And that's a source for demand. In addition to that, as we outlined in a paper that we put at almost the year and a half ago now, we believe there is -- at that time, we thought 5% to 10%; today, we would say 10% to 15% more demand. In other words, higher inventory to sales ratio than normal or pre-pandemic, because of the need for resilience. And where -- where's that number come from, it come from all the customers that we talk to every day. So, between where we are now and where we think we're going to end up being, there is a 20% to 25% swing in inventories. That is huge. And it is not driven by the fact that there's a bunch of inventories sitting around, certainly not in the U.S. and maybe sitting around in some plant somewhere, but in the U.S., there's no inventory around for it to go away. That's the problem. And that's what's creating the supply chain problem. Now there were a lot of people smarter than me who predicted that the supply chain problems will be -- would've been over by Christmas or after Christmas. That is not the case. All they're doing is they're parking the ships further into the Pacific so that the visual is not as concerning, if you will, as it would've been, too many 60 minute stories on that, that concern the politicians, but that's not the only indication of a supply chain problem. I mean, you could have a product that has 50 different parts going into it. And until the last part gets there, you can't ship that product. So that's a supply chain problem. The fact that you can't get trackers to pick up the goods from ports or transport them from point A to point B, that's a supply chain problem. I think all of those things are going to take multiple years to result themselves. So, I think we're going to be in this mode for a while.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nCraig Mailman: Hey, everyone. Tom, I kind of want to go back to your commentary. You guys traditionally had said 8% to 9% FFO growth, X promotes. The CAGR since the Investor Day has been 13%. And I believe you guys are already kind of at 10% with initial guidance here. I mean, in this part of the cycle where market rent growth continues to be underestimated, your mark-to-market grows, you're unleashing a little bit of the balance sheet with higher leverage here in that $2.5 million of uses here, kind of how should we think about maybe this point in the cycle trend till we get an inflection and how long could that last?\nThomas Olinger: Hey, Craig. So, I think you're asking what's 8% to 9% -- if it was 8% to 9% back in 2019, has that changed today? And yes, it's changed. And I think for several reasons. And it gets back to the differentiators I talked about in my script, but I'll start with same-store. My memory is that the same-store embedded in that Investor Day was 3.5% to 4.5%. And that had \u2026\nHamid Moghadam: It was actually 3% growth on top of 3% growth in market rent, up at the mark-to-market that existed there. And I don't remember what that was. It was in the teen certain.\nThomas Olinger: Yeah. Under the -- our new methodology, I think that we were about 18%, give or take. Today we're at 36%, so almost double. Right? So, you can think about that ratchet -- that in-place to market alone is going to ratchet up our same-store growth by more than 100 basis points, up to 150 basis points. So, you can think about that level of same-store for several years, because that 36% in-place to market growth is an average. So think about what it's going to be over the next year or two, should be higher, right? Because you're going to be rolling leases higher. And that 36% is not stopping. If you look at our guidance, right, for rent growth for the year and rent change, I would expect to see that in-place to market build by the time we get to 2020 -- and then 2022, it's going to -- I think it's going to cross the 40% mark. So that same-store is going to continue to grow and it's going -- it's not a one or two-year story. It's two, three, four, five-year story. And again, that's what market rents not growing the 36%, that's number one. Second would be think about our Strategic Capital business, how we are scaling in that business, how our fees are growing without promotes, right? We saw asset values increase 39% overall for the year. Well guess what? That increases asset values in our funds and our asset management fees increase as well. So, that business is continuing to scale and contribute. And then when you look at our Essentials business, we expect -- we talked that Investor Day about that business, adding 50 basis points of growth, kind of $0.02. I think we're going to be well ahead of that. So, I could go on with differentiators, but, that 8% to 9%, the new normal is I think what you're staring down with our core results this year.\nHamid Moghadam: Craig, let me add two things to what Tom said, all of which I agree with. Number one, you actually got our same-store right, better than most people including us. So, congratulations on that -- on that for the past. But going forward, look, the market is really good and all kinds of different portfolios, regardless of their strategies will do well in an environment where rents are going up and cap rates are compressing. But we are thinking way beyond that. I mean, Tom mentioned Essentials, we have significant expectations for that business. Look at our labor, CWI business, that is becoming -- we did it as a service to customers, but it's quickly turning into a potential profit center. We have now put together a group to invest in the EV charging. And we have actually committed to our first project in Southern California for EV charging on trucks. The ROIs on that business are off the charts. So, we're not -- and by the way, I could go on for another 20 minutes talking about the stuff that's in the pipeline. So, we're not sitting and just praying for the real estate aspects of our business. The most valuable aspect of our business is the billion square feet of customers that we serve that are in need of lots of other things. So, we're really excited about the long-term prospects. We didn't have that in 2019. Those things were glimmer in our eye. Now they're real businesses producing real bottom line. So, that's why I'm pretty optimistic about the future going forward.  And remember all of that is being done with sub 20% leverage. And external growth, yeah, we have more external growth than anybody, but in relation to the size of our portfolio, external growth is almost an afterthought. We don't need to depend on that. I'd say in my opinion, lower quality source of growth because you're just arbitraging external capital to the internal cost capital. Ours is organic. So, really, really not only feel good about the level of growth on forward, but also the quality of that growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ron Kamdem, your line is open.\nRonald Kamdem: Yeah. Thanks so much for the time. Congrats on the quarter. Just thinking about the same-store NOI guidance for 2022, any more color on maybe the U.S. versus Europe? And maybe can you compare and contrast, how you expect sort of growth for next year in the two regions? Thanks.\nThomas Olinger: Yeah. I'll throw in some thoughts on rent growth. Rent growth in Europe is catching up to the U.S. And we've seen this play out in the past. And frankly it's catching up slower than we expected, because vacancy rates across Europe haven't been lower than the U.S., but that's taking place now. And I think we and Chris ought to pile in here. This year we'll see European rent growth that I think will exceed that U.S.\nChris Caton: Indeed, the vacancy rates are lower and the rent growth is accelerating. So, it's an interesting point in time in the European markets.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jon Petersen with Jeffries. Your line is open.\nJonathon Petersen: Thank you. Just wanted to ask an accounting question. On the promote income, is that considered reincome or is that in the taxable REIT subsidiary? And if it is reincome, is that going to necessitate a large for a potentially a special dividend this year, just given the size of the promotes?\nThomas Olinger: The vast majority of it does come into the REIT itself versus the taxable REIT subsidiary. When you think just about dividends, as we've talked about in the past, we are -- we have extremely low payout ratio, 60%-ish is what we've been averaging and similar to what I would expect for 2022. And we're paying out the minimum required. So, you should think about our dividend having to grow in line with our underlying earnings. So, when you see earnings growing at 22%, those promotes our landing in the op in our REIT and needs to be reflected in our dividend accordingly.\nOperator: Your next question is from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. In terms of the guidance for this year on Strategic Capital and the promotes, Tom, can you just give us to feel for what level of asset value appreciation is assumed for the funds this year?\nThomas Olinger: Sure, Nick. So, what -- I'll preface it by, there are several factors that go into the promote, not just real estate valuation, there's FX considerations because it's a euro denominated fund, but that fund also has functional currencies, not in euro, British pound, for example, right? So, there's FX activity going on functional and transactional -- transitional. Second would be there's depth mark-to-market in there. So, longwinded way of saying that there are a lot of factors that, that impact it. From a evaluation standpoint, we think there's some modest, mid single digit valuation increase embedded in there. We're taking our best shot at where it's going to land. A lot of variables can impact it. And we're going to update you accordingly as those move around, particularly given how this -- how -- once you -- once the promote exceeds that top hurdle, you can have a lot of variability in either direction, just depending on how things go. So, funds -- based on third-party appraisals, they're going to be what they're going to be. Interest rates are going to be what they're going to be. FX rates are going to be what they're going to be. We've taken their best shot at estimating those impacts. And we'll keep you posted.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. The other thing I would add to that is that we're not assuming cap rate compression. And based on today's values I would say there's appraisal lag built into some of these valuations because the appraisers have a hard time keeping up with comps. Even today the market's been so fast moving. So, I think there are a couple of layers of protection built in that. And obviously, as Tom explained, once you pass the waterfall, all of the additional values promotable. So, there's a lot of leverage on the upside and also on the downside. But if I were betting person, I would take the upside on that, not the downside.\nOperator: Your next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Your line is open.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good morning. I guess a follow-up on the remote question. Thanks for the color on 2020 repromotes. How should we look at this stream of income over the next few years? And should we be valuing promotes at a higher multiple historical given kind of the recurring -- increasing recurring nature and the growth of the valuation of the portfolio.\nHamid Moghadam: Let me take a stab at this. The issue with our promotes is this, we have two huge open-ended funds that are promotable and those are on three years promote cycle. So, 2022 and 2023, our big promote year is just like 2020 and -- sorry -- 2019 and 2020 were, except more so. So, the third year we have some small funds in that year. This year, for example, is that third year, which is relatively thin. We had -- this past year, we had UKLV in there. So, we have some smaller funds in there. Those funds over time will grow. So, this promote picture will become more even.  We've also gone through a modernization of our funds terms and given the investors the option of, uh, basically extending the promotable period to the lean years and also new capital coming in is going to have its promote tied to the year that the capital came in as opposed to a set year. So, over time, you're going to see these promotes smooth out. It will take some years for them to be perfectly smooth. So, the way I would think about it is, look at the promotes over a three-year cycle and average them. And I think the guidance that Tom talked about for this year 2022 is actually not a bad number as sort of thinking about roughly that average over a three-year period. And as to the valuation of that, look, you guys are -- you guys can do that better than us, but we're not getting anything for that. And we should get something. So, because the history is there, you can go back and look at it for 10 years under the new Prologis 11 years and assume something as a percentage of AUM. Historically, I've always used 25 basis points kind of in my head of promotable AUM with 60% of that going to the bottom line, because of our participation programs. So that's the way I think about it in a normalized year, but I think it's going to be much higher than that in this cycle.\nThomas Olinger: And you certainly seen our AUM grow and continue to grow. So, the underlying base at this point is growing rapidly as well.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nBlaine Heck: Great. Thanks. Wanted to touch on acquisitions quickly. It looks like you guys came in like this quarter relative to guidance, and I know acquisitions are certainly tougher to forecast than what you're going to be able to do on the development side, or even on the disposition side. But wanted to get your thoughts on the acquisition market in general, whether the shortfall this quarter was driven by pricing or anything else specifically? And then any broader commentary regarding your level of interest, especially in large acquisitions in 2022, would be very helpful. Thanks.\nThomas Olinger: Yeah. There was nothing in the quarterly results as indicative of more or less interest. And as you see quarter-to-quarter, these numbers move around quite a bit. We are always in the market. We look at all the deals, big small portfolios, et cetera. And prices have been moving up. Obviously, there are competitive situations, but I think we're disciplined like we always have been with acquisitions. But we got great teams and we're on every deal.\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMichael Carroll: Yeah. Thanks. Can you provide some color on your underwritten development margins? It looks like the margins in the 4Q 2021 and 2021 starts is below in-place pipeline and the recent lease stabilize the assets. There's something there that's driving those lower, or is it just conservative estimates?\nHamid Moghadam: Well, our margins on start have historically always been projected to be lower than our actual margins with completion. Because we don't count on things like super rent growth. And as we talked about earlier or cap rate compression or all those other things that have happened and obviously over time, we're using up the cheapest land and buying more and more of our land at margin. So -- and the kind of margins we've had in the last couple of years have been just an unprecedented. So, over time you should expect those kinds of margins to glide to a more normalized level as the cap rate compression slows down and rental growth eventually will slow down, can't keep going at 20% a year. So that is not at all unusual. There's nothing specific going on that other than mix where in some years we're developing more here and there and there are different, and our land bank has different ages in different jurisdictions. So, mix has a lot -- has a little bit to do with it, but the general trend has been much higher than cross cycle kind of margin that we would expect to see.\nOperator: Your next question is from Dave Rodgers with Baird. Your line is open.\nDavid Rodgers: Yeah. Hi, everyone. Wanted to ask about just kind of labor in general, obviously from a broader economic standpoint, big issue for everyone. What are you hearing from your customers in terms of the rebuild of inventory may be related to labor, how long that might take and whether labor's getting better or worse for them and how that might be impacting any real estate decisions if at all?\nHamid Moghadam: Labor is getting worse. Labor has been getting worse actually for 10 years, and the pandemic only just made it worse faster. I think that is forcing our customers into deploying more automation, because they have to get their work done. That requires a lot of capital that many of our customers don't have. So that's a business opportunity for Prologis is to invest in innovation and robotics and all kinds of other automation issues that help with the labor problem. Also CWI is a major step that we've taken in that regard. But I will tell you this, that more of that technology is deployed in our buildings, the stickier the tenants become, and probably they -- the term of the lease will increase and turnover costs will go down. So, I think it's good for us long-term, but I don't think this labor problem is going to get solved. And it's particularly acute in the U.S. It exists in other parts of the world, but it's particularly acute in the U.S. And there lots of theories as the reasons for it, but I'm not smart enough to know which ones make sense and which ones don't.\nOperator: Your next question is from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Your line is open.\nTom Catherwood: Thank you and good morning, everybody. Tom, going back to something you mentioned your opening remark. You were talking about the $26 billion build out potential in your land bank. And you mentioned that it's underpinned by an international opportunity. Set developments obviously jumped in 2021, but they seem to be weighted more towards the U.S. than they were in 2019 and 2020. Is the expectation that Europe could account for a larger percent of the 2022 starts, or is the opportunity set you were talking about kind of in other geographies?\nThomas Olinger: Yeah. So, if you look at the composition of the land bank, our option land and covered land place, so this is almost 200 million square feet of build out opportunity. It's about two-thirds in the Americas and a third outside of the Americas. So that's the balance. And the pace at which the cadence at which we take it down, it'll be opportunity driven.\nHamid Moghadam: The other thing I would say is that if you look at our 20-year track record of development profits, actually two-thirds have come from overseas and a third from the U.S. And again, that's a differentiator for Prologis where we just have a bigger plank bill and to make money.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Your line is open.\nVince Tibone: Hi, good morning. I want to follow-up on the lease mark-to-market. Could you share the estimated mark-to-market on a cash basis and also share the typical annual escalators you are getting on leases today?\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. On the cash in-place to mark today is right around 30%. And from an escalator standpoint, I think what we're seeing today with escalators would clearly be in the threes, and in certain markets it's in the fours and potentially even higher. So, I would tell you there, when we think about all this escalators are certainly important. But at the end of the day, our teams are trying to drive the highest cash flows at the Canada lease. Bumps are a part of that. Starting rents a part of that. TIs are a part of that, right? It all goes into the mix. And so, while it's important to look at bumps, it's not necessarily the sole determinate of the economics. You're driving out of leases.\nThomas Olinger: We are NPV investors on leasing. And the profile of it is -- usually our flexibility to deal with the tenants preferences actually allows us to extract the higher NPV.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nMichael Mueller: Yeah. Hi. What are -- is there a big difference today in terms of the margins you're expecting on build-to-suits versus spec developments?\nThomas Olinger: Mike, I'd say there's no greater difference than there always have been. And you underwrite these at 15 to 20 on spec and roughly 10% on build-to-suit and those numbers are move around a little bit based on risk. But if you're asking about the differentiation between the two, things really haven't changed. Obviously, the outcomes have changed, because the margins are much, much higher.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nSteve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks. I had just a question on development costs. What sort of inflation trends are you seeing kind of starting this year? How did that compare to 2021 and what sort of bottlenecks or issues are you seeing kind of in your own supply chain getting all the stuff you need to build everything you want to build this year?\nThomas Olinger: Yeah, Steve. So in the U.S. in 2021, there were total shell construction cost increases of about 31% and that's on a market wide basis. We were able to mitigate about 7% of that increase or seven percentage points of the increase. So, our net increase that we absorbed last year was 24%. So, we feel like most of that is a competitive advantage against our competitors. And there's a lot behind this in terms of what do we see for this year? Tough to see say how that plays out, but our teams are considering a 10% to 12% additional shell construction increase for 2022.\nHamid Moghadam: By the way, then let me tie that to some of the earlier questions. When you getting this kind of escalation on replacement costs, and by the way, I would say land prices have gone up even at a higher rate that, it's nice to own already a billion square feet of this kind of real estate. So, particularly all -- the other people trying to get into the same business driving down cap rates at the same time that replacement cost rents are going up is a nice place to be. That is not brilliance. That's just dumb luck.\nOperator: Your next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, there. I guess just considering your expectations for 2022 and the guidance you've laid out, can you give any details on what portion is already known? Like for example, lease has signed in 2021 that will commence in 2022, you already know that timing and rate, but for the parts that you don't already know, like lease commencements in the second half or pace of development stabilization, what sort of assumptions are you making? Is it that the strength of 2021 stays the same, improves further or slows and kind of what's driving that?\nThomas Olinger: I would say Caitlin, there are very few things that haven't happened already in that will affect 2022 one way or another, because even if we get it wrong on rental change on one side or together, we put away so many of our rollovers already in for 2022, that there isn't that much opportunity on the margin to put of effect that in a big way. So, there's 6% leasing basically remaining to be done. And that's going to happen on average in the middle of the year. So that's really 3% of our 97%. It's just not going to move the numbers around that much. And obviously development stabilizations and all that are more a future year type of thing again, they occur during the year. So, I would say our, our volatility in the short term, meaning this year is going to be relatively modest. And you can take that answer to the bank pretty much any year at this time.\nHamid Moghadam: And then I'd go back just to the in-place to market that $1.2 billion of NOI that's we will capture with no market rent growth, that gives you a high level of certainty regarding the same-store growth going forward. So, the things you need to think about is, if rent growth outperforms in 2022, that's going to take that $1.2 billion rep. I mentioned, I think that 36% in-place to market today is going to cross 40% by the time we get to the end of the year, it's that sort of predictability I believe that underpins our confidence why our growth will be -- continue to be sector leading for many years to come.\nOperator: Your next question is from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nDerek Johnston: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Are rising rents and revenue growth still handling outpacing the supply chain and efficiencies, inflation, and really overall expense growth? How do you view rents versus expenses, linked expenses playing out in 2022?\nThomas Olinger: I'm not sure I understand the question completely. Expenses are obviously going up as well, but they're going up more sort of in line with general inflation and real estate rent inflation in logistics has been certainly higher in that if you want to describe it as inflation. The other thing is that in terms of overall logistic costs, rents even with their recent escalation are 3%, 4% of the total picture. So, cost of drivers, cost of fuel, cost of transportation, all of those things are much bigger factors in terms of our customer's cost structure. So, there is not as much sensitivity to the real estate cost. If there's a commensurate increase in productivity that comes along with that, I think that's what you asked, but we'll give you an opportunity to clarify here if that's not what you asked.\nDerek Johnston: Thank you.\nThomas Olinger: Okay. All right. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Bilerman: Hey, good morning. This is Michael Bilerman. Hamid, I want to come back to -- you gave an answer where you said you're not going to predict cap rate trends, because you've been consistently wrong for the last five years. And I want to sort of dive into sort of the components that made you wrong over the last five years. I get rents of not dramatically and NOI is so important as numerator , but denominator the cap rate really does impact your capital allocation decisions, what to buy, what to sell, what to develop, how you raise capital on the balance sheet and all those sort of inputs. So, I guess, how are you thinking about it going forward? You must have a view. And so I'm just trying to understand maybe some of the components that made you wrong over the last five years and how that informs your decision going forward.\nHamid Moghadam: Look, we've taken our best shot and we do have a view on these things. After all we'll give you guidance and we've done that for 25 years. So, we do have a view. And our views always been -- not always, but in the last 10 years, as far as I remember, is that most of us in this room sort of grew up in the 80s and 90s and caps rates were 9% and 10% for logistics in those days. So as the cap rates have marched down in the last 20 years to where they are today, I don't know, 3% to 4%, we are anchored in the past. So it always feels like it's a little expensive and all that. But there are a couple things that have changed. Logistics have -- first of all, generally interest rates and all that have driven capital market returns down for everything, stocks, bonds, everything, including real estate. But I think there has been a better appreciation of logistics, real estate as an asset class that has caused logistic cap rates to compress further than maybe some other property tax that have compressed less or in more recent years gone the other way. I don't see anything stopping that part of it. So your gets as good as mine and with respect to long-term interest rates and their direction. But I can tell you the weight of the money is accelerating. It's not slowing down. The other thing is that I think if you are uncertain about the inflation outlook, which is what a lot of the discussion is, is it inflation? Is it supply chain? Is it short-term? Is it long-term? Not a bad thing to own modestly leveraged real estate in an asset class that's in equilibrium -- actually better than equilibrium, couple hundred basis points to either than equilibrium, when you have replacement costs that give you that buffer. So, we have the buffer of the mark-to-market in the 30% range that Tom talked about, but we also have the buffer of replacement costs going up, which Gene talked about. That's just the future buffer that we started talking about yet. So, I think rental score -- I have been consistently in our company low on rental projections, but higher than all my colleagues, low compared to what actually happened, but higher than all my colleagues. And I expect that to continue you for some time, but I think it's imprudent in a year where you've had this kind of spectacular rental growth to go out there and project 10 more years of that. I mean -- and so we run our business assuming more modest, sort of more closer to trend-line type of dynamics. And if it works out better than that, we report it to you every quarter. So we try to get it as close to the pin and as the pin moves, we'll move. So, I don't know if that's an answer to your question or not. One other thing I would tell you and I think you were the -- is this the last question? Yeah, you were the last question. So, maybe this is a wrap up. Look, as you think about our company, it's really important to get cap rates, right? Really important at least in the long term to get rental growth and all those things, right? And we will out compete on those basis all day long, but this company is increasingly become -- becoming a multiple product line cash flow generating type of business. Tom mentioned a billion dollars coming out of our private capital franchise with essentially no capital because our capital is our co-investment, which is in the rent business. So, the Essentials business, we sort of gloss over it, but it's a $75 million year business. Now it can be $1 billion business, the EV business can be $1 billion business. I'm not saying that it is, or whether it's going to happen in two years, but increasingly we're building these cash flows on top of the base real estate business because eventually the real estate business will slow down, but the ability to do business with those customers that use our real estate, I think is a runway for us for multiple decades. So, that's what's really exciting about where we are today.\nHamid Moghadam: Thank you for your interest in our company. And we look forward to talking to you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hamid Moghadam",
            "content": "Okay. I think Tom answered your second question, but let me take another stab at it. We know this is a fact, it's not opinion that supply -- that inventory levels -- in terms of inventory to sales ratios are 10 points below what they were prior to the pandemic. And the reason for that is that people are sitting at home and the goods economy has been on fire and people are buying a lot of stuff and not spending as much money on experience, et cetera. So that dynamic will change. But regardless, that 10% will have to snap back to a normal level. And that's a source for demand. In addition to that, as we outlined in a paper that we put at almost the year and a half ago now, we believe there is -- at that time, we thought 5% to 10%; today, we would say 10% to 15% more demand. In other words, higher inventory to sales ratio than normal or pre-pandemic, because of the need for resilience. And where -- where's that number come from, it come from all the customers that we talk to every day. So, between where we are now and where we think we're going to end up being, there is a 20% to 25% swing in inventories. That is huge. And it is not driven by the fact that there's a bunch of inventories sitting around, certainly not in the U.S. and maybe sitting around in some plant somewhere, but in the U.S., there's no inventory around for it to go away. That's the problem. And that's what's creating the supply chain problem. Now there were a lot of people smarter than me who predicted that the supply chain problems will be -- would've been over by Christmas or after Christmas. That is not the case. All they're doing is they're parking the ships further into the Pacific so that the visual is not as concerning, if you will, as it would've been, too many 60 minute stories on that, that concern the politicians, but that's not the only indication of a supply chain problem. I mean, you could have a product that has 50 different parts going into it. And until the last part gets there, you can't ship that product. So that's a supply chain problem. The fact that you can't get trackers to pick up the goods from ports or transport them from point A to point B, that's a supply chain problem. I think all of those things are going to take multiple years to result themselves. So, I think we're going to be in this mode for a while. It was actually 3% growth on top of 3% growth in market rent, up at the mark-to-market that existed there. And I don't remember what that was. It was in the teen certain. Craig, let me add two things to what Tom said, all of which I agree with. Number one, you actually got our same-store right, better than most people including us. So, congratulations on that -- on that for the past. But going forward, look, the market is really good and all kinds of different portfolios, regardless of their strategies will do well in an environment where rents are going up and cap rates are compressing. But we are thinking way beyond that. I mean, Tom mentioned Essentials, we have significant expectations for that business. Look at our labor, CWI business, that is becoming -- we did it as a service to customers, but it's quickly turning into a potential profit center. We have now put together a group to invest in the EV charging. And we have actually committed to our first project in Southern California for EV charging on trucks. The ROIs on that business are off the charts. So, we're not -- and by the way, I could go on for another 20 minutes talking about the stuff that's in the pipeline. So, we're not sitting and just praying for the real estate aspects of our business. The most valuable aspect of our business is the billion square feet of customers that we serve that are in need of lots of other things. So, we're really excited about the long-term prospects. We didn't have that in 2019. Those things were glimmer in our eye. Now they're real businesses producing real bottom line. So, that's why I'm pretty optimistic about the future going forward.  And remember all of that is being done with sub 20% leverage. And external growth, yeah, we have more external growth than anybody, but in relation to the size of our portfolio, external growth is almost an afterthought. We don't need to depend on that. I'd say in my opinion, lower quality source of growth because you're just arbitraging external capital to the internal cost capital. Ours is organic. So, really, really not only feel good about the level of growth on forward, but also the quality of that growth. Yeah. The other thing I would add to that is that we're not assuming cap rate compression. And based on today's values I would say there's appraisal lag built into some of these valuations because the appraisers have a hard time keeping up with comps. Even today the market's been so fast moving. So, I think there are a couple of layers of protection built in that. And obviously, as Tom explained, once you pass the waterfall, all of the additional values promotable. So, there's a lot of leverage on the upside and also on the downside. But if I were betting person, I would take the upside on that, not the downside. Let me take a stab at this. The issue with our promotes is this, we have two huge open-ended funds that are promotable and those are on three years promote cycle. So, 2022 and 2023, our big promote year is just like 2020 and -- sorry -- 2019 and 2020 were, except more so. So, the third year we have some small funds in that year. This year, for example, is that third year, which is relatively thin. We had -- this past year, we had UKLV in there. So, we have some smaller funds in there. Those funds over time will grow. So, this promote picture will become more even.  We've also gone through a modernization of our funds terms and given the investors the option of, uh, basically extending the promotable period to the lean years and also new capital coming in is going to have its promote tied to the year that the capital came in as opposed to a set year.

But I think there has been a better appreciation of logistics, real estate as an asset class that has caused logistic cap rates to compress further than maybe some other property tax that have compressed less or in more recent years gone the other way. I don't see anything stopping that part of it. So your gets as good as mine and with respect to long-term interest rates and their direction. But I can tell you the weight of the money is accelerating. It's not slowing down. The other thing is that I think if you are uncertain about the inflation outlook, which is what a lot of the discussion is, is it inflation? Is it supply chain? Is it short-term? Is it long-term? Not a bad thing to own modestly leveraged real estate in an asset class that's in equilibrium -- actually better than equilibrium, couple hundred basis points to either than equilibrium, when you have replacement costs that give you that buffer. So, we have the buffer of the mark-to-market in the 30% range that Tom talked about, but we also have the buffer of replacement costs going up, which Gene talked about. That's just the future buffer that we started talking about yet. So, I think rental score -- I have been consistently in our company low on rental projections, but higher than all my colleagues, low compared to what actually happened, but higher than all my colleagues. And I expect that to continue you for some time, but I think it's imprudent in a year where you've had this kind of spectacular rental growth to go out there and project 10 more years of that. I mean -- and so we run our business assuming more modest, sort of more closer to trend-line type of dynamics. And if it works out better than that, we report it to you every quarter. So we try to get it as close to the pin and as the pin moves, we'll move. So, I don't know if that's an answer to your question or not. One other thing I would tell you and I think you were the -- is this the last question? Yeah, you were the last question. So, maybe this is a wrap up. Look, as you think about our company, it's really important to get cap rates, right? Really important at least in the long term to get rental growth and all those things, right? And we will out compete on those basis all day long, but this company is increasingly become -- becoming a multiple product line cash flow generating type of business. Tom mentioned a billion dollars coming out of our private capital franchise with essentially no capital because our capital is our co-investment, which is in the rent business. So, the Essentials business, we sort of gloss over it, but it's a $75 million year business. Now it can be $1 billion business, the EV business can be $1 billion business. I'm not saying that it is, or whether it's going to happen in two years, but increasingly we're building these cash flows on top of the base real estate business because eventually the real estate business will slow down, but the ability to do business with those customers that use our real estate, I think is a runway for us for multiple decades. So, that's what's really exciting about where we are today. Thank you for your interest in our company. And we look forward to talking to you soon."

            "name": "Thomas Olinger",
            "content": "Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. The fourth quarter closed at a year of record setting activity across our business. Core FFO was $1.12 per share, with net promote earnings of $0.05. For the full year, core FFO was $4.15 per share, with net promote earnings of $0.06. Excluding promotes, core FFO grew 14% year-over-year. Net effective rent change on rollover accelerated to 33%, up 510 basis points sequentially and was led by the U.S. at over 37%. Average occupancy was 97.4%, up 80 basis points sequentially. Cash same-store NOI growth remained strong at 7.5% for the quarter and 6.1% for the full year. I want to point out that we're modifying our in place to market rent disclosure to standardize this metric among what logistics REITs. This collaboration is an extension of the work we've done to harmonize other property operating metrics. We have a collectively defined net effective lease mark-to-market of our operating portfolio as the growth rate from in-place rents to market rents. This now aligns with how rent change on rollover is expressed. Using this new definition consistently applied our net effective lease mark-to-market at year-end jumped almost 800 basis points sequentially to 36%. This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI of more than $1.2 billion or $1.55 per share that we will capture without any further market rank growth. Turning to Strategic Capital. This business continues to drive tremendous growth and value. In Q4, we completed the early windup of our highly successful UKLV venture. UKLV's $1.7 billion of operating assets were contributed to our PELP and PELP ventures. We earned net promote income of $0.05 in connection with the closeout of this venture and our percentage of infinite life vehicles has consequently grown to 95% of our $66 billion of third-party assets under management. For the year, our team raised $4.4 billion of third-party equity. After drawing down $1.9 billion in our open ended funds for acquisitions during the year equity queues stood at a record $4 billion at year-end. On the deployment front, we had a very productive and profitable year. Development starts totaled $3.6 billion, with margins of 32%. We continue to maintain a long development runway with a land portfolio able to support $26 billion of future starts. Stabilizations totaled to $2.5 billion with estimated value creation of $1.3 billion and average margin of 53%, both all time highs. Realized development gains were $817 million for the year, also an all time high. These results are the product of our highly disciplined team and an incredibly strong operating environment. For our customers, the importance of the health of their supply chain and the real estate that underpins it has never been so critical. We believe the current global supply chain challenges will continue well beyond this year. Fortunately, the scale of our 1 billion square foot portfolio puts us in a unique position to help our customers address these current supply chain challenges. This includes shortening construction delivery times by navigating raw material shortages and leveraging our Essentials platform to procure warehouse equipment and services, so our customers can focus on their core operations. We're also investing in technology and talent to support our industry leading sustainability objectives, including our efforts around renewable energy. Market dynamics today are highly favorable and demand has never been stronger. During the quarter, we signed 62 million square feet of leases and issued proposals on 90 million square feet. Demand is diverse across a range of industry end customers. E-commerce made up 19% of our new leasing this quarter, with further broadening of customer diversity. We signed 357 new leases with 265 unique e-commerce customers in 2021, both of which are high watermarks. Demand is fueled by three forces. First, overall consumption and demographic growth require our customers to expand. Second, customer supply chains are still repositioning to address the massive shift to e-commerce, as well as preparing for higher growth and service expectations. And third, they need to create more resiliency in supply chains. The inventory to sales ratios are more than 10% below pre-pandemic levels. Our customers not only need to restock at this 10% shortfall, but build additional safety stock of 10% or greater. This combination has the potential to produce 800 million square feet or more of future demand in the U.S. alone. Collectively these forces have placed a premium on speed to market and flexibility driving demand for years to come. From a supply perspective, construction underway in the U.S. is approximately 70% preleased, which is well above the historical average. We believe demand will balance out with supply in 2022 and vacancy rates will remain at record lows in both our U.S. and international markets. Competition for limited availabilities produced yet another quarter of record rent and value growth. In the fourth quarter, rents in our portfolio grew 5.7% globally, and 6.5% in the U.S. bringing full year growth to records 18% and 20% respectively, far exceeding our initial forecast. This growth paired with continued compression and cap rates is translating to record valuation increases. Our portfolio posted its highest quarterly value increase rising more than 12.5% globally, bringing the full year increase to a remarkable 39%. Now moving to guidance for 2022. Here are the components are on an our share basis. We expect cash same-store NOI growth to range between 6% and 7%, and average occupancy to range between 96.5% to 97.5%. We are forecasting rent growth in our markets to be 11% in the U.S. and 10% globally. For Strategic Capital, we expect revenue excluding promotes to range between $540 million and $560 million. We expect net promote income of $0.55 per share for the year, almost all of which will occur in the third quarter and is driven by our PELP venture. While a record, given the significant increase in rents and valuations, we would expect to see similar or higher promote levels in 2023. In response to continued strong demand, we are forecasting development starts of $4.5 billion to $5 billion with approximately 35% build-to-suits. Dispositions will range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion, two-thirds of which we expect to close this quarter. We're forecasting net deployment uses of $2.3 billion at the midpoint, which we plan to fund with $1.6 billion of free cash flow after dividends and a modest increase in leverage. We project core FFO, including the $0.55 of net promote income, to range between $5 and $5.10 share, representing 22% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.45 and $4.55 per share or year- over-year growth of 10% at the midpoint. Since our investor forum in 2019, our three-year earnings CAGR has been 13% excluding promotes, well ahead of the 8% to 9% CAGR forecast we originally provided. Before closing out, I want to spend a minute on the quality of our earnings drivers and differentiator, which set Prologis apart from other real estate companies. We continue to drive strong organic growth and aren't reliant upon external growth to achieve sector leading results. In fact, approximately 75% of the increase to our core FFO for 2022, excluding promotes is derived from organic growth, principally same-store NOI and Strategic Capital fee related earnings. It's important to point out that in 2022, our Strategic Capital revenue including promotes will be over $1 billion, a new milestone. This high margin business generates very durable fee stream with asset management fees marked to fair values each quarter all while requiring minimal capital. In addition, we see growing earnings from our Essentials business, which allows us to expand our services and solutions beyond rent. When we introduce this business back in 2018, we set a target of $300 million from procurement savings and Essentials revenue. We will hit that target this year with more than $225 million from procurement and $75 million from Essentials. In light of our success with procurement and the fact that we have embedded this initiative into our platform, we will not provide specific procurement reporting going forward, instead focusing on Essentials. We also have a long development runway of $26 billion, much of which comes from our international opportunity set, positioning us for continued strong value creation well into the future. Lastly, these differentiators are all underpinned by the lowest cost of capital among REITs and unmatched scale that minimizes operating costs. In closing, while 2021 was a year of many records, the bulk of the benefit from the current environment will be realized in the future, providing a clear, tangible runway for sector leading growth for many years to come. We are confident our best years are still ahead of us. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. Yeah. So, the answer to your question is yes. We have not included the forecasted rent. So, we underwrite based on what we see currently. So, we're -- in this environment we're seeing returns compress. You should expect to see some compression in the development yield. Now mix also has a lot to do that -- with that. And that's something we can check out and maybe get back to you guys in the call down. In terms of cap of trends, I don't think you want to pay any attention to our forecast since we've been consistently wrong for the last five years. Well, I'll start then Chris will have some data for you too, Manny. I think every year we've all forecasted the supply exceeding demand and we yet have to see that happen after the global financial crisis. It will happen in some year. I just don't know whether it's this coming year or some other year, but I've never seen 70% preleasing in 40 years of doing this in the development portfolio. And also, the interest in built-to-suits, I think is a pretty good indication that the product just isn't there. And I'm willing to bet this is a counterfactual, but I'm willing to bet if there were more supply, there would be more absorption of more demand. People simply cannot get the space that they need. But I think it will be several years. And the other thing you need to pay attention to is that overall supply numbers are interesting, but our portfolio is very differentiated in terms of the markets -- high barrier markets that our portfolio lives in. And let's not forget about overseas, because the dynamic overseas in terms of supply are very different than they are in the U.S. So, I think it's a complicated soup. I'm not trying to avoid your answer, but that's not on the first page of my worry list. It will be at some point, but it's not this year and I don't think it's going to be next year, Chris? Hey, Craig. So, I think you're asking what's 8% to 9% -- if it was 8% to 9% back in 2019, has that changed today? And yes, it's changed. And I think for several reasons. And it gets back to the differentiators I talked about in my script, but I'll start with same-store. My memory is that the same-store embedded in that Investor Day was 3.5% to 4.5%. And that had ... Yeah. Under the -- our new methodology, I think that we were about 18%, give or take. Today we're at 36%, so almost double. Right? So, you can think about that ratchet -- that in-place to market alone is going to ratchet up our same-store growth by more than 100 basis points, up to 150 basis points. So, you can think about that level of same-store for several years, because that 36% in-place to market growth is an average. So think about what it's going to be over the next year or two, should be higher, right? Because you're going to be rolling leases higher. And that 36% is not stopping. If you look at our guidance, right, for rent growth for the year and rent change, I would expect to see that in-place to market build by the time we get to 2020 -- and then 2022, it's going to -- I think it's going to cross the 40% mark. So that same-store is going to continue to grow and it's going -- it's not a one or two-year story. It's two, three, four, five-year story. And again, that's what market rents not growing the 36%, that's number one. Second would be think about our Strategic Capital business, how we are scaling in that business, how our fees are growing without promotes, right? We saw asset values increase 39% overall for the year. Well guess what? That increases asset values in our funds and our asset management fees increase as well. So, that business is continuing to scale and contribute. And then when you look at our Essentials business, we expect -- we talked that Investor Day about that business, adding 50 basis points of growth, kind of $0.02. I think we're going to be well ahead of that. So, I could go on with differentiators, but, that 8% to 9%, the new normal is I think what you're staring down with our core results this year. Yeah. I'll throw in some thoughts on rent growth. Rent growth in Europe is catching up to the U.S. And we've seen this play out in the past. And frankly it's catching up slower than we expected, because vacancy rates across Europe haven't been lower than the U.S., but that's taking place now. And I think we and Chris ought to pile in here. This year we'll see European rent growth that I think will exceed that U.S. The vast majority of it does come into the REIT itself versus the taxable REIT subsidiary. When you think just about dividends, as we've talked about in the past, we are -- we have extremely low payout ratio, 60%-ish is what we've been averaging and similar to what I would expect for 2022. And we're paying out the minimum required. So, you should think about our dividend having to grow in line with our underlying earnings. So, when you see earnings growing at 22%, those promotes our landing in the op in our REIT and needs to be reflected in our dividend accordingly. Sure, Nick. So, what -- I'll preface it by, there are several factors that go into the promote, not just real estate valuation, there's FX considerations because it's a euro denominated fund, but that fund also has functional currencies, not in euro, British pound, for example, right? So, there's FX activity going on functional and transactional -- transitional. Second would be there's depth mark-to-market in there. So, longwinded way of saying that there are a lot of factors that, that impact it. From a evaluation standpoint, we think there's some modest, mid single digit valuation increase embedded in there. We're taking our best shot at where it's going to land. A lot of variables can impact it. And we're going to update you accordingly as those move around, particularly given how this -- how -- once you -- once the promote exceeds that top hurdle, you can have a lot of variability in either direction, just depending on how things go. So, funds -- based on third-party appraisals, they're going to be what they're going to be. Interest rates are going to be what they're going to be. FX rates are going to be what they're going to be. We've taken their best shot at estimating those impacts. And we'll keep you posted. And you certainly seen our AUM grow and continue to grow. So, the underlying base at this point is growing rapidly as well. Yeah. There was nothing in the quarterly results as indicative of more or less interest. And as you see quarter-to-quarter, these numbers move around quite a bit. We are always in the market. We look at all the deals, big small portfolios, et cetera. And prices have been moving up. Obviously, there are competitive situations, but I think we're disciplined like we always have been with acquisitions. But we got great teams and we're on every deal. Yeah. So, if you look at the composition of the land bank, our option land and covered land place, so this is almost 200 million square feet of build out opportunity. It's about two-thirds in the Americas and a third outside of the Americas. So that's the balance. And the pace at which the cadence at which we take it down, it'll be opportunity driven. We are NPV investors on leasing. And the profile of it is -- usually our flexibility to deal with the tenants preferences actually allows us to extract the higher NPV. Mike, I'd say there's no greater difference than there always have been. And you underwrite these at 15 to 20 on spec and roughly 10% on build-to-suit and those numbers are move around a little bit based on risk. But if you're asking about the differentiation between the two, things really haven't changed. Obviously, the outcomes have changed, because the margins are much, much higher. Yeah, Steve. So in the U.S. in 2021, there were total shell construction cost increases of about 31% and that's on a market wide basis. We were able to mitigate about 7% of that increase or seven percentage points of the increase. So, our net increase that we absorbed last year was 24%. So, we feel like most of that is a competitive advantage against our competitors. And there's a lot behind this in terms of what do we see for this year? Tough to see say how that plays out, but our teams are considering a 10% to 12% additional shell construction increase for 2022. I would say Caitlin, there are very few things that haven't happened already in that will affect 2022 one way or another, because even if we get it wrong on rental change on one side or together, we put away so many of our rollovers already in for 2022, that there isn't that much opportunity on the margin to put of effect that in a big way. So, there's 6% leasing basically remaining to be done. And that's going to happen on average in the middle of the year. So that's really 3% of our 97%. It's just not going to move the numbers around that much. And obviously development stabilizations and all that are more a future year type of thing again, they occur during the year. So, I would say our, our volatility in the short term, meaning this year is going to be relatively modest. And you can take that answer to the bank pretty much any year at this time. I'm not sure I understand the question completely. Expenses are obviously going up as well, but they're going up more sort of in line with general inflation and real estate rent inflation in logistics has been certainly higher in that if you want to describe it as inflation. The other thing is that in terms of overall logistic costs, rents even with their recent escalation are 3%, 4% of the total picture. So, cost of drivers, cost of fuel, cost of transportation, all of those things are much bigger factors in terms of our customer's cost structure. So, there is not as much sensitivity to the real estate cost. If there's a commensurate increase in productivity that comes along with that, I think that's what you asked, but we'll give you an opportunity to clarify here if that's not what you asked. Okay. All right. Thanks."

            "name": "Chris Caton",
            "content": "Yeah. Sure, Manny. So, the numbers for this year look very strong market environment, 375 to 400 million square feet of both delivery and net absorption in our 30 markets. That'll leave the market vacancy rate at an ultra low all-time record 3.4%, 3.5% vacancy. So, very low. Now this is especially true in our U.S. global markets where we have an overweight strategy. In those markets the under construction pipeline is just 3% of stock and is 70% preleased. 2021 net absorption, so demand was 14% higher than that under construction pipeline. Now by comparison, our regional markets have 4.8% of their markets under construction. So, our global markets are 180 basis points better. 2021 demand that net absorption was 12% below this under construction pipeline in the regional markets. So, our global markets are 25% better. Indeed, the vacancy rates are lower and the rent growth is accelerating. So, it's an interesting point in time in the European markets."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tracy Ward, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTracy Ward: Thanks, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I\u2019d like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings. Additionally, our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we will hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. And also here with me today are Hamid Moghadam; Gary Anderson; Chris Caton; Tim Arndt; Mike Curless; Dan Letter; Ed Nekritz; Gene Reilly; and Karsten Kallevig. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom. And Tom, will you please begin?\nTom Olinger: Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. Third quarter results exceeded expectations and were underpinned by record increases in market rents and valuations. Operating conditions are being shaped by structural forces that continued to drive demand. At the same time, vacancies are at unprecedented lows, space in our markets is effectively sold out. In the last 90 days, supply chain dislocations have become even more pronounced, with customers acting with a sense of urgency to secure the space they need. As demand surges, having the right logistics real estate in the right locations has never been more mission critical to our customers. During the third quarter, we signed 56 million square feet of leases and issued proposals on 84 million square feet. Spaces above 100,000 square feet are effectively fully leased. Our Last Touch segment continued to gain momentum, with new lease signings growing by 44%. E-commerce requirements continued to broaden across a range of industries, with this segment representing one quarter of new lease signings. The activity was down sequentially as anticipated, although remains above trend. Given the sharp ramp up in demand, we are raising our 2021 U.S. forecasts for net absorption by 14% to a record 375 million square feet against deliveries of 285 million square feet, resulting in year-end vacancy reaching a new low of 4%. I want to point out that we revised our data set here this quarter to reflect only Prologis markets. As strong demand is being met with historic low vacancy, preleasing in the U.S. delivery pipeline has reached 70%, its highest level ever as customers continued to compete for space. Acute scarcity in our global markets is driving record rent and value growth. In the third quarter alone, rents grew 7.1% in our U.S. markets far exceeding our expectations. We are increasing our 2021 market rent forecast significantly to an all-time high of 19% in the U.S. and 17% globally, both up approximately 700 basis points. Our in-place to market rent spreads jumped 500 basis points in the quarter and is now approximately 22% with an upward bias. This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI growth of more than $925 million, or $1.25 per share. Record rent growth is translating to record valuation increases. Our logistics portfolio posted the largest quarterly increase in our history, rising 9.5% globally, bringing the year-to-date increase to an impressive 4% -- an impressive 24%, sorry about that. We expect that the ongoing network reconfiguration and expansion required to meet consumer needs and minimize disruptions will fuel demand tailwinds over the next decade. Switching gears to results for the quarter, core FFO was $1.04 per share with net promote earnings of $0.01. Rent change on rollover was strong at 27.9%, slightly lower sequentially due to mix. Average occupancy was 96.6%, up 60 basis points sequentially and we reached 98% leased at quarter-end. Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 6.7%, up 90 basis points sequentially. We had a very productive quarter on the deployment front. Margins on development stabilizations remain elevated coming in at 47%. Our development starts were $1.4 billion consisting of 31 projects across 21 markets, with estimated value creation of more than $520 million. Turning to strategic capital, our team raised almost $500 million in the third quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. Equity queues for open ended vehicles were $3.4 billion at quarter-end, another all-time high. Moving to guidance for 2021. Our outlook has further improved and here are the key updates on our share basis. We\u2019re tightening and increasing our cash same-store NOI growth to now range between 5.75% and 6%. We\u2019re increasing the midpoint for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes by $12.5 million and now ranged between $480 million and $485 million. We expect net promote income of $0.05 per share for the year, an increase of $0.03 from our prior guidance. In response to strong demand, we are increasing development starts by $450 million to a new midpoint of $3.7 billion. Our owned and managed land portfolio now supports 180 million square feet and more than $21 billion of future build out potential, providing a clear runway for significant value creation over the next several years. We\u2019re also increasing the mid-point for acquisitions by $500 million. The increased pace of acquisitions relates to our focus on covered land plays and urban Last Touch opportunities. We now expect net deployment uses of $650 million at the midpoint. Taking these assumptions into account, we are increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.06 and narrowing the range to $4.11 per share to $4.13 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.06 per share and $4.08 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 14%, while deleveraging by more than 300 basis points. We expect to generate $1.4 billion in free cash flow after dividends with a very conservative payout ratio below 60% range. While our year-to-date results have been extraordinary, most of the benefits from the current environment will accrue to the future. Our 22% in-place to market rent spread, the valuation impact on promotes, our leverage capacity, the $21 billion of development build out, and most importantly, the vast opportunity set that our global footprint provides, all paved the way for both significant and durable long-term growth. As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the disruptions within the supply chain won\u2019t be solved overnight. Prologis plays a unique role in the industry and we\u2019re committed to helping find long-term solutions. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working closely with our customers, policymakers and community partners to help address the problems, which will range from warehouse space to transport infrastructure to labor scarcity. In closing, I want to highlight two important upcoming Prologis events. First, this Monday, we will be hosting a webinar that we will dive into our development and strategic capital businesses. And second, on October 27th, we\u2019re bringing together supply chain and community thought leaders to focus on some of the most pressing issues in logistics today, including workforce, energy and transportation. Please visit our website for more information and the registration links for both events. And with that, I will turn it back to Sarah for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Maybe just the earnings release mentioned that your investment capacity is around $15 billion. Do you think Prologis will actually be able to deploy capital and use that opportunity, and if so, how or do you think that spread could actually increase as cash flow increases?\nGene Reilly: Caitlin, it\u2019s Gene. We really never provide guidance at least voluntarily on deployment, because as I\u2019ve said many times, it can range between zero and a lot, last year it was $21 billion. So I don\u2019t know honestly. It just depends on the returns that are available. And the only reason we talk about capacity is that you sort of have a feel for what we can do with the right opportunities came about. But there is no urgency around investing in a particular timeframe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman from Citi. Your line is open.\nEmmanuel Korchman: Hey, everyone. Good morning. Tom, I kind of wanted to reconcile a point you made earlier in your script, which was that, customers are keenly focused on getting more space and we\u2019re reading a lot of headlines on shortages of inventory, of labor, of other things. I guess help me reconcile the two points with customers looking for space that maybe they can\u2019t fill right away or are they just expecting their supply pipeline to rebound quickly, or are they moving stuff from other warehouses or sort of, I guess, it\u2019s a little bit counterintuitive for somebody be taking more space when product is sort of an issue right now? Sorry for long question. Thank you.\nTom Olinger: Yeah. Manny, let me try to answer that question. The supply chain is very long and it\u2019s gotten longer in the last 10 years. So basically, what happened is, think of it as a big long hose and somebody turned off the water and the hose ran dry and as the economies came back, that hose got opened and production started and is now flowing through the supply chain. So it is not flowing smoothly and the old models for predicting demand and carrying inventory are basically thrown out the window. So inventory particularly, mid-product inventory, not finished product inventory sort of ends up piling up in different places, because if there\u2019s one part missing into something, it\u2019s going to hold up the inventory. The other 99 parts have to be stored somewhere. So it\u2019s creating a pretty significant extra demand just to balance out the system given that the buffers are not predictable anymore. So the natural follow-up question from that, I would guess, would be, well, do you guys think about this being a one-time event or a sustainable event? And I would say, this particular factor is likely to be a temporary. Although, probably two-year or three-year type of process before everything straightens out. But right behind that are the two big structural drivers that on top of normal absorption. They include increased share of e-commerce and inventory levels being higher than prior to the pandemic and those two things people aren\u2019t even thinking about right now, because they\u2019re struggling to keep their heads above water. So I think the short-term thing is really interesting. It\u2019s great for headlines and all that. But I think the much more interesting factor in terms of assessing the quality of our business is their long-term driver -- are the two long-term drivers of demand on top of the normal drivers of demand.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood from BTIG. Your line is open.\nTom Catherwood: Great. Excellent. Thank you so much, guys. Quick question on cap rates. We\u2019ve seen incredible compression this year, and unlike prior years, it\u2019s really seemed to be across the Board. Does that create any risk in certain markets or regions where fundamentals of demand may not meet kind of the lofty valuation expectations we now have?\nTom Olinger: Boy, that\u2019s a tough question to answer. I will give you mine and Gene, I am sure will have ideas about this. First of all, we\u2019re notoriously bad at predicting cap rates. We\u2019ve been saying for about five years that they\u2019re too low, only to watch them go lower. But remember, cap rates are a function of two things. One is general returns available in other capital markets, namely interest rates or risk-free rates. And more recently, this rent growth and the growth growing power of that initial yield is orders of magnitude higher than it\u2019s ever been. So I am not smart enough to parse why cap rates are compressing. I suspect it has more to do with the embedded growth rate in the last six months than it does with interest rates picture. In fact, the interest rate picture if anything has increased, but the tremendous growth in rents, I think, has way exceeded the drag from slightly higher interest rates. Gene, what do you think?\nGene Reilly: Yeah. I think you may be getting to the spread between primary and secondary markets and that actually hasn\u2019t tightened up that much. It has tightened up a little bit. But spot cap rates in primary markets are extremely low. So I think there\u2019s always risk as cap rates in secondary or even tertiary markets are dragged down by the overall strength of the market, because you\u2019re going to see more supply in those markets going forward against probably less demand. But we will see how it plays out. But I don\u2019t really think, of course, you may have a different point of view that those spreads have actually tightened that much further.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nJamie Feldman: Thank you. We get asked a lot about just the potential supply coming online with so much capital flowing into this sector. Can you talk a little bit about whether it\u2019s a competitive mode or just kind of how Prologis will be able to kind of protect itself as supply grows or maybe that\u2019s the wrong way to think about it, just how should we think about the supply risks overall and it\u2019s not so easy to build?\nTom Olinger: Yeah.\nHamid Moghadam: I think you should think of supply risk as very market-specific. And you can have all the desire to bring down supply in LA or San Francisco or Seattle or even Inland Empire in -- certainly Inland Empire West or New Jersey. I take all your good markets. If, I mean, how are you going to do it? There is no land and their entitlement picture is getting to be harder and harder every day. Even markets like Dallas that we historically would have discussed as or referred to as non-constraint in terms of land, believe it or not are getting more constrained. I still encounter [ph] constraint, but there are more constraints certainly in the good location. So I think that the big driver is that it\u2019s just hard to come up with the land to build buildings on. I mean, supply is responding to demand. But I will -- my gut feel, and of course, you can\u2019t prove this one way or another is that demand would be higher, supply were higher. I think people are just based on the number of people competing for the same goods spaces and all the inbound calls we get from all our good customers wanting to gain an advantage over another good customer. It is -- people are kind of in a panic mode almost when it comes to buying or committing to real estate, so demand is just crazy.\nTom Olinger: So, Jamie, I will also add that it\u2019s market-specific, it\u2019s actually submarket-specific. And in terms of how do we protect ourselves, we do this all the time, whether it\u2019s a strong market or a weak market, we\u2019re always monitoring where is that supply going to come from. So I don\u2019t think we really change our protocols in that sense.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nDerek Johnston: Thank you. Hi, everyone. In January, on 4Q \u201820\u2019s earning call, you\u2019re in-place to market rent registered at 12.8% and with that in-place to market now at 22% just nine months, 10 months later. What are the key drivers for this change and really how sustainable is this mark-to-market across the portfolio?\nTom Olinger: Yeah. I will take that. So I will anchor you back. Well, first of all, the increase is all driven to high market rent growth. And I think, as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019re almost 22% today and there is an arrow up, just given a very minimal role in the fourth quarter and given our market rent growth expectations. So I would expect that 22% is going to go higher when we\u2019re on this call in January. One thing I would anchor you back to is, at our Investor Day back in November of 2019 that in-place to market was 15.5% and that was underpinning, what we said, our GAAP same-store growth at that time was a 3.5% to 4.5%. Now here we are today at 22% and when you think about that increase that really takes a 3.5% to 4.5% to almost 4.5% to 5.5%. So that\u2019s the impact we\u2019ve really extended. Here we are almost two years later and it\u2019s up dramatically and our runway has arguably gotten even longer. So the underpinning of the organic growth potential that we have is sitting right there for you to see.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. The only thing I would add to Tom\u2019s comment is actually land prices in most markets are going up faster than rents and construction costs are going up faster than rents. So actually the rent required for that marginal square foot of supply is ahead of that 22%. So that\u2019s why the arrow is up. It\u2019s just -- we\u2019re running but sort of standing still or going a little backwards with respect to keeping pace with replacement costs.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim from Truist. Your line is open.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks and good morning out there. So I want to talk about your development pipeline. It\u2019s obviously grown very nicely to a $5 billion. Can you remind us for the hard costs, like how much of the costs are hedged or at least the material security options? And as those expire and the favorable vintage of those hedges expire, what kind of impacts that has to your future development in terms of margins or yields?\nTom Olinger: So, Ki Bin, we think we\u2019ve contained about 25% of the cost increases we\u2019ve seen to-date. So in the -- in our pipeline in terms of the starts going forward, there\u2019s probably 4% sitting there that\u2019s beyond the underwriting of those projects. Most of that is going to be picked up on contingency. But as we look forward, we don\u2019t really see risk. I am not going to get into the details of what we\u2019ve done with pre-buying steel and other components and on the -- on these projects. But I think we\u2019ve mitigated quite a bit so far. We do see these markets kind of stabilizing at this point in time. And the other thing that we\u2019ve done, which is really critical is, we\u2019ve maintained our schedules and I think today, I think, we\u2019ve picked up 30 days of schedule versus the market. And frankly, we built these buildings faster than the market anyway, but that\u2019s an incremental 30 days. So the supply chain disruptions aren\u2019t just cost, they\u2019re their schedule. So I think you\u2019re -- I mean, ultimately, you\u2019re getting to how much have we sort of mitigated. I\u2019ve told you what we\u2019ve done so far. We\u2019re probably out, probably, six months ahead of the curve, but you can\u2019t really get much further than that. So I feel really good about what we\u2019ve done this year and I feel like we\u2019re prepared really well going forward. So we feel good about the outlook, and obviously, we\u2019re raising guidance and our volumes.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. I think more importantly than hedging construction costs is a fact that rents are going up faster than some of these costs and if you take an overall average and certainly in the best markets. So that\u2019s why margins are expanding with cap rates being also compressing. So far so good. Will it continue forever? Probably not.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey. Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick one on just retention shooting up 650 basis points year-over-year, any color what drove that kind of specific geographic, just curious there? Thanks.\nTom Olinger: Nothing unusual about mix or geography, but as we said, customers don\u2019t have options, really a lot of places to go and I think there\u2019s a race to secure really good well-located real estate and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.\nHamid Moghadam: That number can be very volatile quarter-to-quarter. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t pay too much attention to it quarter-to-quarter [ph].\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJohn Kim: Good morning. I was wondering if you can comment on how you see occupancy trending with your leased now at 90%, but you\u2019re also pushing rents harder and also if you can comment on the big sequential increase in occupancy in Asia during the quarter?\nHamid Moghadam: Our occupancies have to go higher. I mean if your demand is 300 and whatever 85 and supply is 285 million, there is 100 million feet that\u2019s going to come out of somewhere and add to that the obsolescence, the significant amount of product that it\u2019s taken out of circulation, because people have built something else on it like apartments. I think for sure our vacancy rates at least in the markets we care about are going to be going down in the foreseeable future. In the long-term, we need to see. I don\u2019t expect 385 million square feet of demand being the new norm forever, because some of it is just people being desperate for putting their stuff somewhere. But I think it will stabilize at the higher level than historical, because of those two unique drivers that we\u2019re seeing in this cycle that we didn\u2019t have in other cycles.\nTom Olinger: John, your question on Asia that\u2019s being driven by China, just we\u2019ve seen some good -- very good lease of activity in China. Japan has remains extremely high occupied.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. The new team in China has done a really great job in leasing space.\nTom Olinger: Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nCraig Mailman: Hey, guys. Just curious on the rent growth piece of things you guys have talked a lot about today. But is there a chance in your negotiations, do you guys trying to push escalators higher as a way to combat potential inflation here in the near-term and just maybe smooth out some of the rent increases some of these times they have, the big sticker shock at the end of the lease?\nHamid Moghadam: Right. Well, there is a variety of rationale for that, but the escalators are moving up, we\u2019re pushing them everywhere as you can imagine. But as importantly, the markets are accepting this and the competitive landscape is doing it, perhaps, partially for the reasons that you mentioned to smooth that effect with the customer. But of course, a lot of our customers get straight line at anyway. But I think it\u2019s just the -- it\u2019s our impression with overall net effective rent growth. So we feel pretty good about that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nSteve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked. But I just on the development increase. I am just wondering if you could maybe talk about regions, kind of where you\u2019re seeing the most demand and if you kind of thought about spec versus build-to-suits. I mean, given your commentary about customers, how do you sort of see that trending moving forward?\nTom Olinger: Yeah. So, Steve, I will take the first part of it. So we got about 100 projects we\u2019re starting this year, so it\u2019s really broad based and I wouldn\u2019t say that the increases are targeted to certain areas, because frankly, we have so much demand in all the markets. We\u2019re pulling forward project -- projects that we can number one, and number two, a lot of this increases build-to-suit activity. And maybe, Mike, can you comment on that?\nMike Curless: Yeah. Steve, so in the sub, 60% of our activity was build-to-suit. That will normalize end of the year in the mid-40%s. But I\u2019d remind you, that\u2019s going to be at a much larger base, which is representative of two basic things, there\u2019s fewer spec opportunities for people to move into and that\u2019s paired up with major structural rollouts that are well underway with a whole lot of companies over and above Amazon. So we see a bunch of diverse activity there and no surprise margins are as solid as they\u2019ve ever been reflective of how important entitle land sites are. And again, and the dearth of available space out there has put us in a really good spot on overseas.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts from UBS. Your line is open.\nBrent Dilts: Hey, guys. So with the shortages of certain items in the supply chain, how is that impacting your procurement programs for tenants for things like forklifts, lightings, rack, et cetera? And also how are your tenants managing labor challenges against the backdrop for record demand?\nTom Olinger: Yeah. Certainly, there\u2019s delays in some of our essential projects as well, forklifts, racking, those sorts of things. So OEM manufacturers in those businesses are also struggling, so lead times are longer. But we\u2019re using again our leverage and our scale, just as we do on the construction side of the business to procure them quicker than they otherwise would be able to. On the labor front, I don\u2019t know if you guys want to chat on that?\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. Clearly, labor is on the minds of lots of our customers and we\u2019re seeing them getting creative on how they\u2019re attracting labor and you see the commercials for a lot -- lots of companies on TV and what they\u2019re doing there. It\u2019s also having them focus on more on automation and we\u2019re seeing plenty of discussions about automation and automation these days is not the old version of it where it\u2019s fixed, bespoke. We\u2019re seeing lots of flexibility out there in terms of robotic forklifts and autonomous forklifts and those types of things, which we think our buildings are very well-suited because the primary criteria for that is a good floor and we spent over 30 years making sure our floors are in really good shape. So we think we\u2019re in real good shape to address automation, which I think will be a function of this labor issue going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nMike Mueller: Yeah. Hi. Tom, you previously talked about base case annual promote levels. How does that change for where cap rates have moved to today?\nTom Olinger: Yeah. As a reminder, we talked about, call it, seven sense of annual promotes if you, the net promote income, if you go back and you look at our historic performance. Clearly given where valuations have gone, I would expect 2022 promotes to be substantially above our historic run rate. Now clearly we will talk more about it in January, but directionally that\u2019s what you should expect.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. Promotes are pretty levered on the upside, because once you pass the pref return that incremental unit of return produces promote, whereas getting up to your pref rate you\u2019re not getting any promote. So for sure it will expand non-linearly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell from Barclays. Your line is open.\nAnthony Powell: Hi. Good morning. A question about the building acquisition guidance that, the increase there talked about covered land space Last Touch, how competitive is the environment for acquisitions there and how are cap rates trending for those types of deals?\nTom Olinger: It\u2019s very competitive for the Last Touch. There\u2019s no question. And cap rates are tough to talk about, because you have in-place rents, you\u2019re capping income that\u2019s literally all over the place. So I am not sure it\u2019s that constructive to talk about the cap rates, but it is competitive. I think we have a strategic advantage in the markets we want to be in, because we\u2019ve been doing this now for three years or four years. So I think we have scoped out the sub and sort of micro markets pretty effectively. But it is competitive and there\u2019s a ton of demand there and that\u2019s not going to change.\nHamid Moghadam: The yield on our covered land place, the entire portfolio cover land place, which is about a quarter of our total land base is about 5%, which means that we\u2019re actually getting better yields on some of these covered land place and that some of it is historic and rents have gone up a lot. But 5% is pretty good. You\u2019re getting paid to wait and that\u2019s the way to carry land. I mean the way to carry land is cover the land place and options, and really the own land that\u2019s just sitting around there that\u2019s the most expensive way of carrying land. So we\u2019ve been on to this strategy for a long time and we have a good base of covered land place that are now sort of cycling through development. So a lot of our development in the next 12 months to 24 months is going to be building out on the covered land place. But the good news is we\u2019re replenishing that inventory and then some as we chew through it.\nTom Olinger: Yeah. Just to add onto what Hamid said. So we have about 180 million feet of FAR build out on our land bank, option land and covered land place combined. So with the income flowing to the covered land place, we have about a 2% stabilized yield for the entire land bank, including all three components of it and after you pay taxes, you\u2019re still on the plus. So we\u2019re kind of carrying this for free. And frankly, some of the -- some of those income profiles on the early covered land places are -- have a serious up arrow to them. So, another way to think about land exposure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMichael Carroll: Yeah. Thanks. So could we see leasing activity or demand improved as the supply chain disruptions dissipate and inventory levels improve or are customers just looking through these problems right now and really trying to build their logistics network that they need over the next three years to five years?\nTom Olinger: I think they\u2019re doing both, but I think most people are focused on just dealing with Christmas. I mean, literally they should be start thinking about the long-term and people are some of the larger and more sophisticated players are and those would be the targets of the world, home depots of the world, people like that. But there are lots of people just trying to survive the next three months or four months. So I think that crazy crunch will diminish over the next two years to three years, for sure. But I think then they will turn to the longer-term strategies and I think that one has legs for a long time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers from Baird. Your line is open.\nDave Rodgers: Yeah. Most of my questions have been answered, but I did want to just follow up on the labor point. Obviously, labor a big concern today, 400 million square feet of additional demand. It\u2019s kind of in the last four quarters alone. Are you seeing customers just making different decisions on locations, campus settings, whatever it might be related to kind of longer term labor concerns, notwithstanding kind of the technology, are you just seeing kind of imminent decisions that are changing due to labor?\nTom Olinger: People have to figure out where their customers are and their networks are based on where the customers are. And real estate and real estate costs are 3% to 5% of the total cost and by the way, that number hasn\u2019t gone on -- gone up, because of rents going up, because the other components labor, transportation and energy are also going up. So they\u2019re not going to optimize around real estate costs. They\u2019re going to optimize around where their consumers are and where -- how long it takes to get them there, what they want and it\u2019s mostly time not tasks. So they\u2019re going to have to operate in the big markets. I mean you\u2019re not going to go in the middle of the square state in the middle of the country, because real estate rents are cheaper to service the desirable markets where a lot of the growth is started costing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the leasing market and in particularly the 3PL market, which has been incredibly active year-to-date. Could you just talk a little bit more about the trends you\u2019re seeing there? I imagine we\u2019ve heard anecdotes of like increasingly maybe Amazon using that market, because it\u2019s easier to get space on a real time basis, any perspective would be very helpful? Thanks.\nMike Curless: Yeah. This is Mike. And 3PL activity was up 500 bps last quarter and we\u2019ve seen this really play out over the last several years where 3PLs might have viewed space as a bit of a commodity many years ago. Today our view in is as an offensive weapon to help accommodate their customers and we\u2019re seeing this play out in the form of them leasing more space and they have underlying customers lined up, because they need that space to attract the customers and we are seeing them go for a longer term leases, both of which are good signs of the health of this business and a whole lot of that is driven by the E-commerce segment, which continues to be very diversified way over and above just Amazon.\nTom Olinger: They are definitely committing space ahead of having customers, but they\u2019re definitely filling up those spaces. This is not 1999 or 2000.com where people are going in hoping that their business will triple. They can\u2019t keep up. I mean literally that\u2019s the takeaway for all you guys. Can ask about in 15 different ways. But the market cannot keep up with -- the supply market cannot keep up with the demand that\u2019s out there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nBlaine Heck: Great. Thanks. I wanted to touch on acquisitions in general, not just specifically on the covered land plays as you touched on those earlier. You guys were able to do just under $400 million of your share during the quarter at a 5% cap rate and you increased guidance pretty significantly. Can you just talk about what caused that cap rate on deals during the quarter to be higher than we\u2019ve seen in a while, is that just a mix issue or are you guys finding more opportunities to maybe acquire off-market? And then related to that, what\u2019s giving you the confidence to increase acquisition guidance when there\u2019s so much capital out there chasing deals?\nTom Olinger: Yeah. So the 5% is definitely a mix issue. But our acquisition activities were generally not out there to buy core portfolios at the highest -- hit that highest bid. So we\u2019re constantly sourcing deals off market. And yes, those two do come with better returns, 5% is a mix issue. With respect to the confidence in the future, I mean, frankly, as Hamid said earlier on, we\u2019re -- we had a $330 million quarter. We might have a $2 billion quarter. We might have -- we may have a zero. It really depends on what\u2019s out there, what\u2019s available to us and we have confidence in - in the next quarter, because we have a lot of irons already in the fire. But confidence long-term, who knows? I mean, if these returns begin to completely blow out over a replacement cost. You\u2019re not going to see us as active. Yet, if there\u2019s a strategic opportunity, we may have a quarter that\u2019s 10 times the quarter we have this. So it\u2019s tough. Acquisitions are hard to forecast. They should be hard to forecast, frankly.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. If somebody gives you a precise forecast for acquisitions you should run for the hills. But there\u2019s also another two I think important differences between us and others. First of all, our playing and is the globe. And that\u2019s lots of different ways to deploy capital than just in the U.S. Now I am not saying by the way Europe is any easier, but I am just saying we have really multiple ways of deploying capital. And secondly, a lot of the incremental capital that\u2019s come into the business is from allocators. It\u2019s from people that basically go and buy existing products. And we can buy substandard product that\u2019s well located and fixed it and that, even though there\u2019s competition in that too, but the number of players in that fixed market hasn\u2019t grown as much as the number of players in the, I buy office buildings and malls today and now I am going to buy warehouse, because it\u2019s cool. So that\u2019s the difference.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJon Petersen: Great. Thanks. I am just curious for your thoughts on, maybe some of the structural headwinds that a lot of kind of the coastal gateway markets are facing, particularly New York and San Francisco. Obviously, people are being called back to the office, but a lot more kind of flexibility and kind of expectations of migration more towards lower cost markets, lower tax markets? And I am just kind of curious how that impacts the industrial sector and your, I guess, willingness and underwriting around developing and expanding in those markets.\nHamid Moghadam: I think if, I\u2019ve honestly heard this wishful thinking by the part of people who are in other regions of the country now for probably 20 years and every time you\u2019ve invested on the basis of that thesis, you\u2019ve left money on the table. So I don\u2019t see it. Yes, are they high -- is Elon Musk moving from California to Texas? Yes. Does he get a lot of headlines? Yes. But he doesn\u2019t consume any more than somebody who makes $60,000 a year. So the big consumption bases are in these markets and the land is covered with buildings. Those are the differences. The fact that they\u2019re sitting next to a beach that\u2019s not so important. It\u2019s just that those populations are still growing. They took a pause last year. But they\u2019re still growing and there\u2019s a lot of -- the vast majority of the movements are in the same region from maybe the urban core to the suburbs or something like that. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of data on this. And maybe, Chris, you want to elaborate on this. So in terms of the distribution business, we don\u2019t have buildings that are in different places for servicing the urban core versus the suburbs. They\u2019re all sort of within the same driving area.\nChris Caton: Yeah. I just had a couple of data points for you. First, the business has never been stronger, when we look at California and New Jersey, business is excellent, both from a demand perspective and a pricing perspective. As you look at real-time migration data and I am specifically talking about the USPS data, you\u2019ve seen migratory trends dissipate that is slow down. So, it is not continuing, it is not accelerating. And if you look at other real time data, for example, the housing, you also see the same trends. So just a couple of data points to reinforce the points Hamid is making.\nHamid Moghadam: By the way, it doesn\u2019t...\nOperator: Again\u2026\nHamid Moghadam: \u2026let -- let me just say this. It\u2019s not like California doesn\u2019t have problems or New York doesn\u2019t have problems. They do have problems. And they need to solve those problems and they need to become more business friendly and they need to improve the quality of life and homelessness is a real issue and all of those things are real issues. But at the end of the day, people go where the job growth is and that\u2019s where the job growth is.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a follow up question from Emmanuel Korchman from Citi. Your line is open.\nEmmanuel Korchman: Thanks, everyone. Chris, one for you, in the past, you\u2019ve talked about how much logistics is as a percentage of sort of overall whether the product cost or distribution cost. Has that just essentially stayed consistent now and the rise in rents is consistent with the rise in other costs, and at some point, does that relationship get messed up either with rents becoming a bigger piece or the other costs becoming a bigger piece? Thanks.\nChris Caton: Hey, Manny. Yeah. It\u2019s our assessment that right now that ratio has not changed and so for those who are not familiar with the data by rent is roughly 5% of supply chain costs and supply chain costs roughly 5% of revenue. So rent is about 25 basis points of throughput distribution. With the growth that we\u2019ve seen in transportation costs, growth we\u2019ve seen in labor, that has in fact been excess of the market rent growth and so that ratio has not meaningfully changed. If anything, it\u2019s gone down a bit.\nOperator: We have a follow up question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim of Truist. Your line is open.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. Just a broad question for you, your market cap is now over $100 billion, obviously grown a lot over the past several years and when you think about the rental math that you do in terms of the economics you get from contributing developed assets into the fund, when you\u2019re a smaller company, I mean, obviously that math works out very favorably. As you get bigger, I wonder, when do we hit that point where you would want to keep more of your development on balance sheet versus contributing to the funds at the same pace?\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. We don\u2019t -- I actually don\u2019t think that math necessarily ever reaches that point, Ki Bin. I think if we think about it, the reasons for being in the private capital business are beyond scale. I mean, they\u2019re mitigating currency exposure. It\u2019s leveraging the return on our capital, et cetera, et cetera. And we\u2019ve got a good history and a good brand in that business. It\u2019s a very important business to us and we will continue to do that in a meaningful way. But the key to our growth is not external growth. Now we\u2019ve done more external growth than anybody on the planet, but our key is not external growth. The key is internal growth. That comes from portfolio construction and that comes from 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, almost of meticulous steady work to build up these positions and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to really in the long-term drive earnings in this company and create value. The deployment is great. It\u2019s interesting. It enables us to get scale that drives down G&A ratios and creates value that way. It increases our liquidity, which reduces the cost of capital. It does all kinds of things. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s those location selections, like look at all our four or five M&A deals. Some of them, probably, between the five of them we\u2019ve sold, probably 30%, maybe 35% of the assets, because we just don\u2019t believe in those markets, we\u2019ve kept the ones that we want. We could have -- by the way, it\u2019s probably the right short-term decision with a bend to keep those assets, because cap rates have compressed. We knowing what I know now, we should be more levered and have owned those assets. But frankly, that doesn\u2019t set us up as well for the long-term. We will make that up and then some in the long term by having the portfolio in the right place. So, organic growth and the external growth is icing on the cake.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman, Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJamie Feldman: Thank you. It looks like you\u2019re going to see some meaningful rent growth in Europe. Can you talk about how your ability to push rents there compares to what you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. and if there\u2019s certain markets that are doing better than others?\nHamid Moghadam: U.K. is like the best markets in the U.K. and the continent is like the average markets in the U.S. minus 50 basis points. That\u2019s the way I think about it. I mean that may not be price, but in terms of rental growth, I think, the average of the continent is probably lower than the average of the U.S. today. But the cost capital is lower in the U.K. -- in Europe also compared to the U.S. interest rates are lower. So I think they all make sense in the context of the cost of capital. But U.K. is more coastal U.S. like and the continent is more like the rest of the U.S.\nHamid Moghadam: Okay. Jamie, I think, you\u2019re the wrap. So I really appreciate everybody being on the call. I think we had about 780 of you on the call today, which is got to be a huge record. So I really appreciate the interest in the company and look forward to talking to you in the next couple of months. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

But I'd remind you, that's going to be at a much larger base, which is representative of two basic things, there's fewer spec opportunities for people to move into and that's paired up with major structural rollouts that are well underway with a whole lot of companies over and above Amazon. So we see a bunch of diverse activity there and no surprise margins are as solid as they've ever been reflective of how important entitle land sites are. And again, and the dearth of available space out there has put us in a really good spot on overseas. Yeah. This is Mike. And 3PL activity was up 500 bps last quarter and we've seen this really play out over the last several years where 3PLs might have viewed space as a bit of a commodity many years ago. Today our view in is as an offensive weapon to help accommodate their customers and we're seeing this play out in the form of them leasing more space and they have underlying customers lined up, because they need that space to attract the customers and we are seeing them go for a longer term leases, both of which are good signs of the health of this business and a whole lot of that is driven by the E-commerce segment, which continues to be very diversified way over and above just Amazon."

First, the business has never been stronger, when we look at California and New Jersey, business is excellent, both from a demand perspective and a pricing perspective. As you look at real-time migration data and I am specifically talking about the USPS data, you've seen migratory trends dissipate that is slow down. So, it is not continuing, it is not accelerating. And if you look at other real time data, for example, the housing, you also see the same trends. So just a couple of data points to reinforce the points Hamid is making. Hey, Manny. Yeah.

We really never provide guidance at least voluntarily on deployment, because as I've said many times, it can range between zero and a lot, last year it was $21 billion. So I don't know honestly. It just depends on the returns that are available. And the only reason we talk about capacity is that you sort of have a feel for what we can do with the right opportunities came about. But there is no urgency around investing in a particular timeframe. Yeah. I think you may be getting to the spread between primary and secondary markets and that actually hasn't tightened up that much. It has tightened up a little bit. But spot cap rates in primary markets are extremely low. So I think there's always risk as cap rates in secondary or even tertiary markets are dragged down by the overall strength of the market, because you're going to see more supply in those markets going forward against probably less demand. But we will see how it plays out. But I don't really think, of course, you may have a different point of view that those spreads have actually tightened that much further."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Hamid Moghadam",
            "content": "I think you should think of supply risk as very market-specific. And you can have all the desire to bring down supply in LA or San Francisco or Seattle or even Inland Empire in -- certainly Inland Empire West or New Jersey. I take all your good markets. If, I mean, how are you going to do it? There is no land and their entitlement picture is getting to be harder and harder every day. Even markets like Dallas that we historically would have discussed as or referred to as non-constraint in terms of land, believe it or not are getting more constrained. I still encounter [ph] constraint, but there are more constraints certainly in the good location. So I think that the big driver is that it's just hard to come up with the land to build buildings on. I mean, supply is responding to demand. But I will -- my gut feel, and of course, you can't prove this one way or another is that demand would be higher, supply were higher. I think people are just based on the number of people competing for the same goods spaces and all the inbound calls we get from all our good customers wanting to gain an advantage over another good customer. It is -- people are kind of in a panic mode almost when it comes to buying or committing to real estate, so demand is just crazy. Yeah. The only thing I would add to Tom's comment is actually land prices in most markets are going up faster than rents and construction costs are going up faster than rents. So actually the rent required for that marginal square foot of supply is ahead of that 22%. So that's why the arrow is up. It's just -- we're running but sort of standing still or going a little backwards with respect to keeping pace with replacement costs. Yeah. I think more importantly than hedging construction costs is a fact that rents are going up faster than some of these costs and if you take an overall average and certainly in the best markets. So that's why margins are expanding with cap rates being also compressing. So far so good. Will it continue forever? Probably not. That number can be very volatile quarter-to-quarter. Honestly, I wouldn't pay too much attention to it quarter-to-quarter [ph]. Our occupancies have to go higher. I mean if your demand is 300 and whatever 85 and supply is 285 million, there is 100 million feet that's going to come out of somewhere and add to that the obsolescence, the significant amount of product that it's taken out of circulation, because people have built something else on it like apartments. I think for sure our vacancy rates at least in the markets we care about are going to be going down in the foreseeable future. In the long-term, we need to see. I don't expect 385 million square feet of demand being the new norm forever, because some of it is just people being desperate for putting their stuff somewhere. But I think it will stabilize at the higher level than historical, because of those two unique drivers that we're seeing in this cycle that we didn't have in other cycles. Yeah. The new team in China has done a really great job in leasing space. Right. Well, there is a variety of rationale for that, but the escalators are moving up, we're pushing them everywhere as you can imagine. But as importantly, the markets are accepting this and the competitive landscape is doing it, perhaps, partially for the reasons that you mentioned to smooth that effect with the customer. But of course, a lot of our customers get straight line at anyway. But I think it's just the -- it's our impression with overall net effective rent growth. So we feel pretty good about that. Yeah. Clearly, labor is on the minds of lots of our customers and we're seeing them getting creative on how they're attracting labor and you see the commercials for a lot -- lots of companies on TV and what they're doing there. It's also having them focus on more on automation and we're seeing plenty of discussions about automation and automation these days is not the old version of it where it's fixed, bespoke. We're seeing lots of flexibility out there in terms of robotic forklifts and autonomous forklifts and those types of things, which we think our buildings are very well-suited because the primary criteria for that is a good floor and we spent over 30 years making sure our floors are in really good shape. So we think we're in real good shape to address automation, which I think will be a function of this labor issue going forward. Yeah. Promotes are pretty levered on the upside, because once you pass the pref return that incremental unit of return produces promote, whereas getting up to your pref rate you're not getting any promote. So for sure it will expand non-linearly. The yield on our covered land place, the entire portfolio cover land place, which is about a quarter of our total land base is about 5%, which means that we're actually getting better yields on some of these covered land place and that some of it is historic and rents have gone up a lot. But 5% is pretty good. You're getting paid to wait and that's the way to carry land. I mean the way to carry land is cover the land place and options, and really the own land that's just sitting around there that's the most expensive way of carrying land. So we've been on to this strategy for a long time and we have a good base of covered land place that are now sort of cycling through development. So a lot of our development in the next 12 months to 24 months is going to be building out on the covered land place. But the good news is we're replenishing that inventory and then some as we chew through it. Yeah. If somebody gives you a precise forecast for acquisitions you should run for the hills. But there's also another two I think important differences between us and others. First of all, our playing and is the globe. And that's lots of different ways to deploy capital than just in the U.S. Now I am not saying by the way Europe is any easier, but I am just saying we have really multiple ways of deploying capital. And secondly, a lot of the incremental capital that's come into the business is from allocators. It's from people that basically go and buy existing products. And we can buy substandard product that's well located and fixed it and that, even though there's competition in that too, but the number of players in that fixed market hasn't grown as much as the number of players in the, I buy office buildings and malls today and now I am going to buy warehouse, because it's cool. So that's the difference. I think if, I've honestly heard this wishful thinking by the part of people who are in other regions of the country now for probably 20 years and every time you've invested on the basis of that thesis, you've left money on the table. So I don't see it. Yes, are they high -- is Elon Musk moving from California to Texas? Yes. Does he get a lot of headlines? Yes. But he doesn't consume any more than somebody who makes $60,000 a year. So the big consumption bases are in these markets and the land is covered with buildings. Those are the differences. The fact that they're sitting next to a beach that's not so important. It's just that those populations are still growing. They took a pause last year. But they're still growing and there's a lot of -- the vast majority of the movements are in the same region from maybe the urban core to the suburbs or something like that. I mean, there's a lot of data on this. And maybe, Chris, you want to elaborate on this. So in terms of the distribution business, we don't have buildings that are in different places for servicing the urban core versus the suburbs. They're all sort of within the same driving area. By the way, it doesn't... ...let -- let me just say this. It's not like California doesn't have problems or New York doesn't have problems. They do have problems. And they need to solve those problems and they need to become more business friendly and they need to improve the quality of life and homelessness is a real issue and all of those things are real issues. But at the end of the day, people go where the job growth is and that's where the job growth is. Yeah. We don't -- I actually don't think that math necessarily ever reaches that point, Ki Bin. I think if we think about it, the reasons for being in the private capital business are beyond scale. I mean, they're mitigating currency exposure. It's leveraging the return on our capital, et cetera, et cetera. And we've got a good history and a good brand in that business.

            "name": "Tom Olinger",
            "content": "Thanks, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. Third quarter results exceeded expectations and were underpinned by record increases in market rents and valuations. Operating conditions are being shaped by structural forces that continued to drive demand. At the same time, vacancies are at unprecedented lows, space in our markets is effectively sold out. In the last 90 days, supply chain dislocations have become even more pronounced, with customers acting with a sense of urgency to secure the space they need. As demand surges, having the right logistics real estate in the right locations has never been more mission critical to our customers. During the third quarter, we signed 56 million square feet of leases and issued proposals on 84 million square feet. Spaces above 100,000 square feet are effectively fully leased. Our Last Touch segment continued to gain momentum, with new lease signings growing by 44%. E-commerce requirements continued to broaden across a range of industries, with this segment representing one quarter of new lease signings. The activity was down sequentially as anticipated, although remains above trend. Given the sharp ramp up in demand, we are raising our 2021 U.S. forecasts for net absorption by 14% to a record 375 million square feet against deliveries of 285 million square feet, resulting in year-end vacancy reaching a new low of 4%. I want to point out that we revised our data set here this quarter to reflect only Prologis markets. As strong demand is being met with historic low vacancy, preleasing in the U.S. delivery pipeline has reached 70%, its highest level ever as customers continued to compete for space. Acute scarcity in our global markets is driving record rent and value growth. In the third quarter alone, rents grew 7.1% in our U.S. markets far exceeding our expectations. We are increasing our 2021 market rent forecast significantly to an all-time high of 19% in the U.S. and 17% globally, both up approximately 700 basis points. Our in-place to market rent spreads jumped 500 basis points in the quarter and is now approximately 22% with an upward bias. This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI growth of more than $925 million, or $1.25 per share. Record rent growth is translating to record valuation increases. Our logistics portfolio posted the largest quarterly increase in our history, rising 9.5% globally, bringing the year-to-date increase to an impressive 4% -- an impressive 24%, sorry about that. We expect that the ongoing network reconfiguration and expansion required to meet consumer needs and minimize disruptions will fuel demand tailwinds over the next decade. Switching gears to results for the quarter, core FFO was $1.04 per share with net promote earnings of $0.01. Rent change on rollover was strong at 27.9%, slightly lower sequentially due to mix. Average occupancy was 96.6%, up 60 basis points sequentially and we reached 98% leased at quarter-end. Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 6.7%, up 90 basis points sequentially. We had a very productive quarter on the deployment front. Margins on development stabilizations remain elevated coming in at 47%. Our development starts were $1.4 billion consisting of 31 projects across 21 markets, with estimated value creation of more than $520 million. Turning to strategic capital, our team raised almost $500 million in the third quarter and $2.5 billion year-to-date. Equity queues for open ended vehicles were $3.4 billion at quarter-end, another all-time high. Moving to guidance for 2021. Our outlook has further improved and here are the key updates on our share basis. We're tightening and increasing our cash same-store NOI growth to now range between 5.75% and 6%. We're increasing the midpoint for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes by $12.5 million and now ranged between $480 million and $485 million. We expect net promote income of $0.05 per share for the year, an increase of $0.03 from our prior guidance. In response to strong demand, we are increasing development starts by $450 million to a new midpoint of $3.7 billion. Our owned and managed land portfolio now supports 180 million square feet and more than $21 billion of future build out potential, providing a clear runway for significant value creation over the next several years. We're also increasing the mid-point for acquisitions by $500 million. The increased pace of acquisitions relates to our focus on covered land plays and urban Last Touch opportunities. We now expect net deployment uses of $650 million at the midpoint. Taking these assumptions into account, we are increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.06 and narrowing the range to $4.11 per share to $4.13 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.06 per share and $4.08 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 14%, while deleveraging by more than 300 basis points. We expect to generate $1.4 billion in free cash flow after dividends with a very conservative payout ratio below 60% range. While our year-to-date results have been extraordinary, most of the benefits from the current environment will accrue to the future. Our 22% in-place to market rent spread, the valuation impact on promotes, our leverage capacity, the $21 billion of development build out, and most importantly, the vast opportunity set that our global footprint provides, all paved the way for both significant and durable long-term growth. As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the disruptions within the supply chain won't be solved overnight. Prologis plays a unique role in the industry and we're committed to helping find long-term solutions. That's why we're working closely with our customers, policymakers and community partners to help address the problems, which will range from warehouse space to transport infrastructure to labor scarcity. In closing, I want to highlight two important upcoming Prologis events. First, this Monday, we will be hosting a webinar that we will dive into our development and strategic capital businesses. And second, on October 27th, we're bringing together supply chain and community thought leaders to focus on some of the most pressing issues in logistics today, including workforce, energy and transportation. Please visit our website for more information and the registration links for both events. And with that, I will turn it back to Sarah for your questions. Yeah. Manny, let me try to answer that question. The supply chain is very long and it's gotten longer in the last 10 years. So basically, what happened is, think of it as a big long hose and somebody turned off the water and the hose ran dry and as the economies came back, that hose got opened and production started and is now flowing through the supply chain. So it is not flowing smoothly and the old models for predicting demand and carrying inventory are basically thrown out the window. So inventory particularly, mid-product inventory, not finished product inventory sort of ends up piling up in different places, because if there's one part missing into something, it's going to hold up the inventory. The other 99 parts have to be stored somewhere. So it's creating a pretty significant extra demand just to balance out the system given that the buffers are not predictable anymore. So the natural follow-up question from that, I would guess, would be, well, do you guys think about this being a one-time event or a sustainable event? And I would say, this particular factor is likely to be a temporary. Although, probably two-year or three-year type of process before everything straightens out. But right behind that are the two big structural drivers that on top of normal absorption. They include increased share of e-commerce and inventory levels being higher than prior to the pandemic and those two things people aren't even thinking about right now, because they're struggling to keep their heads above water. So I think the short-term thing is really interesting. It's great for headlines and all that. But I think the much more interesting factor in terms of assessing the quality of our business is their long-term driver -- are the two long-term drivers of demand on top of the normal drivers of demand. Boy, that's a tough question to answer. I will give you mine and Gene, I am sure will have ideas about this. First of all, we're notoriously bad at predicting cap rates. We've been saying for about five years that they're too low, only to watch them go lower. But remember, cap rates are a function of two things. One is general returns available in other capital markets, namely interest rates or risk-free rates. And more recently, this rent growth and the growth growing power of that initial yield is orders of magnitude higher than it's ever been. So I am not smart enough to parse why cap rates are compressing. I suspect it has more to do with the embedded growth rate in the last six months than it does with interest rates picture. In fact, the interest rate picture if anything has increased, but the tremendous growth in rents, I think, has way exceeded the drag from slightly higher interest rates. Gene, what do you think? Yeah. So, Jamie, I will also add that it's market-specific, it's actually submarket-specific. And in terms of how do we protect ourselves, we do this all the time, whether it's a strong market or a weak market, we're always monitoring where is that supply going to come from. So I don't think we really change our protocols in that sense. Yeah. I will take that. So I will anchor you back. Well, first of all, the increase is all driven to high market rent growth. And I think, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're almost 22% today and there is an arrow up, just given a very minimal role in the fourth quarter and given our market rent growth expectations. So I would expect that 22% is going to go higher when we're on this call in January. One thing I would anchor you back to is, at our Investor Day back in November of 2019 that in-place to market was 15.5% and that was underpinning, what we said, our GAAP same-store growth at that time was a 3.5% to 4.5%. Now here we are today at 22% and when you think about that increase that really takes a 3.5% to 4.5% to almost 4.5% to 5.5%. So that's the impact we've really extended. Here we are almost two years later and it's up dramatically and our runway has arguably gotten even longer. So the underpinning of the organic growth potential that we have is sitting right there for you to see. So, Ki Bin, we think we've contained about 25% of the cost increases we've seen to-date. So in the -- in our pipeline in terms of the starts going forward, there's probably 4% sitting there that's beyond the underwriting of those projects. Most of that is going to be picked up on contingency. But as we look forward, we don't really see risk. I am not going to get into the details of what we've done with pre-buying steel and other components and on the -- on these projects. But I think we've mitigated quite a bit so far. We do see these markets kind of stabilizing at this point in time. And the other thing that we've done, which is really critical is, we've maintained our schedules and I think today, I think, we've picked up 30 days of schedule versus the market. And frankly, we built these buildings faster than the market anyway, but that's an incremental 30 days. So the supply chain disruptions aren't just cost, they're their schedule. So I think you're -- I mean, ultimately, you're getting to how much have we sort of mitigated. I've told you what we've done so far. We're probably out, probably, six months ahead of the curve, but you can't really get much further than that. So I feel really good about what we've done this year and I feel like we're prepared really well going forward. So we feel good about the outlook, and obviously, we're raising guidance and our volumes. Nothing unusual about mix or geography, but as we said, customers don't have options, really a lot of places to go and I think there's a race to secure really good well-located real estate and that's what we're seeing. John, your question on Asia that's being driven by China, just we've seen some good -- very good lease of activity in China. Japan has remains extremely high occupied. Yeah. Yeah. So, Steve, I will take the first part of it. So we got about 100 projects we're starting this year, so it's really broad based and I wouldn't say that the increases are targeted to certain areas, because frankly, we have so much demand in all the markets. We're pulling forward project -- projects that we can number one, and number two, a lot of this increases build-to-suit activity. And maybe, Mike, can you comment on that? Yeah. Certainly, there's delays in some of our essential projects as well, forklifts, racking, those sorts of things. So OEM manufacturers in those businesses are also struggling, so lead times are longer. But we're using again our leverage and our scale, just as we do on the construction side of the business to procure them quicker than they otherwise would be able to. On the labor front, I don't know if you guys want to chat on that? Yeah. As a reminder, we talked about, call it, seven sense of annual promotes if you, the net promote income, if you go back and you look at our historic performance. Clearly given where valuations have gone, I would expect 2022 promotes to be substantially above our historic run rate. Now clearly we will talk more about it in January, but directionally that's what you should expect. It's very competitive for the Last Touch. There's no question. And cap rates are tough to talk about, because you have in-place rents, you're capping income that's literally all over the place. So I am not sure it's that constructive to talk about the cap rates, but it is competitive. I think we have a strategic advantage in the markets we want to be in, because we've been doing this now for three years or four years. So I think we have scoped out the sub and sort of micro markets pretty effectively. But it is competitive and there's a ton of demand there and that's not going to change. Yeah. Just to add onto what Hamid said. So we have about 180 million feet of FAR build out on our land bank, option land and covered land place combined. So with the income flowing to the covered land place, we have about a 2% stabilized yield for the entire land bank, including all three components of it and after you pay taxes, you're still on the plus. So we're kind of carrying this for free. And frankly, some of the -- some of those income profiles on the early covered land places are -- have a serious up arrow to them. So, another way to think about land exposure. I think they're doing both, but I think most people are focused on just dealing with Christmas. I mean, literally they should be start thinking about the long-term and people are some of the larger and more sophisticated players are and those would be the targets of the world, home depots of the world, people like that. But there are lots of people just trying to survive the next three months or four months. So I think that crazy crunch will diminish over the next two years to three years, for sure. But I think then they will turn to the longer-term strategies and I think that one has legs for a long time. People have to figure out where their customers are and their networks are based on where the customers are. And real estate and real estate costs are 3% to 5% of the total cost and by the way, that number hasn't gone on -- gone up, because of rents going up, because the other components labor, transportation and energy are also going up. So they're not going to optimize around real estate costs. They're going to optimize around where their consumers are and where -- how long it takes to get them there, what they want and it's mostly time not tasks. So they're going to have to operate in the big markets. I mean you're not going to go in the middle of the square state in the middle of the country, because real estate rents are cheaper to service the desirable markets where a lot of the growth is started costing. They are definitely committing space ahead of having customers, but they're definitely filling up those spaces. This is not 1999 or 2000.com where people are going in hoping that their business will triple. They can't keep up. I mean literally that's the takeaway for all you guys. Can ask about in 15 different ways. But the market cannot keep up with -- the supply market cannot keep up with the demand that's out there. Yeah. So the 5% is definitely a mix issue. But our acquisition activities were generally not out there to buy core portfolios at the highest -- hit that highest bid. So we're constantly sourcing deals off market. And yes, those two do come with better returns, 5% is a mix issue. With respect to the confidence in the future, I mean, frankly, as Hamid said earlier on, we're -- we had a $330 million quarter. We might have a $2 billion quarter. We might have -- we may have a zero. It really depends on what's out there, what's available to us and we have confidence in - in the next quarter, because we have a lot of irons already in the fire. But confidence long-term, who knows? I mean, if these returns begin to completely blow out over a replacement cost. You're not going to see us as active. Yet, if there's a strategic opportunity, we may have a quarter that's 10 times the quarter we have this. So it's tough. Acquisitions are hard to forecast. They should be hard to forecast, frankly."

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It\u2019s now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Tracy Ward. Tracy, I hand it to you.\nTracy Ward: Thanks, Holly, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I would like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or SEC filings.  Additionally, our second quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures, and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. This morning, we will hear from Tom Olinger, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, Gary Anderson, Chris Caton, Mike Curless, Dan Letter, Ed Nekritz, Gene Reilly and Colleen McEwan are also here with us today. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom. Tom, will you please begin?\nTom Olinger: Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. The second quarter exceeded our expectations both in terms of our results and outlook for 2021 and beyond. With our exceptional portfolio and teams, we set high watermarks across several measures this quarter. Demand for space is robust and diverse and market conditions remained the healthiest in our 38-year history.  In the second quarter, lease signings were 64 million square feet and lease proposals were 84 million square feet, both remain above average and were driven by new and development leasing. Likewise, the Prologis IBI Customer Activity Index reached a new high in the second quarter, an early indicator of strong future demand. Our leasing mix is broad. Currently, the greatest demand is for spaces above 100,000 square feet. For smaller spaces, activity is picking up. We signed 518 leases totaling 18 million square feet in the quarter, the highest volume in this segment in three years.  For customer segments, e-commerce continues to lead the way, representing 30% of new lease signings in the second quarter. While Amazon remains steady at 6% of total new leasing, we have seen many more e-commerce players come to the table. For example, we signed 168 new e-commerce leases in the first half of 2021 versus 53 in the first half of last year. Supply chains are raising, beginning to restock. And as they view, we\u2019ll create more demand going forward. Containerized imports are up 33% through May versus pre-pandemic levels, as retailers replenished their supply chains. While inventories have risen 3% from their trough, they have struggled to grow this year as retain sales are up 19% from pre-pandemic levels. We see the current low level of inventories on our space utilization, which at 84.3% is below the long-term average of 85%. This is yet another sign that our customers are operating with suboptimal levels of inventory.  Putting together the recent outperformance and ongoing momentum, we are raising our 2021 U.S. forecast for net absorption by 20% to 360 million square feet and deliveries by 8% to 325 million square feet.  Looking forward, we foresee continued supply balanced by demand with historic low vacancy of 4.5% carrying into 2022. With balanced demand and supply, acute scarcity in our markets is driving record rents and value growth, while operating portfolio lease percentage rose by 80 basis points to 97.2% at quarter-end.  Customers continue to compete for space and are making decisions faster with lease gestation in the quarter of just 44 days. When we look at the factors impacting supply, significant barriers exists in our markets and include a lack of buyable land, increasingly difficult and expensive permitting and entitlement processes and rapidly escalating replacement cost. Our research team released an excellent paper on this last month, which you can find on our website.  Our supply watch list remains quite small. We reviewed Houston in the quarter leaving just Spain and Poland. Accelerating demand in the quarter, combined with ultra low vacancies, translated to a very strong rent growth of 4.1% in our U.S. markets exceeding our expectations. As a result, we are raising our 2021 rent forecast an all-time high of 10.3% for the U.S., up approximately 40 basis points from our prior estimate and 8% globally, which is up 300 basis points.  Our in-place to market rent spread is now the widest in our history at 16.9%, up 330 basis points sequentially. This represents future gas in the tank of nearly $700 million in NOI, or $0.90 per share.  Turning to valuations. Our assets have strongest quarterly uplift in our history, rising 8% in the second quarter alone, with the U.S. up more than 10% and Europe up 5.6%. On the topic of valuation, I want to point out that we enhanced the NAV disclosure in our supplemental related to property management fees.  Given the size and scale of our portfolio, we created substantial value through our operational advantages. As a result, we know that real estate is worth more in our hands. Accordingly, we are now including net property management fee income as the bone in the adjusted NOI in our NAV disclosure. Switching gears to results for the quarter, our team and portfolio continued to deliver excellent financial results. Core FFO was $1.01 per share, with net promote earnings effectively zero, rent change on rollover was 32%. Occupancy at quarter-end was 96.8%, up 110 basis points sequentially.  Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 5.8%, 290 basis points year-over-year. We tapped into favorable market conditions and disposed of $880 million of non-strategic assets across our portfolio.  In addition, just last week, we completed the sale of a $920 million owned and managed portfolio, including all of the non-strategic IPT assets. It\u2019s worth noting that to date, we have sold $2 billion of non-strategic assets from our IPT and LPT acquisitions at pricing more than 23% above underwriting. Turning to strategic capital. Our team raised almost $600 million in the second quarter. Equity cues from our open-ended vehicles were $3.3 billion at quarter end, hitting another all-time high. Robust investor interest has prompted private equity limited partners to shift away from diversify to more sector-specific funds, particularly for the logistics sector. In light of recent asset management transactions and public cost, the value being ascribed to our strategic capital business is uniquely understated. For the balance sheet, we continue to maintain excellent financial strength with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicles totaling $14 billion. Moving to guidance for 2021. Our outlook has further improved given higher rent growth, higher valuations and robust demand. Here are the key updates on an our share basis. We are increasing our cash same-store NOI growth midpoint by 75 basis points to now range between 5.25% and 5.75%. We expect bad debt expense to be approximately 10 basis points of gross revenues, down from our prior guidance midpoint of 20 basis points and well below our historical average. We are increasing the midpoint for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes, to $470 million, up $15 million from prior guidance. This upward revision is due to increased asset management fees resulting from higher property values. Faster development lease-up and higher asset values are also leading to an increase in promotes.  We now expect net promote income of $0.02 for this year, an increase of $0.04 from our prior guidance. We are also increasing development starts by $300 million and now expect a midpoint of $3.2 billion. Build-to-suits will comprise more than 40% of development volume. Our owned and managed land portfolio, which is composed of land, options, and covered land place supports $18 billion of future development over the next several years. We are also increasing the midpoint for dispositions and contributions by $650 million in total. This increase will have roughly a $0.02 drag on earnings this year, given the timing to redeploy incremental proceeds.  We now expect to generate net deployment sources of $200 million at the midpoint, with leverage remaining effectively flat in 2021. Taking these assumptions into account, we are increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.07 and narrowing the range to $4.04 to $4.08 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.02 and $4.06 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 13%. We continue to maintain exceptional dividend coverage and our 2021 guidance implies a payout ratio in the low 60% range and free cash flow after dividends of $1.3 billion. In closing, the first half of the year has been extraordinary and our outlook is equally promising. Visibility into our strong future organic earnings potential is very clear. We have a significant embedded in-place to market rent spread, the development-ready land portfolio, substantial balance sheet capacity and ability to create value for our customers beyond the real estate. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Holly for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Steve Sakwa, Evercore ISI. \nSteve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning out there. Maybe Tom or Hamid, I was just wondering if you could spend a little more time just talking about some of the demand drivers across some of the various subsectors and maybe regionally, I know Europe, maybe grew a little bit faster, but maybe just provide a little more context around which businesses and which regions you are seeing the most demand in?\nChris Caton: Hey, Steve, it\u2019s Chris Caton. I am going to jump in with a few highlights and then, I think, Gene will share some color. I think there are three or four demand trends that represent themselves. The first is broadly the diversification of e-commerce. So, internationalization of the major players or small and mid-size players stepping up.  The second is the growth leaders of last year are leasing safe. Think about food companies, pharmaceuticals, and durable goods companies. The third trend would be supply chain resilience. For example, we see the core markets are among the strongest they\u2019ve ever been. So, you have several clear themes playing through demand. \nGene Reilly: Yes. So, Steve, the only thing I would add to that is, if you want to get some geographic color is, coastal markets are definitely doing better. You look at the U.S., Southern California and New Jersey by far I think have the strongest demand dynamics. But I\u2019d also say that it\u2019s very difficult to find a weak market globally, no matter where they are, in the Latin America, Europe, the U.S. There is strength in demand really everywhere. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is going to come from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. \nEmmanuel Korchman : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Chris, maybe just another one for you. But you spoke about broad-based demand. But is the specific demand from, especially e-commerce customers changing at all? Are they kind of willing to get whatever they can or are they being more specific as to what they want? Are they pinpointing markets? Is it a wider sort of tapers of demand? Can you help us figure out what they are actually asking for when they come to you? \nChris Caton: Yes. So, the message on e-commerce is actually, it\u2019s very diverse. And I think if you look across the maturity of different organizations, they all want something slightly different. So, if you have a large international player, I do think they are getting much more pinpointed. We\u2019ve seen a lot of growth, for example, in the last such sub-markets.  There is a lot of focus on shortening those delivery times. But more mid-size organizations might be in an adjacent location or in a regional location to still build out the basic infrastructure for executing online.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows : Hi. Good morning, team. I was just wondering if you could talk maybe about development of Prologis is obviously an active developer. You increase your guidance for development starts and stabilizations and also the contributions. So, could you give some detail on how you think about your development businesses, valuation? How the developing gains are related to that and how it might be different than peers\u2019 activity? I know that\u2019s a lot. \nTom Olinger: Hey, Caitlin, thanks for your questions. This is Tom. I\u2019ll take a first shot at that. I think there are several aspects of our development business that are quite unique. The first I would just think looking at the size of that portfolio $18 billion of build out, almost 20% of our market cap. And that portfolio was very focused in our high barrier markets at which we operate. So we\u2019ve got a land bank that we can build out.  A very, very high quality portfolio that\u2019s in high demand. It\u2019s very diversified across 19 different countries and it\u2019s a huge opportunity set that our development platform has to build out and just having the menu to seek the best returns and to solve customers\u2019 problems across all of those different markets is a huge advantage. And I think that leads to just the durability of those development gains. So if you look at our track record, we\u2019ve got a track record of 20 years, developing $37 billion of assets, 20% unlevered IRR and we did those results verified externally by Duff & Phelps, by the way, but -so anincredibletrack record of durability. So, when you look at the $18 billion of build out, our history of being able to continue to develop at very, very attractive rates, there is a very, very long runway of opportunity that\u2019s just presented in front of us. And then, to your point on realized gains, I think it\u2019s another point that makes sense quite unique that given our capital structure and how it works, how we want to structure the vast majority of our assets outside the U.S. are held in funds, but we are developing the vast majority of those assets on balance sheet Europe, in Japan, Mexico.  And those assets, with very few exceptions, are contributing into our funds. So there is a real crystallization of those gains. So, when you think about the 20% unlevered IRRs all that development, the vast majority of those gains were realized in cash and that\u2019s a real cash flow. That \u2013 it\u2019s part of your AFFO and should be embedded in your valuation. I think when we look at valuation in particular for development, I think, it is a very scattershot approach because there is a couple of different things you have to do. Obviously, you\u2019ve got the CIP that\u2019s in front of you. You got to face that and value that. You got your land bank, in our case, $18 billion that you have to value.  And there is also residual for this platform, right? This platform has a history of $37 billion and 20% unlevered IRRs. There is a value here. So, I think you can put those all together. There is different ways to do it, obviously. But I would just encourage you to take a look at the cash flows that this thing generates historically. And I think you are going to find the valuation for our development capabilities are, I would say, significantly undervalued.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Craig Mailman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nCraig Mailman : Hey, everyone. I appreciate the update there and where you think market rent growth is and clearly your net absorption stats as well. Just looks like we are still at equilibrium. But I am just curious, did you guys talk to tenants and kind of continue to push through rents or maybe even accelerate that? How does the conversation changed now with labor shortages continuing and maybe even getting a little bit worse places and just gas prices continue to rise and impacted the transportation side? I mean, are rents even how high up on the list are they at this point? Maybe update us on how many deals you are losing as a result of rent versus other factors? Those are few questions.\nGene Reilly : Yes. This is, Gene. So, I\u2019ll take that. So I think you are \u2013 if you look at the conversations we are having with customers and what their pain points are relative \u2013 excuse me.\nHamid Moghadam: Gene is having a little bit of issue with the access to it. So, let me cover while he \u2013 there is a sort of. So the conversations are mostly around labor. That is absolutely a pain point. But there is an ability to push through our pricing today, because when you have retail sales jump 20% from pre-pandemic levels and God knows what percent from pandemic levels. And the supply chain is dry and there is very little probability of losing that piece of business, because people are flushed with cash and out there spending money. I think this is going to continue for a while. So, basically, everybody\u2019s hair is on fire trying to keep up with demand. And Mike, any additional color on that?\nMike Curless : Yes. I think one way you can really represent this is the fact that we\u2019ve had more customers competing over space than we\u2019ve seen ever before and that creates some difficult situations. So we always start with transparency with both parties. But I got to tell you the rent becomes a very minor discussion just the availability and accessibility of that space becomes the priority. So I think that\u2019s a good description of what we are seeing out there in terms of the customers\u2019 priorities.\nTom Olinger : Craig, I wish we were losing more deals because of rent, because we actually look at that on a quarterly basis by geography and the number is under 5%, which to me it means we may not be pushing rents enough. So, in a way, the fact that we are not losing those deals to rents may not be such a great bank.\nGene Reilly : There is - Let me jump in here and continue with my point. But with respect to gas prices, that pretty much makes location on the more important. So I think that\u2019s probably a tailwind with respect to rents.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.\nVikram Malhotra : Morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe wanted to build upon comments around the strategic capital business. You referenced several times the power of the business and potentially being undervalued. I am assuming that\u2019s on the equity side. As I talk to my colleagues who cover the asset managers, there is clearly different multiples that you use to value some of these larger or asset management platforms.  So maybe you can unpack this for us a little bit in terms of the power of the business; the more focused customer base you are seeing that are focused on logistics-only platforms and then just the valuation, that\u2019d be really helpful?\nTom Olinger : Yes, Vikram, it\u2019s Tom. I will take that first. So, I think let\u2019s start with that business and how that business has grown. If you look over the last five years, any land and revenues of that business has grown 18%, some 18% CAGR. More importantly, the EBITDA or cash flow that that business is generating has grown by 26% CAGR, so incredible growth.  As we look forward, just given what we are seeing, I think the opportunities are there for very strong continued EBITDA growth. So I think that\u2019s a baseline I would think about there. A highly, highly scalable business for what we do. And relative to valuation, there have been I think clarity around valuation in this business. It has never been better because there has been several transactions that have cleared the market lately and you can certainly look at public comps. I think for us, you need to look at the alternative asset managers as the right place to start.  And while there are a lot of different ways, I think analysts and investors are looking at multiple, but when you work through it all for the alternative of those and the comps we are seeing, you are going to see multiples in the mid-20s on earnings and those include promotes. So when you strip out promotes, you are seeing for the best alternative asset managers a multiple of 30 or higher, and they are getting an x on promotes. So, yes, that would tell you our business is - I would say, very undervalued, because as you are thinking about how we compare to them, I think you need to think about the stickiness of our AUM. 90% plus of our AUM is in long life or perpetual vehicles.  We talked about the growth profile that we have and then clearly, there is incredible investor demand for our product, which is also lining up to support growth. Our equity queue at quarter end was $3.3 billion, an all-time high. So, happy to get into more discussions with you all on this going forward. But lot of good visibility out there on valuation.\nChris Caton : Yes. I would add two things, which we sort of assume that are important. First the business\u2019 scale. It\u2019s a $60 billion plus business. I mean, that puts us among the top real estate asset managers anywhere by any measure and we are focused on one property type. So that\u2019s a pretty significant market share in the most desirable market. So that\u2019s place to the premium.  And also, I would say, we have the longest history of actually producing these returns that goes back to AMD\u2019s early days in the mid-80s. So, both in terms of longevity, the quality of the income stream, these are not a bunch of closed-end funds that expire. These are, as Tom pointed out, very sticky and long-lived cash flow streams.  I would argue that they have more leverage on the upside than the real estate cash flows that support that business because of the fee and promote structure. So, for the life of me, I don\u2019t really understand why they are being valued the way they are, but we are going to do a better job of explaining that to people who follow this business, because we are honestly getting a lot of receptivity from those investors that really understand this sector.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America.\nJamie Feldman : Thank you. Following up to the last question, $14 billion of investment capacity, we\u2019ve seen a good amount of large portfolios trade the last few years, but clearly pricing is getting more and more dear. How should we think about your ability to do large-scale transactions to keep growing that business through acquisition?\nTom Olinger : We do not care one iota about external growth and through M&A. It is \u2013 that is no skill of the management team. Just multiple conversion and dismiss that fair that our size prevents us from growing fast.  I would just invite people to look at the numbers and you can strip out the M&A from that. So M&A is opportunistic. It\u2019s never part of our business plan and if we never had another dollar of M&A, outplay our growth rate against anybody else\u2019s in any center frankly over time.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim : Thank you. Given the increase you\u2019ve had in valuations this quarter, I was wondering if you could provide an updated view on exit cap rates and that spread between exit and going in yields when you and your partners are looking at investments?\nHamid Moghadam : Well, historically we pencil in a 50 basis point \u2013 used to pencil in a 50 basis point increase in the residual calculation based on our rents projections and alike. But I think 50 basis points when cap rates were 9% was quite a bit and when the cap rates are in the mid-3s, that\u2019s even a great deal more on a relative basis. So, we are mostly using about a 25% increase in residual calculations ten years out.  But again, we are an infinite life vehicle. When you invest in our REIT, you don\u2019t \u2013 we just sell non-strategic assets. We don\u2019t sell our other assets that we like. You look at the dividends or the cash flow that comes off those assets and the growth rate of those assets that translates into a very nice overall IRR, which is really the fundamental driver of value in our business.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies.\nJonathon Petersen : Great. Thanks. You guys in your press release mentioned that cash same-store NOI growth in the international portfolio was higher than U.S., which I think is kind of a flip from what we\u2019ve seen in recent years. But I look at occupancy the occupancy is still growing faster in the U.S. So, maybe you could just talk about what\u2019s driving that higher international growth?\nGene Reilly : Yes. Tom, I\u2019ll take that. I think part of it is driven by strong results in other Americas and Europe was also strong. I think it\u2019s more of a reflection of a easier comp in Q2 of 2020 than everything else. But listen, I think longer term, I mean, by and large, particularly in Europe, the cap rates have dropped further in Europe over the last several years.  That\u2019s been more of a headwind on rent growth and I would expect, going forward, we are going to see whether it\u2019s next year, the year after that, but we are going to see growth in our international markets to be on par if not better than our U.S. markets.\nTom Olinger : Yes, I would also say that land is very difficult in the U.S. but it\u2019s even more difficult in Europe because the government is a much bigger actor in allocating land out and they really tie it to employment and they are not wild about logistics. So land supply is just that much more difficult.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.\nBlaine Heck : Great. Thanks. So we noticed turnover costs on leases ticked up this quarter and those costs as a percentage of lease value have been trending up over the last four quarters as has free rents. Just given the context of you guys having the highest demand you\u2019ve ever seen, those increase, that increase seems somewhat counter-intuitive. So, can you just give some color on what might be driving that increase? And how we should think about those concessions going forward?\nTom Olinger : Blaine, this is Tom. That\u2019s a good observation. What is driving that over the last four quarters and particularly in the second quarter is higher levels of new leasing. So new leasing in Q2 versus Q1 increased 40% sequentially. And new leases generally come with slightly higher concessions, slightly higher turnover costs as a result, but the key is we are looking at long-term economics. So, yes, there is a little bit of short-term pain with that but we are getting in what we believe to be a better cash flow and higher rents. So, I think that\u2019s the key. We are looking at the long-term economics here and we are getting at.  I do think, in clearly, over the last four quarters, we\u2019ve seen much higher levels of new leasing than in the past, I think that\u2019s going to moderate a bit going forward. But we are looking at the long-term end game here and it\u2019s clearly the right economic decision to make.\nGene Reilly : Yes. The other issue you should keep in mind is that we are pushing rents a lot harder than we were before. So, likely to replace existing customers with the most efficient customers that have the highest value chain and the ability to pay. So, that reshuffle has been accelerated in the last 12, 24 months.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll : Yes. I wanted to touch back on the earlier comments regarding the broadening out of tenant interest, specifically from e-commerce players, I guess. When you say you are seeing more demand from the smaller players, are these companies that are looking to insource their logistics needs versus outsourcing it to 3PLs or did they already have an insource network and they are just looking to expand it right now or is a little bit of both?\nMike Curless : Hey. This is Mike. It\u2019s certainly a little bit of both. I think the bigger story here is, we get asked a lot of questions about is it all about Amazon? And while they\u2019ve been very steady and robust in terms of their activity with us this year with actually plenty of back-end activity coming up in the next couple of quarters.  The bigger takeaway is what Tom said in the earnings front-end here were the other customers. Last year, we leased about 50 non-Amazon \u2013 50 leases to non-Amazon e-com players. This time fast forward, the number is three times as high and it\u2019s a wide variety of smaller and larger customers. There is some big brand names in there like walmart.com or MercadoLibre in Latin America, JD.com.  But the bigger story is, there is over 150 of these smaller, more diversified players using a combination of insourcing and outsourcing. We really like that diversification there and again, the story is just not all about Amazon.\nTom Olinger : I think there is a frenzy on playing catch-up that that is creating a lot of activity. I mean, I think people - if anything the pandemic sort of suggested that they can take business as usual in a very incremental approach with respect to their e-commerce strategy and now they are realizing how important it is and they are just pedal to the metal and that\u2019s showing up in our 3PL leasing statistics as well.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan.\nMike Mueller : Yes. Hi. Can you talk a little bit about your development margins on spec versus build-to-suit? And do you think we could see the mix, which I think you said is about 40% this year drift down further?\nGene Reilly : Yes. Mike, this is Gene. I think the \u2013 I think that\u2019s going to hold. In fact, I think we might see ultimately a higher build-to-suit percentage. And I\u2019d be careful looking at the comparison of margins between build-to-suit and spec, because the mix has an awful lot to do with it. How long the transaction has taken to negotiate has something to do with it.  But I think in both cases, you can expect margins to creep up. We have cost increasing on us on the construction side. But we have return compression and rent growth that\u2019s ahead of our underwriting expectations and that overwhelms the cost increases. So I think, generally going to see margins expand.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird.\nDave Rodgers : Hi, there. Maybe to start with Mike or Gene. Wanted to ask on the inventory and the sales topics that you guys mentioned earlier. Obviously, the big increase in sales and inventory is not keeping up. I guess, when you talk to the customers, what are they trying to solve for from an inventory to sales perspective maybe how does that vary between industries, if at all?  And I guess, how do they take into consideration may be interest cost with interest going down? Does that change kind of their willingness to carry even more inventory in the near-term? Those kind of - type of conversations and any color would be helpful.\nChris Caton : Hey, Dave, it\u2019s Chris Caton. I\u2019ll kick it off. So first off, as has been shared a few times, right now it\u2019s fulfillment by any means necessary. Trying to get goods into the country. Look, inventories are down 10% from pre-pandemic levels. And so, it\u2019s really just a race to get levels in. As it relates to resilience, I do think we are starting to see this, but I think the specific numbers of people are looking at.  They are not yet at the strategic planning phase they are much more tactically focused on fixing their supply chains this year. Refresh up in our supply chain conference four days ago, 75% of people we spoke with, they had a poll survey said increasing inventories do have resilience related issues with top of mind and we are starting to see that play out.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street.\nVince Tibone : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on significant increase in your U.S. market rent growth forecast. I just wanted to get a little more color on which markets you are seeing the greatest improvement in fundamentals and reviews last quarter? And also just hear how high you are forecasting growth in Southern California, New Jersey and alike?\nChris Caton : Hey, Vince. It\u2019s Chris Caton. So indeed, we did make a material increase and look, I think the facts of the situation are really impressive. Rents in the U.S. are up nearly 7% just in the first half of the year, that\u2019s a record. And look, it\u2019s not just the U.S. rents are rising, in Europe they are up 2% so far this year. When I think about different categories, let\u2019s start with the coastal, the major markets on the coast and we\u2019ve had Toronto in there.  Typically, these markets on an annual basis will outperform by 250 to 400 basis points. Last year that compressed as there was less differentiation. That differentiation has returned. And so, we are going to see these coastal markets in Toronto hit mid-teens, I think this year. And I \u2014 based on some of the trends we discussed earlier, I\u2019d say we should expect to see this relative outperformance widen in the coming years. Hope that helps you.\nTom Olinger : Vince, this is Tom. I would just tack on the impact of \u2013 and on our earnings, right? I mean, we are rolling around 16%, 17% of our portfolio for a year now. So all of this good news on rent growth is not coming to the P&L right away. So you need to look at the in-place to market which significantly gapped out this quarter now at almost 17%.  And as I said in my prepared remarks, it\u2019s almost $700 million of incremental NOI and want to see where rent growth continues to go. But I would continue to think that in-place market is going to March a little higher.\nChris Caton : Yes and one other thing I would add, as strong as rents have been in some of these best markets, with today\u2019s rents, today\u2019s construction cost, and today\u2019s land cost, development doesn\u2019t pencil. So, when people are developing, that means they are thinking, they may be wrong, that rents have to grow quite a bit from here or cap rates are going to compress significantly from here.  I don\u2019t know which and they may be wrong. But I can tell you that with today\u2019s marginal land cost and building cost, no way you come close to that clearing your margin in development.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Rob Simone with Hedgeye Risk Management.\nRob Simone : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Kind of a two-part question for me, get back to your earlier comments on strategic capital. We took a shot at that valuation and I think, Tom, your comments were really helpful. I think in many ways, they are probably too conservative. But, on the growth rate side, so one of the things that\u2019s a little bit tougher to handicap from the outside is, kind of the sustainable growth rate and your capital raising.  The deployments from contribution is a little more obvious from the numbers, at least historically. So, I was hoping you guys could comment on how you see the fundraising environment kind of proceeding over the coming years?  And then, also, maybe secondarily to that, it\u2019s really interesting. This is the first year that the net income excluding promotes kind of subsumed your corporate G&A. So from a valuation perspective, how do you think about addressing that? It\u2019s obviously a huge benefit but a big change versus prior year.\nTom Olinger : Hey, Rob. Let me take a shot at this. Today\u2019s \u2013 our third-party AUM is mid $60 billion. At the time of the merger exactly 10 years ago, the merger closed on June 30 of 2011, exactly ten years ago, it was $14 billion. So, you do the math as to what the growth rate has been.  But I think ten years got to be a pretty representative period, because we had some early not so great years in industrial and past couple of years have been really good. But I haven\u2019t done the CAGR, but if you do the CAGR between $14 billion and whatever, $60 billion plus, it\u2019s got to be pretty impressive. The guys are trying to do the math.  But, anyway, you can do the math. It\u2019s certainly higher than what any valuation model will suggest and I bet you, it\u2019s higher than a lot of public company asset managers. It\u2019s 16% annual growth rate in third-party funds under management. So \u2013 and the limiter on that growth is not our ability raise capital. We can go out there and raise \u2013 more capital than we have right now.  It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t want to raise the capital if we think we don\u2019t have good deployment opportunities for us. So, we don\u2019t want our queues getting too long and investors to get frustrated and we certainly don\u2019t want to have a big queue that forces deal making like we see in a lot of other places.\nChris Caton : We\u2019ve raised somewhere between $2 billion and $6 billion of good capital over the course of last three years depending on the need. This year you will be interested to know that 15% of the new capital that\u2019s raised is from new investors, new to Prologis. So that really underscores the broadening of interest in the logistics sector.  The other thing that I think you are going to find interesting is that 50% of the investors are now diligencing ESG as an imperative. So, that really plays to our strength. We\u2019ve been an ESG leader for more than two decades. So, I think that\u2019s a differentiator for PLD.\nGene Reilly : Hey, Rob. I\u2019d just also point out from a key focus on equity raising. But these are open-ended funds are extremely low levered. They are A minus rated entities. They have significant financing capacity. So we\u2019ve got a lot of runway just by using their balance sheets, much less ours. And then thanks for pointing out your point about G&A and scale.  I mean, that just tells you the power of the scale of these businesses. We talked about the AUM growth, that\u2019s 16 over the last ten years or 18 over the last five years. But it\u2019s all about cash flow and EBITDA. That\u2019s grown 26% CAGR in the last five years. And as we grow, the vast majority of that money is going to drop to the bottom-line.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Tom Catherwood, BTIG.\nTom Catherwood : Excellent. Thank you, guys. Hamid, just wanted to follow-up on your comment on industrial development not penciling out. Last quarter, I think you had mentioned that replacement cost could increase by mid and as much as 25% and that Prologis had gotten ahead of that by pre-ordering a lot of material including steel.  As we sit today, what are your current thoughts as far as input costs and how they could continue to trend? And is there a timeframe in which you might kind of fully utilize the material you pre-ordered and we could see maybe more margin compression on the development side is yet to take kind of market rates for those? What are your thoughts on that?\nHamid Moghadam : Yes. In terms of our pre-purchasing steel, I didn\u2019t want to create the false impression that we\u2019ve got our entire development program hedged on steel costs. And we are pretty much working through the steel that\u2019s been hedged.  So, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big factor in forecasting margins going forward. My personal view is that some of these supply chain-related issues that have impacted material costs are going to subside and there was a period out there a year or two years out where maybe the steel price escalation could reverse and get back on a sort of normal inflationary trend, once all the plants are back up and producing.  But the most important thing affecting margins is what Gene mentioned a little while ago, which is that, cap rates are compressing and rents are growing faster than land cost and replacement costs are going up. So the margins, if anything are going to expand unless something material changes that I can\u2019t think of right now, particularly given the outlook for demand. And when someone asks Chris about the different sectors and all that, notably absent in his sectors was housing. Housing is still not anywhere near its potential and it\u2019s a big consumer of warehouse space that hasn\u2019t even kicked in. And you know how low the housing inventory is and how much prices are going up in the housing sector. So I expect actually that to be an additional engine of growth for demand.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim : Yes. Good morning. Just wanted to go back to the land topic. You guys bought more land year-to-date than you did in 2020. Just curious - so just a couple of broad questions. You already have a pretty sizable land base.  I am just curious about what the thinking is behind that? Is it \u2013 shouldn\u2019t been feel good that you had to kind secure market value land to put it to work relatively soon? Or is there a longer term element to it that you think the demand is long lasting and so good that you wanted to replenish the land inventory?  And also, how should we think about the $18 billion of build out in your land bank today? Should we expect that to start to get smaller as we do more development? Or is this a level that you plan you can maintain just to keep things humming along?\nTom Olinger : Yes, couple of things, Ki Bin. First of all, land comes in couple of different flavors. One is raw unentitled land, of which we buy some but not a lot. Second comes in the form of options that we actually don\u2019t buy. It doesn\u2019t show up in the period when we made the deal. It shows up in the period that we actually closed the land option.  So, I don\u2019t know the specifics for this quarter that you are looking at. But we can find that out. But it could be closing in options that we negotiated many, many moons ago. And finally, the infrastructure cost of improving land shows up as land and it may not be actually new land, it may be just additional infrastructure on existing land. For example, in our Tracy Park, we are doing million square foot deals like they are going out of style and along with that, we need to put the infrastructure in and with that land we bought in 2012. But that infrastructure it shows up as a little land. Finally, an increasing percentage of our land is covered land place and they have an income stream and they pencil as investments even if we weren\u2019t going to scrape them and redevelop them down the road. So, these are land purchases deals that are actually pretty attractive in their own right. But they also have an embedded upside in terms of developing new product on it. Gene, anything?\nGene Reilly : Yes. So, Ki Bin, if you look at that $18 billion of build out, about 44% of it is either covered land place or option land. And if you look at how we are replenishing the land bank over time, we are sticking pretty much to those ratios. So, nearly 50% of it comes in those two categories and with respect to the size of the land bank, it\u2019s got to grow. Our development program is growing and you are going to see the land bank grow along with it.\nTom Olinger : A good example would be this Hilltop transaction that got all this attention that all of a sudden are we going to the retail business? No, we are not going to the retail business. That\u2019s just another way of buying land with the yield on it. So, but it\u2019s chunky. It\u2019s $100 million. So that shows up as that can move the numbers around in a given quarter by quite a bit. But it\u2019s covered land place at the end of the day.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is a follow-up from Jamie Feldman, Bank of America.\nJamie Feldman : Thanks. I just wanted \u2013 I have two quick follow-up questions. One is going back to the supply chain shortages, pleasantly surprised to see you raised your starts guidance and your stabilizations guidance. Would you say that we\u2019ll see that across the board in this sector? Or there is something specific about the PLD platform that let you continue on with your development plans?  And then, secondly, you mentioned housing is not yet at its full potential for demand. Any thoughts - latest thoughts on re-shoring and what that could mean to demand and then anything coming out of Congress with the infrastructure bill that could also be a driver of growth? Thank you.\nTom Olinger : Yes. On the infrastructure side, a lot of it isn\u2019t infrastructure, this is I can tell. So I don\u2019t think those things are necessarily going to add a lot of business. But the real infrastructure for part, this is less than $1 billion should be really great for the business.  Onshoring is - I only see onshoring in newspaper articles. I haven\u2019t really actually seen them and if you look at the import numbers, we set month-after-month of records. And now I do think there will be onshoring of medical supplies and PPE. And some of the things that are strategic to use an over-used word. But generally speaking, we just don\u2019t have the resources, the infrastructure, the labor, the knowhow to manufacture a lot of the things that come into our containers. Gene, anything?\nGene Reilly : Yes. I mean, I think you will see in the Mexico, they are seeing it. But I don\u2019t think you see re-shoring here. What was the first part of your question?\nChris Caton : What we see others.\nGene Reilly : Right. Right.\nTom Olinger : Well, I have no idea. \nGene Reilly : Yes, we need to.\nTom Olinger : Yes, I mean we\u2019ll find out in a couple of weeks. But the \u2013 I can tell you that \u2013 and you\u2019ve heard us talk about this for years now. We\u2019ve really taken the customer and put it in the middle of our business, and that is paying dividends. So this customer-centric model allows us to do a lot of business. By the way that playbook will get like copied like everything else.  So, I assume, other people will do the same thing. But so far, we are doing great with major customer business. Thanks to the good work that the teams are doing.  With that, Jamie, you were the last. So, thank you again for your attention and we look forward to talking to you before next quarter for sure. Take care.\nOperator: Once again, we\u2019d like to thank you for participating in today\u2019s Prologis conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mike Curless",
            "content": "Yes. I think one way you can really represent this is the fact that we've had more customers competing over space than we've seen ever before and that creates some difficult situations. So we always start with transparency with both parties. But I got to tell you the rent becomes a very minor discussion just the availability and accessibility of that space becomes the priority. So I think that's a good description of what we are seeing out there in terms of the customers' priorities. Hey. This is Mike. It's certainly a little bit of both. I think the bigger story here is, we get asked a lot of questions about is it all about Amazon? And while they've been very steady and robust in terms of their activity with us this year with actually plenty of back-end activity coming up in the next couple of quarters.  The bigger takeaway is what Tom said in the earnings front-end here were the other customers. Last year, we leased about 50 non-Amazon \u2013 50 leases to non-Amazon e-com players. This time fast forward, the number is three times as high and it's a wide variety of smaller and larger customers. There is some big brand names in there like walmart.com or MercadoLibre in Latin America, JD.com.  But the bigger story is, there is over 150 of these smaller, more diversified players using a combination of insourcing and outsourcing. We really like that diversification there and again, the story is just not all about Amazon."

            "name": "Chris Caton",
            "content": "Hey, Steve, it's Chris Caton. I am going to jump in with a few highlights and then, I think, Gene will share some color. I think there are three or four demand trends that represent themselves. The first is broadly the diversification of e-commerce. So, internationalization of the major players or small and mid-size players stepping up.  The second is the growth leaders of last year are leasing safe. Think about food companies, pharmaceuticals, and durable goods companies. The third trend would be supply chain resilience. For example, we see the core markets are among the strongest they've ever been. So, you have several clear themes playing through demand. Yes. So, the message on e-commerce is actually, it's very diverse. And I think if you look across the maturity of different organizations, they all want something slightly different. So, if you have a large international player, I do think they are getting much more pinpointed. We've seen a lot of growth, for example, in the last such sub-markets.  There is a lot of focus on shortening those delivery times. But more mid-size organizations might be in an adjacent location or in a regional location to still build out the basic infrastructure for executing online. Yes. I would add two things, which we sort of assume that are important. First the business' scale. It's a $60 billion plus business. I mean, that puts us among the top real estate asset managers anywhere by any measure and we are focused on one property type. So that's a pretty significant market share in the most desirable market. So that's place to the premium.  And also, I would say, we have the longest history of actually producing these returns that goes back to AMD's early days in the mid-80s. So, both in terms of longevity, the quality of the income stream, these are not a bunch of closed-end funds that expire. These are, as Tom pointed out, very sticky and long-lived cash flow streams.  I would argue that they have more leverage on the upside than the real estate cash flows that support that business because of the fee and promote structure. So, for the life of me, I don't really understand why they are being valued the way they are, but we are going to do a better job of explaining that to people who follow this business, because we are honestly getting a lot of receptivity from those investors that really understand this sector. Hey, Dave, it's Chris Caton. I'll kick it off. So first off, as has been shared a few times, right now it's fulfillment by any means necessary. Trying to get goods into the country. Look, inventories are down 10% from pre-pandemic levels. And so, it's really just a race to get levels in. As it relates to resilience, I do think we are starting to see this, but I think the specific numbers of people are looking at.  They are not yet at the strategic planning phase they are much more tactically focused on fixing their supply chains this year. Refresh up in our supply chain conference four days ago, 75% of people we spoke with, they had a poll survey said increasing inventories do have resilience related issues with top of mind and we are starting to see that play out. Hey, Vince. It's Chris Caton. So indeed, we did make a material increase and look, I think the facts of the situation are really impressive. Rents in the U.S. are up nearly 7% just in the first half of the year, that's a record. And look, it's not just the U.S. rents are rising, in Europe they are up 2% so far this year.

I don't know which and they may be wrong. But I can tell you that with today's marginal land cost and building cost, no way you come close to that clearing your margin in development.

            "name": "Gene Reilly",
            "content": "Yes. So, Steve, the only thing I would add to that is, if you want to get some geographic color is, coastal markets are definitely doing better. You look at the U.S., Southern California and New Jersey by far I think have the strongest demand dynamics. But I'd also say that it's very difficult to find a weak market globally, no matter where they are, in the Latin America, Europe, the U.S. There is strength in demand really everywhere. Yes. This is, Gene. So, I'll take that. So I think you are \u2013 if you look at the conversations we are having with customers and what their pain points are relative \u2013 excuse me. There is - Let me jump in here and continue with my point. But with respect to gas prices, that pretty much makes location on the more important. So I think that's probably a tailwind with respect to rents. Yes. Tom, I'll take that. I think part of it is driven by strong results in other Americas and Europe was also strong. I think it's more of a reflection of a easier comp in Q2 of 2020 than everything else. But listen, I think longer term, I mean, by and large, particularly in Europe, the cap rates have dropped further in Europe over the last several years.  That's been more of a headwind on rent growth and I would expect, going forward, we are going to see whether it's next year, the year after that, but we are going to see growth in our international markets to be on par if not better than our U.S. markets. Yes. The other issue you should keep in mind is that we are pushing rents a lot harder than we were before. So, likely to replace existing customers with the most efficient customers that have the highest value chain and the ability to pay. So, that reshuffle has been accelerated in the last 12, 24 months. Yes. Mike, this is Gene. I think the \u2013 I think that's going to hold. In fact, I think we might see ultimately a higher build-to-suit percentage. And I'd be careful looking at the comparison of margins between build-to-suit and spec, because the mix has an awful lot to do with it. How long the transaction has taken to negotiate has something to do with it.  But I think in both cases, you can expect margins to creep up. We have cost increasing on us on the construction side. But we have return compression and rent growth that's ahead of our underwriting expectations and that overwhelms the cost increases. So I think, generally going to see margins expand. Hey, Rob. I'd just also point out from a key focus on equity raising. But these are open-ended funds are extremely low levered. They are A minus rated entities. They have significant financing capacity.

            "content": "Gene is having a little bit of issue with the access to it. So, let me cover while he \u2013 there is a sort of. So the conversations are mostly around labor. That is absolutely a pain point. But there is an ability to push through our pricing today, because when you have retail sales jump 20% from pre-pandemic levels and God knows what percent from pandemic levels. And the supply chain is dry and there is very little probability of losing that piece of business, because people are flushed with cash and out there spending money. I think this is going to continue for a while. So, basically, everybody's hair is on fire trying to keep up with demand. And Mike, any additional color on that? Well, historically we pencil in a 50 basis point \u2013 used to pencil in a 50 basis point increase in the residual calculation based on our rents projections and alike. But I think 50 basis points when cap rates were 9% was quite a bit and when the cap rates are in the mid-3s, that's even a great deal more on a relative basis. So, we are mostly using about a 25% increase in residual calculations ten years out.  But again, we are an infinite life vehicle. When you invest in our REIT, you don't \u2013 we just sell non-strategic assets. We don't sell our other assets that we like. You look at the dividends or the cash flow that comes off those assets and the growth rate of those assets that translates into a very nice overall IRR, which is really the fundamental driver of value in our business. Yes. In terms of our pre-purchasing steel, I didn't want to create the false impression that we've got our entire development program hedged on steel costs. And we are pretty much working through the steel that's been hedged.  So, I don't think that's a big factor in forecasting margins going forward. My personal view is that some of these supply chain-related issues that have impacted material costs are going to subside and there was a period out there a year or two years out where maybe the steel price escalation could reverse and get back on a sort of normal inflationary trend, once all the plants are back up and producing.  But the most important thing affecting margins is what Gene mentioned a little while ago, which is that, cap rates are compressing and rents are growing faster than land cost and replacement costs are going up. So the margins, if anything are going to expand unless something material changes that I can't think of right now, particularly given the outlook for demand. And when someone asks Chris about the different sectors and all that, notably absent in his sectors was housing. Housing is still not anywhere near its potential and it's a big consumer of warehouse space that hasn't even kicked in. And you know how low the housing inventory is and how much prices are going up in the housing sector. So I expect actually that to be an additional engine of growth for demand."

            "name": "Tom Olinger",
            "content": "Thank you, Tracy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. The second quarter exceeded our expectations both in terms of our results and outlook for 2021 and beyond. With our exceptional portfolio and teams, we set high watermarks across several measures this quarter. Demand for space is robust and diverse and market conditions remained the healthiest in our 38-year history.  In the second quarter, lease signings were 64 million square feet and lease proposals were 84 million square feet, both remain above average and were driven by new and development leasing. Likewise, the Prologis IBI Customer Activity Index reached a new high in the second quarter, an early indicator of strong future demand. Our leasing mix is broad. Currently, the greatest demand is for spaces above 100,000 square feet. For smaller spaces, activity is picking up. We signed 518 leases totaling 18 million square feet in the quarter, the highest volume in this segment in three years.  For customer segments, e-commerce continues to lead the way, representing 30% of new lease signings in the second quarter. While Amazon remains steady at 6% of total new leasing, we have seen many more e-commerce players come to the table. For example, we signed 168 new e-commerce leases in the first half of 2021 versus 53 in the first half of last year. Supply chains are raising, beginning to restock. And as they view, we'll create more demand going forward. Containerized imports are up 33% through May versus pre-pandemic levels, as retailers replenished their supply chains. While inventories have risen 3% from their trough, they have struggled to grow this year as retain sales are up 19% from pre-pandemic levels. We see the current low level of inventories on our space utilization, which at 84.3% is below the long-term average of 85%. This is yet another sign that our customers are operating with suboptimal levels of inventory.  Putting together the recent outperformance and ongoing momentum, we are raising our 2021 U.S. forecast for net absorption by 20% to 360 million square feet and deliveries by 8% to 325 million square feet.  Looking forward, we foresee continued supply balanced by demand with historic low vacancy of 4.5% carrying into 2022. With balanced demand and supply, acute scarcity in our markets is driving record rents and value growth, while operating portfolio lease percentage rose by 80 basis points to 97.2% at quarter-end.  Customers continue to compete for space and are making decisions faster with lease gestation in the quarter of just 44 days. When we look at the factors impacting supply, significant barriers exists in our markets and include a lack of buyable land, increasingly difficult and expensive permitting and entitlement processes and rapidly escalating replacement cost. Our research team released an excellent paper on this last month, which you can find on our website.  Our supply watch list remains quite small. We reviewed Houston in the quarter leaving just Spain and Poland. Accelerating demand in the quarter, combined with ultra low vacancies, translated to a very strong rent growth of 4.1% in our U.S. markets exceeding our expectations. As a result, we are raising our 2021 rent forecast an all-time high of 10.3% for the U.S., up approximately 40 basis points from our prior estimate and 8% globally, which is up 300 basis points.  Our in-place to market rent spread is now the widest in our history at 16.9%, up 330 basis points sequentially. This represents future gas in the tank of nearly $700 million in NOI, or $0.90 per share.  Turning to valuations. Our assets have strongest quarterly uplift in our history, rising 8% in the second quarter alone, with the U.S. up more than 10% and Europe up 5.6%. On the topic of valuation, I want to point out that we enhanced the NAV disclosure in our supplemental related to property management fees.  Given the size and scale of our portfolio, we created substantial value through our operational advantages. As a result, we know that real estate is worth more in our hands. Accordingly, we are now including net property management fee income as the bone in the adjusted NOI in our NAV disclosure. Switching gears to results for the quarter, our team and portfolio continued to deliver excellent financial results. Core FFO was $1.01 per share, with net promote earnings effectively zero, rent change on rollover was 32%. Occupancy at quarter-end was 96.8%, up 110 basis points sequentially.  Cash same-store NOI growth accelerated to 5.8%, 290 basis points year-over-year. We tapped into favorable market conditions and disposed of $880 million of non-strategic assets across our portfolio.  In addition, just last week, we completed the sale of a $920 million owned and managed portfolio, including all of the non-strategic IPT assets. It's worth noting that to date, we have sold $2 billion of non-strategic assets from our IPT and LPT acquisitions at pricing more than 23% above underwriting. Turning to strategic capital. Our team raised almost $600 million in the second quarter. Equity cues from our open-ended vehicles were $3.3 billion at quarter end, hitting another all-time high. Robust investor interest has prompted private equity limited partners to shift away from diversify to more sector-specific funds, particularly for the logistics sector. In light of recent asset management transactions and public cost, the value being ascribed to our strategic capital business is uniquely understated. For the balance sheet, we continue to maintain excellent financial strength with liquidity and combined leverage capacity between Prologis and our open-ended vehicles totaling $14 billion. Moving to guidance for 2021. Our outlook has further improved given higher rent growth, higher valuations and robust demand. Here are the key updates on an our share basis. We are increasing our cash same-store NOI growth midpoint by 75 basis points to now range between 5.25% and 5.75%. We expect bad debt expense to be approximately 10 basis points of gross revenues, down from our prior guidance midpoint of 20 basis points and well below our historical average. We are increasing the midpoint for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes, to $470 million, up $15 million from prior guidance. This upward revision is due to increased asset management fees resulting from higher property values. Faster development lease-up and higher asset values are also leading to an increase in promotes.  We now expect net promote income of $0.02 for this year, an increase of $0.04 from our prior guidance. We are also increasing development starts by $300 million and now expect a midpoint of $3.2 billion. Build-to-suits will comprise more than 40% of development volume. Our owned and managed land portfolio, which is composed of land, options, and covered land place supports $18 billion of future development over the next several years. We are also increasing the midpoint for dispositions and contributions by $650 million in total. This increase will have roughly a $0.02 drag on earnings this year, given the timing to redeploy incremental proceeds.  We now expect to generate net deployment sources of $200 million at the midpoint, with leverage remaining effectively flat in 2021. Taking these assumptions into account, we are increasing our core FFO midpoint by $0.07 and narrowing the range to $4.04 to $4.08 per share. Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.02 and $4.06 per share, representing year-over-year growth at the midpoint of almost 13%. We continue to maintain exceptional dividend coverage and our 2021 guidance implies a payout ratio in the low 60% range and free cash flow after dividends of $1.3 billion. In closing, the first half of the year has been extraordinary and our outlook is equally promising. Visibility into our strong future organic earnings potential is very clear. We have a significant embedded in-place to market rent spread, the development-ready land portfolio, substantial balance sheet capacity and ability to create value for our customers beyond the real estate. With that, I'll turn it back to Holly for your questions. Hey, Caitlin, thanks for your questions. This is Tom. I'll take a first shot at that. I think there are several aspects of our development business that are quite unique. The first I would just think looking at the size of that portfolio $18 billion of build out, almost 20% of our market cap. And that portfolio was very focused in our high barrier markets at which we operate. So we've got a land bank that we can build out.  A very, very high quality portfolio that's in high demand. It's very diversified across 19 different countries and it's a huge opportunity set that our development platform has to build out and just having the menu to seek the best returns and to solve customers' problems across all of those different markets is a huge advantage. And I think that leads to just the durability of those development gains. So if you look at our track record, we've got a track record of 20 years, developing $37 billion of assets, 20% unlevered IRR and we did those results verified externally by Duff & Phelps, by the way, but -so anincredibletrack record of durability. So, when you look at the $18 billion of build out, our history of being able to continue to develop at very, very attractive rates, there is a very, very long runway of opportunity that's just presented in front of us. And then, to your point on realized gains, I think it's another point that makes sense quite unique that given our capital structure and how it works, how we want to structure the vast majority of our assets outside the U.S. are held in funds, but we are developing the vast majority of those assets on balance sheet Europe, in Japan, Mexico.  And those assets, with very few exceptions, are contributing into our funds. So there is a real crystallization of those gains. So, when you think about the 20% unlevered IRRs all that development, the vast majority of those gains were realized in cash and that's a real cash flow. That \u2013 it's part of your AFFO and should be embedded in your valuation. I think when we look at valuation in particular for development, I think, it is a very scattershot approach because there is a couple of different things you have to do. Obviously, you've got the CIP that's in front of you. You got to face that and value that. You got your land bank, in our case, $18 billion that you have to value.  And there is also residual for this platform, right? This platform has a history of $37 billion and 20% unlevered IRRs. There is a value here. So, I think you can put those all together. There is different ways to do it, obviously. But I would just encourage you to take a look at the cash flows that this thing generates historically. And I think you are going to find the valuation for our development capabilities are, I would say, significantly undervalued. Craig, I wish we were losing more deals because of rent, because we actually look at that on a quarterly basis by geography and the number is under 5%, which to me it means we may not be pushing rents enough. So, in a way, the fact that we are not losing those deals to rents may not be such a great bank. Yes, Vikram, it's Tom. I will take that first. So, I think let's start with that business and how that business has grown. If you look over the last five years, any land and revenues of that business has grown 18%, some 18% CAGR. More importantly, the EBITDA or cash flow that that business is generating has grown by 26% CAGR, so incredible growth.  As we look forward, just given what we are seeing, I think the opportunities are there for very strong continued EBITDA growth. So I think that's a baseline I would think about there. A highly, highly scalable business for what we do. And relative to valuation, there have been I think clarity around valuation in this business. It has never been better because there has been several transactions that have cleared the market lately and you can certainly look at public comps. I think for us, you need to look at the alternative asset managers as the right place to start.  And while there are a lot of different ways, I think analysts and investors are looking at multiple, but when you work through it all for the alternative of those and the comps we are seeing, you are going to see multiples in the mid-20s on earnings and those include promotes. So when you strip out promotes, you are seeing for the best alternative asset managers a multiple of 30 or higher, and they are getting an x on promotes. So, yes, that would tell you our business is - I would say, very undervalued, because as you are thinking about how we compare to them, I think you need to think about the stickiness of our AUM. 90% plus of our AUM is in long life or perpetual vehicles.  We talked about the growth profile that we have and then clearly, there is incredible investor demand for our product, which is also lining up to support growth. Our equity queue at quarter end was $3.3 billion, an all-time high. So, happy to get into more discussions with you all on this going forward. But lot of good visibility out there on valuation. We do not care one iota about external growth and through M&A. It is \u2013 that is no skill of the management team. Just multiple conversion and dismiss that fair that our size prevents us from growing fast.  I would just invite people to look at the numbers and you can strip out the M&A from that. So M&A is opportunistic. It's never part of our business plan and if we never had another dollar of M&A, outplay our growth rate against anybody else's in any center frankly over time. Yes, I would also say that land is very difficult in the U.S. but it's even more difficult in Europe because the government is a much bigger actor in allocating land out and they really tie it to employment and they are not wild about logistics. So land supply is just that much more difficult. Blaine, this is Tom. That's a good observation. What is driving that over the last four quarters and particularly in the second quarter is higher levels of new leasing. So new leasing in Q2 versus Q1 increased 40% sequentially. And new leases generally come with slightly higher concessions, slightly higher turnover costs as a result, but the key is we are looking at long-term economics. So, yes, there is a little bit of short-term pain with that but we are getting in what we believe to be a better cash flow and higher rents. So, I think that's the key. We are looking at the long-term economics here and we are getting at.  I do think, in clearly, over the last four quarters, we've seen much higher levels of new leasing than in the past, I think that's going to moderate a bit going forward. But we are looking at the long-term end game here and it's clearly the right economic decision to make. I think there is a frenzy on playing catch-up that that is creating a lot of activity. I mean, I think people - if anything the pandemic sort of suggested that they can take business as usual in a very incremental approach with respect to their e-commerce strategy and now they are realizing how important it is and they are just pedal to the metal and that's showing up in our 3PL leasing statistics as well. Vince, this is Tom. I would just tack on the impact of \u2013 and on our earnings, right? I mean, we are rolling around 16%, 17% of our portfolio for a year now. So all of this good news on rent growth is not coming to the P&L right away. So you need to look at the in-place to market which significantly gapped out this quarter now at almost 17%.  And as I said in my prepared remarks, it's almost $700 million of incremental NOI and want to see where rent growth continues to go. But I would continue to think that in-place market is going to March a little higher. Hey, Rob. Let me take a shot at this. Today's \u2013 our third-party AUM is mid $60 billion. At the time of the merger exactly 10 years ago, the merger closed on June 30 of 2011, exactly ten years ago, it was $14 billion. So, you do the math as to what the growth rate has been.  But I think ten years got to be a pretty representative period, because we had some early not so great years in industrial and past couple of years have been really good. But I haven't done the CAGR, but if you do the CAGR between $14 billion and whatever, $60 billion plus, it's got to be pretty impressive. The guys are trying to do the math.  But, anyway, you can do the math. It's certainly higher than what any valuation model will suggest and I bet you, it's higher than a lot of public company asset managers. It's 16% annual growth rate in third-party funds under management. So \u2013 and the limiter on that growth is not our ability raise capital. We can go out there and raise \u2013 more capital than we have right now.  It's just that we don't want to raise the capital if we think we don't have good deployment opportunities for us. So, we don't want our queues getting too long and investors to get frustrated and we certainly don't want to have a big queue that forces deal making like we see in a lot of other places. Yes, couple of things, Ki Bin. First of all, land comes in couple of different flavors. One is raw unentitled land, of which we buy some but not a lot. Second comes in the form of options that we actually don't buy. It doesn't show up in the period when we made the deal. It shows up in the period that we actually closed the land option.  So, I don't know the specifics for this quarter that you are looking at. But we can find that out. But it could be closing in options that we negotiated many, many moons ago. And finally, the infrastructure cost of improving land shows up as land and it may not be actually new land, it may be just additional infrastructure on existing land. For example, in our Tracy Park, we are doing million square foot deals like they are going out of style and along with that, we need to put the infrastructure in and with that land we bought in 2012. But that infrastructure it shows up as a little land. Finally, an increasing percentage of our land is covered land place and they have an income stream and they pencil as investments even if we weren't going to scrape them and redevelop them down the road. So, these are land purchases deals that are actually pretty attractive in their own right. But they also have an embedded upside in terms of developing new product on it. Gene, anything? A good example would be this Hilltop transaction that got all this attention that all of a sudden are we going to the retail business? No, we are not going to the retail business. That's just another way of buying land with the yield on it. So, but it's chunky. It's $100 million. So that shows up as that can move the numbers around in a given quarter by quite a bit. But it's covered land place at the end of the day. Yes. On the infrastructure side, a lot of it isn't infrastructure, this is I can tell. So I don't think those things are necessarily going to add a lot of business. But the real infrastructure for part, this is less than $1 billion should be really great for the business.  Onshoring is - I only see onshoring in newspaper articles. I haven't really actually seen them and if you look at the import numbers, we set month-after-month of records. And now I do think there will be onshoring of medical supplies and PPE. And some of the things that are strategic to use an over-used word. But generally speaking, we just don't have the resources, the infrastructure, the labor, the knowhow to manufacture a lot of the things that come into our containers. Gene, anything? Well, I have no idea. Yes, I mean we'll find out in a couple of weeks. But the \u2013 I can tell you that \u2013 and you've heard us talk about this for years now. We've really taken the customer and put it in the middle of our business, and that is paying dividends. So this customer-centric model allows us to do a lot of business. By the way that playbook will get like copied like everything else.  So, I assume, other people will do the same thing. But so far, we are doing great with major customer business. Thanks to the good work that the teams are doing.  With that, Jamie, you were the last. So, thank you again for your attention and we look forward to talking to you before next quarter for sure. Take care."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead.\nRonald Hubbard: Thank you, Don. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Schnur, Chief Operating Officer; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer. Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our 10-K or 10-Q that we have on file with the SEC and the company's other SEC filings. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, April 29, 2021, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures that we provide on this call is included in our earnings release. Our earnings release and supplemental package were distributed last night after the market closed. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at dukerealty.com. You can also find our earnings release, supplemental package, SEC reports and an audio webcast of this call in the Investor Relations section of our website as well. Now for our prepared statement, I'll turn it over to Jim Connor.\nJames Connor: Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. I will open by saying as always, we hope you and your families are safe and healthy, and that you have the opportunity to be vaccinated. The fundamentals of our business continue to be as good as ever. We've now had 2 successive quarters of demand breaking all-time records. Our development platform had a record first quarter of starts, and our core portfolio continues to perform at the top of the class. Our liquidity position and sources of capital are very attractively priced to capture opportunities, including our execution of 2 green debt transactions. All of these drivers result in us raising key components of our 2021 guidance that roll up to double-digit growth in expected core FFO and AFFO with the midpoints. Now let me turn it over to Steve to cover our operations.\nSteven Schnur: Thanks, Jim. I'll first cover overall market fundamentals, then review our operational results. Industrial net absorption in the first quarter according to CBRE registered an impressive 100 million square feet, marking the first time that demand has exceeded 100 million square feet in consecutive quarters. This was more than enough to offset new supply as completions dipped to 57 million square feet from about 70 million square feet in the fourth quarter of 2020. This positive net absorption over deliveries for the quarter reduced vacancy down to 4.4%, which is back down near the record levels we saw throughout most of 2019. The strong mix and fundamentals increased asking rents by over 7% compared to the previous year. CBRE now projects demand for the full year to surpass 300 million square feet, perhaps even breaking the 2016 record of 327 million square feet. They project deliveries to be about 300 million square feet as well. The overall sector continues to remain very much in balance, which will produce another year of growth in asking rents of high single digits nationally. On the macroeconomic front, the increasing pace of vaccinations, the stimulus being pumped into the U.S. economy and the arrival of spring weather has generated some significant recent data points indicative of a very strong year in our business. The recent March consumer confidence rating is back near the range of 2018 and 2019, and the GDP growth is projected to be in the 6% to 7% range. This bodes very well for demand in logistics real estate. And in addition, we have the secular drivers in our business that remain firmly intact and stronger than prepandemic. To that point, the growth in retail sales and e-commerce sales across the 2-month February and March period were up 12% and 28%, respectively. And perhaps more notably, when measured against the 2019 pre - nonpandemic time frame, the recent February and March figures were up 15% and 43%, respectively. In addition, the experience of the supply chain bottlenecks and response for greater business inventory redundancy is expected to push the retail inventory to sales ratio to above historic levels, yet it now sits near record low levels. Demand by occupier type remains broad-based and very active, with pure e-commerce, omnichannel retailers, 3PLs, health care supply firms and food and beverage companies leading the way. Now I'll turn to our own portfolio. We executed a very solid first quarter by signing 7.4 million square feet of new leases. On first-generation leasing, we signed 3 transactions to stabilize assets that were previously in the unstabilized in-service and spec development pools, including 146,000-square-foot lease on a spec development in Southern California, Mid-Counties submarket for 100% of the space. The lease activity for the quarter, combined with strong fundamentals I mentioned, led to continued growth in rents in our portfolio as we reported 11.4% cash, 26.2% on a GAAP basis. The mark-to-market on our portfolio leases is at 17% below market rental rates, which is supportive of continued strong rent growth. We also had an exceptional quarter of development starts. As initially reflected in our press release last month, on top of the $373 million of starts we reported in the press release, at quarter end, we signed another $39 million project in the Tampa's market, which is build-to-suit for an e-commerce retailer. In total, we started 11 projects during the quarter, totaling 3.8 million square feet and $412 million in cost. These projects were 60% preleased with value creation estimated near 40%. We're very - we're also very proud that 3 of the 4 build-to-suits we signed during the quarter was repeat customers. Our development pipeline at quarter end totaled $1.4 billion with 68% allocated to our coastal Tier 1 markets. The pipeline - this pipeline was 65% preleased as of March 31. Looking forward and consistent with the strong fundamentals I discussed and our best-in-class local operating teams, our outlook for new development starts is as strong as it's ever been, as reflected by our revised guidance of over 30% from our original midpoint. I'll also note, we do expect our pipeline preleasing percentage to potentially drop a bit in future quarters as we put fully leased assets in service and start more speculative development projects in high-barrier Tier 1 submarkets where fundamentals are very strong. I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover acquisitions and disposition.\nNicholas Anthony: Thanks, Steve. For the quarter, we sold $94 million of assets comprised of 2 facilities in Houston as well as 2 facilities in Indianapolis owned in a 50-50 joint venture. In turn, we used part of these proceeds to acquire 3 buildings totaling 680,000 square feet for $51 million, including 1 asset in Southern California's IE West submarket and 1 in Northern New Jersey's Meadowlands submarket. The third facility acquired was in the Indianapolis Airport submarket and was part of a joint venture liquidation and asset swap. These buildings were all 100% leased within markets where we expect strong market rent growth that will contribute to long-term IRRs well in excess of the assets we sold. From a strategic positioning standpoint, the net effect of our development, disposition and acquisition activity this quarter moves our coastal Tier 1 exposure to over 42% of GAV. We've begun marketing a few Midwestern assets leased to Amazon for outright sale, while certain assets leased to Amazon in other noncoastal Tier 1 markets may either be sold outright or contributed to a joint venture. In addition, the more recent news on disposition in last night's press release, that we are now marketing for sale our entire 5.2 million-square-foot St. Louis portfolio. The rationale on the sale is threefold. One, we are taking advantage of increased investor demand for logistics assets; two, the portfolio accelerates our strategic objective to increase our exposure to coastal Tier 1 markets; and three, it will provide a source of funds for our increasing development pipeline. As a result, we have raised the midpoint of our full year expected dispositions by $400 million. Altogether, we expect our planned 2021 disposition activity to be weighted toward the middle of the year. I will now turn our call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and guidance update.\nMark Denien: Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.39 per share, which represents 18% growth over the first quarter of 2020. We've been saying for the last few quarters that we expected our core FFO growth rates to accelerate and begin to approach our already strong AFFO growth rates. The results from the current quarter and our revised guidance certainly reflect this. AFFO totaled $140 million for the quarter. Our best-in-class low level of capital expenditures, along with the strong NOI growth, continues to generate significant AFFO growth to reinvest into our business. Our best-in-sector rent collections continued in the first quarter of 2021 with more than 99.9% of rents collected. We have also collected more than 99.9% of April rents. And we now only have $52,000 under deferral arrangements remaining to be collected and had effectively no bad debt expense in the first quarter. Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 was 6.3%. The growth in same-property NOI was due to increased occupancy and rent growth as well as the burn-off of free rent compared to the first quarter of 2020. We do expect this growth to moderate for the remainder of the year based on tougher occupancy comps and less free rent burn-off, but to remain strong nonetheless. We finished the quarter with no outstanding borrowings on our own secured line of credit, which we renewed in March and extended through March of 2026, including our extension options. We reduced our borrowing rate by 10 basis points compared to the previous facility. As part of our commitment to corporate responsibility, the credit facility also includes an incremental reduction in borrowing costs as certain sustainability-linked metrics are achieved each year. Our future debt maturities are well sequenced with less than 3% of our total outstanding debt being scheduled to mature prior to the end of 2023. As a result of our strong start to 2021, we announced revised core FFO guidance for 2021 to a range of $1.65 to $1.71 per share compared to the previous range of $1.62 to $1.68 per share. The $1.68 per share midpoint of our revised core FFO guidance represents an over 10% increase over 2020 results. We also announced revised guidance for growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis to range between 8.0% and 12.3%, with a midpoint of 10.1% compared to the previous range of 5.8% to 10.1%. This increased earnings growth expectation is impressive when considering we are increasing current-year disposition expectations by $400 million to fund development projects that will not contribute to earnings until 2022 and beyond. For same-property NOI growth on a cash basis, we've increased our guidance to a range of 4.1% to 4.9% from the previous range of 3.6% to 4.4%. We continue to outperform our underwriting assumptions for speculative developments, both in the timing of lease-up and in rental rates achieved, and continue to maintain a solid list of build-to-suit projects. Based on this, our revised guidance for development starts is between $950 million and $1.1 billion compared to the previous range of $700 million to $900 million. This increase in development starts will provide a key source of growth in 2022 and beyond. As Nick mentioned, we intend to take advantage of the investment sales market pricing to prefund a significant portion of our development pipeline with an increase in dispositions. Our guidance for dispositions has been revised to between $900 million and $1.1 billion compared to the initial range of $500 million to $700 million. We've updated a couple of other components of our guidance based on our more optimistic outlook as detailed in our range of estimates exhibit, including our supplemental information on our website. I'll now turn it back to Jim for a few closing remarks.\nJames Connor: Thank you, Mark. In closing, a strong economic recovery is unfolding, and numerous secular drivers are continuing to create unparalleled opportunities for our platform to capture growth from rising rental rates, high-margin development opportunities and from raising capital at a very low cost. We're very pleased with our team's execution in the first quarter and now with our expected double-digit growth in core FFO and AFFO. As long as these multiple tailwinds can sustain and as long as the economy continues to recover, we're optimistic we can achieve similar levels of growth for the foreseeable future, that are hopeful it should lead to corresponding increases in our annual quarterly dividend. Thank you for your interest and your support, and we will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Don, you can open up the lines, and we'll now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. First, we go on to the line of Blaine Heck.\nBlaine Heck: I'll start with Nick. As you mentioned, you guys raised disposition guidance pretty significantly this quarter. Outside of St. Louis, are you guys selling any other portfolios? Or will the rest be more kind of one-off and the sale of the Amazon facilities? And then can you give us any sense of how much pricing has actually changed this year, especially in those kind of secondary markets where I'm assuming most of the dispositions will be?\nNicholas Anthony: Yes, Blaine. So most of the other assets are sort of one-offs, a couple of Class B, but mostly long-term credit deals, a lot of them leased to Amazon. So that makes up the rest of it. There's really no portfolios in that guidance number outside of the St. Louis portfolio. As far as pricing goes, we continue to see cap rate compression. It's - the secondary markets have compressed more recently than the coastal markets. But especially some of these Amazon assets, we've been very pleased with the pricing that we're seeing on those transactions as well. So I'd say, over the last 90 days, there's probably been another 25 bps on compression.\nBlaine Heck: Great. That's really helpful. And then maybe for Jim. Several of your competitors have talked about the rising cost of construction now, not just from increasing land cost, but also the raw materials. Can you just talk about how you guys are dealing with that increase in cost and whether you think rents are rising fast enough to keep yields steady? Or maybe should we expect a temporary dip in yields as the material costs are temporarily elevated?\nJames Connor: Yes. Thanks, Blaine. I'll start and then Steve can give you a little color. We've been dealing with land prices escalating for a number of years now. So that's not anything out of the ordinary. Steel is the latest one, and a lot of people are talking about that. One of the advantages of being a national developer is, a, the number of relationships that we have, the leverage that we have and our team's ability to go out and accelerate some of the design and procurement. So sitting here today, we can comfortably tell you that we have the steel we need to finish everything that's in the development pipeline for the balance of the year. And I think Steve can give a little more color on what some of the local teams are doing.\nSteven Schnur: Sure, Blaine. I would just tell you, steel is gaining a lot of headlines, lumber is another one. Land has - obviously, as Jim indicated, has been up significantly for a number of years. Rents are certainly keeping pace. Cap rates are helping. I think the bigger concern, I guess, or cautious thing that we pay attention to is the time frames. Steel is pushed from 10 to 12 weeks to probably 24 to 26 weeks. So more upfront cooperation with architects and tenants to get projects started to make sure you can deliver on time.\nOperator: And next, we go on to the line of John Kim.\nJohn Kim: On your spec developments, are you sensing that there's also increasing spec in your markets from public and private developers? And are there any markets where you're concerned that the spec development is escalating quickly?\nJames Connor: Sure. John Kim, I'll tell you, I think we're - there's competition everywhere. I do think the private players, particularly the larger private players, have been active on the merchant development front. Our focus and where we've got our landholdings in the high-barrier markets, I think we indicated in our release that 88% of our land is now in the coastal Tier 1 markets. The competition there, the vacancy rates there many times are less than 2%. So I think we're comfortable with that. I would tell you, in terms of markets we're concerned about our monitoring supply, there's always going to be a handful of submarkets scattered around. But Houston is the one that we - we have no intentions of starting any projects in Houston, but that market needs to shore itself up a bit.\nJohn Kim: I know you gave your excuses on why you're exiting St. Louis, but why not go the joint venture routes in that market since that seems to be the strategy with some of the other markets?\nNicholas Anthony: This is Nick. The question was, why not JV the St. Louis assets? Generally, we have kept them work. We tried to keep our model more simplistic. And we don't think, strategically, a joint venture there would make as much sense and maybe in some other instances where you could grow it. I just don't know how you - what you would do with it going forward.\nOperator: And next, we go on to the line of Manny Korchman.\nEmmanuel Korchman: Maybe this one for Mark. Just thinking about using dispositions for capital funding for the developments versus issuing common stock here. What's sort of more attractive about selling the assets and exiting those markets than just growing through an equity raise?\nMark Denien: Well, I guess we're using a little bit of everything, Manny. I mean, we did issue a little bit on our ATM in the first quarter. I guess what I would say, and Nick can follow up on this, the St. Louis exit has sort of been on a list for a while. It's really more of an acceleration, something we were probably going to do down the road anyway. And as our development pipeline opportunities ramped up, we just kind of pulled forward some things that we're going to do anyway. But we'll continue to use a little bit of everything as long as our capital is attractively priced.\nNicholas Anthony: Yes. What I would add is this was an opportunity to basically improve our geography going forward and also improve our growth profile going forward just to make - to help improve performance in the future.\nEmmanuel Korchman: And Nick, I don't know if we've talked about this in a little while, but just can you talk about the pricing differential between single assets or larger single assets and portfolios? Is there a pricing difference? And if so, are you looking at one more than the other?\nNicholas Anthony: Well, they're certainly - it's sort of a mixed bag. It's not as black and white as you might think. Obviously, the long-term credit deals are garnering very low cap rates. A lot of them are brand-new, new development. A lot of the portfolio deals that you see out there are a blend of Class A and Class B assets, and a lot of it depends on where the rents are in relation to market. So they generally trade at higher cap rates. And the buyer pool is not necessarily as deep on those because they're a little harder to underwrite and get your hands around. But it is sort of comparing apples and oranges there on those 2 different types.\nEmmanuel Korchman: So - and then the second part of the question, are you more interested right now in buying some single assets in varied markets versus picking up a portfolio?\nNicholas Anthony: We - yes. Typically, on the acquisition side, we focused on 1 to 3 assets at a time because we want to focus on buying what we want, where we want it. So it complements our strategy. Typically, when we've done larger portfolios, we got lucky with the Bridge transaction several years ago because it's all where we wanted it. But typically, what happens on some of these portfolios is you get a lot of assets and locations that you wouldn't normally want to be in, and it creates a lot of friction and noise trying to reposition those portfolios after you get them.\nOperator: And next, we're going to the line of Jamie Feldman.\nJames Feldman: Great. I think you had mentioned in your earlier comments about sales into a JV, if I heard that right. Can you talk more about the plans there? And is this something that you would keep as kind of a perpetual structure and continue to sell, kind of grow it? Or is this more one-off?\nNicholas Anthony: Yes. I mean, we're looking at all the different levers as far as monetizing assets. One of the things that we've talked about is managing our - being prudent about managing our Amazon exposure going forward because we continue to do a significant amount of business with them. And I think their exposure at the end of this quarter is right around 9%. And we'd probably rather be in the 4% to 7% range going forward on that. So there are some assets that maybe we don't want to sell outright because of where they are or what type of asset they are. And we may take advantage of a JV structure in that case. And then that might be something that we can use to monetize future assets similar to that going forward.\nJames Feldman: Okay. Any thoughts on like structure in terms of your stake versus a partner's stake and potential magnitude?\nNicholas Anthony: No. I think we're evaluating all that stuff. Obviously, we need to do something - a decent amount of monetization to make sense to manage the Amazon exposure. But we don't have any hard numbers in mind.\nJames Feldman: Okay. Have you started talking to partners?\nNicholas Anthony: Yes. We have - we had discussions, but we've always had discussions with partners over the time. We talked to a lot of our existing partners about this whole concept on a regular basis.\nJames Feldman: Okay. Will you consider more of like a fund structure? Or this is...\nNicholas Anthony: No. I mean - no. I think historically, we've used more of the JV structure. Could it be a JV with multiple partners? Maybe. But not necessarily a fund structure.\nJames Feldman: Okay. And then just as - here we are at kind of a unique time in the economy where things are picking up. Any anecdotes about kind of new types of tenants leasing space? Anything that kind of stands out from the quarter that might be different than what you've talked about in the past?\nSteven Schnur: No, Jamie, this is Steve. I don't think so. I think 3PLs continue to be very, very active. And I think that's centered around e-commerce. It's also centered around the theme you've been hearing about for a while with inventory redundancy. So that's probably the most active. 3PLs have always been active, but I think right now is they've sort of taken over the lead by a wide margin over anyone else.\nOperator: And next, we go on to the line of Nick Yulico.\nNicholas Yulico: Just a question on kind of your pricing strategy right now. Because it looks like your tenant retention has picked up this year versus last year. It's obviously a good thing for occupancy, raise that guidance. But I guess I'm just wondering how you're kind of approaching pricing discussions with renewals, whether you're willing to deal with a little bit more frictional vacancy there to push pricing in your portfolio.\nSteven Schnur: Sure, Nick. This is Steve. Yes. We're - it's a case-by-case basis, but we are certainly pushing the envelope. I think this quarter, we did not have very much role on the coasts. So our results, which we were happy with on the rent growth side, I think there's some upward trajectory to what we'll do the rest of the year. We're continuing to push rents. We're having some difficult conversations. They aren't easy conversations, but we're willing to take some space back if we need to.\nNicholas Yulico: Okay. Just second question is on the development land, where I know you have - give a book basis, but 88% of that is your listing here as being in coastal Tier 1 markets. Maybe you could just give us some sort of perspective on how much - I know we keep hearing land prices are going up substantially. You have a very big Southern California land bank. Maybe just a little bit of perspective on where you think the land is really worth on a market basis for all of your land held for development.\nSteven Schnur: Yes. We just looked at that. It's in the low 40s mark-to-market. So we have quite a bit of upside in our landholdings.\nNicholas Yulico: You said, sorry, it's about 40% higher than the book value?\nSteven Schnur: The market value is, yes, over our book value. Correct.\nOperator: And next, we go on to the line of Caitlin Burrows.\nCaitlin Burrows: So you're obviously very active in development now. You started $800 million in 2020, and 2021 guidance is for over $1 billion at the midpoint. So I was just wondering, do you believe there is runway for the '21 volumes to continue and that's from both a demand perspective and also your ability to get land and complete projects in the target markets?\nJames Connor: Yes, Caitlin, I would tell you, as I kind of tried to reference in my closing remarks, if the economy continues to recover, as it certainly is indicating it has, and we're able to achieve the kind of GDP growth in the second half of the year that most of the leading banks are projecting, yes, we think next year is going to be a very, very good year. And we should have ample opportunity to do a comparable level of volume.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. Great. And then I think just following up on one of the recent questions on the key assumptions that you guys have at the end of the supplement. It does mention that you're willing to push rents at the expense of some occupancy, which I think makes sense given high occupancy. But we haven't yet seen that play out in the leasing spread. So obviously, they're high, but versus last quarter or even a year ago, not as high. So just wondering, do you think we should expect to see the leasing spreads rise in the near future? Or would that take a little bit longer to play out?\nMark Denien: Let me start that, Caitlin. This is Mark. One thing we've been talking a lot about where the leases we have that are rolling where they're located, over 40% of our NOI now are in the coastal markets. This quarter, it just so happened that only about 10% of our roll was in the coastal markets. So I think that we're still very happy with 12% plus or minus cash and almost 30 gap when 90% of that roll were in noncoastal markets. You won't see us get to the 40% roll that our portfolio looks like for a few years down the road. But I think you will see us pushing closer to 20% to 25% of our roll. For the next year, 1.5 years, we'll start to be more in those coastal markets. So that does give us the opportunity to get those rates up even higher than what they were this quarter. I don't know if Steve wants to add anything to that. But just a little point on where the - I think it's important to know where the roll was. And when 90% of our noncoastal markets we still achieve those numbers, we're pretty happy with that.\nOperator: And next, we're going to the line of Vince Tibone.\nVince Tibone: Could you discuss how your market rent growth expectations this year differ between coastal market, Tier 1, noncoastal markets and the remainder of your portfolio?\nJames Connor: Sure. Vince, I'll take a stab. I'll tell you, I think there's - clearly, the numbers that get published are on a macro basis. You really need to dig into the individual submarkets. I think some of the high-barrier infill coastal markets are pushing high single-digit rent growth, if not double digit. I think in the center part of the country, where you have less barriers to supply, you're probably in the lower single digits. That probably averages out to that 6% to 7% rent growth that we've been seeing from CBRE. So I don't know if that - hopefully, that answers your question. There is obviously discrepancy by availability of supply.\nVince Tibone: That's really helpful. And just any difference between some of the coastal markets like New Jersey versus SoCal, anyone standing out? Or are they kind of similar in this high single-digit range?\nJames Connor: I think the two markets you indicated are extremely active, very low vacancy rates, very little new supply being added that's not being absorbed quickly. And so those two markets are doing really well. I think Seattle continues to perform well. There was - I'd say Northern California had a bit of a slowdown. I think it was more affected, COVID-related, but seems to be coming back pretty strong with what we have there.\nVince Tibone: Got it. I think that's really helpful. If I could squeeze one more in. Can you just provide a little color on the pricing and marketing process on the Houston dispositions? Just curious, given some of the challenges in that market, how does that differ from some of the other dispositions you're marketing?\nNicholas Anthony: Vic, this is Nick. You said Houston dispositions?\nVince Tibone: Yes. Just curious if that - we've seen weaker demand there, weaker pricing compared to some of the other regions.\nNicholas Anthony: Fortunately for us, they were long-term leases with Amazon, so it was a great experience. The buyer pools were very deep, and the pricing was very good, like we're seeing across the country. So that was obviously the reason why those went well for us.\nVince Tibone: Got it. And is Houston a long-term hold for you? Or is that something you could potentially consider exiting as well similar to St. Louis?\nNicholas Anthony: No. I think we're cognizant of our exposure there, but we have no plans to exit Houston in the future. So we just keep an eye on it and manage it.\nOperator: And next, we go on to the line of Mike Mueller.\nMichael Mueller: Two quick ones here. First, what's the difference between the Amazon assets that you're looking to sell outright versus what you would consider to put in the JV? And then second, when you're thinking about your in-process development pipeline, is there a max level or some sort of cap that you want to stay under?\nNicholas Anthony: Mike, this is Nick. I'll take the first part, and I'm sure Steve will take the second part. In terms of what we're looking to sell outright versus joint venture, it's primarily location-driven for the most part. Generally, it's the growth profile of the asset. So if it's an asset that has a good embedded rent growth and a market that has good prospective rent growth going forward, we're probably more likely to put it in the JV versus sell it outright. So that's generally how we've looked at it. And then the second part of your question...\nSteven Schnur: Yes. The second part of your question on the development opportunities, obviously, developing at the margins we are, the more we can do, the better. I think we pay attention to what our exposure is relative to the overall size of our company, and we're at roughly 9% now. I think we'd start to get nervous if we were 12%, 13%, something like that.\nOperator: And next, we go on to the line of Dave Rodgers.\nDavid Rodgers: Steve, maybe a question on lease rate growth. You talked about it by geography, but maybe just some color on the size and what you're seeing in terms of the rate growth across core portfolio in the last quarter or so.\nSteven Schnur: Yes, Dave, this is Steve. You're a little broken up, but I think you asked about lease rates by size and maybe location. I would tell you, for us, again, the portfolio that we operate, our best-performing size segment this past quarter was 100 million to 250 million. I think historically, going back the last, call it, 6 or 8 quarters, it'd be - I would tell you, it's tended to be better on larger size. So I would expect that to be the case this year based on the demand we're seeing. It's hard with 1 quarter into the year to read much into that. But for us, the large-size segment continues to be the most active.\nDavid Rodgers: Great. And then I think coming into - and sorry, I do have a bad connection, but I think coming into the year, you guys have talked about losing some tenants early on that would roll out. Obviously, you had a little bit of that. But did that all hit in the first quarter? Do we expect to see any of that moving into the second quarter? Or were you guys just successful at kind of stepping in and backfilling a lot of those leases fairly quickly to start the year?\nMark Denien: Yes, Dave, this is Mark. Yes, at the end of last year on the January call, I guess, we talked about 4 or 5 tenants. And I guess, first off, I'd say these were not significant tenants, but there were 4 or 5, we were basically in the process of trying to get evicted and re-tenant that space. So the good news is all of that space has been backfilled. In fact, a couple of those tenants actually got current on their rent and went through some M&A transactions themselves. Got current, they're going to stay in the space after all. Another couple of them, the other half, I would say, we've now got out of the space. We've got leases signed to backfill it. There probably will be some downtime in rent here in the second quarter, but the leases are all signed, and we should be back up full running with better rents and better credit obviously come Q3.\nOperator: And next, we go on to the line of Rich Anderson.\nRichard Anderson: So I wanted to ask about the Amazon commentary, obviously, selling to get your percentage down. What is - what's scary about 12% Amazon? I mean, I could think of a lot worse tenants to be - have a 12% exposure, too. I mean, is that coming - kind of who's driving that decision? Is it just intuitive about your part or participants in Duke Realty outside of you that want to - whether the rating agencies, I don't know who it could be, are sort of driving a decision to lose some of that concentration? Or is it just a natural observation on your part?\nJames Connor: Well, Rich, it's Jim. I'll start out and give you my perspective. Nick can chime in. I sleep very well at night with the amount of Amazon exposure we have, given their credit profile and their growth. But part of it is input from the rating agencies and managing that. Part of it is, as Steve alluded to earlier, we have a very active development and leasing pipeline with Amazon. So left unfettered, that number is just going to continue to grow at a very, very rapid pace. And what Nick's guys are able to do, as he detailed to one of the earlier questions, is pull out the assets that have probably the lowest escalations, are in the markets where we have the least amount of upside, so to speak, and select those for outright sales and some for the joint venture. And some are in the infill markets that we work really, really hard to get a hold of. And those are incredibly valuable assets, and we want to hold those for the long term. So Nick, you can add [indiscernible].\nNicholas Anthony: Yes, I think that's right. And we're just - we're trying to be prudent in our diversification of our overall portfolio in terms of assets, geography and tenant exposure. So we're just trying to maintain a good balance.\nRichard Anderson: Yes, I understand. I'm just being [indiscernible].\nNicholas Anthony: Yes. We're not afraid of it.\nRichard Anderson: Yes. Okay. And then second question is perhaps a little somber one with the events in Indianapolis at the FedEx facility. I just wonder if there was any response from the community of industrial real estate owners about enhanced security or anything. I don't know what you could have really done, but I'm just curious if there was any necessary reaction on the part of not just you, but your peers.\nJames Connor: Yes, Rich, I'll make a couple of high-level comments. I will tell you that the amount of interaction that our local operating teams have had with our tenants, starting well over a year ago in helping them manage COVID protocols and enhancing the environment for the safety of their associates. Second, the work that we've done with our own people in the development of our buildings because the number of people that we have on site when we're building a building. So those increased protocols and safety in general. So I won't say that any of it is in reaction to horrible events like what we saw at the FedEx facility. But I will tell you, the amount of interaction on all of those subjects with our tenants is probably double today from what it was 18 months ago.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Next, we go on to the line of Brent Dilts.\nBrent Dilts: Great. In the prepared remarks, you made some comments on inventory to sales levels. So could you talk about how large a safety stock buffer might ultimately get built in? 5% to 10% is frequently thrown about. So I'm just curious what you guys think.\nSteven Schnur: Yes. I think - well, I would tell you, we read the same research reports that you guys do, and I think 5% to 10% seems to be what everyone talks about, which translates somewhere in the neighborhood of 0.5 billion square feet of demand. We see cases of it every day now, where we're talking to - whether it's retailers, e-commerce groups, a lot of the 3PL activity. Transportation costs are going to rise significantly with the new administration and a lot of things going on. And I think you're going to see more distribution to offset transportation costs, more distribution points around the country to offset transportation costs. We're seeing some of the production start to move back to North America and Central America, which I think will lead to more suppliers needing space here. So as Jim indicated, a lot of tailwinds in our back right now.\nJames Connor: Yes, Brent, I would just add just one other point. Even the impact of the incident at the Suez Canal, and while that doesn't necessarily impact logistics and shipping to the U.S., it just reinforces the need for these major companies to have additional safety stock because of the vulnerability we all have, given incidents that can happen anywhere in the globe. So this is not a passing trend. This is something that we're going to deal with, obviously, very positive for our sector, but for the next 2 to 3 years.\nBrent Dilts: Yes. Okay. And then just one other one on dispositions. I know you already talked about pricing, but could you talk about buyer types in the market? Are you seeing anything interesting as far as like a shift in domestic versus international or investment firms versus peers, things like that?\nNicholas Anthony: Yes. This is Nick. We have seen a change there. Obviously, a lot of the normal usual suspects we see in the bidder pools. But we've also seen a lot of new names pop up. Some of them are high net worth family offices. Some of them are sovereign-based, Spanish, Latin America, what have you. Some of them are rotating - or a lot of these are rotating out of other asset classes into our asset class. So there is an increased investor base that's looking for these assets in these bidder pools, for sure.\nOperator: And next, we go on to the line of Jason Idoine.\nJason Idoine: Just touching on one of the points that you just brought up. So you talked about some of the repatriation that could happen with manufacturing and production and people bringing some of that back to the United States, I guess. Is that activity picking up significantly? Or how has that been trending more recently?\nSteven Schnur: Yes. Jason, this is Steve. There's - I think we're starting to see some of that. Obviously, that takes a long time when you're talking about changing production from China to other locations. But you're starting to see some headlines. I know Walmart had a recent announcement about some of the production they're trying to bring back. And it may not be manufacture of goods, but the way goods are assembled, the way they're packaged, coming back, reshoring. So I know Northern Mexico, we don't operate there. But obviously, our Texas folks and California folks deal with goods coming in from there. That activity has been pretty significant. You talked to some of the folks in those markets, and that activity is starting to hit in Northern Mexico right now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And there are no more questions in queue.\nJames Connor: Thanks, Don. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to engaging with many of you throughout the rest of the year. Don, you may disconnect the line.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Conferencing Service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Connor",
            "content": "Thanks, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. I will open by saying as always, we hope you and your families are safe and healthy, and that you have the opportunity to be vaccinated. The fundamentals of our business continue to be as good as ever. We've now had 2 successive quarters of demand breaking all-time records. Our development platform had a record first quarter of starts, and our core portfolio continues to perform at the top of the class. Our liquidity position and sources of capital are very attractively priced to capture opportunities, including our execution of 2 green debt transactions. All of these drivers result in us raising key components of our 2021 guidance that roll up to double-digit growth in expected core FFO and AFFO with the midpoints. Now let me turn it over to Steve to cover our operations. Thank you, Mark. In closing, a strong economic recovery is unfolding, and numerous secular drivers are continuing to create unparalleled opportunities for our platform to capture growth from rising rental rates, high-margin development opportunities and from raising capital at a very low cost. We're very pleased with our team's execution in the first quarter and now with our expected double-digit growth in core FFO and AFFO. As long as these multiple tailwinds can sustain and as long as the economy continues to recover, we're optimistic we can achieve similar levels of growth for the foreseeable future, that are hopeful it should lead to corresponding increases in our annual quarterly dividend. Thank you for your interest and your support, and we will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Don, you can open up the lines, and we'll now take questions. Yes. Thanks, Blaine. I'll start and then Steve can give you a little color. We've been dealing with land prices escalating for a number of years now. So that's not anything out of the ordinary. Steel is the latest one, and a lot of people are talking about that. One of the advantages of being a national developer is, a, the number of relationships that we have, the leverage that we have and our team's ability to go out and accelerate some of the design and procurement. So sitting here today, we can comfortably tell you that we have the steel we need to finish everything that's in the development pipeline for the balance of the year. And I think Steve can give a little more color on what some of the local teams are doing. Sure. John Kim, I'll tell you, I think we're - there's competition everywhere. I do think the private players, particularly the larger private players, have been active on the merchant development front. Our focus and where we've got our landholdings in the high-barrier markets, I think we indicated in our release that 88% of our land is now in the coastal Tier 1 markets. The competition there, the vacancy rates there many times are less than 2%. So I think we're comfortable with that. I would tell you, in terms of markets we're concerned about our monitoring supply, there's always going to be a handful of submarkets scattered around. But Houston is the one that we - we have no intentions of starting any projects in Houston, but that market needs to shore itself up a bit. Yes, Caitlin, I would tell you, as I kind of tried to reference in my closing remarks, if the economy continues to recover, as it certainly is indicating it has, and we're able to achieve the kind of GDP growth in the second half of the year that most of the leading banks are projecting, yes, we think next year is going to be a very, very good year. And we should have ample opportunity to do a comparable level of volume. Sure. Vince, I'll take a stab. I'll tell you, I think there's - clearly, the numbers that get published are on a macro basis. You really need to dig into the individual submarkets. I think some of the high-barrier infill coastal markets are pushing high single-digit rent growth, if not double digit. I think in the center part of the country, where you have less barriers to supply, you're probably in the lower single digits. That probably averages out to that 6% to 7% rent growth that we've been seeing from CBRE. So I don't know if that - hopefully, that answers your question. There is obviously discrepancy by availability of supply. I think the two markets you indicated are extremely active, very low vacancy rates, very little new supply being added that's not being absorbed quickly. And so those two markets are doing really well. I think Seattle continues to perform well. There was - I'd say Northern California had a bit of a slowdown. I think it was more affected, COVID-related, but seems to be coming back pretty strong with what we have there. Well, Rich, it's Jim. I'll start out and give you my perspective. Nick can chime in. I sleep very well at night with the amount of Amazon exposure we have, given their credit profile and their growth. But part of it is input from the rating agencies and managing that. Part of it is, as Steve alluded to earlier, we have a very active development and leasing pipeline with Amazon. So left unfettered, that number is just going to continue to grow at a very, very rapid pace. And what Nick's guys are able to do, as he detailed to one of the earlier questions, is pull out the assets that have probably the lowest escalations, are in the markets where we have the least amount of upside, so to speak, and select those for outright sales and some for the joint venture. And some are in the infill markets that we work really, really hard to get a hold of. And those are incredibly valuable assets, and we want to hold those for the long term. So Nick, you can add [indiscernible]. Yes, Rich, I'll make a couple of high-level comments. I will tell you that the amount of interaction that our local operating teams have had with our tenants, starting well over a year ago in helping them manage COVID protocols and enhancing the environment for the safety of their associates. Second, the work that we've done with our own people in the development of our buildings because the number of people that we have on site when we're building a building. So those increased protocols and safety in general. So I won't say that any of it is in reaction to horrible events like what we saw at the FedEx facility. But I will tell you, the amount of interaction on all of those subjects with our tenants is probably double today from what it was 18 months ago. Yes, Brent, I would just add just one other point. Even the impact of the incident at the Suez Canal, and while that doesn't necessarily impact logistics and shipping to the U.S., it just reinforces the need for these major companies to have additional safety stock because of the vulnerability we all have, given incidents that can happen anywhere in the globe. So this is not a passing trend. This is something that we're going to deal with, obviously, very positive for our sector, but for the next 2 to 3 years. Thanks, Don. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to engaging with many of you throughout the rest of the year. Don, you may disconnect the line."

            "content": "Thanks, Nick. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.39 per share, which represents 18% growth over the first quarter of 2020. We've been saying for the last few quarters that we expected our core FFO growth rates to accelerate and begin to approach our already strong AFFO growth rates. The results from the current quarter and our revised guidance certainly reflect this. AFFO totaled $140 million for the quarter. Our best-in-class low level of capital expenditures, along with the strong NOI growth, continues to generate significant AFFO growth to reinvest into our business. Our best-in-sector rent collections continued in the first quarter of 2021 with more than 99.9% of rents collected. We have also collected more than 99.9% of April rents. And we now only have $52,000 under deferral arrangements remaining to be collected and had effectively no bad debt expense in the first quarter. Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 was 6.3%. The growth in same-property NOI was due to increased occupancy and rent growth as well as the burn-off of free rent compared to the first quarter of 2020. We do expect this growth to moderate for the remainder of the year based on tougher occupancy comps and less free rent burn-off, but to remain strong nonetheless. We finished the quarter with no outstanding borrowings on our own secured line of credit, which we renewed in March and extended through March of 2026, including our extension options. We reduced our borrowing rate by 10 basis points compared to the previous facility. As part of our commitment to corporate responsibility, the credit facility also includes an incremental reduction in borrowing costs as certain sustainability-linked metrics are achieved each year. Our future debt maturities are well sequenced with less than 3% of our total outstanding debt being scheduled to mature prior to the end of 2023. As a result of our strong start to 2021, we announced revised core FFO guidance for 2021 to a range of $1.65 to $1.71 per share compared to the previous range of $1.62 to $1.68 per share. The $1.68 per share midpoint of our revised core FFO guidance represents an over 10% increase over 2020 results. We also announced revised guidance for growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis to range between 8.0% and 12.3%, with a midpoint of 10.1% compared to the previous range of 5.8% to 10.1%. This increased earnings growth expectation is impressive when considering we are increasing current-year disposition expectations by $400 million to fund development projects that will not contribute to earnings until 2022 and beyond. For same-property NOI growth on a cash basis, we've increased our guidance to a range of 4.1% to 4.9% from the previous range of 3.6% to 4.4%. We continue to outperform our underwriting assumptions for speculative developments, both in the timing of lease-up and in rental rates achieved, and continue to maintain a solid list of build-to-suit projects. Based on this, our revised guidance for development starts is between $950 million and $1.1 billion compared to the previous range of $700 million to $900 million. This increase in development starts will provide a key source of growth in 2022 and beyond. As Nick mentioned, we intend to take advantage of the investment sales market pricing to prefund a significant portion of our development pipeline with an increase in dispositions. Our guidance for dispositions has been revised to between $900 million and $1.1 billion compared to the initial range of $500 million to $700 million. We've updated a couple of other components of our guidance based on our more optimistic outlook as detailed in our range of estimates exhibit, including our supplemental information on our website. I'll now turn it back to Jim for a few closing remarks. Well, I guess we're using a little bit of everything, Manny. I mean, we did issue a little bit on our ATM in the first quarter. I guess what I would say, and Nick can follow up on this, the St. Louis exit has sort of been on a list for a while. It's really more of an acceleration, something we were probably going to do down the road anyway. And as our development pipeline opportunities ramped up, we just kind of pulled forward some things that we're going to do anyway. But we'll continue to use a little bit of everything as long as our capital is attractively priced. Let me start that, Caitlin. This is Mark. One thing we've been talking a lot about where the leases we have that are rolling where they're located, over 40% of our NOI now are in the coastal markets. This quarter, it just so happened that only about 10% of our roll was in the coastal markets. So I think that we're still very happy with 12% plus or minus cash and almost 30 gap when 90% of that roll were in noncoastal markets. You won't see us get to the 40% roll that our portfolio looks like for a few years down the road. But I think you will see us pushing closer to 20% to 25% of our roll. For the next year, 1.5 years, we'll start to be more in those coastal markets. So that does give us the opportunity to get those rates up even higher than what they were this quarter. I don't know if Steve wants to add anything to that. But just a little point on where the - I think it's important to know where the roll was. And when 90% of our noncoastal markets we still achieve those numbers, we're pretty happy with that. Yes, Dave, this is Mark. Yes, at the end of last year on the January call, I guess, we talked about 4 or 5 tenants. And I guess, first off, I'd say these were not significant tenants, but there were 4 or 5, we were basically in the process of trying to get evicted and re-tenant that space. So the good news is all of that space has been backfilled. In fact, a couple of those tenants actually got current on their rent and went through some M&A transactions themselves. Got current, they're going to stay in the space after all. Another couple of them, the other half, I would say, we've now got out of the space. We've got leases signed to backfill it. There probably will be some downtime in rent here in the second quarter, but the leases are all signed, and we should be back up full running with better rents and better credit obviously come Q3."

            "name": "Steven Schnur",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. I'll first cover overall market fundamentals, then review our operational results. Industrial net absorption in the first quarter according to CBRE registered an impressive 100 million square feet, marking the first time that demand has exceeded 100 million square feet in consecutive quarters. This was more than enough to offset new supply as completions dipped to 57 million square feet from about 70 million square feet in the fourth quarter of 2020. This positive net absorption over deliveries for the quarter reduced vacancy down to 4.4%, which is back down near the record levels we saw throughout most of 2019. The strong mix and fundamentals increased asking rents by over 7% compared to the previous year. CBRE now projects demand for the full year to surpass 300 million square feet, perhaps even breaking the 2016 record of 327 million square feet. They project deliveries to be about 300 million square feet as well. The overall sector continues to remain very much in balance, which will produce another year of growth in asking rents of high single digits nationally. On the macroeconomic front, the increasing pace of vaccinations, the stimulus being pumped into the U.S. economy and the arrival of spring weather has generated some significant recent data points indicative of a very strong year in our business. The recent March consumer confidence rating is back near the range of 2018 and 2019, and the GDP growth is projected to be in the 6% to 7% range. This bodes very well for demand in logistics real estate. And in addition, we have the secular drivers in our business that remain firmly intact and stronger than prepandemic. To that point, the growth in retail sales and e-commerce sales across the 2-month February and March period were up 12% and 28%, respectively. And perhaps more notably, when measured against the 2019 pre - nonpandemic time frame, the recent February and March figures were up 15% and 43%, respectively. In addition, the experience of the supply chain bottlenecks and response for greater business inventory redundancy is expected to push the retail inventory to sales ratio to above historic levels, yet it now sits near record low levels. Demand by occupier type remains broad-based and very active, with pure e-commerce, omnichannel retailers, 3PLs, health care supply firms and food and beverage companies leading the way. Now I'll turn to our own portfolio. We executed a very solid first quarter by signing 7.4 million square feet of new leases. On first-generation leasing, we signed 3 transactions to stabilize assets that were previously in the unstabilized in-service and spec development pools, including 146,000-square-foot lease on a spec development in Southern California, Mid-Counties submarket for 100% of the space. The lease activity for the quarter, combined with strong fundamentals I mentioned, led to continued growth in rents in our portfolio as we reported 11.4% cash, 26.2% on a GAAP basis. The mark-to-market on our portfolio leases is at 17% below market rental rates, which is supportive of continued strong rent growth. We also had an exceptional quarter of development starts. As initially reflected in our press release last month, on top of the $373 million of starts we reported in the press release, at quarter end, we signed another $39 million project in the Tampa's market, which is build-to-suit for an e-commerce retailer. In total, we started 11 projects during the quarter, totaling 3.8 million square feet and $412 million in cost. These projects were 60% preleased with value creation estimated near 40%. We're very - we're also very proud that 3 of the 4 build-to-suits we signed during the quarter was repeat customers. Our development pipeline at quarter end totaled $1.4 billion with 68% allocated to our coastal Tier 1 markets. The pipeline - this pipeline was 65% preleased as of March 31. Looking forward and consistent with the strong fundamentals I discussed and our best-in-class local operating teams, our outlook for new development starts is as strong as it's ever been, as reflected by our revised guidance of over 30% from our original midpoint. I'll also note, we do expect our pipeline preleasing percentage to potentially drop a bit in future quarters as we put fully leased assets in service and start more speculative development projects in high-barrier Tier 1 submarkets where fundamentals are very strong. I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover acquisitions and disposition. Sure, Blaine. I would just tell you, steel is gaining a lot of headlines, lumber is another one. Land has - obviously, as Jim indicated, has been up significantly for a number of years. Rents are certainly keeping pace. Cap rates are helping. I think the bigger concern, I guess, or cautious thing that we pay attention to is the time frames. Steel is pushed from 10 to 12 weeks to probably 24 to 26 weeks. So more upfront cooperation with architects and tenants to get projects started to make sure you can deliver on time. No, Jamie, this is Steve. I don't think so. I think 3PLs continue to be very, very active. And I think that's centered around e-commerce. It's also centered around the theme you've been hearing about for a while with inventory redundancy. So that's probably the most active. 3PLs have always been active, but I think right now is they've sort of taken over the lead by a wide margin over anyone else. Sure, Nick. This is Steve. Yes. We're - it's a case-by-case basis, but we are certainly pushing the envelope. I think this quarter, we did not have very much role on the coasts. So our results, which we were happy with on the rent growth side, I think there's some upward trajectory to what we'll do the rest of the year. We're continuing to push rents. We're having some difficult conversations. They aren't easy conversations, but we're willing to take some space back if we need to. Yes. We just looked at that. It's in the low 40s mark-to-market. So we have quite a bit of upside in our landholdings. The market value is, yes, over our book value. Correct. Yes. The second part of your question on the development opportunities, obviously, developing at the margins we are, the more we can do, the better. I think we pay attention to what our exposure is relative to the overall size of our company, and we're at roughly 9% now. I think we'd start to get nervous if we were 12%, 13%, something like that. Yes, Dave, this is Steve. You're a little broken up, but I think you asked about lease rates by size and maybe location. I would tell you, for us, again, the portfolio that we operate, our best-performing size segment this past quarter was 100 million to 250 million. I think historically, going back the last, call it, 6 or 8 quarters, it'd be - I would tell you, it's tended to be better on larger size. So I would expect that to be the case this year based on the demand we're seeing. It's hard with 1 quarter into the year to read much into that. But for us, the large-size segment continues to be the most active. Yes. I think - well, I would tell you, we read the same research reports that you guys do, and I think 5% to 10% seems to be what everyone talks about, which translates somewhere in the neighborhood of 0.5 billion square feet of demand. We see cases of it every day now, where we're talking to - whether it's retailers, e-commerce groups, a lot of the 3PL activity. Transportation costs are going to rise significantly with the new administration and a lot of things going on. And I think you're going to see more distribution to offset transportation costs, more distribution points around the country to offset transportation costs. We're seeing some of the production start to move back to North America and Central America, which I think will lead to more suppliers needing space here. So as Jim indicated, a lot of tailwinds in our back right now. Yes. Jason, this is Steve. There's - I think we're starting to see some of that. Obviously, that takes a long time when you're talking about changing production from China to other locations. But you're starting to see some headlines. I know Walmart had a recent announcement about some of the production they're trying to bring back. And it may not be manufacture of goods, but the way goods are assembled, the way they're packaged, coming back, reshoring. So I know Northern Mexico, we don't operate there. But obviously, our Texas folks and California folks deal with goods coming in from there. That activity has been pretty significant. You talked to some of the folks in those markets, and that activity is starting to hit in Northern Mexico right now."

            "name": "Nicholas Anthony",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. For the quarter, we sold $94 million of assets comprised of 2 facilities in Houston as well as 2 facilities in Indianapolis owned in a 50-50 joint venture. In turn, we used part of these proceeds to acquire 3 buildings totaling 680,000 square feet for $51 million, including 1 asset in Southern California's IE West submarket and 1 in Northern New Jersey's Meadowlands submarket. The third facility acquired was in the Indianapolis Airport submarket and was part of a joint venture liquidation and asset swap. These buildings were all 100% leased within markets where we expect strong market rent growth that will contribute to long-term IRRs well in excess of the assets we sold. From a strategic positioning standpoint, the net effect of our development, disposition and acquisition activity this quarter moves our coastal Tier 1 exposure to over 42% of GAV. We've begun marketing a few Midwestern assets leased to Amazon for outright sale, while certain assets leased to Amazon in other noncoastal Tier 1 markets may either be sold outright or contributed to a joint venture. In addition, the more recent news on disposition in last night's press release, that we are now marketing for sale our entire 5.2 million-square-foot St. Louis portfolio. The rationale on the sale is threefold. One, we are taking advantage of increased investor demand for logistics assets; two, the portfolio accelerates our strategic objective to increase our exposure to coastal Tier 1 markets; and three, it will provide a source of funds for our increasing development pipeline. As a result, we have raised the midpoint of our full year expected dispositions by $400 million. Altogether, we expect our planned 2021 disposition activity to be weighted toward the middle of the year. I will now turn our call over to Mark to discuss our financial results and guidance update. Yes, Blaine. So most of the other assets are sort of one-offs, a couple of Class B, but mostly long-term credit deals, a lot of them leased to Amazon. So that makes up the rest of it. There's really no portfolios in that guidance number outside of the St. Louis portfolio. As far as pricing goes, we continue to see cap rate compression. It's - the secondary markets have compressed more recently than the coastal markets. But especially some of these Amazon assets, we've been very pleased with the pricing that we're seeing on those transactions as well. So I'd say, over the last 90 days, there's probably been another 25 bps on compression. This is Nick. The question was, why not JV the St. Louis assets? Generally, we have kept them work. We tried to keep our model more simplistic. And we don't think, strategically, a joint venture there would make as much sense and maybe in some other instances where you could grow it. I just don't know how you - what you would do with it going forward. Yes. What I would add is this was an opportunity to basically improve our geography going forward and also improve our growth profile going forward just to make - to help improve performance in the future. Well, they're certainly - it's sort of a mixed bag. It's not as black and white as you might think. Obviously, the long-term credit deals are garnering very low cap rates. A lot of them are brand-new, new development. A lot of the portfolio deals that you see out there are a blend of Class A and Class B assets, and a lot of it depends on where the rents are in relation to market. So they generally trade at higher cap rates. And the buyer pool is not necessarily as deep on those because they're a little harder to underwrite and get your hands around. But it is sort of comparing apples and oranges there on those 2 different types. We - yes. Typically, on the acquisition side, we focused on 1 to 3 assets at a time because we want to focus on buying what we want, where we want it. So it complements our strategy. Typically, when we've done larger portfolios, we got lucky with the Bridge transaction several years ago because it's all where we wanted it. But typically, what happens on some of these portfolios is you get a lot of assets and locations that you wouldn't normally want to be in, and it creates a lot of friction and noise trying to reposition those portfolios after you get them. Yes. I mean, we're looking at all the different levers as far as monetizing assets. One of the things that we've talked about is managing our - being prudent about managing our Amazon exposure going forward because we continue to do a significant amount of business with them. And I think their exposure at the end of this quarter is right around 9%. And we'd probably rather be in the 4% to 7% range going forward on that. So there are some assets that maybe we don't want to sell outright because of where they are or what type of asset they are. And we may take advantage of a JV structure in that case. And then that might be something that we can use to monetize future assets similar to that going forward. No. I think we're evaluating all that stuff. Obviously, we need to do something - a decent amount of monetization to make sense to manage the Amazon exposure. But we don't have any hard numbers in mind. Yes. We have - we had discussions, but we've always had discussions with partners over the time. We talked to a lot of our existing partners about this whole concept on a regular basis. No. I mean - no. I think historically, we've used more of the JV structure. Could it be a JV with multiple partners? Maybe. But not necessarily a fund structure. Vic, this is Nick. You said Houston dispositions? Fortunately for us, they were long-term leases with Amazon, so it was a great experience. The buyer pools were very deep, and the pricing was very good, like we're seeing across the country. So that was obviously the reason why those went well for us. No. I think we're cognizant of our exposure there, but we have no plans to exit Houston in the future. So we just keep an eye on it and manage it. Mike, this is Nick. I'll take the first part, and I'm sure Steve will take the second part. In terms of what we're looking to sell outright versus joint venture, it's primarily location-driven for the most part. Generally, it's the growth profile of the asset. So if it's an asset that has a good embedded rent growth and a market that has good prospective rent growth going forward, we're probably more likely to put it in the JV versus sell it outright. So that's generally how we've looked at it. And then the second part of your question... Yes, I think that's right. And we're just - we're trying to be prudent in our diversification of our overall portfolio in terms of assets, geography and tenant exposure. So we're just trying to maintain a good balance. Yes. We're not afraid of it. Yes. This is Nick. We have seen a change there. Obviously, a lot of the normal usual suspects we see in the bidder pools. But we've also seen a lot of new names pop up. Some of them are high net worth family offices. Some of them are sovereign-based, Spanish, Latin America, what have you. Some of them are rotating - or a lot of these are rotating out of other asset classes into our asset class. So there is an increased investor base that's looking for these assets in these bidder pools, for sure."

I\u2019d like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I will hand the call over to Tim.\nTim Arndt: Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Let me begin by thanking our global team for delivering an excellent quarter and year. We have had outstanding results despite challenging headwinds from the capital markets and the overall economic backdrop. In the face of this, our focus has been to serve our customers and investors putting our heads down and executing on our long-term plan. As you see in our results, our portfolio is in excellent shape, driven by still strong demand and a continued lack of availability. This foundation for our business not only drove our nearly 13% increase in year-over-year core earnings, but it also sets up the company for sustainable growth for years to come. Turning to results. Core FFO excluding promotes was $4.61 per share and including promotes was $5.16 per share, ahead of our forecast. In the fourth quarter, our operating results again generated several new records. Occupancy increased to 98.2%, with retention of 82%. The Prologis portfolio excluding Duke added 30-basis-point of the 40-basis-point increase over the quarter. While we tend to quote occupancy, it is notable that the portfolio is 98.6% leased, a record that underscores the tightness across our markets. Rent change for the quarter was 51% on a net effective basis. The step down from our third quarter rent change of 60% is a reflection of mix and not market rents. In fact, market rent growth exceeded expectations during the quarter, increasing our lease mark-to-market to a record 67%. These results drove same-store growth to 7.7% on a net effective basis and 9.1% on cash. The Duke portfolio having closed on October 3rd, is fully integrated in these results, with the exception of same-store growth, which will not be reflected until the first quarter of 2024. On the balance sheet, while access to the debt markets have remained challenging for many issuers, we successfully executed a number of transactions during the quarter, raising over $1.1 billion at an interest rate below 3%, including $700 million of new unsecured borrowings out of Japan and Canada. Our credit metrics continue to be excellent and we have maintained over $4 billion of liquidity at year-end with borrowing capacity across Prologis and the open-ended funds of $20 billion, expanded significantly due to our balance sheet growth from the Duke acquisition. With regard to our markets and leasing activity, the bottomline is that conditions remain healthy and there is little we see across our results or proprietary metrics that point to a meaningful slowdown. We see a normalization of demand and when combined with low vacancy, it continues to translate to a meaningful increase in rents. Across our markets, rent growth was nearly 5% during the quarter, driving the full year to 28%. Proposal activity for available space was consistent with our recent history, and given persistent low vacancy, there is simply a very small number of units to even propose deals on. As evidenced, over 99% of our portfolio is either currently leased or in negotiation. Utilization remains high at 86%, near its all time record and deal gestation ticked up over the quarter, indicative of more careful consideration and time being taken in leasing decisions. While we are watching e-commerce carefully, its share of overall retail sales have increased to 22%, which is 600 basis points above its pre-pandemic level. Putting the nuance of mix, timing and other factors aside, as measured by retention, occupancy or rent change, it is clear that customers need to commit to space to market conditions, which offer them very little choice. In terms of supply, the development pipeline across our market stands at 565 million square feet and our expectation for the year is that the pipeline will decline. Deliveries will put modest upward pressure on vacancies from 3.3% today towards 4% later in the year. However, new development starts are slowing in response to the market environment, which will reduce vacancies in late 2023 or 2024. In Europe, we expect deliveries to outpace absorption by approximately 30 million square feet, expanding the current 2.6% vacancy rate to approximately 3.5%. Finally, and as expected, our true months of supply metric grew to 25 months in the U.S. from 22 months last quarter. As a reminder, this metric has averaged roughly 36 months over the last 10 years. In capital markets, transactions continue to be slow in the fourth quarter, making price discovery challenging. That said, return requirements are trending to the low-to-mid 7% range. This expansion further affected appraised values in our funds, although continued rent growth has mitigated some of the effect. Our U.S. values, which were appraised by third parties every quarter, declined 6% this quarter and 7% over the entire second half. In Europe, values declined approximately 12% during the quarter and 16% over the half. Our open-end funds have received only modest redemption requests, less than 3% of net asset value during the quarter, totaling 5% across the second half. Our flagship funds have strong balance sheets with low leverage, largely undrawn credit facilities, cash on hand and undrawn equity commitments. While we believe the value declines over the second half reflect market, investors are still adjusting to a new environment. Because we strive to be consistent in our actions and fair to all investors, we will redeem units call equity and resume asset contributions when price discovery has run its course. We expect that to be one quarter to two quarters away likely sooner in Europe. This will ensure certainty, fairness and consistency to all of our investors. Turning to our outlook for 2023, while our macro forecast assumes a moderate recession, which may put headwinds on demand, our business is driven by secular forces and long-term planning by our customers that should limit the impact unless such a downturn becomes significant and protracted. As mentioned earlier, we believe vacancy will build in the market and our portfolio, both of which are unsustainably low. Putting this sentiment together with our outlook on supply and demand, our 2023 rent forecast calls for approximately 10% growth in the U.S. and 9% globally. We acknowledge that our rent forecasts have proven conservative in recent years, but we are comfortable with this starting point given the environment. Specific to our portfolio and on an our share basis, we expect average occupancy to range between 96.5% and 97.5%, roughly 50 basis points lower than the 2022 midpoint. Combined with rent change, we forecast to generate net effective same-store growth of approximately 8% to 9% with casting store growth between 8.5% and 9.5%. Given these assumptions, we believe our lease mark-to-market will be sustained or even increased over 2023, ending the year between 65% and 70%, and providing visibility to an incremental $2.9 billion of NOI after the more than $300 million that will become realized over the course of this year. We expect G&A to range between $370 million and $385 million, reflecting not only inflation in wages and other corporate costs, but also additional investments we are making in our Essentials business particularly in the energy teams.  In that regard, we expect the contribution to FFO from Essentials to range between $0.07 and $0.09 this year. This reflects 70% growth in revenues and tax credits from 2022, but offset in the near-term by our higher Duke related share count and the G&A investments just mentioned. In terms of operational metrics for the business, we expect to add 115 megawatts of solar power over the year driving the portfolio to approximately 540 megawatts by year end. It\u2019s worth noting that we closed 2022 as the second largest on-site power producer in the U.S., a position we will build upon with our plan for 1 gigawatt of production and storage by 2025. We also forecast to have over 20 EV charging clusters installed and operational by year-end. In deployment, we will continue to be disciplined in our approach to new starts. We have over $39 billion of opportunities to select from in our land bank and between our expectations for build-to-suits and logical markets prospect, we see an active year of starts initially to range between $2.5 billion and $3 billion with a real opportunity to grow as conditions warrant. As mentioned earlier, we plan for redemptions to be cleared out over the year and private fundraising to resume. Accordingly, we forecast contribution activity to occur primarily in the second half and resulting in combined contribution and disposition guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion. Finally, in strategic capital, we forecast revenues excluding promotes to range between $500 million and $525 million, which is impacted by valuation write-downs across 2022 and the first half of 2023. We are forecasting net promote income of $0.40 based on an assumption that U -- that values in USLF, primary source of 2023 promotes will decline further from values at year end, every 1% change in asset value equates to slightly less than $0.02 of net promote income. Putting this all together, we expect core FFO excluding promotes to range between $5 per share and $5.10 per share. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents approximately 9.5% growth over 2022. We are guiding core FFO including promotes to range between $5.40 per share and $5.50 per share. In closing, this guidance builds upon an exceptional three-year period of sector-leading earnings growth. At our 2019 Investor Day, we presented a three-year plan, targeting 8.5% annual growth, we achieved nearly 14% over this period, 550 basis points of annual outperformance. We expect 2023 to be a year where headlines continue to be disconnected from our business and ability to deliver strong growth and valuation. While there are many unknowns generally, there are more knowns in our business that are clear, such as our lease mark-to-market, significant and visible opportunity in our land bank, a need for excitement for -- a need and excitement for a new generation of sustainable energy solutions, and a dedicated team that is the best in the business and laser focused on delivering leading results. We will now turn the call over to the Operator to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please state your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks. I guess good morning out there. Tim, I just wanted to clarify in your kind of going through your guidance, you throw out a lot of numbers. I just want to make sure on the mark-to-market numbers that are embedded in your same-store NOI growth of 8% to 9% GAAP and 8.5% to 9.5% cash. Just what are you expecting for cash and GAAP leasing spreads and I just want to make sure that\u2019s different than the kind of overall portfolio mark-to-market you talked about 65% to 70%?\nTim Arndt: Yeah. They are going to be stronger. As you think about the lease mark-to-market, it\u2019s all of the leases, so it represents old leases and leases just done. So, clearly, everything that will roll next year is going to be above the 67% reporting today. It\u2019s a little bit flatter than you might expect as we have looked at it. I think leasing spreads next year are going to be in the high 70s to low 80s on a net effective basis and then as we know that the cash basis of that has trended towards about 1,500 basis points or so inside of that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please state your question.\nCraig Mailman: Hey. Good morning, everyone. I just want to hit on the capital deployment side of things, maybe a two-parter here. Just first on the stabilization, so just the kind of the -- what you guys have stabilizing the $2.8 billion at your share, can you just bridge that gap versus the $5.5 billion that you have on page 20 of expected deliveries or completions in 2023? And maybe just give us some sense of timing on that, I know I think about 30% of those are build-to-suits. So also how you are thinking about where the preleasing is on the balance of that as well and kind of how that layers into your occupancy assumption?\nTim Arndt: Yeah. I will take -- Craig, it\u2019s Tim. I will take the first half and Dan can help with the second. This is really a date issue, I would say, not even an issue, but just a function of the date. We have a large amount of that group of stabilization we believe will occur in the first quarter of 2024 and I think there is a very real possibility that if we improve some of the leasing timing by just a month or two, we could see a decent amount of that actually fall back into 2023. So it\u2019s just a function of crossing over a calendar year to lay up the mix of all of our projects is landing.\nDan Letter: And this is Dan. I will just pile on there. The pre-leasing in that portfolio, as you see, there\u2019s 29% of that that\u2019s in there as a build-to-suit. The pre-leasing is better than that 29%, and I would say, on track with historical averages even on a bigger data set here. So we feel really good about delivering our stabilization at this year and next.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please state your question.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks and good morning. I was curious about the investment capacity that you show in your supplemental of $1.5 billion is down from $4.2 billion. I just want to understand what that actually represents? And tying that to your comments about contributions perhaps picking back up if conditions settle out, how does that comment compared to the $1.5 billion capacity and how much river room [ph] do you ultimately have an increase on that capacity? Thank you.\nTim Arndt: Hey, Ki Bin. So what I would do with regard to investment capacity is relying more on the way I am describing it in our prepared remarks, the $20 billion and $4 billion or $5 billion across the funds. The number that\u2019s presented in the sup, which is what I think you are referring to is a bit technical about the current amount of equity that can be drawn in the funds and then that number is levered slightly, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s a bit understated. The number we supplemented with in prepared remarks is looking at the overall leverage of the fund and how much more capacity sits beyond just that of committed equity post-leverage. So, for example, our USLF venture is very low leverage, just about 10% and that creates an incredible amount of debt capacity, as you can imagine. And I think that winds up addressing your second question, which is the liquidity and the funds for contributions, there\u2019s a lot there for us to have over time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.\nDerek Johnston: Hi, everyone. How are you doing? Can you give us an update on the markets in Europe, the mark-to-market there, any leasing trends? I think you touched briefly on the private market transaction backdrop. We definitely see the U.S. mark-to-market getting wider. I guess how do you view demand in Europe and the differences between the U.S. and Europe unfolding in 2023? Thank you.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. Let me start with some general comments. Europe is generally a mild and more muted version of the U.S. both on the way up and on the way down and the market is -- has a lower vacancy rate than the UAE -- than the U.S., if you can believe it. So that\u2019s a general backdrop. That\u2019s very consistent with the way Europe has behaved in the last 10 years or 15years. As to the specifics on mark-to-market and alike, Dan, do you want to cover that?\nDan Letter: Yeah. Sure. Mark-to-market -- lease mark-to-market in Europe is about 28%, and I would say, just overall, we feel very good about the leasing demand in Europe right now. We talked about at the -- in the remarks about an expansion in the vacancy, but overall, we feel really good about where it\u2019s headed.\nHamid Moghadam: And the -- you might ask what about the U.K., because that\u2019s the one you hear about all the time, and actually that\u2019s really strong, too, so far. So we have actually been surprised on the positive side with the U.K. The other place that is really held up well is actually Germany, which you would have guessed with energy issues would be softer, it hasn\u2019t been and there\u2019s virtually no vacancy in Germany. And some of the manufacturing coming back, particularly autos, et cetera, are really strengthening Central and Eastern Europe the markets, particularly in Poland, where there\u2019s this perennial vacancy. It\u2019s sort of tightening up.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please state your question.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. I want to dig in a little bit to the sectors that you are seeing driving leasing demand, let\u2019s say, in the fourth quarter and so far this year, whether you have seen any changes in types of customers taking space versus a year ago? And then, I guess, when we think about the broader retailer bucket, where you did see some retailers reporting year-over-year sales declines in the back half of last year, wondering if any pieces of that category are you seeing less demand?\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. The only category that is significantly below the trend and is likely to be that way is housing, because the starts are slowing. But with respect to other detail, Chris, do you want to take that?\nChris Caton: Yeah. It\u2019s absolutely right. Generally, Nick, it was diverse. So whether we look at consumer products, whether we look at apparel, food and beverage customers, we have a diverse range of customers leasing space from us beyond the housing categories, which would include construction, it could include home goods and alike.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. And retail sales on a real basis, notwithstanding the weaker for instance December and November are good. I think it\u2019s between 2.5% and 3% up compared to the year before. So, yeah, you do hear the headlines of the weaker with retailers, but I think if you look at it overall, it\u2019s actually pretty positive. It\u2019s more positive than the headlines. I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s super positive, but it\u2019s much better than the headlines.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please state your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You clearly laid out the building blocks of your same-store NOI growth of 8.5% to 9.5% in 2023, where you have a high level of visibility, obviously, a lot of macro uncertainty out there. Can you provide the specific assumptions you have used for your initial 2023 outlook and then just where and how a change in the macro environment could provide upside or downside to your initial guidance? Thanks.\nHamid Moghadam: Macro environment other than, call it, defaults or something that has an immediate effect are not going to drive the numbers big time in 2023, because a lot of the leasing that needs to take place in 2023 is already in progress or been dealt with. We are dealing with very high occupancy levels. To start with, there is not a whole lot of space to lease and the real driver of those same-store numbers is the huge mark-to-market in the portfolio that already exists. So that\u2019s -- so don\u2019t expect, even if we change the assumptions by a lot, the numbers for 2023 are not going to move that much. They will, obviously, move as you get further along into the future. So that\u2019s one comment I would make. The second comment I would make is that in every year in the last three years or four years, we started the year with rental assumptions that we have exceeded sometimes by a factor of 3x to 4x. So I am not saying that\u2019s going to happen this year, but there is absolutely no reason in the world to go crazy on our assumptions with respect to rental rates, particularly they don\u2019t have an effect in 2023 anyway. So we will see how it plays and if we see evidence of stronger rental growth and my bet would be a surprise on the upside of our assumptions, not the other way around, then we will let you know and you can adjust the numbers accordingly. Tim?\nTim Arndt: Yeah. Just building on that, Michael, if you, within the supplemental, you can see our lease expiration schedule. Out of that, you will see we have about 13% rolling and that\u2019s a mix of what is stated as expiring, which is another 9%, but also things that we have already addressed ahead of entering the year here. So the footnotes will tell you that. You get to 13% there. SME said, start with the 67% lease mark-to-market. You have got 10% market rent growth for the year. You assume we will get that halfway through the year. One thing we see people get wrong is that will take you to a certain amount of rent change. You actually get half that rent change this year, you get half of 2022\u2019s rent change as well. There is a mathematic thing that you need to be mindful of given the quantum of rent change we are talking about lately. That will all get you to close to 9% and then we backed off an assumption on occupancy loss, which we couldn\u2019t point to right now, but just feels prudent in the environment, so we have taken our guidance down there a bit.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please state your question.\nVince Tibone: Hi. Good morning. How should we think about the organic same-store NOI growth for the legacy Duke portfolio in 2023, given them that\u2019s outside of guidance? Is it lower than guidance for the legacy PLD portfolio in the same ballpark, just given the thought that you do any color you could share would be helpful?\nHamid Moghadam: Well, it will be lower for one reason anyway, which is that they started at a higher level of occupancy. So putting even rent aside on a same-store basis there\u2019s less opportunity. They generally had longer term leases because they generally have bigger spaces. So that affects the mix, but Tim?\nTim Arndt: Well, I think, an important thing to remember here and we have seen some people not have this entirely correct modeling is just understanding that on a GAAP basis there will be very little same-store. There\u2019s potential for some, but because we mark the leases up to market now at the close on a net effective basis there will be very little same-store growth, that\u2019s contemplated in our guidance. On a cash basis, I expect it would look quite similar to Prologis.\nVince Tibone: That\u2019s really helpful.\nHamid Moghadam: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from...\nHamid Moghadam: By the way, if I can continue that. One thing that you didn\u2019t ask, but it\u2019s important in this context, and Dan can elaborate, is that the rental performance of the Duke portfolio on the few spaces that have come up for releasing or were in progress during the time we were doing the transaction are trending significantly higher than what we had underwritten. Dan, can you quantify that?\nDan Letter: Yeah. I actually go as far as saying we expect to outperform the operating portfolio to 11% to 13%, call it, now 8% of that is going to come from market rent growth, so really 3% to 5% of that comes from just operating that portfolio in the Prologis platform.\nOperator: Next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please state your question.\nTom Catherwood: Thanks. Tim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the outlook for 2023 assumes a recession and if we look back to previous recessionary cycles, usually we get declines in consumption, which drives lower demand for industrial space. But we have also never started a cycle with kind of persistently low vacancy like we have right now or tailwinds from e-commerce and supply gain reconfiguration. So kind of within that backdrop of assuming a recession, how do you think it could be different this time and kind of what do you have baked into your numbers for that for 2023?\nHamid Moghadam: So given that Tim was in kindergarten when cycle started, Tim and I are a little bit different than our recession outlook, but I don\u2019t think it matters. I think Tim would tell you that if there\u2019s a recession, there\u2019s a very mild recession and my bet would be that we wouldn\u2019t have a recession, but it would be close to zero GDP growth for a while. So call it recession or no recession, but the same outcome. I think what\u2019s different about other cycles and I say that with a lot of dislike for the phrase that\u2019s different this time is that, there were really two situations where we had negative absorption in the U.S., which is where we have data. One was on the hill of dotcom and there you had a high vacancy rate. On top of it, you had a very low utilization rate because there was a lot of capital for these dotcom, particularly e-commerce retailers and they were taking space way ahead of demand, so there was a lot of shadow space too. So when you add those two, it was a very, very high vacancy type of market during that time, so 2000, 2001 timeframe. The next time you had a pretty significant negative absorption with 2008, 2009, and we all know the reasons for that. And there, you also started with a significantly higher vacancy rate. I think it was 7% or 8% before the music stopped and all I can tell you is that, Prologis -- the old Prologis with the funny LA loan [ph] had 52 million square feet of vacant spec space that they had to lease. I think AMD at the time have like 8 million square feet or 9 million square feet. So nothing like you are talking about here, particularly given the different scale of the company and how lease we are starting out. Now even in that situation where we are normally at about 95% occupancy, we went down to about 91% in both cases. So I don\u2019t see anything near that. I mean it\u2019s mathematically impossible. Even if absorption goes to zero right now, we don\u2019t lease any more of the under development spec space and absorption goes to zero, I mean, you will be under 5% vacancy, which used to be considered a great strong market. And the capital up, we didn\u2019t have this kind of mark-to-market. I mean the mark-to-markets in those days were in the mid single-digit range and now we are talking about 70% almost. So a very different picture.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Please state your question.\nTodd Thomas: Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just had a question about market rents actually, so the 10% market rent forecast in the U.S. Can you just discuss that or break it out a little bit for us in terms of coastal versus non-coastal in terms of your expectations just in the context of supply growth that you are seeing and the demand backdrop in general?\nChris Caton: Yeah. Hey. It\u2019s Chris Caton. So indeed we expect 10% in the U.S. that\u2019s going to vary. Typical spread between coastal, non-coastal is 300 basis points to 500 basis points, at least that\u2019s where it was running, say, pre-pandemic and we expect a wider spread in the current environment. So whether you look at vacancy, whether you look at the under construction pipeline, whether you look at the momentum in pricing in the back half of last year including fourth quarter that leads you to conclude on the coastal outperformance continuing at a greater than historical average in 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey. I just want to go back to some of the comments on the third-party management. I think you talked about valuations being down 7% in the back half of last year and potentially continuing into this year and the redemptions potentially ending in the first two quarters of the year. I just want to get a sense, any more color how are you thinking about that, is it because the valuations have been repriced that you expect sort of the redemptions to stop? What should we be looking for to get more confidence in that? Thanks.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. There are two things that usually drive redemption requests. One is sort of the denominator effect and people needing and two is some folks want to arbitrage the lag between the -- how quickly the public markets adjust and the backward looking appraisal process. In our experience in past downturns, the second has taken about three quarters to be fully reflected in appraisals. So we really don\u2019t want to disadvantage one group of investors. By the way, the vast majority of our investors, 95% of them, because a couple of points of people want to arbitrage that difference, so we want to make sure the valuations are right before those things transact. We think Europe has actually adjusted quicker than the U.S. and that\u2019s why we think there\u2019s maybe another quarter to go before Europe fully adjust. So we are committed to taking care of those redemptions in the next quarter. And we think the U.S. may take another quarter to adjust and we will take care of those in the second quarter. Here is what\u2019s important and people don\u2019t get about the structure of our funds. First of all, our leverage is in the low 20% range on these funds. So there\u2019s oodles of liquidity in these firms to basically be able to handle any redemption requests -- any reasonable redemption request. And secondly, we started with the Q and we started with some cash on hand. So, again, there are lots of sources for addressing those redemption requests. I think you should assume that redemptions that have been effective as of the end of this quarter will, by and large, be taken care of by the middle of the year and sooner in Europe. So you can model that math beyond that. Now I will tell you one other thing, which is kind of interesting. Prologis could be a buyer up in these fronts, and in fact, even in the global financial crisis, where the old AMB was in a tighter spot with respect to leverage, we actually stepped up and bought on very attractive terms with adjusted values, a couple of hundred million dollars of real estate and we actually offered it to our outside investors first and then we stepped in and bought it. And you know what, the next quarter, all the redemptions went away, because people realized that the people who know the most about this portfolio are buyers at these prices. So it\u2019s really about getting the values, right? And we started writing down these portfolios a quarter or two ago and our appraisal process is independent. We have nothing to do about it and that\u2019s very, very different than some of the redemption situations that we have all been reading about.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question comes from Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nCamille Bonnel: Hi. Good morning. On your development guidance, can you give us some color on how much conservatism is built into your development starts? And also you are expecting another year of strong stabilization, what assumptions are you making in terms of timing of these projects and is any of the increase in guidance driven by projects from last year taking longer to complete due to longer construction time lines?\nDan Letter: This is Dan. Let me start with this year\u2019s development start guidance. We are coming off our largest year of starts ever, and just given the macro headlines, we decided to take a little bit more balanced approach where we slowed our starts at the end of last year. We don\u2019t expect to start up in earnest until the last half of this year. We think the build-to-suit business will pick up at the same time. So call it conservatism, I call it discipline and just feel really good about our approach, given the volumes over the last year or two. And then stabilization next year, stabilization this year, Tim mentioned it earlier, we think we can outperform. What we have in the books right now, demand continues to be strong. We talked about the development starts plummeting in the marketplace in the fourth quarter. We think they are going to be slower in the first half of the year and we think that bodes well for absorption in the last half of this year into next year. So we feel very good about our guidance.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. There has not been a material delay in any of our construction project, if you look at them on an aggregated basis. So that is not -- that has not shifted stabilizations from 2022 to 2023 or anything like that. Yeah, I can\u2019t even think of an example that comes close. And even on the cost side, because we have been thoughtful about procurement and securing some of these type supplies ahead of time. That\u2019s been actually something that we use as a competitive advantage in marketing to build-to-suits, because we have got a bunch of steel and we have got a bunch of air conditioning units and electric panels and things that are insured supply are already sitting in our warehouse waiting to be deployed into our land bank. So no, there\u2019s nothing funny going on about that, and by the way, the stabilizations are not just a function of completion of construction, but also leasing being stabilized at 90% or more and that factor hasn\u2019t delayed stabilizations either. We have been leasing actually ahead of plan to this day and I think we will -- I expect to continue to do that.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. On the subject of fund redemptions, there are some unlisted funds or non-traded REITs with a different leverage profile than yours, different investor base that are seeing a significant amount of redemption requests and I was wondering if you anticipate this will lead to increased asset sales on the block and potentially some more opportunities for you on the acquisition side?\nHamid Moghadam: I hope it does. I am not optimistic that it will, because if you look at even the denominator problem for most institutions and the fact that they generally have to reduce their exposure to real estate, they are likely not going to want to reduce their exposure to industrial. So I think and with these -- most of the open-end funds, where it would be -- where their mix, they are different property types, the industrial is what\u2019s holding up their performance. So for them to disclose those would put them in even a more difficult situation. So I don\u2019t think there will be a lot of for sellers in industrial, because to the extent that you are dealing with a leverage issue or a liquidity issue, if you sell your highest yielding assets, you keep tightening the coverage and noose around your neck. So as much as I\u2019d like to, I don\u2019t think we will see a lot of that. I think where we could see opportunity is actually within our own open-end fund availabilities. If the redemptions continue and we think the values are good, first, we will offer that to all the third-party investors and then we will step in them buy and we like that real estate. We know it well, and we operate it, and if it\u2019s priced right, we are all buyers, no problem.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC. Please state your question.\nMichael Carroll: Yeah. Thanks. I guess, Hamid, I understand that PLD in the industrial space in general are pretty well positioned in the current environment despite the uncertainty, but is there anything that you are watching out for any specific risks that you foresee for this space here in the next year plus or so?\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. We are watching everything really carefully. I mean I am not -- believe me, we have been through enough cycles and enough where things can happen that none of us predict that we want to be vigilant. That\u2019s why we are starting out the year with very conservative assumptions and things that we can deliver. I mean, I think even on this basis, we are going to, I think, put up unbelievably good numbers. I mean, who can think of almost a digit kind of returns or growth off of such strong growth, 14% per year earnings growth consistently for the last three years. So I think the arrow is up. But, yeah, I mean nobody predicted Putin going into Europe last year. It\u2019s usually the stuff that you don\u2019t -- you can\u2019t predict. I mean, am I worried about inflation really thanking our numbers? No. Am I really worried about recession thanking our numbers? No. Am I worried about e-commerce going out the window and people going back to shopping deals the way without that percentage going up? No, I am not worried about those things. But I am worried about things that I don\u2019t even know what to worry about. You get my drip there, anyway. So, yeah, there\u2019s always bad stuff that can happen that are out of the realm of normal projections.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nMike Mueller: Yeah. Hi. What are the anticipated yields for your 2023 development starts?\nDan Letter: Anticipated -- this is Dan. The anticipated yields are actually up slightly, but still in the low 6s, 6.1-ish, 6.2-ish.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please state your question.\nAnthony Powell: Hi. Good morning. Question on utilization, which increased in the quarter, what drove that growth given all the headlines we see about port volumes were not declining and how big of a driver of the higher utilization is for your outlook for this year given the strong outlook this year?\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. I don\u2019t think utilization actually moved that much. I mean the peak utilization ever all time was 87%. And I think that 1 point is well within the sampling bias that can take place, because it\u2019s not a perfect data set. It\u2019s a sample of large data sets. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a meaningful trend in certainly not a decelerating trend in utilization. With respect to port volumes, I think, port volumes are pretty meaningless in the last -- really since COVID started, because there were so many fits and starts and play things being in the wrong place and all that. And yeah, the West Coast ports have lower volumes today than they did before, but the East Coast and golf ports are getting a lot more volume than they did before. So on an aggregate basis, port volumes are just fine and if you look at the lag that it takes too many empty containers on one side of the ocean, and factories shutting down on the other side of the ocean and all that. I think until the market normalizes, you can\u2019t really draw any conclusions from port volumes. So I don\u2019t see either one of those two trends affecting demand. Chris, do you want to?\nChris Caton: Yeah. I will just build on that by saying two things are also happening. One is market vacancies in the U.S. are 3.2%, 3.3% lower in Europe. That, in its own right creates some pent-up demand and so there\u2019s a need to push utilization within the facilities. And then second, look, inventories are up 15% on a year-on-year basis -- on a nominal basis and 9%, 10% on a real basis. So there is real structural demand, lifting new demand, as well as in-place customers.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. Notwithstanding that increase in real inventories, we still think we are less than halfway towards equilibrium level of inventories about 45% of the way there. So we think there\u2019s a lot of tailwind behind inventories, too.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nBlaine Heck: Great. Thanks. So related to that last question, and Hamid, your comments on that progress towards equilibrium inventory, can you just talk about your recent conversations with customers? What\u2019s your sense for how they are balancing this investment need and CapEx spend against concerns about the economic slowdown or recession and higher overall cost of capital?\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. I will pitch it to Mike for more detailed comments on this. So my sense is that customers are -- don\u2019t have quite as much fomo as they did before. In other words, they are not in the hard mentality of let\u2019s go get this place, because if we don\u2019t, somebody else will and all that. I think the market has rationalized with respect to pace of leasing demand and people are being more thoughtful about how they go about their thinking space, because forget about what they pay us in rent. I mean every time you open a new large warehouse, there\u2019s a lot of CapEx that goes into it and all that, real estate is the least of your worries. It\u2019s all the other stuff that you have to put in. So I think people are cautious, but they also realize, particularly on the e-comm side that this was a theoretical threat before the COVID. Now they see what really happened to their business during COVID. So they are very anxious to build out their full e-commerce supply chain, which is oftentimes a different one than their bricks-and-mortar supply chain. So I would say, demand has broadened, it\u2019s much less all about Amazon, it\u2019s much broader than that. But it\u2019s pretty strong. Is it the strongest it\u2019s ever been? No, it\u2019s not as strong as 2021. But compared to any 10-year period you want to look at, it\u2019s -- we would consider this a very strong market. Mike?\nMike Curless: Yeah. I would just to pile on. I mean, on a net basis, the activity is still very strong, decision time line is definitely have stretched out of people to be more cautious. But remember, these structural configurations we have been talking about for two year or three years continue to march on, perhaps, at a bit of a slower rate, but ultimately, it comes down to the fear of not having the right space when you needed to hear from now is overwriting, taking space that\u2019s a little bit too early. So broadly we feel pretty good about this overall activity.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please state your question.\nCraig Mailman: Hey, guys. I just want to follow up on these demand discussions, because this is a constant question I get from clients here and maybe it\u2019s more of a Chris question, but Hamid feel free to jump in, too. Just in terms of in these era of low vacancies were really not in the least, so net absorption is not necessarily the best leading indicator of demand. I mean what are you guys using at least to kind of use as your forward-looking indicator on and destruction or something that the market could look to, because it just seems like retentions are still high, availability is low, construction could fall off, but everyone is talking about inventories big higher, utilization will be higher, so people needing less of the space, but it\u2019s just from your commentary, it seems like this is not really filtering through what you guys are seeing and just some thoughts there. Then related to that, Chris, I mean, what would it take for market rents to actually turn negative, because that\u2019s a question I get a lot as well and I am just kind of curious in your modeling kind of what inputs with that to really turn to get that from the positive 10% you are seeing to somewhere below zero?\nHamid Moghadam: Okay. Let me start. I am sure Chris can give much more color. I would state this, in 40 years ago on this, this is the biggest disconnect that I have seen between the macro economy and the prospects for our business. Usually, those things -- two things are much more aligned and this time around, they just appear to be completely disconnected for a variety of reasons that we talked about at nauseam. So I think where pricing goes away is, vacancy is going to 7% to 8% and staying there. And if you do the math on that, you need another in the U.S., I don\u2019t know, 2 billion, 3 billion square feet of unleased construction coming online and you can\u2019t do it overnight, maybe 1 billion something median. We can do the math. But it\u2019s a big number and you are not going to keep doing that if space that -- if the first 100 million feet doesn\u2019t lease, you are not going to do that. And by the way, this cycle, you have a couple of big players in the business that have much more to gain from the fundamentals of the business being stronger, rents being stronger than a few bucks they may make on additional development. So there is an economic incentive to be disciplined. In prior cycles, mostly driven by merchant builders and private developers, they don\u2019t really care what their rental market was. They just wanted to build the product and sell to somebody else and that will be their problem. Today, those two sites are connected to one another. So I think that the motivations are really different and absent the nuclear work type of scenario. I just don\u2019t see vacancy rates going to a level that will lead to a reduction in rents. It\u2019s either going to be a demand collapse or a supply explosion and I don\u2019t see either one of them happening. The other thing I would say is that we are -- we leased 1 million square feet on a daily basis. Just -- let\u2019s get our heads around that, 1 million square feet on a daily basis. We throw these big numbers around without really fully appreciating what the scale of that is. I mean that is 10x the amount of space than anybody else in leases in any sector in real estate. So by watching these customers and their behavior, obviously, we will figure out if some back stuff is about to happen and won\u2019t be waiting for the quarterly report to analyze that. So, Chris, do you have specifics?\nChris Caton: Yeah. A couple of specifics, I would lead with our proprietary data leads us to these conclusions. So for example, our sales force pipeline, if we look at the vacancy that we do have, 46% has deals working. That\u2019s in line or above the average that we have experienced through COVID to say nothing of the conversations that Mike and Scott and our customer led solutions team have. In terms of public data, which I think I heard you ask about, Craig. We do publish our IBI survey and our utilization data and so figures like 60, on our IVI, it\u2019s a diffusion index. So that\u2019s consistent with this good or great tone that the team has struck and 86% on utilization, which was discussed earlier are ways that you can see that in the marketplace. And then as it relates to what it would take for rents to fall, Hamid described it very specifically. And I\u2019d add one piece of data that, I don\u2019t see commonly discussed in the marketplace, but it\u2019s important to know, which is development starts rather than development completions. Starts in the U.S. were off by a third in the fourth quarter relative to their 2022 trend and on the Continental Europe, they were off by 45%. So we are seeing a sharp marking to market at the capital market environment, the valuation environment and what those buildings might be worth for some of those other folks building buildings.\nHamid Moghadam: By the way, banks are a lot more disciplined, because now they have risk-based capital requirements. So putting out a lot of construction loans on buildings that don\u2019t lease like used to happen in prior cycles less likely to happen. So I think the market is generally smarter. There\u2019s a lot more data. Conversations like we are having today never used to take place two decades ago. So the cycles were much more amplified. I think it\u2019s pretty hard for that to happen. But something can come out of left field. I am not discounting that possibility. Something really bad to come out of left field and change all this, but I just can\u2019t think of what that thing would be. But none of us predicted the pandemic I don\u2019t think. So things can happen.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please state your question.\nVince Tibone: Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I just want to get any color on recent market rent growth and how that may differ between suite size, like are you seeing any differences in performance between bulk buildings and smaller more infill facilities?\nHamid Moghadam: I would generally tell you that the smaller spaces are having a tougher time to the extent of anybody having a tougher time, but Chris is looking up the specific. They are not radically different, but why don\u2019t we do this, why don\u2019t we go to the next -- you got it.\nChris Caton: Okay.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah.\nChris Caton: Right. No. Glad to help you out here. First off, market rent growth had great momentum at the end of the year with 5% growth in the U.S., 3% in Europe. When we look at rent change, which is a great way to understand performance in suite size, it\u2019s strong across the board. But in fact, late in the year, we saw an improvement in those smaller units, when -- which might be where you are your question is coming from, so it\u2026\nHamid Moghadam: Oh! Yeah.\nChris Caton: \u2026adverse.\nHamid Moghadam: Okay. That\u2019s different than I would have guessed and I bet you it\u2019s because there was more available space to absorb in those categories. Those categories were less leased. And by the way, we have them, too. I mean we have some smaller than 100,000 square foot unit. So I would say, occupancy was a little bit lower, so there was more room to lease product at the higher end.\nChris Caton: If we flip it to submarkets and we look at, say, infill which tend to have those smaller units, infill outperformed in the U.S. by 500 -- 400 basis points last year, so say, 34% and in the U.S. in the infill submarkets versus 30% for the whole of the United States.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up from Blaine and myself. So where do you expect to make the most progress on the Essentials business in 2023 and how does that factor into your guidance and earnings? And then also if you could just say where you think cap rates are today versus the peak of the cycle, how much they have moved? Thank you.\nHamid Moghadam: So two things. I think the Essentials business, in terms of percentage growth, I think, our mobility business would be the biggest, because it\u2019s the smallest right now to start with. So any growth will be the biggest. But in terms of dollar contribution, I would say, solar and storage are coming on the strongest today and operations is to close second behind. I will pitch it to Gary if he has any more to say about that after this. Second part of the question was -- oh, cap rate. So cap rates are really misleading. So we got to be careful about that. Cap rates at market, assuming that you had a building a year and a half ago at market and you have a building at market today, I would guess it\u2019s 50 basis points to 75 basis points maybe 100 basis points, okay? It\u2019s -- call it, 50 basis points to 100 basis points. But you have had all this rental growth in between. So the observed cap rates for the same building this year versus last year with rents that are higher by, I don\u2019t know, 10%, 15% or something, would not have moved as much. So, and if you get into weird situations, like some building that was leased five years ago when it comes on the market and it\u2019s -- and the in-place rent is less than half of what market is, that building could have a lower cap rate than it would have had a year ago. IRR is what\u2019s really important based on reasonable assumptions and my guess is that if I were going to pick a number, I would say, low to -- low 7, 7.25-ish in the U.S. and maybe a little bit lower than that in Europe with growth of, say, 4%-ish percent across a 10-year projection, something like that, approximately. Gary, anything on.\nGary Anderson: I think you got it exactly Hamid. I mean to say, in 2023, our mix is going to be about 50% operations and about 50% energy and mobility. The growth rate, obviously, mobility is going to be much higher because it\u2019s coming off of basically a zero base. Where are we investing? We are investing in our energy and mobility businesses. And that\u2019s where we are doing the capability, because actually see the most significant growth of 2025 and beyond. But I mean, just to put a set of stake in this, we are very, very convicted about the potential for these businesses. We are on track to generate our $300 million in revenues and tax benefits by 2025, which we have talked about before and that is going to deliver about $0.25 per share in FFO. And that would be a little bit above our -- that will be about 100 basis points of growth per year compared to our 2019 Investor Day estimates of about 50 basis points. So net-net, look, we are in great shape, that business is growing right on plan and we are going to continue to make investments in that business and this year it\u2019s going to be in mobility and energy.\nHamid Moghadam: By the way, that 2025 number that Gary just mentioned, it\u2019s going to be recapturing maybe 15%, 20% of the total opportunity within our portfolio. So there will be a huge runway for growth, and frankly, we are beginning to see more deals out of our own platform, because customers are taking us to buildings that they lease from other people to do the same level of service to them in those other situations. So I can\u2019t even begin to quantify that out of platform opportunities. So we are really excited about our Essentials business. Okay.\nJamie Feldman: Thanks.\nHamid Moghadam: I think we are at the top of the hour. I know we have one more question, but maybe we can take that outside the call, Anthony, with our apologies. But thank you for your interest in the company and we look forward to seeing you next quarter. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. All parties may disconnect.

            "name": "Tim Arndt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Let me begin by thanking our global team for delivering an excellent quarter and year. We have had outstanding results despite challenging headwinds from the capital markets and the overall economic backdrop. In the face of this, our focus has been to serve our customers and investors putting our heads down and executing on our long-term plan. As you see in our results, our portfolio is in excellent shape, driven by still strong demand and a continued lack of availability. This foundation for our business not only drove our nearly 13% increase in year-over-year core earnings, but it also sets up the company for sustainable growth for years to come. Turning to results. Core FFO excluding promotes was $4.61 per share and including promotes was $5.16 per share, ahead of our forecast. In the fourth quarter, our operating results again generated several new records. Occupancy increased to 98.2%, with retention of 82%. The Prologis portfolio excluding Duke added 30-basis-point of the 40-basis-point increase over the quarter. While we tend to quote occupancy, it is notable that the portfolio is 98.6% leased, a record that underscores the tightness across our markets. Rent change for the quarter was 51% on a net effective basis. The step down from our third quarter rent change of 60% is a reflection of mix and not market rents. In fact, market rent growth exceeded expectations during the quarter, increasing our lease mark-to-market to a record 67%. These results drove same-store growth to 7.7% on a net effective basis and 9.1% on cash. The Duke portfolio having closed on October 3rd, is fully integrated in these results, with the exception of same-store growth, which will not be reflected until the first quarter of 2024. On the balance sheet, while access to the debt markets have remained challenging for many issuers, we successfully executed a number of transactions during the quarter, raising over $1.1 billion at an interest rate below 3%, including $700 million of new unsecured borrowings out of Japan and Canada. Our credit metrics continue to be excellent and we have maintained over $4 billion of liquidity at year-end with borrowing capacity across Prologis and the open-ended funds of $20 billion, expanded significantly due to our balance sheet growth from the Duke acquisition. With regard to our markets and leasing activity, the bottomline is that conditions remain healthy and there is little we see across our results or proprietary metrics that point to a meaningful slowdown. We see a normalization of demand and when combined with low vacancy, it continues to translate to a meaningful increase in rents. Across our markets, rent growth was nearly 5% during the quarter, driving the full year to 28%. Proposal activity for available space was consistent with our recent history, and given persistent low vacancy, there is simply a very small number of units to even propose deals on. As evidenced, over 99% of our portfolio is either currently leased or in negotiation. Utilization remains high at 86%, near its all time record and deal gestation ticked up over the quarter, indicative of more careful consideration and time being taken in leasing decisions. While we are watching e-commerce carefully, its share of overall retail sales have increased to 22%, which is 600 basis points above its pre-pandemic level. Putting the nuance of mix, timing and other factors aside, as measured by retention, occupancy or rent change, it is clear that customers need to commit to space to market conditions, which offer them very little choice. In terms of supply, the development pipeline across our market stands at 565 million square feet and our expectation for the year is that the pipeline will decline. Deliveries will put modest upward pressure on vacancies from 3.3% today towards 4% later in the year. However, new development starts are slowing in response to the market environment, which will reduce vacancies in late 2023 or 2024. In Europe, we expect deliveries to outpace absorption by approximately 30 million square feet, expanding the current 2.6% vacancy rate to approximately 3.5%. Finally, and as expected, our true months of supply metric grew to 25 months in the U.S. from 22 months last quarter. As a reminder, this metric has averaged roughly 36 months over the last 10 years. In capital markets, transactions continue to be slow in the fourth quarter, making price discovery challenging. That said, return requirements are trending to the low-to-mid 7% range. This expansion further affected appraised values in our funds, although continued rent growth has mitigated some of the effect. Our U.S. values, which were appraised by third parties every quarter, declined 6% this quarter and 7% over the entire second half. In Europe, values declined approximately 12% during the quarter and 16% over the half. Our open-end funds have received only modest redemption requests, less than 3% of net asset value during the quarter, totaling 5% across the second half. Our flagship funds have strong balance sheets with low leverage, largely undrawn credit facilities, cash on hand and undrawn equity commitments. While we believe the value declines over the second half reflect market, investors are still adjusting to a new environment. Because we strive to be consistent in our actions and fair to all investors, we will redeem units call equity and resume asset contributions when price discovery has run its course. We expect that to be one quarter to two quarters away likely sooner in Europe. This will ensure certainty, fairness and consistency to all of our investors. Turning to our outlook for 2023, while our macro forecast assumes a moderate recession, which may put headwinds on demand, our business is driven by secular forces and long-term planning by our customers that should limit the impact unless such a downturn becomes significant and protracted. As mentioned earlier, we believe vacancy will build in the market and our portfolio, both of which are unsustainably low. Putting this sentiment together with our outlook on supply and demand, our 2023 rent forecast calls for approximately 10% growth in the U.S. and 9% globally. We acknowledge that our rent forecasts have proven conservative in recent years, but we are comfortable with this starting point given the environment. Specific to our portfolio and on an our share basis, we expect average occupancy to range between 96.5% and 97.5%, roughly 50 basis points lower than the 2022 midpoint. Combined with rent change, we forecast to generate net effective same-store growth of approximately 8% to 9% with casting store growth between 8.5% and 9.5%. Given these assumptions, we believe our lease mark-to-market will be sustained or even increased over 2023, ending the year between 65% and 70%, and providing visibility to an incremental $2.9 billion of NOI after the more than $300 million that will become realized over the course of this year. We expect G&A to range between $370 million and $385 million, reflecting not only inflation in wages and other corporate costs, but also additional investments we are making in our Essentials business particularly in the energy teams.  In that regard, we expect the contribution to FFO from Essentials to range between $0.07 and $0.09 this year. This reflects 70% growth in revenues and tax credits from 2022, but offset in the near-term by our higher Duke related share count and the G&A investments just mentioned. In terms of operational metrics for the business, we expect to add 115 megawatts of solar power over the year driving the portfolio to approximately 540 megawatts by year end. It's worth noting that we closed 2022 as the second largest on-site power producer in the U.S., a position we will build upon with our plan for 1 gigawatt of production and storage by 2025. We also forecast to have over 20 EV charging clusters installed and operational by year-end. In deployment, we will continue to be disciplined in our approach to new starts. We have over $39 billion of opportunities to select from in our land bank and between our expectations for build-to-suits and logical markets prospect, we see an active year of starts initially to range between $2.5 billion and $3 billion with a real opportunity to grow as conditions warrant. As mentioned earlier, we plan for redemptions to be cleared out over the year and private fundraising to resume. Accordingly, we forecast contribution activity to occur primarily in the second half and resulting in combined contribution and disposition guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion. Finally, in strategic capital, we forecast revenues excluding promotes to range between $500 million and $525 million, which is impacted by valuation write-downs across 2022 and the first half of 2023. We are forecasting net promote income of $0.40 based on an assumption that U -- that values in USLF, primary source of 2023 promotes will decline further from values at year end, every 1% change in asset value equates to slightly less than $0.02 of net promote income. Putting this all together, we expect core FFO excluding promotes to range between $5 per share and $5.10 per share. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents approximately 9.5% growth over 2022. We are guiding core FFO including promotes to range between $5.40 per share and $5.50 per share. In closing, this guidance builds upon an exceptional three-year period of sector-leading earnings growth. At our 2019 Investor Day, we presented a three-year plan, targeting 8.5% annual growth, we achieved nearly 14% over this period, 550 basis points of annual outperformance. We expect 2023 to be a year where headlines continue to be disconnected from our business and ability to deliver strong growth and valuation. While there are many unknowns generally, there are more knowns in our business that are clear, such as our lease mark-to-market, significant and visible opportunity in our land bank, a need for excitement for -- a need and excitement for a new generation of sustainable energy solutions, and a dedicated team that is the best in the business and laser focused on delivering leading results. We will now turn the call over to the Operator to take your questions. Yeah. They are going to be stronger. As you think about the lease mark-to-market, it's all of the leases, so it represents old leases and leases just done. So, clearly, everything that will roll next year is going to be above the 67% reporting today. It's a little bit flatter than you might expect as we have looked at it. I think leasing spreads next year are going to be in the high 70s to low 80s on a net effective basis and then as we know that the cash basis of that has trended towards about 1,500 basis points or so inside of that. Yeah. I will take -- Craig, it's Tim. I will take the first half and Dan can help with the second. This is really a date issue, I would say, not even an issue, but just a function of the date. We have a large amount of that group of stabilization we believe will occur in the first quarter of 2024 and I think there is a very real possibility that if we improve some of the leasing timing by just a month or two, we could see a decent amount of that actually fall back into 2023. So it's just a function of crossing over a calendar year to lay up the mix of all of our projects is landing. Hey, Ki Bin. So what I would do with regard to investment capacity is relying more on the way I am describing it in our prepared remarks, the $20 billion and $4 billion or $5 billion across the funds. The number that's presented in the sup, which is what I think you are referring to is a bit technical about the current amount of equity that can be drawn in the funds and then that number is levered slightly, so that's why it's a bit understated. The number we supplemented with in prepared remarks is looking at the overall leverage of the fund and how much more capacity sits beyond just that of committed equity post-leverage. So, for example, our USLF venture is very low leverage, just about 10% and that creates an incredible amount of debt capacity, as you can imagine. And I think that winds up addressing your second question, which is the liquidity and the funds for contributions, there's a lot there for us to have over time. Yeah. Just building on that, Michael, if you, within the supplemental, you can see our lease expiration schedule. Out of that, you will see we have about 13% rolling and that's a mix of what is stated as expiring, which is another 9%, but also things that we have already addressed ahead of entering the year here. So the footnotes will tell you that. You get to 13% there. SME said, start with the 67% lease mark-to-market. You have got 10% market rent growth for the year. You assume we will get that halfway through the year. One thing we see people get wrong is that will take you to a certain amount of rent change. You actually get half that rent change this year, you get half of 2022's rent change as well. There is a mathematic thing that you need to be mindful of given the quantum of rent change we are talking about lately. That will all get you to close to 9% and then we backed off an assumption on occupancy loss, which we couldn't point to right now, but just feels prudent in the environment, so we have taken our guidance down there a bit. Well, I think, an important thing to remember here and we have seen some people not have this entirely correct modeling is just understanding that on a GAAP basis there will be very little same-store. There's potential for some, but because we mark the leases up to market now at the close on a net effective basis there will be very little same-store growth, that's contemplated in our guidance. On a cash basis, I expect it would look quite similar to Prologis."

            "name": "Chris Caton",
            "content": "Yeah. It's absolutely right. Generally, Nick, it was diverse. So whether we look at consumer products, whether we look at apparel, food and beverage customers, we have a diverse range of customers leasing space from us beyond the housing categories, which would include construction, it could include home goods and alike. Yeah. Hey. It's Chris Caton. So indeed we expect 10% in the U.S. that's going to vary. Typical spread between coastal, non-coastal is 300 basis points to 500 basis points, at least that's where it was running, say, pre-pandemic and we expect a wider spread in the current environment. So whether you look at vacancy, whether you look at the under construction pipeline, whether you look at the momentum in pricing in the back half of last year including fourth quarter that leads you to conclude on the coastal outperformance continuing at a greater than historical average in 2023. Yeah. I will just build on that by saying two things are also happening. One is market vacancies in the U.S. are 3.2%, 3.3% lower in Europe. That, in its own right creates some pent-up demand and so there's a need to push utilization within the facilities. And then second, look, inventories are up 15% on a year-on-year basis -- on a nominal basis and 9%, 10% on a real basis. So there is real structural demand, lifting new demand, as well as in-place customers. Yeah. A couple of specifics, I would lead with our proprietary data leads us to these conclusions. So for example, our sales force pipeline, if we look at the vacancy that we do have, 46% has deals working. That's in line or above the average that we have experienced through COVID to say nothing of the conversations that Mike and Scott and our customer led solutions team have. In terms of public data, which I think I heard you ask about, Craig. We do publish our IBI survey and our utilization data and so figures like 60, on our IVI, it's a diffusion index. So that's consistent with this good or great tone that the team has struck and 86% on utilization, which was discussed earlier are ways that you can see that in the marketplace. And then as it relates to what it would take for rents to fall, Hamid described it very specifically. And I'd add one piece of data that, I don't see commonly discussed in the marketplace, but it's important to know, which is development starts rather than development completions. Starts in the U.S. were off by a third in the fourth quarter relative to their 2022 trend and on the Continental Europe, they were off by 45%. So we are seeing a sharp marking to market at the capital market environment, the valuation environment and what those buildings might be worth for some of those other folks building buildings. Okay. Right. No. Glad to help you out here. First off, market rent growth had great momentum at the end of the year with 5% growth in the U.S., 3% in Europe. When we look at rent change, which is a great way to understand performance in suite size, it's strong across the board. But in fact, late in the year, we saw an improvement in those smaller units, when -- which might be where you are your question is coming from, so it... ...adverse. If we flip it to submarkets and we look at, say, infill which tend to have those smaller units, infill outperformed in the U.S. by 500 -- 400 basis points last year, so say, 34% and in the U.S. in the infill submarkets versus 30% for the whole of the United States."

            "content": "I think you got it exactly Hamid. I mean to say, in 2023, our mix is going to be about 50% operations and about 50% energy and mobility. The growth rate, obviously, mobility is going to be much higher because it's coming off of basically a zero base. Where are we investing? We are investing in our energy and mobility businesses. And that's where we are doing the capability, because actually see the most significant growth of 2025 and beyond. But I mean, just to put a set of stake in this, we are very, very convicted about the potential for these businesses. We are on track to generate our $300 million in revenues and tax benefits by 2025, which we have talked about before and that is going to deliver about $0.25 per share in FFO. And that would be a little bit above our -- that will be about 100 basis points of growth per year compared to our 2019 Investor Day estimates of about 50 basis points. So net-net, look, we are in great shape, that business is growing right on plan and we are going to continue to make investments in that business and this year it's going to be in mobility and energy."

            "name": "Dan Letter",
            "content": "And this is Dan. I will just pile on there. The pre-leasing in that portfolio, as you see, there's 29% of that that's in there as a build-to-suit. The pre-leasing is better than that 29%, and I would say, on track with historical averages even on a bigger data set here. So we feel really good about delivering our stabilization at this year and next. Yeah. Sure. Mark-to-market -- lease mark-to-market in Europe is about 28%, and I would say, just overall, we feel very good about the leasing demand in Europe right now. We talked about at the -- in the remarks about an expansion in the vacancy, but overall, we feel really good about where it's headed. Yeah. I actually go as far as saying we expect to outperform the operating portfolio to 11% to 13%, call it, now 8% of that is going to come from market rent growth, so really 3% to 5% of that comes from just operating that portfolio in the Prologis platform. This is Dan. Let me start with this year's development start guidance. We are coming off our largest year of starts ever, and just given the macro headlines, we decided to take a little bit more balanced approach where we slowed our starts at the end of last year. We don't expect to start up in earnest until the last half of this year. We think the build-to-suit business will pick up at the same time. So call it conservatism, I call it discipline and just feel really good about our approach, given the volumes over the last year or two. And then stabilization next year, stabilization this year, Tim mentioned it earlier, we think we can outperform. What we have in the books right now, demand continues to be strong. We talked about the development starts plummeting in the marketplace in the fourth quarter. We think they are going to be slower in the first half of the year and we think that bodes well for absorption in the last half of this year into next year. So we feel very good about our guidance. Anticipated -- this is Dan. The anticipated yields are actually up slightly, but still in the low 6s, 6.1-ish, 6.2-ish."
        },
        "speaker6": {
            "name": "Hamid Moghadam",
            "content": "Yeah. Let me start with some general comments. Europe is generally a mild and more muted version of the U.S. both on the way up and on the way down and the market is -- has a lower vacancy rate than the UAE -- than the U.S., if you can believe it. So that's a general backdrop. That's very consistent with the way Europe has behaved in the last 10 years or 15years. As to the specifics on mark-to-market and alike, Dan, do you want to cover that? And the -- you might ask what about the U.K., because that's the one you hear about all the time, and actually that's really strong, too, so far. So we have actually been surprised on the positive side with the U.K. The other place that is really held up well is actually Germany, which you would have guessed with energy issues would be softer, it hasn't been and there's virtually no vacancy in Germany. And some of the manufacturing coming back, particularly autos, et cetera, are really strengthening Central and Eastern Europe the markets, particularly in Poland, where there's this perennial vacancy. It's sort of tightening up. Yeah. The only category that is significantly below the trend and is likely to be that way is housing, because the starts are slowing. But with respect to other detail, Chris, do you want to take that? Yeah. And retail sales on a real basis, notwithstanding the weaker for instance December and November are good. I think it's between 2.5% and 3% up compared to the year before. So, yeah, you do hear the headlines of the weaker with retailers, but I think if you look at it overall, it's actually pretty positive. It's more positive than the headlines. I wouldn't say, it's super positive, but it's much better than the headlines. Macro environment other than, call it, defaults or something that has an immediate effect are not going to drive the numbers big time in 2023, because a lot of the leasing that needs to take place in 2023 is already in progress or been dealt with. We are dealing with very high occupancy levels. To start with, there is not a whole lot of space to lease and the real driver of those same-store numbers is the huge mark-to-market in the portfolio that already exists. So that's -- so don't expect, even if we change the assumptions by a lot, the numbers for 2023 are not going to move that much. They will, obviously, move as you get further along into the future. So that's one comment I would make. The second comment I would make is that in every year in the last three years or four years, we started the year with rental assumptions that we have exceeded sometimes by a factor of 3x to 4x. So I am not saying that's going to happen this year, but there is absolutely no reason in the world to go crazy on our assumptions with respect to rental rates, particularly they don't have an effect in 2023 anyway. So we will see how it plays and if we see evidence of stronger rental growth and my bet would be a surprise on the upside of our assumptions, not the other way around, then we will let you know and you can adjust the numbers accordingly. Tim? Well, it will be lower for one reason anyway, which is that they started at a higher level of occupancy. So putting even rent aside on a same-store basis there's less opportunity. They generally had longer term leases because they generally have bigger spaces. So that affects the mix, but Tim? Thanks. By the way, if I can continue that. One thing that you didn't ask, but it's important in this context, and Dan can elaborate, is that the rental performance of the Duke portfolio on the few spaces that have come up for releasing or were in progress during the time we were doing the transaction are trending significantly higher than what we had underwritten. Dan, can you quantify that? So given that Tim was in kindergarten when cycle started, Tim and I are a little bit different than our recession outlook, but I don't think it matters. I think Tim would tell you that if there's a recession, there's a very mild recession and my bet would be that we wouldn't have a recession, but it would be close to zero GDP growth for a while. So call it recession or no recession, but the same outcome. I think what's different about other cycles and I say that with a lot of dislike for the phrase that's different this time is that, there were really two situations where we had negative absorption in the U.S., which is where we have data. One was on the hill of dotcom and there you had a high vacancy rate. On top of it, you had a very low utilization rate because there was a lot of capital for these dotcom, particularly e-commerce retailers and they were taking space way ahead of demand, so there was a lot of shadow space too. So when you add those two, it was a very, very high vacancy type of market during that time, so 2000, 2001 timeframe. The next time you had a pretty significant negative absorption with 2008, 2009, and we all know the reasons for that. And there, you also started with a significantly higher vacancy rate. I think it was 7% or 8% before the music stopped and all I can tell you is that, Prologis -- the old Prologis with the funny LA loan [ph] had 52 million square feet of vacant spec space that they had to lease. I think AMD at the time have like 8 million square feet or 9 million square feet. So nothing like you are talking about here, particularly given the different scale of the company and how lease we are starting out. Now even in that situation where we are normally at about 95% occupancy, we went down to about 91% in both cases. So I don't see anything near that. I mean it's mathematically impossible. Even if absorption goes to zero right now, we don't lease any more of the under development spec space and absorption goes to zero, I mean, you will be under 5% vacancy, which used to be considered a great strong market. And the capital up, we didn't have this kind of mark-to-market. I mean the mark-to-markets in those days were in the mid single-digit range and now we are talking about 70% almost. So a very different picture. Yeah. There are two things that usually drive redemption requests. One is sort of the denominator effect and people needing and two is some folks want to arbitrage the lag between the -- how quickly the public markets adjust and the backward looking appraisal process. In our experience in past downturns, the second has taken about three quarters to be fully reflected in appraisals. So we really don't want to disadvantage one group of investors. By the way, the vast majority of our investors, 95% of them, because a couple of points of people want to arbitrage that difference, so we want to make sure the valuations are right before those things transact. We think Europe has actually adjusted quicker than the U.S. and that's why we think there's maybe another quarter to go before Europe fully adjust. So we are committed to taking care of those redemptions in the next quarter. And we think the U.S. may take another quarter to adjust and we will take care of those in the second quarter. Here is what's important and people don't get about the structure of our funds. First of all, our leverage is in the low 20% range on these funds. So there's oodles of liquidity in these firms to basically be able to handle any redemption requests -- any reasonable redemption request. And secondly, we started with the Q and we started with some cash on hand. So, again, there are lots of sources for addressing those redemption requests. I think you should assume that redemptions that have been effective as of the end of this quarter will, by and large, be taken care of by the middle of the year and sooner in Europe. So you can model that math beyond that. Now I will tell you one other thing, which is kind of interesting. Prologis could be a buyer up in these fronts, and in fact, even in the global financial crisis, where the old AMB was in a tighter spot with respect to leverage, we actually stepped up and bought on very attractive terms with adjusted values, a couple of hundred million dollars of real estate and we actually offered it to our outside investors first and then we stepped in and bought it. And you know what, the next quarter, all the redemptions went away, because people realized that the people who know the most about this portfolio are buyers at these prices. So it's really about getting the values, right? And we started writing down these portfolios a quarter or two ago and our appraisal process is independent. We have nothing to do about it and that's very, very different than some of the redemption situations that we have all been reading about. Yeah. There has not been a material delay in any of our construction project, if you look at them on an aggregated basis. So that is not -- that has not shifted stabilizations from 2022 to 2023 or anything like that. Yeah, I can't even think of an example that comes close. And even on the cost side, because we have been thoughtful about procurement and securing some of these type supplies ahead of time. That's been actually something that we use as a competitive advantage in marketing to build-to-suits, because we have got a bunch of steel and we have got a bunch of air conditioning units and electric panels and things that are insured supply are already sitting in our warehouse waiting to be deployed into our land bank. So no, there's nothing funny going on about that, and by the way, the stabilizations are not just a function of completion of construction, but also leasing being stabilized at 90% or more and that factor hasn't delayed stabilizations either. We have been leasing actually ahead of plan to this day and I think we will -- I expect to continue to do that. I hope it does. I am not optimistic that it will, because if you look at even the denominator problem for most institutions and the fact that they generally have to reduce their exposure to real estate, they are likely not going to want to reduce their exposure to industrial. So I think and with these -- most of the open-end funds, where it would be -- where their mix, they are different property types, the industrial is what's holding up their performance. So for them to disclose those would put them in even a more difficult situation. So I don't think there will be a lot of for sellers in industrial, because to the extent that you are dealing with a leverage issue or a liquidity issue, if you sell your highest yielding assets, you keep tightening the coverage and noose around your neck. So as much as I'd like to, I don't think we will see a lot of that. I think where we could see opportunity is actually within our own open-end fund availabilities. If the redemptions continue and we think the values are good, first, we will offer that to all the third-party investors and then we will step in them buy and we like that real estate. We know it well, and we operate it, and if it's priced right, we are all buyers, no problem. Yeah. We are watching everything really carefully. I mean I am not -- believe me, we have been through enough cycles and enough where things can happen that none of us predict that we want to be vigilant. That's why we are starting out the year with very conservative assumptions and things that we can deliver. I mean, I think even on this basis, we are going to, I think, put up unbelievably good numbers. I mean, who can think of almost a digit kind of returns or growth off of such strong growth, 14% per year earnings growth consistently for the last three years. So I think the arrow is up. But, yeah, I mean nobody predicted Putin going into Europe last year. It's usually the stuff that you don't -- you can't predict. I mean, am I worried about inflation really thanking our numbers? No. Am I really worried about recession thanking our numbers? No. Am I worried about e-commerce going out the window and people going back to shopping deals the way without that percentage going up? No, I am not worried about those things. But I am worried about things that I don't even know what to worry about. You get my drip there, anyway. So, yeah, there's always bad stuff that can happen that are out of the realm of normal projections. Yeah. I don't think utilization actually moved that much. I mean the peak utilization ever all time was 87%. And I think that 1 point is well within the sampling bias that can take place, because it's not a perfect data set. It's a sample of large data sets. So I don't think there's a meaningful trend in certainly not a decelerating trend in utilization. With respect to port volumes, I think, port volumes are pretty meaningless in the last -- really since COVID started, because there were so many fits and starts and play things being in the wrong place and all that. And yeah, the West Coast ports have lower volumes today than they did before, but the East Coast and golf ports are getting a lot more volume than they did before. So on an aggregate basis, port volumes are just fine and if you look at the lag that it takes too many empty containers on one side of the ocean, and factories shutting down on the other side of the ocean and all that. I think until the market normalizes, you can't really draw any conclusions from port volumes. So I don't see either one of those two trends affecting demand. Chris, do you want to? Yeah. Notwithstanding that increase in real inventories, we still think we are less than halfway towards equilibrium level of inventories about 45% of the way there. So we think there's a lot of tailwind behind inventories, too. Yeah. I will pitch it to Mike for more detailed comments on this. So my sense is that customers are -- don't have quite as much fomo as they did before. In other words, they are not in the hard mentality of let's go get this place, because if we don't, somebody else will and all that. I think the market has rationalized with respect to pace of leasing demand and people are being more thoughtful about how they go about their thinking space, because forget about what they pay us in rent. I mean every time you open a new large warehouse, there's a lot of CapEx that goes into it and all that, real estate is the least of your worries. It's all the other stuff that you have to put in. So I think people are cautious, but they also realize, particularly on the e-comm side that this was a theoretical threat before the COVID. Now they see what really happened to their business during COVID. So they are very anxious to build out their full e-commerce supply chain, which is oftentimes a different one than their bricks-and-mortar supply chain. So I would say, demand has broadened, it's much less all about Amazon, it's much broader than that. But it's pretty strong. Is it the strongest it's ever been? No, it's not as strong as 2021. But compared to any 10-year period you want to look at, it's -- we would consider this a very strong market. Mike? Okay. Let me start. I am sure Chris can give much more color. I would state this, in 40 years ago on this, this is the biggest disconnect that I have seen between the macro economy and the prospects for our business. Usually, those things -- two things are much more aligned and this time around, they just appear to be completely disconnected for a variety of reasons that we talked about at nauseam. So I think where pricing goes away is, vacancy is going to 7% to 8% and staying there. And if you do the math on that, you need another in the U.S., I don't know, 2 billion, 3 billion square feet of unleased construction coming online and you can't do it overnight, maybe 1 billion something median. We can do the math. But it's a big number and you are not going to keep doing that if space that -- if the first 100 million feet doesn't lease, you are not going to do that. And by the way, this cycle, you have a couple of big players in the business that have much more to gain from the fundamentals of the business being stronger, rents being stronger than a few bucks they may make on additional development. So there is an economic incentive to be disciplined. In prior cycles, mostly driven by merchant builders and private developers, they don't really care what their rental market was. They just wanted to build the product and sell to somebody else and that will be their problem. Today, those two sites are connected to one another. So I think that the motivations are really different and absent the nuclear work type of scenario. I just don't see vacancy rates going to a level that will lead to a reduction in rents. It's either going to be a demand collapse or a supply explosion and I don't see either one of them happening. The other thing I would say is that we are -- we leased 1 million square feet on a daily basis. Just -- let's get our heads around that, 1 million square feet on a daily basis. We throw these big numbers around without really fully appreciating what the scale of that is. I mean that is 10x the amount of space than anybody else in leases in any sector in real estate. So by watching these customers and their behavior, obviously, we will figure out if some back stuff is about to happen and won't be waiting for the quarterly report to analyze that. So, Chris, do you have specifics? By the way, banks are a lot more disciplined, because now they have risk-based capital requirements. So putting out a lot of construction loans on buildings that don't lease like used to happen in prior cycles less likely to happen. So I think the market is generally smarter. There's a lot more data. Conversations like we are having today never used to take place two decades ago. So the cycles were much more amplified. I think it's pretty hard for that to happen. But something can come out of left field. I am not discounting that possibility. Something really bad to come out of left field and change all this, but I just can't think of what that thing would be. But none of us predicted the pandemic I don't think. So things can happen. I would generally tell you that the smaller spaces are having a tougher time to the extent of anybody having a tougher time, but Chris is looking up the specific. They are not radically different, but why don't we do this, why don't we go to the next -- you got it. Yeah. Oh! Yeah. Okay. That's different than I would have guessed and I bet you it's because there was more available space to absorb in those categories. Those categories were less leased. And by the way, we have them, too. I mean we have some smaller than 100,000 square foot unit. So I would say, occupancy was a little bit lower, so there was more room to lease product at the higher end. So two things. I think the Essentials business, in terms of percentage growth, I think, our mobility business would be the biggest, because it's the smallest right now to start with. So any growth will be the biggest. But in terms of dollar contribution, I would say, solar and storage are coming on the strongest today and operations is to close second behind. I will pitch it to Gary if he has any more to say about that after this. Second part of the question was -- oh, cap rate. So cap rates are really misleading. So we got to be careful about that. Cap rates at market, assuming that you had a building a year and a half ago at market and you have a building at market today, I would guess it's 50 basis points to 75 basis points maybe 100 basis points, okay? It's -- call it, 50 basis points to 100 basis points. But you have had all this rental growth in between. So the observed cap rates for the same building this year versus last year with rents that are higher by, I don't know, 10%, 15% or something, would not have moved as much. So, and if you get into weird situations, like some building that was leased five years ago when it comes on the market and it's -- and the in-place rent is less than half of what market is, that building could have a lower cap rate than it would have had a year ago. IRR is what's really important based on reasonable assumptions and my guess is that if I were going to pick a number, I would say, low to -- low 7, 7.25-ish in the U.S. and maybe a little bit lower than that in Europe with growth of, say, 4%-ish percent across a 10-year projection, something like that, approximately. Gary, anything on. By the way, that 2025 number that Gary just mentioned, it's going to be recapturing maybe 15%, 20% of the total opportunity within our portfolio. So there will be a huge runway for growth, and frankly, we are beginning to see more deals out of our own platform, because customers are taking us to buildings that they lease from other people to do the same level of service to them in those other situations. So I can't even begin to quantify that out of platform opportunities. So we are really excited about our Essentials business. Okay. I think we are at the top of the hour. I know we have one more question, but maybe we can take that outside the call, Anthony, with our apologies. But thank you for your interest in the company and we look forward to seeing you next quarter. Take care."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jill Sawyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin.\nJill Sawyer: Thanks, Darryl and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our third quarter results, press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation for those measures. On October 3rd, we closed on the acquisition of Duke Realty. As a reminder, Duke\u2019s results are not contained in our third quarter earnings release. However, within our supplemental, we included a summary of the portfolio integrated as of quarter end. Please refer to our website for details on the transaction.  I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO, and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim.\nTim Arndt: Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. We are clearly in a volatile macro environment where ongoing inflation, steeply rising interest rates and the war and energy crisis in Europe are pressuring the global economy. And while we're closely monitoring each element, the fundamentals in our business are very strong, and our read of supply and demand in our markets remains out of sync with the headlines. This morning, we reported excellent third quarter results, which generated many new records in the quarter. Yet, we will spend less time on these results and more time describing our view of the market and how we're navigating the environment. Before doing so, I'd like to thank our teams across the entire organization who did an exceptional job keeping focus on the business, especially while working through the Duke acquisition, which closed on October 3. We fully integrated the portfolio, achieved our day 1 synergies and look forward to the next phase, which is to build AFFO accretion through incremental property cash flows and Essentials income. We move forward with a better portfolio, a larger and stronger balance sheet, talented new employees and new customers to whom we can introduce to our Essentials business. Turning to results. Core FFO was $1.73 per share, including $0.57 of net promote income earned principally from our PELP venture in Europe. Our annual guidance for promotes was $0.60, with most of the revenue to be earned in the third quarter. The amount came in below expectations due to a nearly 5% write-down of European asset values in the quarter, partially offset by an increase in NAV from debt mark-to-market. In the end, the promote was a record high, while the fund enjoyed a high teens annualized IRR across the 3-year performance period despite the recent markdown. I'll note a few operating stats from the quarter, all of which were records for the company. Ending occupancy increased 10 basis points over the quarter to 97.8%. Same-store growth was 8.3% on a net effective basis and 9.3% on a cash basis. Both were driven primarily by rent change, which was 60% on a net effective basis. Separately, the Duke portfolio ended the quarter with 99% occupancy and net effective rent change of 54%. While these markets are outstanding, they are also backward looking. So we've kept focus on more contemporaneous data, namely rent change on signings, which was 84% during the quarter, and our lease mark-to-market, which now stands at nearly 62%. Finally, we had a very active quarter on the balance sheet, raising over $3 billion of debt in a variety of markets and currencies given our broad access, including a $650 million green bond issued in late September. We ended the quarter with debt-to-EBITDA of 4.3x, excluding gains, providing us significant investment capacity. Turning to our observations of current conditions. We continue to see scarcity of available space across our markets. Vacancy rates are at historic lows, and our own occupancy sits at a record high. Market rent growth in the third quarter remained robust in response to this scarcity and continued strong demand. Color across the markets remains generally upbeat in terms of customer inquiries, and our proprietary metrics also reveal healthy activity even if they've softened from the peak demand generated during COVID to levels still above long-term averages. Transaction gestation was stable during the third quarter at 62 days, proposals via available units slowed during the third quarter to levels more in line with the pace of 2019 and indicative of less urgency to renew space far ahead of exploration. Inside our properties are metrics point of activity that is increasing with our IBI index at 63.8%, the 80th percentile and utilization up to 86.6%, the 95th percentile. Our certain customers have publicly announced a pause in CapEx spending, particularly those with more mature supply chains. But active dialogue with the majority of our customers confirms an overarching need to increase space as supply chain resiliency remains a top concern. Shifting to supply. We're seeing initial signs of a deceleration in development activity across our markets as construction and capital costs continue to increase. We believe we could see a gap in deliveries emerge in late '23 or early '24. As for today, our true months of supply metrics sits at a healthy 22 months, up from 18 months last quarter. We've previously explained that we expect to see this metric climb into a low 30 months range, still at a level reflecting a strong operating environment. It's important to acknowledge where supply is being delivered as our submarket location strategies minimize our exposure to new supply. For example, in our coastal U.S. markets where we generate over 50% of our global NOI, vacancies are just 1.7%. Geographically, we have an increased level of focus on Europe given the ongoing war and growing energy crisis. While we're reporting record results, including occupancy at 98.6% in a market with 2.4% vacancy, we are closely monitoring conditions. Customers are exercising caution in response to rising energy costs, which may create headwinds to near-term demand. That said, we also believe that new supply will now decline around 15% in 2023, which should support occupancy. The U.S. remains strong, where we now generate 87% of our NOI with the addition of Duke. Our teams continue to see solid activity, although acknowledging a reduced number of prospects for space compared to what we saw during the frenzy of COVID. Rent change on signings during the quarter was 93%, demonstrating a continuation of favorable pricing dynamics. In Latin America, both Mexico and Brazil are performing well, with very high occupancy over 98% and rent change across the region of 24%. And in Asia, construction costs in Japan are rising most acutely from the weakness in the yen, as well as from competition for key materials to complete construction. Market vacancies have increased, but this constraint on new supply, particularly out to '23 and '24, should provide an offset. The combined picture was positive to third quarter market rent growth, exceeding our expectations and driving a 300 basis point increase of our '22 global forecast to 26%, with the U.S. at 28%, significantly up from the 10% and 11%, respectively, in our initial guidance. It's difficult to fully know the impact of this market rent growth on values given the limited transaction volume in the market. But our view is that the increase in return requirements is more than offsetting rent growth and indeed pressuring values. Based on prior cycles, we can safely assume it will take few quarters for full price discovery to be made as markets stabilize and transaction volumes build. With all this in mind, we're carefully managing the business and approaching our markets with a sense of caution much as we did at the onset of the pandemic. In leasing, despite the very strong spot environment, we are carefully watching for softening demand and will assume that there will be further macro deterioration. In some markets, this will have us managing more for occupancy than rent growth, but in many others, we believe pricing will remain favorable given very low availability. This is an environment where our revenue management capabilities will be the most useful and allow us to manage such decisions lease-by-lease. With deployment, we are reducing our starts guidance to a range of $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion, and we expect our fourth quarter starts will be 60% build-to-suit, reflecting a more cautious approach to deployment in the coming months, aiming to be very selective in new projects. And in terms of strategic capital, we previously mentioned that we expect to see an increase in redemption activity. While we did have inflows from numerous investors, redemptions grew by $1.3 billion, which, for context, is just 3% of our open-end third-party AUM. Our funds have sufficient equity queues to address this activity. In combination with equity called during the quarter, we now sit at net neutral queues. The open-ended funds have ample investment capacity based on overall low leverage, and we are optimistic about the long-term growth of the business. In the near term, we will be prudent as we evaluate further capital deployment, including a pause on contributions in the short term. Turning to guidance, which includes Duke portfolio for the fourth quarter. We are maintaining our guidance for average occupancy, while increasing our net effective same-store guidance to 7.5% to 7.75%, and our cash same-store guidance to 8.5% to 8.75%. We expect to see our lease mark-to-market around 65% at the end of the year. We now expect acquisitions to range between $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, which increased due to our acquisition activity in Europe during the quarter, and contributions and dispositions to range between $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Finally, we are increasing core FFO, excluding Promotes, to $4.60 to $4.62 per share, which includes approximately $0.05 of accretion related to the acquisition of Duke. We are guiding core FFO with Promotes to be $5.12 to $5.14 per share, which incorporates a lower Promote guidance of $0.52, reflective of the higher share count resulting from the Duke transaction. I'd like to point out that our earnings have been unimpacted by FX over this extremely volatile year due to our capital strategy and approach to hedging. The same is true for our equity base, which has very minimal exposure outside of the U.S. dollar despite our global footprint. We will continue to protect both proactively and programmatically. To close, we're proud of how we've positioned the business and are optimistic about the organic growth ahead. We own hard assets with contractual revenues, significant embedded mark-to-market and have meaningful secular drivers that continue to play out. As an organization, we have long had an entrepreneurial and growth mindset. Today, adding new business lines and cash flow streams that are synergistic with our already unique model. We have built the company to thrive across cycles, including uncertain environments like today, where we can seize opportunities and continue to set our business and portfolio apart. We'll now turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Sakwa: I don't know, Tim or Hamid, I guess what I'm trying to sort of circle up here is that, I understand why development starts would come down in light of what's going on globally, but yet stabilizations are up but the contributions are down. And I guess what I'm trying to really square up is if the funds still have capacity and they're still interested in deploying money, I'm trying to just really circle up why contributions into funds would be down, which is also impacting development gains?  So is it a pricing issue? Is it a lack of leasing on the assets? I guess, I'm just trying to get a little more color on why that contributions number is down. And I guess I can understand why dispositions would be down in this uncertain capital markets environment, but I'm just trying to get a little bit better handle on the contribution side.\nHamid Moghadam : Yes, Steve, good question. It's actually none of those reasons. The reason the contributions are down is that I made a decision that we are going to contributions until we have much better clarity on valuations, because one of the lessons that we and the former Prologis learned in the last cycle is that it's really, really important not to force any issues when there is the least bit of hesitancy around values. And as much as we have ideas about what values are and where they're going, we don't have absolute certainty about that. So it was completely a voluntary decision. Our leasing of our development business is actually ahead of what -- the way we underwrote the properties, and there is no external constraint on us, including capacity, of which the funds continue to have some. They're getting some redemptions, but they have plenty of leverage capacity, and we continue to raise money even in the same environment, not as much as we did before, but we continue to do that.\nTim Arndt : I would just add, Steve, in relation to your comment on gains in next year, I would just point out that the value creation is occurring regardless of that monetization event. If we hold the development assets on our balance sheet, it's still there at a very attractive yield. And we believe many of those assets will still find their way to the fund. It's just a time, a pause right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi.\nCraig Mailman: I just want to go back, Tim, to your commentary, there was, I think, an overarching message that fundamentals are still very strong. And the way it looks to me, you could still have accelerating core growth into next year. But at the same time, you clearly mentioned that some markets you guys would have to be kind of revenue manager here. I just kind of would like a little bit of color on maybe the percentage of those markets or how we should think about what's really at risk from a fundamental perspective? And then also, just as it relates to Duke, clearly, debt rates have moved against you a little bit. And so relative to your initial accretion, there's probably a little bit of a headwind there. And I'm just curious, too, as you guys kind of start to bid and kind of coming down a bit this year, where is your updated accretion number for Duke for the first 12 months?\nHamid Moghadam : That was a couple of questions and 1 big question. So let me take parts of it, and I'm sure Tim and Dan will have a follow-up on this. In terms of fundamentals, what we're saying is that if a normal range of market outcomes is kind of 0 to 10, we were operating in an environment that was maybe at 12 for the last 18 months, and that's coming down to sort of a 9, 9.5 today. And that's why we\u2019ve shared with you the percentiles of utilization and occupancy and business activity that are part of our proprietary data that we survey customers around. So by any measure, other than the last 18 months, I would say, we're in very strong market conditions. And during those periods of sort of 9, 9.5, there are always a couple of markets that are weaker than others. The key markets are exceptionally strong. I mean, L.A., basically L.A. and Inland Empire, there's no vacancy in New Jersey, there's no vacancy and so on and so forth. But there are markets where vacancy rates are in the 5%, 6% range. That, by historical standards, is a very low level of vacancy. So I would say -- I would characterize the fundamentals as being very, very strong. They're just not off the charts given what's happened in the last 18 months. With respect to the Duke portfolio and margins and the like, Dan can elaborate on this, but we've never underwritten the exit cap rates to what the peak has been in the last 12 to 18 months. We've always taken -- added the premium for the forward risk and just the fact that, basically, these were unprecedented times. And a lot of the margins that you saw in prior quarters from us reflected that level of conservatism. And rents are still going up. I mean, we started 2022 thinking rents are going to be up 11%. They're up 28%. So yes, cap rates have gone up, but the rents that are being capped are significantly higher. So bottom line, margins, if you really stress test everything, okay, and you say rental growth stops, cap rates go up, et cetera, et cetera, construction costs go up, our development pipeline goes from mid-40s margins to high 20s margin type of thing. So still double what we underwrite to, which we usually underwrite to mid-teens. So extremely strong operating environment, and we are just being cautious on the capital market environment as we have to be. It would be imprudent if we weren't.\nTim Arndt : And Craig, I'll just pick up your question on the debt in Duke. You're right. Since we announced the transaction in June, depending where you're on the curve, we're 100 to 200 basis points higher in interest rates. So that does hit the debt mark-to-market piece of things. I think if we were redoing the entire accretion on the year, we'd be still in the range, but at the lower end of that original $0.20 to $0.25 today.\nHamid Moghadam : Yes. But I would also say on the fundamentals of the real estate, we're ahead of where we underwrote. So I think that far outweighs a mark-to-market on the debt. I mean, both Duke and us were very low levels of leverage. So the mark-to-market is just not a big deal in our calculus.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.\nDerek Johnston: Just touching on European occupancy. You certainly had a positive bump to 98.6% and clearly pushed NOI. But can you expand on which geographies led really the sustainability of EU demand, what you guys are seeing on the ground and any additional leasing comments?\nHamid Moghadam : Some of the weaker markets in Europe have strengthened, like Spain would come to mind or France would come to mind. The perennial strong markets in Europe were the U.K. and Germany, historically, Northern Europe. And they remain strong, but we wouldn't be surprised if Germany weakened a bit and the U.K. weakened a bit. In terms of weak markets in Europe, I would say, if you really force me to name one, I would say it's Hungary, which is a very, very small part of our overall business. Poland is actually, too much to our surprise, pretty strong. It must be because of the in-migration of a lot of Ukrainians into Poland and the additional consumption that they drive. But markets in Europe are tighter than they are in the U.S. in aggregate, and that's why vacancy rates are lower. But there's no question that Europe will have lower growth or more if we go into a recession, a bigger recession than the U.S., but by no means is it weak. Quite to the contrary, pretty strong.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNichYulico: I just wanted to touch on sort of thinking about as we are heading into a weaker economic environment, most people think there's a global recession coming. If you could give us some context of how to think about potential occupancy impact to the portfolio. I mean, I think most of the third-party brokerage firms are citing something like 100 basis points of U.S. vacancy increase next year because of slowing absorption, some supply picking up. I guess, I'm curious what you thought about that. And then also from a credit loss standpoint, how we should think about the portfolio in sort of a historical context, kind of framing out where you have sort of a credit watch list today and potential occupancy impact on top of just an overall market occupancy impact from a credit loss standpoint in the portfolio if we are heading into a recession.\nHamid Moghadam : Sure. On credit loss, the average over 10, 15 years has been about 15 basis points. We underwrite a lot higher than that, but that's where we've averaged during the most acute times of COVID in the first quarter or 2 when nobody -- when there was all that loss of jobs and everybody was scared. That went up to 55 basis points. But we collected on all that credit reserve that we had set up because eventually everybody paid. So I don't know where we ended up with, but we essentially ended up at 0, or maybe in line with the 15 basis points of historical numbers. I don't think we're going to see it anywhere near that. I think there is a fair amount of demand today that is not being satisfied in the market because of lack of supply. Our vacancy rate, just to pick a round number of 4%, even if they were to go up 100 basis points, which I don't believe they will, it would be at 5% which we would all do cartwheels for at any time in the 42 years that we've been in this business.  So I'm -- I mean, just do the math on the numbers, assuming that the development pipeline has a 0 more leasing. I don't mean for Prologis, I mean for the marketplace. And demand falls off significantly. That's how you get to the 100 basis points. And I just don't think it's going to be that acute given what we're seeing in terms of customer interest in our spaces on a real-time basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: My question is on the Promotes. I think heading into the year, we talked about 2020 to 2023 Promote being similar or higher than where it was going to be in 2022 just given where valuations have changed and the different dynamics at play. How should we be thinking about the dynamics at play for next year on the Promote side?\nHamid Moghadam : Promote levels are very sensitive to exit cap rates that you assumed. So that's a pretty tough question to answer. But if we stress test our numbers from the last time we spoke, the Promote for USLF next year is going to be on par with what it is this year for PELF. But that number can move in either direction by a significant amount, depending to what happens to exit cap rates. And by the way, both of those years, '22 and '23, will be record Promotes by a factor of 2 or 3.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist.\nKi Bin Kim: I just want to go back to the question about contributions and your fund business. Can you remind us what the pricing mechanism is for your funds for you to contribute assets? If I remember correctly, that was a broker pref, but obviously, you don't want to force anything into your fund investors. So I'm just curious, what is causing the pause or temporary pause in contributions? Is it just an agreement or agreed upon price that you can't come to or is it something different? And second question, Hamid, if I think about the business bigger picture, if we didn't have this market volatility, I would have expected your company to contribute an increasing level of assets to your fund business because you have to kind of keep up with the development pipeline. But given that that's probably not going to happen, how should we think about the company taking on more assets on the balance sheet, better for our earnings but also higher leverage? I'm just trying to better understand that dynamic going forward.\nHamid Moghadam : Yes. On the fund contribution question, we would be happy to continue to contribute the deals, if there were not for our care in managing the long-term value of the franchise in our private capital business. We haven't even tried, and we will not even try to contribute these assets that are being completed because we just don't think it's the right thing to do. It's got nothing to do with the appraised values or capacity or any of that stuff, as I explained before. We just think until there is real clarity, that will take some time and there have to be some comps and some transactions. Then when there is clarity, we'll start contributions again. As you know, unlike the last cycle, the contributions today are not must put, must take. They are totally voluntary by us to offer those properties to the investors or not to offer those properties to the investors. We're just not going to force that issue. It's not like they've turned us down or we think the values are too low. The values are great. We would still have significant 40% margins if we contributed. It's purely voluntary. And I think it's the right decision for the company in the long term. In terms of its impact on leverage, obviously, if we decide to hold more assets, our leverage is going to go up. But the reason we built this balance sheet is exactly for situations like this, is to be able to, A, be able to hold more of our assets that we're -- at some point in the future will contribute. And we're happy to hold those. And the other purpose for the balance sheet is to take advantage of investment opportunities as they emerge. It's still too early because I think the valuations will settle out somewhere lower than where the appraisers probably think today. But I don't know that for sure. And we -- by the way, we've been -- don't listen to a word I'm saying with respect to valuations, because for 5 years, we've been saying the cap rates are going to go back up, and they finally did, I guess. But we've been really wrong and, frankly, too high in cap rates for all this time. One other thing that's important, I should have mentioned this. We had never written up our portfolios to so the peak cap rates or underwritten any of our developments to the peak cap rates that we were seeing in the marketplace. We were always assuming exit cap rates that had a premium built into them. I think I mentioned that before, but that premium was anywhere between 5,000 to 7,500 basis points. So a lot of what you're seeing and are yet likely to see in values is already reflected in the way we looked at our margins, and we further stress test those numbers. And I think I shared the results of that with you earlier.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG.\nTom Catherwood: Hamid, you mentioned tenants with more mature supply chains have slowed their CapEx spending. Obviously, we've seen that in the headlines as well. Are you seeing, though, any givebacks or nonrenewals from those tenants, whether it's FedEx or Amazon or others? And specifically, what are the tenants or industries that are backfilling this gap in demand?\nHamid Moghadam : I'm going to let Mike give you a broader view of demand other than the customers you asked about. But let me hit those 2. We have 0 givebacks on Amazon. Zero. We thought we were going to have 2 out of like 160, we have 0. And they continue to take new space from us. So I don't know what all this excitement is all about, but we haven't seen it in the marketplace. They were on a tear in 2020 and '21, and they probably overcommitted to space, and they just reeled that back a bit. But they talked about 30 million feet coming online. We don't think it's even going to be 10 million feet and none of it is in the spaces that we have. So that's Amazon. FedEx is consolidating some of its ground operations with airport operations. We're going to be a beneficiary of that. And we're not going to lose any FedEx business as a result of that. And we're in regular conversation with these people. So those 2 customers specifically, no issue, and we have vetted this about as best as anybody can.  With respect to the broader customer picture, Mike?\nMike Curless : Yes, I would just add a finer point to that. We're going to see other headlines coming down the pike. I'd encourage you to really look through the headlines and understand the numerator versus the denominator in play here. And we're talking, just to pile on Hamid's comments, FedEx mentioned order of magnitude of 100 projects they're pausing in the future. That's set against 15,000 spaces they already have. Amazon, to put a finer point on that, even if there -- they have 550 million square foot portfolio. So we're talking 1% churn kind of numbers here, which is a very normal churn we see for our larger customers that have thousands of spaces. I think it's important when you see the next headline to look beyond along those headlines. In terms of where the other activity is, and Chris can pile on as well here, too, but e-commerce clearly is the big driver. And we're seeing e-commerce levels in our own portfolio just ahead of where we were pre-COVID. The big difference is Amazon is not a part of that this quarter. They're temporarily pausing, and we're seeing 122 other customers, not named Amazon, driving e-commerce leasing at levels we saw pre-pandemic. I think that's the big driver, the big takeaway for the segments that are supporting this backfill.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street.\nVince Tibone: You increased your market rent growth forecast in the U.S. to 28% this year. How much of that growth has already been achieved through the end of the third quarter? I'd like to hear just how much you think market rents can continue to grow in the current environment.\nTim Arndt : Vince, yes, the increase is exclusively based on the outperformance in the third quarter. We thought in the present landscape, it would not be appropriate to make an increase. But as we look into next year, I think it's appropriate to expect mid- to high single digits. As Hamid mentioned, we opened this year with a similar level of caution and have seen subsequent increases. We monitor this on a real-time basis let alone reporting out on a quarterly basis. And some of the things that go into that is the ongoing significant momentum, right? So rents were up 6% in the quarter against ultra-low vacancies, healthy demand, healthy leading indicators but set against the macro uncertainty that we've described.\nHamid Moghadam : So 75% to 80% of the 28% has already occurred, and we expect the balance to occur in the balance of the year. And by the way, we're only a couple of weeks into the quarter. But again, every time we make a deal, we know what the effective rent is compared to the way we underwrote it. And we call it spear, I won't get into the details of it here. But those indications are up, both in terms of comparison to underwriting or the way we had pro forma those spaces. And also in terms of duration of leases, they're slightly longer than we thought.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Thomas: I wanted to follow up on Duke. Tim, thanks for the update around the $0.20 to $0.25 of year 1 core FFO accretion. But I'm curious, Hamid, your comments suggest that Duke is running ahead of your initial underwriting. So I'm curious if there's been any change to your underwriting such that the year AFFO impacts changed at all relative to your initial expectations. And then just secondly, regarding the core FFO guidance, excluding net promote income, can you just help us bridge that 1.1% increase at the midpoint from the prior guidance now that Duke's closed and just discuss the drivers of that increase a little bit? It sounded like the quarter came in ahead of budget or plan, which I suspect contributed, but the increase of $0.05 at the midpoint, I think you attributed solely to Duke. Was there anything else that was an offset in the quarter to the stronger growth?\nHamid Moghadam : Yes. Just -- I remember, Duke's leases were longer than ours. So the average turnover based on the average duration of the Duke leases is like 10%, 12% a year. I don't remember what it is exactly in the next 12 months, that\u2019s your question was on. And we think we're a couple of points ahead. But a couple of points ahead affecting 10% to 12% of the portfolio for an average of 6 months is what we're talking about in terms of its impact on the next year. So it will be a small impact. I think the bigger impact will be what we can do once we get our hands on the rest of the portfolio rolling over through revenue management. And we think overall, maybe that could be 2% or 3% above underwriting. I also think there will be a couple of hundred basis points pickup in terms of folding essential sales on top of that. But it will take a little while for us to sort of build those relationships with those customers in those locations and all that. On the second part of your question, Tim will address that.\nTim Arndt : Yes, you're right that the quarter was strong. We're probably $0.01 ahead there, and that would be reflected really in the same-store guidance overall that we took up. We would see an uptick on the year from that uplift as well as we would get a little bit out of this slowdown in contributions in the short term. Offsetting each of those, putting the group to about 0 would be a little bit higher interest expense. We've got short-term rates that have really picked up. And then the write-down of asset values in the funds does hit asset management fees. So that would be another take. So that's all coming up to about 0, leaving really the entirety of the accretion to the Duke transaction.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.\nBlaine Heck: Hamid, can you expand on your thoughts on the broader economy? I think your remarks in the earnings release indicated that you're preparing for an economic slowdown. Does that include a U.S. and/or a global recession? And how should we think about your development starts in 2023 given that you've now added capacity through the Duke transaction but seem to be more cautious here today given macro concerns?\nHamid Moghadam : Yes. My view of the economy is that the Fed was behind the 8 ball, and they are now really running hard to catch up and they're going to overshoot in their reaction. And everybody expects these things to have an immediate effect. Look, I'm not as smart as the guys running the Fed, but these things typically have a 2-year lag. So I think we're going to whipsaw this economy. And there is no reason this economy should be in a recession other than just wanting to wring out this inflation. And this is a personal editorial. This is not a company position, but I believe more -- based on what I'm seeing, more of the inflation is actually affected by not that systemic wage price push that we saw in other times of high inflation. By the way, I was there. When I started my career, the 10-year bond was 14% and prime rate was 22%. But that was a psychology that was built into the marketplace. I think -- and it took bulker in October of '79 to wring that out. But the market had gone 6 or 7 years with that becoming the norm. This is very different. We were just talking about 2% inflation a year ago, and it just spiked up. So a lot of that, I think, is going to dissipate as things normalize and trade flows and the like normalize, but that's a personal point of view. So I am concerned about inflation. I think the Fed is all going to overdo it. Whether we have a recession or not, I don't know why people are so focused on this recession question. To me, a 0.25% growth rate in the GDP when the potential is 2%, 2.5% for the U.S. and 1.5% for Europe is a bad thing. Now whether technically a bunch of smoke will come out of the pipe, that says we officially have a recession, that's less important, but we are definitely under kind of underperform the capacity of this industry. The consumer is in great shape. The consumer balance sheets are in great shape. So I see a lot of reasons for optimism. I mean, look at all these calls that we were all having a quarter ago. I think the psychology has changed dramatically because of all this aggressive Fed action. So I've done a good job of not answering the question. If you had to ask me last quarter what's the probability of a recession in the next year, I would have told you 90-10. Today, I would go 60-40 or maybe 50-50. I think we're much closer in the U.S. I think in Europe, we will go into a very slight shallow recession. With respect to its impact on development starts, I think the market is undersupplied with space. But we don't have to make that decision today. We don't. Every start decision is made deal-by-deal, and we will have the benefit of up-to-minute information and actually some information about the future because we're talking to prospects. So if we think the prospects are there to lease it up, we'll build the building. And if not, I don't really care about guidance. We try to give you the best guidance we can, but we don't run our business according to guidance. We could be lower or we could be higher. I think we're going to surprise people on the upside. But let's wait and see. We don't have to make that decision today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Just going back to the lease signing of 84% during the quarter. It sort of suggests that the commenced leases should be accelerating as well. But how do I marry that with the full year same-store NOI guidance where you're guiding for $8.625 for the year, but year-to-date, it's 8.7. sso suggesting a little bit of deceleration? Just trying to understand what could be driving that? Is it occupancy of the comp versus the lease signing that's accelerating?\nTim Arndt : Yes, Ron. Look, this is a good opportunity actually to distinguish the 2 metrics. So the commencements were 62%, and that's why we're actually calling out the 84% on signings because of the lag that sits between the two. The lease signings on what started this quarter, generating the 62% were probably done in the first quarter. So all that means that the 84% we're signing today, we're really not going to see those commence until '23 outside of the same-store period in our guidance. So that's why we're actually focusing on signings. You'll probably hear a bit more of that going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America.\nCamille Bonnel : We've seen the spread between market rent growth and lease escalations widen over the past 2 years. Can you talk to what percent of your leases have a fixed structure? What are the escalators you're achieving on new leases? And how sustainable these are throughout the duration of the lease?\nHamid Moghadam : Virtually all leases have escalators. I would guess the average is 3.5-ish, maybe approaching 4. And yes, 4, I'm getting a lot of 4s, thumbs up here. And what was --\nTim Arndt : I would just clarify that the installed base is probably the 3.5% you mentioned and then more recently 4%.\nHamid Moghadam : Yes. And I think that was it. Did you have a third part to your question?\nCamille Bonnel : Just wondering how sustainable these increases are throughout the duration of the lease.\nHamid Moghadam : Well, they're contractually obligated to increase. So it's not -- and they're contractual. They're not CPI-driven or anything like that. So I guess unless the tenant goes broke, there is no risk to that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: I realize that the markets are very fluid, but I did want to ask about the 4.1% cap rate that you have stabilized on your development starts. I guess, industrial would be the 1 asset class that you could argue the most for negative leverage given the strong mark-to-market that you have, but new developments are signed basically at market. So it doesn't have its same mark-to-market potential. So can you make the argument or couldn't you make the argument that new development should be at a higher cap rate, which I know was counterintuitive to how it's been recently, but it's reflective of that market today?\nHamid Moghadam : Yes. By the way, I don't think there is any negative leverage even today. Let's just go to basic principles. The reason interest rates are going up is because we have inflation. Real up is because we have situation, so there's pressure on real rents going up. If we continue in an inflationary environment where rates are up, we're going to get more rental growth, not rental growth because vacancy rates are very low. So really, in terms of IRR, we have positive inflation -- positive leverage. And that's the way it has been for 30 years of my 42-year career. Positive leverage on IRR, not necessarily positive on the going in cap rate or cash yield compared to interest rates. That's the way the business works. It's total return dependent. And total return in a high interest rate, high inflation environment is going to have a big growth component to it. Unless the market is 10%, 15% vacant, in which case, inflation doesn't matter, you don't have pricing power. But we expect to have pricing power for the foreseeable future even in a really, really conservative absorption scenario. And I went through that before. I can't imagine a scenario anytime soon where vacancy rates would reach 5%. So I think we'll have pricing power, and I think we have positive leverage on an IRR basis. And by the way, short-term rates have moved up a lot more than the long-term rates. And really, real estate is an infinite life asset. So you got to compare its returns to 10-year or more longer debt. Tim?\nTim Arndt : I just want to clarify, John, maybe you see this, but I want to be sure you note that we have in the supplemental, both the exit cap and estimate on it and the development yield, and I think you're quoting the exit cap. The development yields are 6%, 6.5% in the portfolio. So I want to be sure you understand that distinction.\nHamid Moghadam : Hence, the huge margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies.\nJonPetersen: I was looking at the sort of the Promote opportunity next year for the targeted U.S. logistics fund. I realize it's volatile and there's a ton of assumptions that go into this. So maybe you could help us and remind us what the hurdle rates are that you have to hit each year to be eligible for a Promote? Just kind of how that structure works, once you hit the hurdle, like what percent of the NOI you get, so we can all be dangerous and make our own assumptions. And then another question I have is on the land portfolio. I think you have it on the books at $2.7 billion. Any estimate on how we should think about the market value of that land portfolio today?\nHamid Moghadam : Yes. I think market value of land was double our book value. And my guess is, before this is all over, and not a single piece of land has not really traded in any scale so that I can give you an actual estimate but I would guess land values before it's all over will decline by 30% which would put them still significantly above our book value. So that's where we are. I think the Promote hurdles are 7, and it's a 20% part -- yes. And we have 2 hurdle promotes, actually 7 and 10 and 15 and 20 is the upside participation in those, and those are leveraged hurdle rates. So 15 over 7, 20 over a 10.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays.\nAnthony Powell: A question on acquisitions. Can you talk more about the Crossbay deal, what brought you to that transaction? I think you talked before about maybe more portfolio deals happening in Europe. Are there more news out there? And what's your, I guess, willingness to do more deals on the balance sheet given kind of the overall macro environment?\nDan Letter : This is Dan. I'll take that question. So the Crossbay deal closed last quarter, we, I think, first introduced that deal probably in February. We were able to -- when we first talked about this deal, the bid-ask was pretty far apart. But we were actually able to win that deal at a very favorable price. We actually got a couple of price reductions, and we really love the real estate. It's very complementary to PELF, and the team is very excited about bringing that on. As it relates to other portfolios, the way I think about deploying capital right now, I think about really disciplined, I think, about patients and I think about opportunity. We've always run a very disciplined deployment machine. And our team, boots on the ground are calibrated for that and are excited about it. We're being patient right now because we do expect to see opportunities that come from -- as a matter of fact, we're making money today based on decisions that we made in the depths of the GFC. So really excited about what opportunities could come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets.\nMichael Carroll: I wanted to touch on an earlier question to see if we can get a little bit more information regarding the larger users with more mature supply pipelines. I know you touched on a few examples. But in general, how big is this bucket of these larger users slowing down? I mean, is it mostly Amazon? And I believe you mentioned FedEx, there are like a few other outside of that or is that about it?\nHamid Moghadam : Everybody is running to catch up on their e-commerce supply chain because they're starting behind and they need to catch up. So the demand for e-comm space is broadening. But remember, e-com is just maybe 20% of the overall demand. At the same time that, that's going on, people are building resilience in their supply chain. So inventory levels have adjusted upwards like we predicted. We think half of that adjustment has already occurred, and there's another half of it to go. So I think you'll see all customers or virtually all customers building more resilience into their supply chain by taking up more space so that they don't get caught with the wrong inventory in the wrong place at the wrong time. But demand is definitely broadening. Mike, do you want to?\nMike Curless: Yes. And I think I could just give you a sense on all customers are being certainly more introspective and cautious these days. That's natural in times of uncertainty. But if you look at our build-to-suit list, for example, it's a narrower list. Amazon is currently pausing. But the customers that are on the list are still following through with long-term supply chain reconfigurations that have been in place for a long time, and they are following through with those with the same effort that we've seen before. So I would say if you look at build-to-suits, it's a smaller, more active list of customers. And our competitive environment looks even better. There's fewer private competitors out there that are direct competition given the current market conditions. So I view that business as smaller but a deeper prospect list with a higher win rate possibility. So that's 1 perspective.\nHamid Moghadam : Yes, the point Mike just made about the competition on the private side is a really, really important one. I mean, these guys depend on leverage. Leverage is not available. It's not just a question of the cost of it to a lot of these people. So we've already seen certainly layoffs in Europe with respect to some of the very aggressive private guys, and I think we'll see some of it in the U.S., too. So again, another reason why we have a good balance sheet is to use it when the opportunities are there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.\nMike Mueller: Is your 65% year-end lease mark-to-market expectation with or without Duke in it?\nHamid Moghadam : That's with Duke.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rodgers with Baird.\nDave Rodgers: Hamid, thanks for the details on tenant credit that you provided earlier. I wanted to go back, and maybe this is a draconian question, but when you go back to global financial crisis, I think you lost 600 basis points of occupancy top to bottom. Some of that might have been credit loss, but even though it's not credit loss, then some tenants may leave just due to the same factors that we're talking about. I guess, how does today differ? And I guess, I'm just a little worried about the convexity of noninvestment-grade now above 10%, those types of things. I guess how does your portfolio differ? How do you think the market differs? And then maybe a follow-up to Chris. Last quarter, you had suggested a 75 basis point increase in vacancy for '23 for the market as a whole. Has that number changed?\nHamid Moghadam : Okay. I'm not sure I understood the second part. But the first part, first of all, I don't know about Prologis, but I think there was 52 million square feet of spec space that they had built at that time. And the company at that time was, I don't know, 400 million square feet or something. It was a huge part of the installed base, and most of it was spec. So you went into global financial crisis with a collapse in demand and you were starting off with a 7% or 8% vacancy rate even before going into the global financial crisis, so it was different at least in 3 respects. One, level of spec development; two, the starting level of vacancy; and three, the impact of that on a much, much smaller company than today. So very, very different situation. But the numbers for AMB were that we went from mid-95% occupancy to 91% occupancy. And by the way, the exact same thing happened in the dot-com collapse, which was people had overcommitted to space. The difference is that the shadow space in this market is very low. That's why we look track utilization. We have 90th percentile utilization in the buildings in terms of history. So occupancies are high, utilization is high, there's a lot of ongoing demand and we're starting off at the 98% occupancy. Even if the global financial crisis were going to repeat itself, we'll be at 94% occupancy. That's just fine. There's no problem with that. We can get rent growth at those kinds of numbers. So I don't even think of those draconian scenarios. Of course, somebody launches a nuclear war somewhere, all bets are off, but I'm not capable of making those.\nChris Caton: Dave, as it relates to the forecast we shared, you remember correctly but got the units wrong. So we had said we could see a supply demand gap of 50 million to 100 million square next year, which would only be 30 basis points of occupancy increase. Our latest view probably has it at the higher end of that range, say, 100 million square foot gap, which would lead to a high 3s or a 4% market vacancy, which again is below the low that prevailed during the decade before. And then also call out in Tim's script that based on the capital market landscape, we could have a gap in development starts that would ultimately translate to a gap in deliveries late next year and early '24.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James.\nBill Crow: Two questions. First of all, any change in the lease-up time on new deliveries? And the second question is, you talked a lot about cap rates and cap rate increases over the last 6 or 7 months. I'm just wondering if you were to underwrite an acquisition today, how would that change from where you were early this year? Let's say, how much how much do you think cap rates have gapped out on a like-for-like deal?\nTim Arndt : I can start on the lease-up times, and I think Hamid made reference to this just that compared to underwriting. We've consistently beat underwriting, and that would remain the case today. Maybe there's a month lower there, but we're continuing to beat underwriting in new development leasing.\nHamid Moghadam : I would say on the cap rate side, you see it in our development portfolio in the supplemental. We moved our exit cap rates from 4.1 to 4.7. So that's demonstrative of the change that we're looking at across the board going forward.\nHamid Moghadam : So if you -- I would say, for the last couple of years, we're looking at about a 6% unleveraged IRR in acquisitions using about an average of a 3% growth rate on rents and that gap is 300 basis points. By the way, that's the most important number that you look at, that I look at anyway, and replacement costs. So if you believe inflation is going to be higher at 4%, rents will grow at least [indiscernible] times inflation given what's happening to replacement costs and given the tightness of the market. So you could expect with the 4% growth rate that the IRRs would be 7%, 7.5% going forward. So the point I'm trying to make is that you just can't look at discount rate of those cash flows without considering the growth rate of those cash flows. And those 2 don't move perfectly in tandem, but generally move in line with one another in a market that has a vacancy rate below equilibrium.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.\nJamie Feldman: We were just thinking about how should we think about FX and how that goes into your calculus when you're thinking about investment activity given how strong the U.S. dollar is and your unique global platform? And then secondly, if you could just give us some thoughts on when you think the mark-to-market stops expanding. I think it's been surprising to us how it just keeps going quarter-after-quarter. I'd love to get some thoughts on when that might moderate.\nHamid Moghadam : Yes. So FX are -- I'll give you the big picture theory, and Tim can give you the details. We do 3 levels of FX management. Number one, we want to have a global platform to serve global customers, but we do not want to have our capital equally in every place because we're a U.S. dollar dividend payer. Therefore, we use a higher percentage of private capital in our foreign jurisdictions than we do in U.S. jurisdictions. So that's the first step that we take. Secondly, we have a disproportionately higher amount of debt in foreign currencies matched against our equity or our share of the equity in those assets so that we are neutralized in terms of asset and liability movements with respect to the movement of interest rates.  In other words, $100 of equity and $100 of debt against it. By the way, the U.S. is much less levered. So our overall leverage is very good. So that's the second level that we manage the asset value, which is really the big dangerous thing in real estate. So on those, we're perfectly hedged. Perfectly hedged. Not overhedged, not under hedged. Perfectly hedged. Then there is the issue of how do you manage earnings, FX on earnings, which is more of a flow management, and that is by buying hedges that go out and protect earnings for 2-ish kind of years.\nTim Arndt : Yes. And I would say even longer, we ladder into that strategy where the next few years are quite fully hedged, but we have hedges out to '26, '27 and we dollar cost average into it. I also think, Jamie, it sounded like underneath your question is how do we feel about sending dollars to Europe or to Japan. And frankly, that's not really how it works. In these other jurisdictions, we're typically recycling capital. That's when we're running the contribution model even at a time like this when the contributions at least in Europe are at a pause, we're funding that with debt in-country. So we don't really have the kind of issue, as I think you're trying to highlight there. Your second question was on the lease mark-to-market, I think, and how does it fall down over time. And I know you appreciate that's going to be purely a function of what is market rent growth from here. If there are no market rent growth, it will come down more precipitously. And if there's a reasonable level, say, high single digits, that's probably going to be paired with our same store growth. And that would say the lease mark-to-market is going to be pretty constant for a while. So you have to make a bet on market rent growth to really answer that question, and we're not doing that today over the long term, but it's got a very long tail to it, I think, is our view.\nHamid Moghadam : By the way, I would also say that the FX rates being so favorable to the dollar, there will become a time where there will be compelling opportunities to deploy capital in Europe because you could catch the combination of good values in local currency and a great exchange rate. So we're not -- we don't expect to do that tomorrow or anything, but that's another consideration that we always keep in mind, which is the opportunistic side of all these changes that we're witnessing. Before I let you go, however, I'd like to take a minute to highlight our Groundbreakers Conference, which happens next Tuesday at Hudson Yards in New York. It will also be streaming online. This is an annual thought leadership event, which will feature some of the most innovative voices in logistics today, including Dave Clark, formerly CEO of Worldwide Consumer at Amazon and now the new CEO of Flexport, which is actually one of our portfolio companies, plus a host of others that you won't want to miss. We'll dig into all the questions that you've been asking about in terms of macro trends. And I think it will be a very different event than yet another recumbence or something of that kind. So if you're really interested about logistics and when it's moving in the next couple of decades, these are the people that we brought together. So I look forward to seeing many of you there. We've had a tremendous response. And I think you'll get a lot out of it. So please come. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hamid Moghadam",
            "content": "Yes, Steve, good question. It's actually none of those reasons. The reason the contributions are down is that I made a decision that we are going to contributions until we have much better clarity on valuations, because one of the lessons that we and the former Prologis learned in the last cycle is that it's really, really important not to force any issues when there is the least bit of hesitancy around values. And as much as we have ideas about what values are and where they're going, we don't have absolute certainty about that. So it was completely a voluntary decision. Our leasing of our development business is actually ahead of what -- the way we underwrote the properties, and there is no external constraint on us, including capacity, of which the funds continue to have some. They're getting some redemptions, but they have plenty of leverage capacity, and we continue to raise money even in the same environment, not as much as we did before, but we continue to do that. That was a couple of questions and 1 big question. So let me take parts of it, and I'm sure Tim and Dan will have a follow-up on this. In terms of fundamentals, what we're saying is that if a normal range of market outcomes is kind of 0 to 10, we were operating in an environment that was maybe at 12 for the last 18 months, and that's coming down to sort of a 9, 9.5 today. And that's why we've shared with you the percentiles of utilization and occupancy and business activity that are part of our proprietary data that we survey customers around. So by any measure, other than the last 18 months, I would say, we're in very strong market conditions. And during those periods of sort of 9, 9.5, there are always a couple of markets that are weaker than others. The key markets are exceptionally strong. I mean, L.A., basically L.A. and Inland Empire, there's no vacancy in New Jersey, there's no vacancy and so on and so forth. But there are markets where vacancy rates are in the 5%, 6% range. That, by historical standards, is a very low level of vacancy. So I would say -- I would characterize the fundamentals as being very, very strong. They're just not off the charts given what's happened in the last 18 months. With respect to the Duke portfolio and margins and the like, Dan can elaborate on this, but we've never underwritten the exit cap rates to what the peak has been in the last 12 to 18 months. We've always taken -- added the premium for the forward risk and just the fact that, basically, these were unprecedented times. And a lot of the margins that you saw in prior quarters from us reflected that level of conservatism. And rents are still going up. I mean, we started 2022 thinking rents are going to be up 11%. They're up 28%. So yes, cap rates have gone up, but the rents that are being capped are significantly higher. So bottom line, margins, if you really stress test everything, okay, and you say rental growth stops, cap rates go up, et cetera, et cetera, construction costs go up, our development pipeline goes from mid-40s margins to high 20s margin type of thing. So still double what we underwrite to, which we usually underwrite to mid-teens. So extremely strong operating environment, and we are just being cautious on the capital market environment as we have to be. It would be imprudent if we weren't. Yes. But I would also say on the fundamentals of the real estate, we're ahead of where we underwrote. So I think that far outweighs a mark-to-market on the debt. I mean, both Duke and us were very low levels of leverage. So the mark-to-market is just not a big deal in our calculus. Some of the weaker markets in Europe have strengthened, like Spain would come to mind or France would come to mind. The perennial strong markets in Europe were the U.K. and Germany, historically, Northern Europe. And they remain strong, but we wouldn't be surprised if Germany weakened a bit and the U.K. weakened a bit. In terms of weak markets in Europe, I would say, if you really force me to name one, I would say it's Hungary, which is a very, very small part of our overall business. Poland is actually, too much to our surprise, pretty strong. It must be because of the in-migration of a lot of Ukrainians into Poland and the additional consumption that they drive. But markets in Europe are tighter than they are in the U.S. in aggregate, and that's why vacancy rates are lower. But there's no question that Europe will have lower growth or more if we go into a recession, a bigger recession than the U.S., but by no means is it weak. Quite to the contrary, pretty strong. Sure. On credit loss, the average over 10, 15 years has been about 15 basis points. We underwrite a lot higher than that, but that's where we've averaged during the most acute times of COVID in the first quarter or 2 when nobody -- when there was all that loss of jobs and everybody was scared. That went up to 55 basis points. But we collected on all that credit reserve that we had set up because eventually everybody paid. So I don't know where we ended up with, but we essentially ended up at 0, or maybe in line with the 15 basis points of historical numbers. I don't think we're going to see it anywhere near that. I think there is a fair amount of demand today that is not being satisfied in the market because of lack of supply. Our vacancy rate, just to pick a round number of 4%, even if they were to go up 100 basis points, which I don't believe they will, it would be at 5% which we would all do cartwheels for at any time in the 42 years that we've been in this business.  So I'm -- I mean, just do the math on the numbers, assuming that the development pipeline has a 0 more leasing. I don't mean for Prologis, I mean for the marketplace. And demand falls off significantly. That's how you get to the 100 basis points. And I just don't think it's going to be that acute given what we're seeing in terms of customer interest in our spaces on a real-time basis. Promote levels are very sensitive to exit cap rates that you assumed. So that's a pretty tough question to answer. But if we stress test our numbers from the last time we spoke, the Promote for USLF next year is going to be on par with what it is this year for PELF. But that number can move in either direction by a significant amount, depending to what happens to exit cap rates. And by the way, both of those years, '22 and '23, will be record Promotes by a factor of 2 or 3. Yes. On the fund contribution question, we would be happy to continue to contribute the deals, if there were not for our care in managing the long-term value of the franchise in our private capital business. We haven't even tried, and we will not even try to contribute these assets that are being completed because we just don't think it's the right thing to do. It's got nothing to do with the appraised values or capacity or any of that stuff, as I explained before. We just think until there is real clarity, that will take some time and there have to be some comps and some transactions. Then when there is clarity, we'll start contributions again. As you know, unlike the last cycle, the contributions today are not must put, must take. They are totally voluntary by us to offer those properties to the investors or not to offer those properties to the investors. We're just not going to force that issue. It's not like they've turned us down or we think the values are too low. The values are great. We would still have significant 40% margins if we contributed. It's purely voluntary. And I think it's the right decision for the company in the long term. In terms of its impact on leverage, obviously, if we decide to hold more assets, our leverage is going to go up. But the reason we built this balance sheet is exactly for situations like this, is to be able to, A, be able to hold more of our assets that we're -- at some point in the future will contribute. And we're happy to hold those. And the other purpose for the balance sheet is to take advantage of investment opportunities as they emerge. It's still too early because I think the valuations will settle out somewhere lower than where the appraisers probably think today. But I don't know that for sure. And we -- by the way, we've been -- don't listen to a word I'm saying with respect to valuations, because for 5 years, we've been saying the cap rates are going to go back up, and they finally did, I guess. But we've been really wrong and, frankly, too high in cap rates for all this time. One other thing that's important, I should have mentioned this. We had never written up our portfolios to so the peak cap rates or underwritten any of our developments to the peak cap rates that we were seeing in the marketplace. We were always assuming exit cap rates that had a premium built into them. I think I mentioned that before, but that premium was anywhere between 5,000 to 7,500 basis points. So a lot of what you're seeing and are yet likely to see in values is already reflected in the way we looked at our margins, and we further stress test those numbers. And I think I shared the results of that with you earlier. I'm going to let Mike give you a broader view of demand other than the customers you asked about. But let me hit those 2. We have 0 givebacks on Amazon. Zero. We thought we were going to have 2 out of like 160, we have 0. And they continue to take new space from us. So I don't know what all this excitement is all about, but we haven't seen it in the marketplace. They were on a tear in 2020 and '21, and they probably overcommitted to space, and they just reeled that back a bit. But they talked about 30 million feet coming online. We don't think it's even going to be 10 million feet and none of it is in the spaces that we have. So that's Amazon. FedEx is consolidating some of its ground operations with airport operations. We're going to be a beneficiary of that. And we're not going to lose any FedEx business as a result of that. And we're in regular conversation with these people. So those 2 customers specifically, no issue, and we have vetted this about as best as anybody can.  With respect to the broader customer picture, Mike? So 75% to 80% of the 28% has already occurred, and we expect the balance to occur in the balance of the year. And by the way, we're only a couple of weeks into the quarter. But again, every time we make a deal, we know what the effective rent is compared to the way we underwrote it. And we call it spear, I won't get into the details of it here. But those indications are up, both in terms of comparison to underwriting or the way we had pro forma those spaces. And also in terms of duration of leases, they're slightly longer than we thought. Yes. Just -- I remember, Duke's leases were longer than ours. So the average turnover based on the average duration of the Duke leases is like 10%, 12% a year. I don't remember what it is exactly in the next 12 months, that's your question was on. And we think we're a couple of points ahead. But a couple of points ahead affecting 10% to 12% of the portfolio for an average of 6 months is what we're talking about in terms of its impact on the next year. So it will be a small impact. I think the bigger impact will be what we can do once we get our hands on the rest of the portfolio rolling over through revenue management. And we think overall, maybe that could be 2% or 3% above underwriting. I also think there will be a couple of hundred basis points pickup in terms of folding essential sales on top of that. But it will take a little while for us to sort of build those relationships with those customers in those locations and all that. On the second part of your question, Tim will address that. Yes. My view of the economy is that the Fed was behind the 8 ball, and they are now really running hard to catch up and they're going to overshoot in their reaction. And everybody expects these things to have an immediate effect. Look, I'm not as smart as the guys running the Fed, but these things typically have a 2-year lag. So I think we're going to whipsaw this economy. And there is no reason this economy should be in a recession other than just wanting to wring out this inflation. And this is a personal editorial. This is not a company position, but I believe more -- based on what I'm seeing, more of the inflation is actually affected by not that systemic wage price push that we saw in other times of high inflation. By the way, I was there. When I started my career, the 10-year bond was 14% and prime rate was 22%. But that was a psychology that was built into the marketplace. I think -- and it took bulker in October of '79 to wring that out. But the market had gone 6 or 7 years with that becoming the norm. This is very different. We were just talking about 2% inflation a year ago, and it just spiked up. So a lot of that, I think, is going to dissipate as things normalize and trade flows and the like normalize, but that's a personal point of view. So I am concerned about inflation. I think the Fed is all going to overdo it. Whether we have a recession or not, I don't know why people are so focused on this recession question. To me, a 0.25% growth rate in the GDP when the potential is 2%, 2.5% for the U.S. and 1.5% for Europe is a bad thing. Now whether technically a bunch of smoke will come out of the pipe, that says we officially have a recession, that's less important, but we are definitely under kind of underperform the capacity of this industry. The consumer is in great shape. The consumer balance sheets are in great shape. So I see a lot of reasons for optimism. I mean, look at all these calls that we were all having a quarter ago. I think the psychology has changed dramatically because of all this aggressive Fed action. So I've done a good job of not answering the question. If you had to ask me last quarter what's the probability of a recession in the next year, I would have told you 90-10. Today, I would go 60-40 or maybe 50-50. I think we're much closer in the U.S. I think in Europe, we will go into a very slight shallow recession. With respect to its impact on development starts, I think the market is undersupplied with space. But we don't have to make that decision today. We don't. Every start decision is made deal-by-deal, and we will have the benefit of up-to-minute information and actually some information about the future because we're talking to prospects. So if we think the prospects are there to lease it up, we'll build the building. And if not, I don't really care about guidance. We try to give you the best guidance we can, but we don't run our business according to guidance. We could be lower or we could be higher. I think we're going to surprise people on the upside. But let's wait and see. We don't have to make that decision today. Virtually all leases have escalators. I would guess the average is 3.5-ish, maybe approaching 4. And yes, 4, I'm getting a lot of 4s, thumbs up here. And what was -- Yes. And I think that was it. Did you have a third part to your question? Well, they're contractually obligated to increase. So it's not -- and they're contractual. They're not CPI-driven or anything like that. So I guess unless the tenant goes broke, there is no risk to that. Yes. By the way, I don't think there is any negative leverage even today. Let's just go to basic principles. The reason interest rates are going up is because we have inflation. Real up is because we have situation, so there's pressure on real rents going up. If we continue in an inflationary environment where rates are up, we're going to get more rental growth, not rental growth because vacancy rates are very low. So really, in terms of IRR, we have positive inflation -- positive leverage. And that's the way it has been for 30 years of my 42-year career. Positive leverage on IRR, not necessarily positive on the going in cap rate or cash yield compared to interest rates. That's the way the business works. It's total return dependent. And total return in a high interest rate, high inflation environment is going to have a big growth component to it. Unless the market is 10%, 15% vacant, in which case, inflation doesn't matter, you don't have pricing power. But we expect to have pricing power for the foreseeable future even in a really, really conservative absorption scenario. And I went through that before. I can't imagine a scenario anytime soon where vacancy rates would reach 5%. So I think we'll have pricing power, and I think we have positive leverage on an IRR basis. And by the way, short-term rates have moved up a lot more than the long-term rates. And really, real estate is an infinite life asset. So you got to compare its returns to 10-year or more longer debt. Tim? Hence, the huge margins. Yes. I think market value of land was double our book value. And my guess is, before this is all over, and not a single piece of land has not really traded in any scale so that I can give you an actual estimate but I would guess land values before it's all over will decline by 30% which would put them still significantly above our book value. So that's where we are. I think the Promote hurdles are 7, and it's a 20% part -- yes. And we have 2 hurdle promotes, actually 7 and 10 and 15 and 20 is the upside participation in those, and those are leveraged hurdle rates. So 15 over 7, 20 over a 10. Everybody is running to catch up on their e-commerce supply chain because they're starting behind and they need to catch up. So the demand for e-comm space is broadening. But remember, e-com is just maybe 20% of the overall demand. At the same time that, that's going on, people are building resilience in their supply chain. So inventory levels have adjusted upwards like we predicted. We think half of that adjustment has already occurred, and there's another half of it to go. So I think you'll see all customers or virtually all customers building more resilience into their supply chain by taking up more space so that they don't get caught with the wrong inventory in the wrong place at the wrong time. But demand is definitely broadening. Mike, do you want to? Yes, the point Mike just made about the competition on the private side is a really, really important one. I mean, these guys depend on leverage. Leverage is not available. It's not just a question of the cost of it to a lot of these people. So we've already seen certainly layoffs in Europe with respect to some of the very aggressive private guys, and I think we'll see some of it in the U.S., too. So again, another reason why we have a good balance sheet is to use it when the opportunities are there. That's with Duke. Okay. I'm not sure I understood the second part. But the first part, first of all, I don't know about Prologis, but I think there was 52 million square feet of spec space that they had built at that time. And the company at that time was, I don't know, 400 million square feet or something. It was a huge part of the installed base, and most of it was spec. So you went into global financial crisis with a collapse in demand and you were starting off with a 7% or 8% vacancy rate even before going into the global financial crisis, so it was different at least in 3 respects. One, level of spec development; two, the starting level of vacancy; and three, the impact of that on a much, much smaller company than today. So very, very different situation. But the numbers for AMB were that we went from mid-95% occupancy to 91% occupancy. And by the way, the exact same thing happened in the dot-com collapse, which was people had overcommitted to space. The difference is that the shadow space in this market is very low. That's why we look track utilization. We have 90th percentile utilization in the buildings in terms of history. So occupancies are high, utilization is high, there's a lot of ongoing demand and we're starting off at the 98% occupancy. Even if the global financial crisis were going to repeat itself, we'll be at 94% occupancy. That's just fine. There's no problem with that. We can get rent growth at those kinds of numbers. So I don't even think of those draconian scenarios. Of course, somebody launches a nuclear war somewhere, all bets are off, but I'm not capable of making those. I would say on the cap rate side, you see it in our development portfolio in the supplemental. We moved our exit cap rates from 4.1 to 4.7. So that's demonstrative of the change that we're looking at across the board going forward. So if you -- I would say, for the last couple of years, we're looking at about a 6% unleveraged IRR in acquisitions using about an average of a 3% growth rate on rents and that gap is 300 basis points. By the way, that's the most important number that you look at, that I look at anyway, and replacement costs. So if you believe inflation is going to be higher at 4%, rents will grow at least [indiscernible] times inflation given what's happening to replacement costs and given the tightness of the market. So you could expect with the 4% growth rate that the IRRs would be 7%, 7.5% going forward. So the point I'm trying to make is that you just can't look at discount rate of those cash flows without considering the growth rate of those cash flows. And those 2 don't move perfectly in tandem, but generally move in line with one another in a market that has a vacancy rate below equilibrium. Yes. So FX are -- I'll give you the big picture theory, and Tim can give you the details. We do 3 levels of FX management. Number one, we want to have a global platform to serve global customers, but we do not want to have our capital equally in every place because we're a U.S. dollar dividend payer. Therefore, we use a higher percentage of private capital in our foreign jurisdictions than we do in U.S. jurisdictions. So that's the first step that we take. Secondly, we have a disproportionately higher amount of debt in foreign currencies matched against our equity or our share of the equity in those assets so that we are neutralized in terms of asset and liability movements with respect to the movement of interest rates.  In other words, $100 of equity and $100 of debt against it. By the way, the U.S. is much less levered. So our overall leverage is very good. So that's the second level that we manage the asset value, which is really the big dangerous thing in real estate. So on those, we're perfectly hedged. Perfectly hedged. Not overhedged, not under hedged. Perfectly hedged. Then there is the issue of how do you manage earnings, FX on earnings, which is more of a flow management, and that is by buying hedges that go out and protect earnings for 2-ish kind of years. By the way, I would also say that the FX rates being so favorable to the dollar, there will become a time where there will be compelling opportunities to deploy capital in Europe because you could catch the combination of good values in local currency and a great exchange rate. So we're not -- we don't expect to do that tomorrow or anything, but that's another consideration that we always keep in mind, which is the opportunistic side of all these changes that we're witnessing. Before I let you go, however, I'd like to take a minute to highlight our Groundbreakers Conference, which happens next Tuesday at Hudson Yards in New York. It will also be streaming online. This is an annual thought leadership event, which will feature some of the most innovative voices in logistics today, including Dave Clark, formerly CEO of Worldwide Consumer at Amazon and now the new CEO of Flexport, which is actually one of our portfolio companies, plus a host of others that you won't want to miss. We'll dig into all the questions that you've been asking about in terms of macro trends. And I think it will be a very different event than yet another recumbence or something of that kind. So if you're really interested about logistics and when it's moving in the next couple of decades, these are the people that we brought together. So I look forward to seeing many of you there. We've had a tremendous response. And I think you'll get a lot out of it. So please come. Take care."

            "content": "This is Dan. I'll take that question. So the Crossbay deal closed last quarter, we, I think, first introduced that deal probably in February. We were able to -- when we first talked about this deal, the bid-ask was pretty far apart. But we were actually able to win that deal at a very favorable price. We actually got a couple of price reductions, and we really love the real estate. It's very complementary to PELF, and the team is very excited about bringing that on. As it relates to other portfolios, the way I think about deploying capital right now, I think about really disciplined, I think, about patients and I think about opportunity. We've always run a very disciplined deployment machine. And our team, boots on the ground are calibrated for that and are excited about it. We're being patient right now because we do expect to see opportunities that come from -- as a matter of fact, we're making money today based on decisions that we made in the depths of the GFC. So really excited about what opportunities could come."

            "name": "Mike Curless",
            "content": "Yes, I would just add a finer point to that. We're going to see other headlines coming down the pike. I'd encourage you to really look through the headlines and understand the numerator versus the denominator in play here. And we're talking, just to pile on Hamid's comments, FedEx mentioned order of magnitude of 100 projects they're pausing in the future. That's set against 15,000 spaces they already have. Amazon, to put a finer point on that, even if there -- they have 550 million square foot portfolio. So we're talking 1% churn kind of numbers here, which is a very normal churn we see for our larger customers that have thousands of spaces. I think it's important when you see the next headline to look beyond along those headlines. In terms of where the other activity is, and Chris can pile on as well here, too, but e-commerce clearly is the big driver. And we're seeing e-commerce levels in our own portfolio just ahead of where we were pre-COVID. The big difference is Amazon is not a part of that this quarter. They're temporarily pausing, and we're seeing 122 other customers, not named Amazon, driving e-commerce leasing at levels we saw pre-pandemic. I think that's the big driver, the big takeaway for the segments that are supporting this backfill. Yes. And I think I could just give you a sense on all customers are being certainly more introspective and cautious these days. That's natural in times of uncertainty. But if you look at our build-to-suit list, for example, it's a narrower list. Amazon is currently pausing. But the customers that are on the list are still following through with long-term supply chain reconfigurations that have been in place for a long time, and they are following through with those with the same effort that we've seen before. So I would say if you look at build-to-suits, it's a smaller, more active list of customers. And our competitive environment looks even better. There's fewer private competitors out there that are direct competition given the current market conditions. So I view that business as smaller but a deeper prospect list with a higher win rate possibility. So that's 1 perspective."

            "name": "Tim Arndt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. We are clearly in a volatile macro environment where ongoing inflation, steeply rising interest rates and the war and energy crisis in Europe are pressuring the global economy. And while we're closely monitoring each element, the fundamentals in our business are very strong, and our read of supply and demand in our markets remains out of sync with the headlines. This morning, we reported excellent third quarter results, which generated many new records in the quarter. Yet, we will spend less time on these results and more time describing our view of the market and how we're navigating the environment. Before doing so, I'd like to thank our teams across the entire organization who did an exceptional job keeping focus on the business, especially while working through the Duke acquisition, which closed on October 3. We fully integrated the portfolio, achieved our day 1 synergies and look forward to the next phase, which is to build AFFO accretion through incremental property cash flows and Essentials income. We move forward with a better portfolio, a larger and stronger balance sheet, talented new employees and new customers to whom we can introduce to our Essentials business. Turning to results. Core FFO was $1.73 per share, including $0.57 of net promote income earned principally from our PELP venture in Europe. Our annual guidance for promotes was $0.60, with most of the revenue to be earned in the third quarter. The amount came in below expectations due to a nearly 5% write-down of European asset values in the quarter, partially offset by an increase in NAV from debt mark-to-market. In the end, the promote was a record high, while the fund enjoyed a high teens annualized IRR across the 3-year performance period despite the recent markdown. I'll note a few operating stats from the quarter, all of which were records for the company. Ending occupancy increased 10 basis points over the quarter to 97.8%. Same-store growth was 8.3% on a net effective basis and 9.3% on a cash basis. Both were driven primarily by rent change, which was 60% on a net effective basis. Separately, the Duke portfolio ended the quarter with 99% occupancy and net effective rent change of 54%. While these markets are outstanding, they are also backward looking. So we've kept focus on more contemporaneous data, namely rent change on signings, which was 84% during the quarter, and our lease mark-to-market, which now stands at nearly 62%. Finally, we had a very active quarter on the balance sheet, raising over $3 billion of debt in a variety of markets and currencies given our broad access, including a $650 million green bond issued in late September. We ended the quarter with debt-to-EBITDA of 4.3x, excluding gains, providing us significant investment capacity. Turning to our observations of current conditions. We continue to see scarcity of available space across our markets. Vacancy rates are at historic lows, and our own occupancy sits at a record high. Market rent growth in the third quarter remained robust in response to this scarcity and continued strong demand. Color across the markets remains generally upbeat in terms of customer inquiries, and our proprietary metrics also reveal healthy activity even if they've softened from the peak demand generated during COVID to levels still above long-term averages. Transaction gestation was stable during the third quarter at 62 days, proposals via available units slowed during the third quarter to levels more in line with the pace of 2019 and indicative of less urgency to renew space far ahead of exploration. Inside our properties are metrics point of activity that is increasing with our IBI index at 63.8%, the 80th percentile and utilization up to 86.6%, the 95th percentile. Our certain customers have publicly announced a pause in CapEx spending, particularly those with more mature supply chains. But active dialogue with the majority of our customers confirms an overarching need to increase space as supply chain resiliency remains a top concern. Shifting to supply. We're seeing initial signs of a deceleration in development activity across our markets as construction and capital costs continue to increase. We believe we could see a gap in deliveries emerge in late '23 or early '24. As for today, our true months of supply metrics sits at a healthy 22 months, up from 18 months last quarter. We've previously explained that we expect to see this metric climb into a low 30 months range, still at a level reflecting a strong operating environment. It's important to acknowledge where supply is being delivered as our submarket location strategies minimize our exposure to new supply. For example, in our coastal U.S. markets where we generate over 50% of our global NOI, vacancies are just 1.7%. Geographically, we have an increased level of focus on Europe given the ongoing war and growing energy crisis. While we're reporting record results, including occupancy at 98.6% in a market with 2.4% vacancy, we are closely monitoring conditions. Customers are exercising caution in response to rising energy costs, which may create headwinds to near-term demand. That said, we also believe that new supply will now decline around 15% in 2023, which should support occupancy. The U.S. remains strong, where we now generate 87% of our NOI with the addition of Duke. Our teams continue to see solid activity, although acknowledging a reduced number of prospects for space compared to what we saw during the frenzy of COVID. Rent change on signings during the quarter was 93%, demonstrating a continuation of favorable pricing dynamics. In Latin America, both Mexico and Brazil are performing well, with very high occupancy over 98% and rent change across the region of 24%. And in Asia, construction costs in Japan are rising most acutely from the weakness in the yen, as well as from competition for key materials to complete construction. Market vacancies have increased, but this constraint on new supply, particularly out to '23 and '24, should provide an offset. The combined picture was positive to third quarter market rent growth, exceeding our expectations and driving a 300 basis point increase of our '22 global forecast to 26%, with the U.S. at 28%, significantly up from the 10% and 11%, respectively, in our initial guidance. It's difficult to fully know the impact of this market rent growth on values given the limited transaction volume in the market. But our view is that the increase in return requirements is more than offsetting rent growth and indeed pressuring values. Based on prior cycles, we can safely assume it will take few quarters for full price discovery to be made as markets stabilize and transaction volumes build. With all this in mind, we're carefully managing the business and approaching our markets with a sense of caution much as we did at the onset of the pandemic. In leasing, despite the very strong spot environment, we are carefully watching for softening demand and will assume that there will be further macro deterioration. In some markets, this will have us managing more for occupancy than rent growth, but in many others, we believe pricing will remain favorable given very low availability. This is an environment where our revenue management capabilities will be the most useful and allow us to manage such decisions lease-by-lease. With deployment, we are reducing our starts guidance to a range of $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion, and we expect our fourth quarter starts will be 60% build-to-suit, reflecting a more cautious approach to deployment in the coming months, aiming to be very selective in new projects. And in terms of strategic capital, we previously mentioned that we expect to see an increase in redemption activity. While we did have inflows from numerous investors, redemptions grew by $1.3 billion, which, for context, is just 3% of our open-end third-party AUM. Our funds have sufficient equity queues to address this activity. In combination with equity called during the quarter, we now sit at net neutral queues. The open-ended funds have ample investment capacity based on overall low leverage, and we are optimistic about the long-term growth of the business. In the near term, we will be prudent as we evaluate further capital deployment, including a pause on contributions in the short term. Turning to guidance, which includes Duke portfolio for the fourth quarter. We are maintaining our guidance for average occupancy, while increasing our net effective same-store guidance to 7.5% to 7.75%, and our cash same-store guidance to 8.5% to 8.75%. We expect to see our lease mark-to-market around 65% at the end of the year. We now expect acquisitions to range between $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, which increased due to our acquisition activity in Europe during the quarter, and contributions and dispositions to range between $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Finally, we are increasing core FFO, excluding Promotes, to $4.60 to $4.62 per share, which includes approximately $0.05 of accretion related to the acquisition of Duke. We are guiding core FFO with Promotes to be $5.12 to $5.14 per share, which incorporates a lower Promote guidance of $0.52, reflective of the higher share count resulting from the Duke transaction. I'd like to point out that our earnings have been unimpacted by FX over this extremely volatile year due to our capital strategy and approach to hedging. The same is true for our equity base, which has very minimal exposure outside of the U.S. dollar despite our global footprint. We will continue to protect both proactively and programmatically. To close, we're proud of how we've positioned the business and are optimistic about the organic growth ahead. We own hard assets with contractual revenues, significant embedded mark-to-market and have meaningful secular drivers that continue to play out. As an organization, we have long had an entrepreneurial and growth mindset. Today, adding new business lines and cash flow streams that are synergistic with our already unique model. We have built the company to thrive across cycles, including uncertain environments like today, where we can seize opportunities and continue to set our business and portfolio apart. We'll now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. I would just add, Steve, in relation to your comment on gains in next year, I would just point out that the value creation is occurring regardless of that monetization event. If we hold the development assets on our balance sheet, it's still there at a very attractive yield. And we believe many of those assets will still find their way to the fund. It's just a time, a pause right now. And Craig, I'll just pick up your question on the debt in Duke. You're right. Since we announced the transaction in June, depending where you're on the curve, we're 100 to 200 basis points higher in interest rates. So that does hit the debt mark-to-market piece of things. I think if we were redoing the entire accretion on the year, we'd be still in the range, but at the lower end of that original $0.20 to $0.25 today. Vince, yes, the increase is exclusively based on the outperformance in the third quarter. We thought in the present landscape, it would not be appropriate to make an increase. But as we look into next year, I think it's appropriate to expect mid- to high single digits. As Hamid mentioned, we opened this year with a similar level of caution and have seen subsequent increases. We monitor this on a real-time basis let alone reporting out on a quarterly basis. And some of the things that go into that is the ongoing significant momentum, right? So rents were up 6% in the quarter against ultra-low vacancies, healthy demand, healthy leading indicators but set against the macro uncertainty that we've described. Yes, you're right that the quarter was strong. We're probably $0.01 ahead there, and that would be reflected really in the same-store guidance overall that we took up. We would see an uptick on the year from that uplift as well as we would get a little bit out of this slowdown in contributions in the short term. Offsetting each of those, putting the group to about 0 would be a little bit higher interest expense. We've got short-term rates that have really picked up. And then the write-down of asset values in the funds does hit asset management fees. So that would be another take. So that's all coming up to about 0, leaving really the entirety of the accretion to the Duke transaction. Yes, Ron. Look, this is a good opportunity actually to distinguish the 2 metrics. So the commencements were 62%, and that's why we're actually calling out the 84% on signings because of the lag that sits between the two. The lease signings on what started this quarter, generating the 62% were probably done in the first quarter. So all that means that the 84% we're signing today, we're really not going to see those commence until '23 outside of the same-store period in our guidance. So that's why we're actually focusing on signings. You'll probably hear a bit more of that going forward. I would just clarify that the installed base is probably the 3.5% you mentioned and then more recently 4%. I just want to clarify, John, maybe you see this, but I want to be sure you note that we have in the supplemental, both the exit cap and estimate on it and the development yield, and I think you're quoting the exit cap. The development yields are 6%, 6.5% in the portfolio. So I want to be sure you understand that distinction. I can start on the lease-up times, and I think Hamid made reference to this just that compared to underwriting. We've consistently beat underwriting, and that would remain the case today. Maybe there's a month lower there, but we're continuing to beat underwriting in new development leasing. Yes. And I would say even longer, we ladder into that strategy where the next few years are quite fully hedged, but we have hedges out to '26, '27 and we dollar cost average into it. I also think, Jamie, it sounded like underneath your question is how do we feel about sending dollars to Europe or to Japan. And frankly, that's not really how it works. In these other jurisdictions, we're typically recycling capital. That's when we're running the contribution model even at a time like this when the contributions at least in Europe are at a pause, we're funding that with debt in-country. So we don't really have the kind of issue, as I think you're trying to highlight there. Your second question was on the lease mark-to-market, I think, and how does it fall down over time. And I know you appreciate that's going to be purely a function of what is market rent growth from here. If there are no market rent growth, it will come down more precipitously. And if there's a reasonable level, say, high single digits, that's probably going to be paired with our same store growth. And that would say the lease mark-to-market is going to be pretty constant for a while. So you have to make a bet on market rent growth to really answer that question, and we're not doing that today over the long term, but it's got a very long tail to it, I think, is our view."

This call will focus on our second quarter results. The company will not provide comments related to this transaction beyond what is included in our prepared remarks. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO, and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim.\nTim Arndt: Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. This morning, we reported our second quarter results, which were strong and ahead of our expectations with occupancy, leasing and rent change all at record highs. Duke also released their operating results this morning, which tell a similarly strong story. That said, the macroeconomic environment is making it difficult for investors to fully assess the state of our industry. There's frankly a stark difference between what one reads in headlines versus what is actually happening in our business. Accordingly, we find ourselves focusing more on our own proprietary metrics and real-time feedback from our customers to build a forward-looking view of our markets and demand. Before going through that view, let me first step through our results. Core FFO, with and without promotes, was $1.11 per share, slightly ahead of our forecast. Rent change on rollover was 46%, led by the US at 54%. Retention in the quarter was 79%, driving occupancy higher by 30 basis points over the quarter to 97.7%. All of this led to net effective same-store NOI growth of 7.6% and cash same-store of 8.2%. We started $1.7 billion in new development projects, bringing our year-to-date starts to $2.7 billion. On the balance sheet, we closed on a refinancing of our lines of credit, expanding the total commitment to $5.4 billion, ending the quarter with $5.2 billion of liquidity. We are very pleased to have not only increased our line capacity, but also to have done so while maintaining our spread and staggering maturities. In strategic capital, our net equity queue, which combines the committed queue less outstanding redemptions and deployment, it was $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter. While performance in the second quarter was strong, we recognize that with the current backdrop, markets do have the potential to soften. Instead of repeating macroeconomic statistics from media headlines, which you all know well, I'll instead share observations from our unique data and insights. At quarter end, we had proposals on 52% of our remaining availabilities versus an average of 38% prior to COVID, reflective of the very active dialogue we've had and the fact that little space remains available to lease in our portfolio, 71% of leases expiring in the next 12 months are either preleased or in negotiations, ahead of the pre-COVID average of 56%.  Lease negotiation periods have lengthened by a few days to an average of 60, while up from the more rapid pace of 50 days across 2021, it has essentially returned to the normalized levels we saw pre-COVID. And as it relates to pricing, our Sphere data which measures normalized effective rents against forecast, reflects that, markets remain strong and rent growth stays ahead of our expectations.  Our field teams report market activity, which is totally consistent with all of this data. While the number of customers competing for available space has decreased from unprecedented levels tempering urgency, our teams report still healthy demand and limited downtime. This is also reflected in our monthly customer survey data, which report high historical utilization at 86% and an IBI index that reflects growth in activity.  In the end, we believe we're seeing a normalization in the volume and pace of demand which we expected as the world reopened from COVID and consumers seek more in-person experiences. But given exceptionally tight markets and availability, the fundamentals remain excellent. E-commerce represented 14% of new leasing, down from approximately 25% in 2021, a shift we've long telegraphed.  As noted, overall occupancy and leasing have continued to grow with take-up coming from a broad set of users, most notably transportation, healthcare and auto. E-commerce remains a positive long-term trend for our business. Clearly, COVID accelerated its adoption from a 15% share, retail sales pre-pandemic and running at 23% during, at 21% today, it is roughly 150 basis points ahead of our pre-COVID expectations.  We are also seeing the emergence of supply chain resiliency as a secular and incremental demand driver for our business. We hear it from our customers both in daily dialogue, as well as our advisory boards, including three events held this quarter. We expect that this need for safety stock will lift demand for years to come, although economic uncertainty could cause some delay this year.  In light of very low vacancy and healthy demand, we are increasing our overall market rent growth forecast for the year to 23% on a global basis and 25% in the US. This is due to a very strong first half where we see rents having increased 14% globally and 16% in the US. We continue to see increases in construction costs which provide a pricing umbrella for continued rent growth given the need to uphold expected yields before new spec development can be started.  The increase in rents over the second quarter has expanded our lease mark-to-market to nearly 56%, translating to over $2 billion of embedded annual NOI as these leases roll. Applying this mark-to-market to our lease expiration schedule will show that net effective same-store NOI growth through 2025 should exceed 8% without any further increases in market rent, an incredible amount of built-in organic growth and resiliency in our earnings.  Before turning to guidance, we expect to imminently file the S-4 related to our acquisition of Duke Realty, which will guide the timing of our shareholder votes and the close date of the transaction. The [filing] (ph) guidance excludes the deal's expected accretion. Beginning with operating guidance, we expect average occupancy to range between 97.25% to 97.75%, an increase of nearly 40 basis points from our prior guidance. We are increasing our net effective same-store guidance to a range of 7.25% to 7.75% and cash same-store to a range of 8.25% to 8.75%, each an increase of roughly 90 basis points. Rent change on rollover is expected to grow from our first half levels, increasing spreads to over 50% in each the third and fourth quarters. Given our view of market rent growth, we expect our portfolio's lease mark-to-market will expand to over 60% by the end of the year. We are holding our guidance for net promotes at $0.60 for the year. Our current appraised values would generate net promote income above this level, but given market uncertainty, we're holding our prior guidance. Our overall deployment guidance is unchanged from last quarter with the exception of acquisitions, which we have increased to $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion at our share based on our belief that opportunities are likely to emerge in the back half, which will be well-positioned to pursue. I'm also pleased to note that despite extraordinary moves in both interest rates and FX, our forecast remains unimpacted due to our proactive approach to managing both risks through limited maturities and robust FX hedging program. In total, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance to $5.14 to $5.18 per share, including promotes and $4.54 to $4.58 per share excluding promotes, representing 11.5% growth from 2021. Before closing, I'd like to spend just a few minutes highlighting one of the more important announcements we've made in recent years. Last month, we announced a new commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2040, a full decade ahead of the targets established in the Paris Climate Agreement. Our plan includes key milestones along the way, such as a dramatic increase in our solar energy production and storage goal to 1 gigawatt by 2025, more than doubling our previous goal. We will also conduct carbon-neutral operations and construction by 2025. Ultimately, we plan to get to net zero without reliance on carbon offsets and our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and net zero in our entire value chain by 2040. It's noteworthy that we are one of very few REITs to commit to science-based targets for our Net Zero goal. Prologis has long been a leader in ESG, both inside and outside of our industry. We're extremely pleased to have once again raised the bar and hold ourselves accountable to real, measurable, and reportable progress for our investors, our customers, and our planet. We truly feel great about our business and how we've positioned our teams, our portfolio and our balance sheet to thrive across the cycle even in uncertain times as we see today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our operator to take your questions. As a reminder, we won't be addressing questions related to the Duke transaction on this morning's call.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will be coming from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.\nCraig Mailman: HI. It's actually Craig Mailman here with Michael. I just want to hit on the market rent growth and mark-to-market piece. You guys had 79% retention, 25-odd percent cash mark-to-market just peak average occupancy levels. And so I guess maybe a two-parter here. Just what breaks the camel's back here in the near-term from an occupancy or market rent growth perspective? And then two, maybe, Tim, could you just address as you head into the back half of the year and into 2023, kind of remind us what that mark-to-market on a standalone basis means for FFO per share?\nTim Arndt: Yes, I can take the second part. We actually really don't break the number down in that way. We have full year same-store guidance. As noted, with a midpoint of -- it's at 7.5% to -- yes, sorry, 7.5%. And the growth in the back half is probably adding $0.01 to $0.02 of the run rate that you'll see in Q3 and Q4.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. And we didn't really hear -- I didn't really hear the first half of the question. Can you repeat that, please?\nCraig Mailman: Sorry, I was just saying kind of given the strength of the operating metrics, what breaks the camel's back from the sense of risk to occupancy market rent growth is a mark-to-market here? I know you guys talked a lot about kind of the headline risk versus the reality of what you're seeing on the ground. But just to maybe put out there from your perspective, what the real risks are given what you're seeing on the ground?\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. So there is the much talked about risk to supply exceeding demand. And there's a fair amount of confusion between the supply and demand balance in the overall US industrial market and the markets that we are involved in. And I'll turn it over to Chris to actually walk you through that because that's a pretty important distinction, and I really don't think there is a risk to supply, particularly given the low vacancy rates from which we are operating today. But let's bookmark that, and Chris will talk about that. On the demand side, the way I think about it is that I've been doing this for 40 years. And I would say, prior to last quarter and the quarter before, let's call the peak in terms of strength of market on the demand side as a 10 on a one to 10 scale. I think the last quarter and the quarter before were like on 12 or 13. They were just crazy good. And I think this quarter, there may be 9.5 to 10. I mean by historical standards, this would be exceptionally good. I mean in the 5 percentile good for the last 40 years. It just -- it can never be as good as it was in the last quarter and the quarter before because, frankly, everybody reads the same papers. And if you're a CEO of a company and you're looking to expand your operations, you're going to just take your time a little bit more, just to be sure that you're not making a stupid mistake. So the difference between sort of grabbing every piece of the space that you can see, which may push demand 10%, 20% above what is really needed, probably in an environment like this could haven't been conservative by 10% to 20%. And that swing is basically coming out of the froth that we saw in the last two quarters. So that's the way I think about it. But Chris can give you the supply/demand numbers because there's a lot of misunderstanding on those factors.\nChris Caton: Yeah. Let's be clear. And indeed, we publish our data quarterly to try and help bring clarity to the marketplace. And what does that data reveal? Well, we forecast 375 million square feet of net absorption and completions this year, calendar year 2022, and see vacancy rate falling to 3.2%. Now our statistics focus on our 30 US markets and is based on the leading source in each market. Now we could look out to 2023. It's a little early, but we foresee a gap, say, 50 million to 100 million square feet in differential between supply and demand. That would lead to a moderate rise in market vacancies, but they would remain below 4%, which is well below the pre-pandemic and historical averages. Now what we're seeing when we look at market commentary is that sources -- some sources are using unconventional methodologies and also include additional non-Prologis markets. So, for example, the next 20 US markets, places like Memphis, St. Louis, Detroit, have a market vacancy rate that's roughly one percentage point higher in our markets and do have a supply/demand imbalance with 126 million square feet under construction versus trailing 12-month net absorption of 88 million square feet.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. The other thing that's going on, and we're probably over-killing this response, but I think it's probably the single biggest area where we get questions on. Construction has not only become expensive, but also construction periods have been really stretched out because of limited availability of certain components. And by the way, we've been really good about ordering that stuff ahead of time. I'm talking about the market, not our situation in particular. So an extended construction period will make the pipeline of supply sound bigger. So if you're having a third longer construction period, which is what we're estimating, with the same amount of supply, the numbers will just be one-third bigger. That's just math. So again, a lot of confusion about this issue. And I think it's a single biggest disconnect between investor perceptions and the reality on the ground.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. Appreciate the comments, Hamid, on supply and demand. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about region and what you're seeing both in the US and Europe, just given some of the bigger challenges that we're seeing in Europe right now?\nHamid Moghadam: Well, let me give you the general commentary on Europe. Europe is as good as I remember Europe being because actually, the war and the excess population that's come out of Ukraine and in Central -- in the neighboring countries have actually increased demand and led to actually better market dynamics for unfortunate and tragic reasons, but it simply has. I would say the UK has slowed down a bit given what's going on with the politics. But Europe is generally a more muted market than the US, both on the supply and on the demand side. And that's why we're showing lower rental growth rate for Europe compared to the US. So that's not that unusual in terms of its historical relationship. Chris, do you have anything to add to that?\nChris Caton: Yeah. I would add, look, the US has been a market leader, especially on the coast with rent growth meaningfully outperform lower barrier markets. We're talking about 10 to 15 percentage annual rent growth, its better on the coast. And outside the US, whether it's Europe, whether it's the UK, whether it's Toronto, whether it's Mexico, vacancy rates are below 2.5%, and we're seeing some of the best market rent growth we've ever seen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Catherwood: Excellent. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Tim, I appreciate your comment about proposals on remaining availability of 52%. I think that was the number versus 38% pre-COVID. How does that 52% compared to the last few quarters? And then maybe more broadly on your kind of leading indicators. How much of a lag have you experienced during prior cycles between a falloff in demand and fundamentals and warning signals coming from your proprietary metrics?\nTim Arndt: Yes. Thanks, Tom. Basically, the 52% we measured this last quarter is the strongest it's been. It has accelerated from that pre-COVID number that we quoted of 38%, lifted up into the 40s through COVID and has now hit what I think is an all-time high. And Chris, maybe you can pick up the past cycles?\nChris Caton: Yes. So, I'd start by saying some of these insights are based on our investments in data that are unavailable elsewhere in real estate and uniquely available in this cycle. One metric that we invented in the last cycle was the IBI by way of a preview or by way of retrospective, I suppose. That metric is great at predicting next 12 months of net absorption and remains at a healthy level today.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. And the absolute vacancy rates today are just crazy low. I mean, like half of what they were in prior cycles at the peak of the market. So whether -- so we're talking about just so that we've got our cycles clear. Probably some of you on the call weren't even born then. But I'm talking about the early '80s oil crisis, the late '80s, early '90s, the SNL crisis, real estate crisis, the dot-com collapse in the early 2000s, the global financial crisis. Compared to all of those, first of all, I don't think we're looking at the same site of situation. And, certainly, we're not starting off a vacancy rate that starts with a 3. So I think it's crazy that we're even thinking about those situations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. Maybe shifting gears a little bit and thinking about asset values. It looks like you're going to ramp up your acquisitions in the back half of the year. I assume that means you're finding some interesting opportunities. Can you talk about how much you think cap rates have moved and how much do you think asset values have moved? And maybe what looks interesting to you that you're ramping up your outlook?\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. Good question. The fact of the matter is, we're not seeing that much, because just like any other market cycle when people see an inflection point, basically, transaction volume goes down. And buyers basically go and on deals that are in progress, try to get a price reduction. And oftentimes, they don't get it, and it just doesn't transact. So there is not a whole lot of visibility as to what values would -- are likely to be. I can also tell you that based on our appraisal, external appraisers have actually written up our values by 4% this past quarter.  Now are we going to believe that? No, because appraisals are backwards looking. So certainly, I think valuations are somewhat more muted, particularly because of the fraud is not there because of the typical leverage buyer having a harder time being the marginal buyer. Having said that, I think cap rates are likely to remain pretty strong. If you were going to sort of, give me a truth serum and say, where do you expect this to settle? I would say 10 to 25 basis points higher than where we saw it prior to the downturn. And that's on top of the 4% that people have written up. In other words, not from that level. If it's 100, I would say, going down 10 to 25 basis points in terms of value as opposed to going up by 4% on value. So Dan do you have anything to add to that?\nDan Letter: Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Jamie, six weeks ago at NAREIT, we talked about we were entering a period of price discovery. And I think at the time, we thought it would be 60 to 90 days before we started seeing some of those comps shake out and we're just not quite seeing it yet. Volumes are way down -- deal volumes are way down, and we're hearing of a number of renegotiations happening for deals that were tied up before, the headlines started to get ugly. So at this point, we'll see how it plays out, but this is in-sync with what we were thinking six weeks ago.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please proceed with your question. \nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. Good morning, Hamid. So just putting together some of the commentary around normalized customer behavior or at least proposals, how does that translate into your willingness to deploy capital on developments? So, on a combined basis, you and Duke are probably reaching close to $6 billion. Is that a sustainable level, given some of the things that you're seeing or how should we think about that changing?\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. Our development activity is always bottoms up deal by deal, leasing opportunity by leasing opportunity and remember, we're not developing in new markets. We're developing in place we -- where we have, I don't know, 20, 30, 40 in the case of Southern California, over 100 million square feet of activity that we're seeing on a day-to-day basis. So, there are bottoms up, they are not like we're building to a goal. It's not that at all.  But we are likely not going to be deploying the same amount of capital in development across the cycle. I think we're on the good side of the cycle. Where that will moderate? I don't know. But construction costs today are probably up 50%, land values are up significantly. So, the rents you need to get acceptable margins. And I mean land values at market, not land values at our cost because with our costs, we have significant margins.  Really make it tough to make some of the numbers work, particularly for a lot of our competitors that buy land just -- as just-in-time type of acquisition. So, I think that's a real limiter and governor on profitable development and we'll just see. But across a 10-year cycle, we're towards the high end of deployment levels today, for sure.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. Similar line of questioning, The yields you have on development starts increased to 6.1% this quarter, which is a pretty wide spread to your acquisition cap rates. But it was the cap rates -- or sorry, it was the acquisition guidance that you increased that to about -- starts. I was just wondering how easy it is to pull-forward some of the development opportunities earlier just given the increase in margins and development yields?\nTim Arndt: One thing I'll just highlight and maybe throw it over to Dan is just that the development yields you are looking at there while conservative would incorporate our view of rents at the time that the assets are stabilized and as the leasing is occurring, whereas acquisition cap rates are going to be reflecting current and in-place NOI. So, that's a pretty big gap in there to appreciate.\nDan Letter: And as it relates -- this is Dan. As it relates to how quickly we can pull-forward starts, we've got this land bank as a differentiator right now, right? We've got $2.5 billion worth of land on the balance sheet worth nearly double. So, this is land that's largely entitled and ready to go. So, that's really the beauty of our development business is that we can start and stop as we see the demand.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. The only thing I have to add is that implied in your question is that we think it's really important to pull-forward development. Again, it is not. We're not building to a particular budget or anything like that. So, if we see the market again bottoms up deal by deal, not being as strong as we wanted, we're just happy to sit and not develop in that market. Not to mention that the big portion of our developments are build-to-suit and lease. So, we know the economics going in.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Hi, good afternoon. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My question is on the near-term expected strength and how that evolves. Your same-store NOI guidance implies it remains at about 8.5% in the back half. Last year growth in the back half was about 200 basis points higher than the first half. So, can you talk about the contributing factors that allow you to achieve stable results despite the more difficult comparison, so accelerating results on the two-year stack and not asking for guidance here, but can you help marry that with when the impact from the expectation that conditions normalize? Like when can that start to weigh on some of the fundamental numbers that you report? Thank you.\nTim Arndt: Yes, it's Tim. I would say two things. One, the back half, and I think this we discussed last quarter is -- does not have the occupancy gains that we see in Q1 and Q2 that this year, same-store is enjoying in the back half, the occupancy gains driving same-store more muted and it's pretty much rent changed from there. I think to shift your question more to the long-term, I refer back to my comments for the script where you can look at our expiration schedule, you can use the lease mark-to-market. We've highlighted establish a market rent and look at the rents expiring in the remainder of this year, next year, 2024, et cetera. That's the point I made about computing easily 8% same-store growth enduring for many years to come. So, that's how I would use the data and then look at that resiliency.\nHamid Moghadam: By the way other than this cycle in the entire history of the company, the highest same-store number ever was 6.5% for the forward one year. So we -- I mean to have sort of 8% rental growth for multiple years, like five years, is just crazy good because the mark-to-markets are so high.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, just a quick one on Amazon. They talked about putting space back on the market. Maybe can you give us what's the update in terms of what you've seen in your portfolio and in the market in terms of space being put back and what you're hearing? Thanks.\nMike Curless: Hey, Ronald, this is Mike Curless. We've heard the same rumors out on the Street, the 10 million to 30 million square feet. None of it has been substantiated by Amazon. And what matters is what we're seeing on the ground and we're not seeing much at all. We had our national broker calls last week, literally heard about one space that's out there for sublease in the markets that we focus on. But more importantly, let's go to our portfolio of 132 spaces -- And early on, we had an inquiry on two out of 132, let me reemphasize just two. And early on, those got taken off the table. So we have zero in play. And I think if you're very familiar with our portfolio like we are, it should not be a surprise. Those are mission-critical facilities located in Europe. population centers. And to put a finer point on that, in the last 18 months, our retention rate in that set of spaces, Amazon has been 95%, 20 points higher than our company average at the same time And just take it at one step further. As we look to the future, we're 99% leased in the 36 markets, we're doing business with them. We have 54% in place to market, very favorable there. So I think we are very well positioned for anything that might come our way.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. The only thing I would add is that I didn't listen to the Amazon earnings call, but I got more questions about that one comment than comments from the entire industrial real estate industry, which is pretty consistent. So I guess if you have a market cap of over $1 trillion, people listen to you a lot more. But I think the single biggest miss for investors is that they read too much into that commentary. And the facts on the ground just don't support it. So that's all I have to say. And I'm prepared to be on the record for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Within the context and conversation about the lease negotiation period and decrease or, I guess, normalization and competition for space. Are you expecting some of the leading indicators you track to continue normalizing or softening a bit further as you look out over the next several quarters, or do you think that you might see conditions and underlying fundamentals stabilize at current levels, just a bit off the extreme peaks you discussed that you realized over the last few quarters?\nHamid Moghadam: I think if I were going to bet, of course, nobody knows is that I think that will normalize at a higher level than normal. But right now, I would say it's prudent to assume that will be slightly down, but better than most market cycles. So that's the way we're running our business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good morning. You mentioned that you saw transportation, healthcare and auto pickup in terms of mix of leasing. What's driving those sectors really pick up their activity? And would you expect them to continue to lead the mix over the next several quarters?\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. Here's what I would say generally. We have -- we lease about one million square feet a day, actually more than one million square feet a day. But as big as we are, once you start dividing the numbers into the markets we operate in and the economic sectors that we lease to, the one million square foot lease can move the numbers around radically in a quarter. And by the way, if you look at the same data from other companies, 100,000 square foot lease can really move their numbers around. So I wouldn't look at those statistics on a quarter-by-quarter basis. I think they're totally meaningless because of the law of smaller numbers. So the answer is, I don't know. But I don't think -- I wouldn't look to that for any kind of long-term assumptions on how to run our business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nVince Tibone: Hi, good morning. Have your expectations for supply completions in 2023 changed in recent months? Are you seeing any other players taking a pause from new that development starts due to macro concerns?\nChris Caton: Hi Vince, it's Chris Caton. Yes, our expectations have evolved a couple of ways. One is, first, for this calendar year, we have reduced it, not increased it based on the challenge of delivering product as Hamid described earlier and products basically getting stuck in the supply pipeline. We have also reduced our view for next year just as you surmise based on fluidity and the landscape and the rise in financial return of\u2026\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Carroll: Yeah. I just have a real quick question. I know the GAAP mark-to-market is about 56% today. Can you provide some color on what the cash mark-to-market is? I believe a few quarters ago, you highlighted was near 30%. Can you kind of highlight where that has trended?\nTim Arndt: Yeah, it's moving by the same delta roughly at the end of the quarter, it was 48%. You probably heard me say that's not a number I find very useful. I would focus on the net effective because that stat is heavily influenced by where you are with remaining lease terms. So it creates all kinds of problems interpreting it. And the net effective number that we gave you of about 56%. I think it's a better representative of what's going on in the economics and the leases and also better representative of what will go on in our earnings.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of with Nikita Bely with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nNikita Bely: Hi, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the institutional capital in your funds business? A, conversations you've had with them? And is there any change in the amount of capital that these folks are willing to put into your funds? And any color you could provide around that subject?\nHamid Moghadam: Sure. I would say similar to the fundamentals of our business, in the past couple of years, we've had more demand for our funds than we've chosen to take money for. In other words, we've turned down people who wanted to invest money in our funds because we had these really long queues, And it was irresponsible to take -- keep taking money when we have hard time deploying that volume of money. I would say that has shifted a bit. So demand for new products has shifted down. And on the margin, there is a little bit more of redemption requests. Well, a little bit more before it was zero, and now we have some redemption requests. All of this is reflective of what I call the denominator effect is that, their stock and bond portfolios are getting hammered, their private equity and venture portfolios are getting write-down. So basically, real estate generally is getting to be a larger percentage, and they have to rebalance. So -- and industrial is probably the best sector to rebalance out of, because that's where the liquidity and the market strength and the embedded gains have been in the last market cycle. So not at all surprising, but we still have plenty of private capital to run our business for a long, long time. And I think we have a great franchise in that area and one that has been really well tested in -- through three or four market cycles. And by the way, that's the same reason we've kept our leverage in that business so low, because when everybody is kind of levering up, the thing to do is to run your business unlevered. And if we see some great opportunities coming out of that cycle, our remaining powder is not just what we have in the queues that we talked about, but also the opportunity of levering up to the more normalized levels that those funds were designed to do. So I don't think capital is a constraint for us on the private side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nBill Crow: Good morning. Thanks. Within the context of the market rent growth that we're talking about and the Street expecting kind of four or five years' worth, are you seeing any markets where either sequentially or on a year-over-year basis market rents are starting to come down from their peaks?\nHamid Moghadam: Go ahead, Chris.\nChris Caton: Hi. It's Chris Caton. I ran through the regional differences and the pace of growth this year is, in fact, higher than last year. So all the US and those differentials, Europe as well is faster, not slower. So we are -- we have quite a bit of momentum. In terms of individual markets, we track our risk -- our supply risk markets. And that list has not appreciably changed over the past year. We are watchful of supply in a handful of markets, Dallas, Indianapolis and Phoenix. But we would not rate that supply as too much to damage rent growth, but it's -- those are a couple of markets we are watching.\nBill Crow: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDerek Johnston: Hi, everybody. Many companies like retail, they're reporting higher inventory levels and inventory-to-sales ratios are creeping up. So how is the inventory build demand driver that you guys discussed impacted last quarter's leasing? And are you seeing any delays now for this year or really in the opening, just to clarify, was that cautionary, given the macro? So any more insight as you were working to get our head around this emerging driver? Thanks a lot.\nChris Caton: Thanks, Derek. It's Chris Caton. Yes, indeed, Tim summarized our view, and we do think it's -- in his script, and we think it's appropriate to be prudent in macro. In fact, we're getting a lot of questions on this, just as you're asking. So, we're going to publish a paper this week on this very topic. Look, summary is the buildup of real inventories for resilience is really only half done and it\u2019s progressing -- it's progressing with our view.  Now notwithstanding some of that excess inventory for some retailers for some products, which you just described, the broader landscape has continued to focus on raising inventory levels, reducing stock outs and reintroducing product variety. As it relates to leasing, we are seeing it in the marketplace now for resilience. I'll just give you the basic numbers, trend demand growth in our 30 markets is roughly 200 million to 225 million square feet per year, and we are running at a pace of 300 million square feet per year.  So, we have indeed seen quite a bit of growth in excess of -- excuse me, it's 400 million, so 300 million realized over the last 18 months. So, we've begun to realize some of these structural drivers, but more is in front of us than has been realized.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. I would say this is the second worst understood point about our business. I think I would put Amazon first and I would put a level of inventory second, that's why we've chosen to put out this paper, and I just invite you to get into the nuances. These kinds of numbers, particularly ratio type numbers, can be very misleading, if you don't parse them out. For example, whether you include autos or non-autos or general merchandise or non-general merchandise, you'll see those conclusions to be radically different.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Yulico: Thanks. I just had a couple of questions here on page four, where you give the leading indicators. I guess on lease proposals, I just want to see what you would attribute to that number having coming down? Is that just now finally realizing the Amazon effect removing them from the market? I mean lease proposals look like they're down 10%, 15% versus your year average.  And then on the IBI activity index, I just want to also make sure in terms of the -- what you're serving people about, is that really looking forward on space demand, or is it more of a \u2013 I mean the chart looks like it's almost more of a coincidental indicator rather than much of a leading indicator if you look at the last sort of two recessions and how it played out?\nHamid Moghadam: All I can tell you is that, it's hard to increase lease proposals when you have less space to rent. We only have 2% vacancy. So, the metric that you should think about is the one that we mentioned in the script, which is that, we are 52% on our vacancy at this point in the cycle, which is by far higher than the normal point in the cycle in terms of pre-leasing or re-leasing of our vacancies. These are proposals by the way.\nChris Caton: Yes. And as it relates to the IBI, which you asked, we find it to be more closely correlated with next 12-month absorption than any other economic indicator.\nOperator: Thanks. The next question comes from the line of Dave Rogers with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nDave Rogers: Yes, thanks. Given the comments you made earlier, just about the price discovery in the market. Curious about your thoughts around asset sales dispositions, you didn't update guidance, but should we anticipate that, that pushes later into the year? And then maybe more broadly, as you bring Duke on board, not a question about them, but about you, that effective transaction as a deleveraging event, it seems for you guys. So, do you run leverage back up as a company? Are you comfortable you are? Do you run lower kind of in the future and trying to think about asset sales and recycling going forward?\nHamid Moghadam: Yes, pretty hard to run leverage any lower than where we are, But we're not conscious with thinking of leveraging up. And the fact that the combination will actually improve or reduce our leverage is totally coincidental. We're not doing the deal to reduce our leverage. Our leverage is pretty low. So, I would say our leverage is probably much lower than it's likely to be across the cycle. But again, that's opportunity driven, not sort of top-down driven. Tim, anything else?\nTim Arndt: No, I fully agree on how we view that transaction. And then with regard to dispo timing, nothing has really changed in our forecast. The holding of our guidance reflects our original view. There's always puts and takes on which quarter, some things will land in and what the right mix of assets are going to be, but we're good with our guidance.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. Let me just give you an example of dispo guidance. We had a portfolio that we had on the market, nothing to -- obviously, with Duke. And the buyer came back for a price discount. And we basically told them, they can take a hike. The same thing happened in the week that the world shutdown because of COVID. A buyer came in, they were way down the road on the acquisition, and they came back, this is two years ago, for a price discount, okay? And we told them to go away. They came back a year and a half later, and they paid 15% more than they had the deal tied up on. So, 20% more than where they were trying to drive the price that. I'm not saying the same thing will happen, but I'm just saying, look, at the end of the day, no level of disposition or acquisition or development is going to affect the company that's of this scale and diversity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Bilerman: Hey. I mean, just staying with sort of the investment market, I just wanted to get some of your views, thinking about it more so from an IRR perspective than a cap rate, just given how large the mark-to-market today in various assets, talking about a spot cap rate sometimes leads to different conclusions? And so I'd be curious of your view how you're approaching it from an IRR basis, either on a five or seven-year basis and how you're thinking about the required return, but also how you're seeing the usual investor change perhaps their view overall on underwriting?\nHamid Moghadam: Third, at least well understood point. And you make a great point. What does the spot cap rate mean if your mark-to-market is 50 basis points. If you're investing in apartments, you're there is no mark-to-market. So, the cap rate is the cap rate. But the fact that you have that built-in mark-to-market, just as your question suggests, that alone would drive cap rates way down. So, I think the IRR is a much better measure of return requirements. And I would say, a quarter ago, we were seeing transactions go down in the low five unleveraged IRRs, which is the way we like to look at it. By the way, we're investing at those kinds of returns. But they were literally low five IRRs with an average, I would say, rent growth forecast a market rent growth forecast of probably 3%, okay? Today, I would say the discount rates that people are likely to look at are going to have a six in front of them, low 6s. But the rental growth forecast, even with the same 3% market rent forecast is going to be substantially higher than before because the mark-to-markets have expanded. So the lease mark-to-market of 3% is on top of the mark-to-market. So the total lease growth rate is increasing. So I'm not sure the cap rates are going to move around that much because of the mark-to-market issue. I think what's going to happen is most people don't get that. So they're going to pause a bit on volume of deployment. But any time anybody wants to bring a good deal in one of our markets at -- with 50% mark-to-market at the kind of cap rates that we saw maybe three quarters ago, our number is one 800 Prologis. We'd like to buy as much of that stuff as we can because I think to invest in that with that mark-to-market, -- and that level of discount to replacement costs is our dream come true, and our leveraged friends can't do that. So it's a great environment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Jamie Feldman with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. I mean I don't know if you can quantify this or not, but when you think about your leasing pipeline, the proposals you've mentioned, 52% of remaining vacancies. Can you break that out by how much you think that is \u2013 how much of that do you think is recession-sensitive versus not? So I guess I'm asking, when you think about if they're really trying to get supply chain resilience and all the secular trends we're talking about, how much of the leasing pipeline would just power through that versus take a pause if we do, in fact, have a mild recession as a later calling for?\nHamid Moghadam: Jamie, it would be pure speculation. I have no idea is a personal answer. First of all, I'm not sure we're going to have a recession. Secondly, I have no idea if we have a recession, how deep or extended it will be? I'm not sure even what the definition of the recession is anymore because when got not just committee deciding whether we're in a recession or not, and they usually declare it a couple of quarters after it happens. So the answer is, I have no clue. That's the honest answer. Okay. That was the last question. Really appreciate your interest and look forward in our continued dialogue. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and logoff your computers. Thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Hey, Ronald, this is Mike Curless. We've heard the same rumors out on the Street, the 10 million to 30 million square feet. None of it has been substantiated by Amazon. And what matters is what we're seeing on the ground and we're not seeing much at all. We had our national broker calls last week, literally heard about one space that's out there for sublease in the markets that we focus on. But more importantly, let's go to our portfolio of 132 spaces -- And early on, we had an inquiry on two out of 132, let me reemphasize just two. And early on, those got taken off the table. So we have zero in play. And I think if you're very familiar with our portfolio like we are, it should not be a surprise. Those are mission-critical facilities located in Europe. population centers. And to put a finer point on that, in the last 18 months, our retention rate in that set of spaces, Amazon has been 95%, 20 points higher than our company average at the same time And just take it at one step further. As we look to the future, we're 99% leased in the 36 markets, we're doing business with them. We have 54% in place to market, very favorable there. So I think we are very well positioned for anything that might come our way."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tim Arndt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. This morning, we reported our second quarter results, which were strong and ahead of our expectations with occupancy, leasing and rent change all at record highs. Duke also released their operating results this morning, which tell a similarly strong story. That said, the macroeconomic environment is making it difficult for investors to fully assess the state of our industry. There's frankly a stark difference between what one reads in headlines versus what is actually happening in our business. Accordingly, we find ourselves focusing more on our own proprietary metrics and real-time feedback from our customers to build a forward-looking view of our markets and demand. Before going through that view, let me first step through our results. Core FFO, with and without promotes, was $1.11 per share, slightly ahead of our forecast. Rent change on rollover was 46%, led by the US at 54%. Retention in the quarter was 79%, driving occupancy higher by 30 basis points over the quarter to 97.7%. All of this led to net effective same-store NOI growth of 7.6% and cash same-store of 8.2%. We started $1.7 billion in new development projects, bringing our year-to-date starts to $2.7 billion. On the balance sheet, we closed on a refinancing of our lines of credit, expanding the total commitment to $5.4 billion, ending the quarter with $5.2 billion of liquidity. We are very pleased to have not only increased our line capacity, but also to have done so while maintaining our spread and staggering maturities. In strategic capital, our net equity queue, which combines the committed queue less outstanding redemptions and deployment, it was $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter. While performance in the second quarter was strong, we recognize that with the current backdrop, markets do have the potential to soften. Instead of repeating macroeconomic statistics from media headlines, which you all know well, I'll instead share observations from our unique data and insights. At quarter end, we had proposals on 52% of our remaining availabilities versus an average of 38% prior to COVID, reflective of the very active dialogue we've had and the fact that little space remains available to lease in our portfolio, 71% of leases expiring in the next 12 months are either preleased or in negotiations, ahead of the pre-COVID average of 56%.  Lease negotiation periods have lengthened by a few days to an average of 60, while up from the more rapid pace of 50 days across 2021, it has essentially returned to the normalized levels we saw pre-COVID. And as it relates to pricing, our Sphere data which measures normalized effective rents against forecast, reflects that, markets remain strong and rent growth stays ahead of our expectations.  Our field teams report market activity, which is totally consistent with all of this data. While the number of customers competing for available space has decreased from unprecedented levels tempering urgency, our teams report still healthy demand and limited downtime. This is also reflected in our monthly customer survey data, which report high historical utilization at 86% and an IBI index that reflects growth in activity.  In the end, we believe we're seeing a normalization in the volume and pace of demand which we expected as the world reopened from COVID and consumers seek more in-person experiences. But given exceptionally tight markets and availability, the fundamentals remain excellent. E-commerce represented 14% of new leasing, down from approximately 25% in 2021, a shift we've long telegraphed.  As noted, overall occupancy and leasing have continued to grow with take-up coming from a broad set of users, most notably transportation, healthcare and auto. E-commerce remains a positive long-term trend for our business. Clearly, COVID accelerated its adoption from a 15% share, retail sales pre-pandemic and running at 23% during, at 21% today, it is roughly 150 basis points ahead of our pre-COVID expectations.  We are also seeing the emergence of supply chain resiliency as a secular and incremental demand driver for our business. We hear it from our customers both in daily dialogue, as well as our advisory boards, including three events held this quarter. We expect that this need for safety stock will lift demand for years to come, although economic uncertainty could cause some delay this year.  In light of very low vacancy and healthy demand, we are increasing our overall market rent growth forecast for the year to 23% on a global basis and 25% in the US. This is due to a very strong first half where we see rents having increased 14% globally and 16% in the US. We continue to see increases in construction costs which provide a pricing umbrella for continued rent growth given the need to uphold expected yields before new spec development can be started.  The increase in rents over the second quarter has expanded our lease mark-to-market to nearly 56%, translating to over $2 billion of embedded annual NOI as these leases roll. Applying this mark-to-market to our lease expiration schedule will show that net effective same-store NOI growth through 2025 should exceed 8% without any further increases in market rent, an incredible amount of built-in organic growth and resiliency in our earnings.  Before turning to guidance, we expect to imminently file the S-4 related to our acquisition of Duke Realty, which will guide the timing of our shareholder votes and the close date of the transaction. The [filing] (ph) guidance excludes the deal's expected accretion. Beginning with operating guidance, we expect average occupancy to range between 97.25% to 97.75%, an increase of nearly 40 basis points from our prior guidance. We are increasing our net effective same-store guidance to a range of 7.25% to 7.75% and cash same-store to a range of 8.25% to 8.75%, each an increase of roughly 90 basis points. Rent change on rollover is expected to grow from our first half levels, increasing spreads to over 50% in each the third and fourth quarters. Given our view of market rent growth, we expect our portfolio's lease mark-to-market will expand to over 60% by the end of the year. We are holding our guidance for net promotes at $0.60 for the year. Our current appraised values would generate net promote income above this level, but given market uncertainty, we're holding our prior guidance. Our overall deployment guidance is unchanged from last quarter with the exception of acquisitions, which we have increased to $1.2 billion to $1.7 billion at our share based on our belief that opportunities are likely to emerge in the back half, which will be well-positioned to pursue. I'm also pleased to note that despite extraordinary moves in both interest rates and FX, our forecast remains unimpacted due to our proactive approach to managing both risks through limited maturities and robust FX hedging program. In total, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance to $5.14 to $5.18 per share, including promotes and $4.54 to $4.58 per share excluding promotes, representing 11.5% growth from 2021. Before closing, I'd like to spend just a few minutes highlighting one of the more important announcements we've made in recent years. Last month, we announced a new commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2040, a full decade ahead of the targets established in the Paris Climate Agreement. Our plan includes key milestones along the way, such as a dramatic increase in our solar energy production and storage goal to 1 gigawatt by 2025, more than doubling our previous goal. We will also conduct carbon-neutral operations and construction by 2025. Ultimately, we plan to get to net zero without reliance on carbon offsets and our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and net zero in our entire value chain by 2040. It's noteworthy that we are one of very few REITs to commit to science-based targets for our Net Zero goal. Prologis has long been a leader in ESG, both inside and outside of our industry. We're extremely pleased to have once again raised the bar and hold ourselves accountable to real, measurable, and reportable progress for our investors, our customers, and our planet. We truly feel great about our business and how we've positioned our teams, our portfolio and our balance sheet to thrive across the cycle even in uncertain times as we see today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our operator to take your questions. As a reminder, we won't be addressing questions related to the Duke transaction on this morning's call. Yes, I can take the second part. We actually really don't break the number down in that way. We have full year same-store guidance. As noted, with a midpoint of -- it's at 7.5% to -- yes, sorry, 7.5%. And the growth in the back half is probably adding $0.01 to $0.02 of the run rate that you'll see in Q3 and Q4. Yes. Thanks, Tom. Basically, the 52% we measured this last quarter is the strongest it's been. It has accelerated from that pre-COVID number that we quoted of 38%, lifted up into the 40s through COVID and has now hit what I think is an all-time high. And Chris, maybe you can pick up the past cycles? One thing I'll just highlight and maybe throw it over to Dan is just that the development yields you are looking at there while conservative would incorporate our view of rents at the time that the assets are stabilized and as the leasing is occurring, whereas acquisition cap rates are going to be reflecting current and in-place NOI. So, that's a pretty big gap in there to appreciate. Yes, it's Tim. I would say two things. One, the back half, and I think this we discussed last quarter is -- does not have the occupancy gains that we see in Q1 and Q2 that this year, same-store is enjoying in the back half, the occupancy gains driving same-store more muted and it's pretty much rent changed from there. I think to shift your question more to the long-term, I refer back to my comments for the script where you can look at our expiration schedule, you can use the lease mark-to-market. We've highlighted establish a market rent and look at the rents expiring in the remainder of this year, next year, 2024, et cetera. That's the point I made about computing easily 8% same-store growth enduring for many years to come. So, that's how I would use the data and then look at that resiliency. Yeah, it's moving by the same delta roughly at the end of the quarter, it was 48%. You probably heard me say that's not a number I find very useful. I would focus on the net effective because that stat is heavily influenced by where you are with remaining lease terms. So it creates all kinds of problems interpreting it. And the net effective number that we gave you of about 56%. I think it's a better representative of what's going on in the economics and the leases and also better representative of what will go on in our earnings. No, I fully agree on how we view that transaction. And then with regard to dispo timing, nothing has really changed in our forecast. The holding of our guidance reflects our original view. There's always puts and takes on which quarter, some things will land in and what the right mix of assets are going to be, but we're good with our guidance."

            "name": "Chris Caton",
            "content": "Yeah. Let's be clear. And indeed, we publish our data quarterly to try and help bring clarity to the marketplace. And what does that data reveal? Well, we forecast 375 million square feet of net absorption and completions this year, calendar year 2022, and see vacancy rate falling to 3.2%. Now our statistics focus on our 30 US markets and is based on the leading source in each market. Now we could look out to 2023. It's a little early, but we foresee a gap, say, 50 million to 100 million square feet in differential between supply and demand. That would lead to a moderate rise in market vacancies, but they would remain below 4%, which is well below the pre-pandemic and historical averages. Now what we're seeing when we look at market commentary is that sources -- some sources are using unconventional methodologies and also include additional non-Prologis markets. So, for example, the next 20 US markets, places like Memphis, St. Louis, Detroit, have a market vacancy rate that's roughly one percentage point higher in our markets and do have a supply/demand imbalance with 126 million square feet under construction versus trailing 12-month net absorption of 88 million square feet. Yeah. I would add, look, the US has been a market leader, especially on the coast with rent growth meaningfully outperform lower barrier markets. We're talking about 10 to 15 percentage annual rent growth, its better on the coast. And outside the US, whether it's Europe, whether it's the UK, whether it's Toronto, whether it's Mexico, vacancy rates are below 2.5%, and we're seeing some of the best market rent growth we've ever seen. Yes. So, I'd start by saying some of these insights are based on our investments in data that are unavailable elsewhere in real estate and uniquely available in this cycle. One metric that we invented in the last cycle was the IBI by way of a preview or by way of retrospective, I suppose. That metric is great at predicting next 12 months of net absorption and remains at a healthy level today. Hi Vince, it's Chris Caton. Yes, our expectations have evolved a couple of ways. One is, first, for this calendar year, we have reduced it, not increased it based on the challenge of delivering product as Hamid described earlier and products basically getting stuck in the supply pipeline. We have also reduced our view for next year just as you surmise based on fluidity and the landscape and the rise in financial return of... Hi. It's Chris Caton. I ran through the regional differences and the pace of growth this year is, in fact, higher than last year. So all the US and those differentials, Europe as well is faster, not slower. So we are -- we have quite a bit of momentum. In terms of individual markets, we track our risk -- our supply risk markets. And that list has not appreciably changed over the past year. We are watchful of supply in a handful of markets, Dallas, Indianapolis and Phoenix. But we would not rate that supply as too much to damage rent growth, but it's -- those are a couple of markets we are watching. Thanks, Derek. It's Chris Caton. Yes, indeed, Tim summarized our view, and we do think it's -- in his script, and we think it's appropriate to be prudent in macro. In fact, we're getting a lot of questions on this, just as you're asking. So, we're going to publish a paper this week on this very topic.

As it relates to leasing, we are seeing it in the marketplace now for resilience. I'll just give you the basic numbers, trend demand growth in our 30 markets is roughly 200 million to 225 million square feet per year, and we are running at a pace of 300 million square feet per year.  So, we have indeed seen quite a bit of growth in excess of -- excuse me, it's 400 million, so 300 million realized over the last 18 months. So, we've begun to realize some of these structural drivers, but more is in front of us than has been realized. Yes. And as it relates to the IBI, which you asked, we find it to be more closely correlated with next 12-month absorption than any other economic indicator."

And I think at the time, we thought it would be 60 to 90 days before we started seeing some of those comps shake out and we're just not quite seeing it yet. Volumes are way down -- deal volumes are way down, and we're hearing of a number of renegotiations happening for deals that were tied up before, the headlines started to get ugly. So at this point, we'll see how it plays out, but this is in-sync with what we were thinking six weeks ago. And as it relates -- this is Dan. As it relates to how quickly we can pull-forward starts, we've got this land bank as a differentiator right now, right? We've got $2.5 billion worth of land on the balance sheet worth nearly double.

            "content": "Yes. And we didn't really hear -- I didn't really hear the first half of the question. Can you repeat that, please? Yes. So there is the much talked about risk to supply exceeding demand. And there's a fair amount of confusion between the supply and demand balance in the overall US industrial market and the markets that we are involved in. And I'll turn it over to Chris to actually walk you through that because that's a pretty important distinction, and I really don't think there is a risk to supply, particularly given the low vacancy rates from which we are operating today. But let's bookmark that, and Chris will talk about that. On the demand side, the way I think about it is that I've been doing this for 40 years. And I would say, prior to last quarter and the quarter before, let's call the peak in terms of strength of market on the demand side as a 10 on a one to 10 scale. I think the last quarter and the quarter before were like on 12 or 13. They were just crazy good. And I think this quarter, there may be 9.5 to 10. I mean by historical standards, this would be exceptionally good. I mean in the 5 percentile good for the last 40 years. It just -- it can never be as good as it was in the last quarter and the quarter before because, frankly, everybody reads the same papers. And if you're a CEO of a company and you're looking to expand your operations, you're going to just take your time a little bit more, just to be sure that you're not making a stupid mistake. So the difference between sort of grabbing every piece of the space that you can see, which may push demand 10%, 20% above what is really needed, probably in an environment like this could haven't been conservative by 10% to 20%. And that swing is basically coming out of the froth that we saw in the last two quarters. So that's the way I think about it. But Chris can give you the supply/demand numbers because there's a lot of misunderstanding on those factors. Yeah. The other thing that's going on, and we're probably over-killing this response, but I think it's probably the single biggest area where we get questions on. Construction has not only become expensive, but also construction periods have been really stretched out because of limited availability of certain components. And by the way, we've been really good about ordering that stuff ahead of time. I'm talking about the market, not our situation in particular. So an extended construction period will make the pipeline of supply sound bigger. So if you're having a third longer construction period, which is what we're estimating, with the same amount of supply, the numbers will just be one-third bigger. That's just math. So again, a lot of confusion about this issue. And I think it's a single biggest disconnect between investor perceptions and the reality on the ground. Well, let me give you the general commentary on Europe. Europe is as good as I remember Europe being because actually, the war and the excess population that's come out of Ukraine and in Central -- in the neighboring countries have actually increased demand and led to actually better market dynamics for unfortunate and tragic reasons, but it simply has. I would say the UK has slowed down a bit given what's going on with the politics. But Europe is generally a more muted market than the US, both on the supply and on the demand side. And that's why we're showing lower rental growth rate for Europe compared to the US. So that's not that unusual in terms of its historical relationship. Chris, do you have anything to add to that? Yes. And the absolute vacancy rates today are just crazy low. I mean, like half of what they were in prior cycles at the peak of the market. So whether -- so we're talking about just so that we've got our cycles clear. Probably some of you on the call weren't even born then. But I'm talking about the early '80s oil crisis, the late '80s, early '90s, the SNL crisis, real estate crisis, the dot-com collapse in the early 2000s, the global financial crisis. Compared to all of those, first of all, I don't think we're looking at the same site of situation. And, certainly, we're not starting off a vacancy rate that starts with a 3. So I think it's crazy that we're even thinking about those situations. Yes. Good question. The fact of the matter is, we're not seeing that much, because just like any other market cycle when people see an inflection point, basically, transaction volume goes down. And buyers basically go and on deals that are in progress, try to get a price reduction. And oftentimes, they don't get it, and it just doesn't transact. So there is not a whole lot of visibility as to what values would -- are likely to be. I can also tell you that based on our appraisal, external appraisers have actually written up our values by 4% this past quarter.  Now are we going to believe that? No, because appraisals are backwards looking. So certainly, I think valuations are somewhat more muted, particularly because of the fraud is not there because of the typical leverage buyer having a harder time being the marginal buyer. Having said that, I think cap rates are likely to remain pretty strong. If you were going to sort of, give me a truth serum and say, where do you expect this to settle? I would say 10 to 25 basis points higher than where we saw it prior to the downturn. And that's on top of the 4% that people have written up. In other words, not from that level. If it's 100, I would say, going down 10 to 25 basis points in terms of value as opposed to going up by 4% on value. So Dan do you have anything to add to that? Yes. Our development activity is always bottoms up deal by deal, leasing opportunity by leasing opportunity and remember, we're not developing in new markets. We're developing in place we -- where we have, I don't know, 20, 30, 40 in the case of Southern California, over 100 million square feet of activity that we're seeing on a day-to-day basis. So, there are bottoms up, they are not like we're building to a goal. It's not that at all.  But we are likely not going to be deploying the same amount of capital in development across the cycle. I think we're on the good side of the cycle. Where that will moderate? I don't know. But construction costs today are probably up 50%, land values are up significantly. So, the rents you need to get acceptable margins. And I mean land values at market, not land values at our cost because with our costs, we have significant margins.  Really make it tough to make some of the numbers work, particularly for a lot of our competitors that buy land just -- as just-in-time type of acquisition. So, I think that's a real limiter and governor on profitable development and we'll just see. But across a 10-year cycle, we're towards the high end of deployment levels today, for sure. Yes. The only thing I have to add is that implied in your question is that we think it's really important to pull-forward development. Again, it is not. We're not building to a particular budget or anything like that. So, if we see the market again bottoms up deal by deal, not being as strong as we wanted, we're just happy to sit and not develop in that market. Not to mention that the big portion of our developments are build-to-suit and lease. So, we know the economics going in. By the way other than this cycle in the entire history of the company, the highest same-store number ever was 6.5% for the forward one year. So we -- I mean to have sort of 8% rental growth for multiple years, like five years, is just crazy good because the mark-to-markets are so high. Yes. The only thing I would add is that I didn't listen to the Amazon earnings call, but I got more questions about that one comment than comments from the entire industrial real estate industry, which is pretty consistent. So I guess if you have a market cap of over $1 trillion, people listen to you a lot more. But I think the single biggest miss for investors is that they read too much into that commentary. And the facts on the ground just don't support it. So that's all I have to say. And I'm prepared to be on the record for that. I think if I were going to bet, of course, nobody knows is that I think that will normalize at a higher level than normal. But right now, I would say it's prudent to assume that will be slightly down, but better than most market cycles. So that's the way we're running our business. Yeah. Here's what I would say generally. We have -- we lease about one million square feet a day, actually more than one million square feet a day. But as big as we are, once you start dividing the numbers into the markets we operate in and the economic sectors that we lease to, the one million square foot lease can move the numbers around radically in a quarter. And by the way, if you look at the same data from other companies, 100,000 square foot lease can really move their numbers around. So I wouldn't look at those statistics on a quarter-by-quarter basis. I think they're totally meaningless because of the law of smaller numbers. So the answer is, I don't know. But I don't think -- I wouldn't look to that for any kind of long-term assumptions on how to run our business. Sure. I would say similar to the fundamentals of our business, in the past couple of years, we've had more demand for our funds than we've chosen to take money for. In other words, we've turned down people who wanted to invest money in our funds because we had these really long queues, And it was irresponsible to take -- keep taking money when we have hard time deploying that volume of money. I would say that has shifted a bit. So demand for new products has shifted down. And on the margin, there is a little bit more of redemption requests. Well, a little bit more before it was zero, and now we have some redemption requests. All of this is reflective of what I call the denominator effect is that, their stock and bond portfolios are getting hammered, their private equity and venture portfolios are getting write-down. So basically, real estate generally is getting to be a larger percentage, and they have to rebalance. So -- and industrial is probably the best sector to rebalance out of, because that's where the liquidity and the market strength and the embedded gains have been in the last market cycle. So not at all surprising, but we still have plenty of private capital to run our business for a long, long time. And I think we have a great franchise in that area and one that has been really well tested in -- through three or four market cycles. And by the way, that's the same reason we've kept our leverage in that business so low, because when everybody is kind of levering up, the thing to do is to run your business unlevered. And if we see some great opportunities coming out of that cycle, our remaining powder is not just what we have in the queues that we talked about, but also the opportunity of levering up to the more normalized levels that those funds were designed to do. So I don't think capital is a constraint for us on the private side. Go ahead, Chris. Yes. I would say this is the second worst understood point about our business. I think I would put Amazon first and I would put a level of inventory second, that's why we've chosen to put out this paper, and I just invite you to get into the nuances. These kinds of numbers, particularly ratio type numbers, can be very misleading, if you don't parse them out. For example, whether you include autos or non-autos or general merchandise or non-general merchandise, you'll see those conclusions to be radically different. All I can tell you is that, it's hard to increase lease proposals when you have less space to rent. We only have 2% vacancy. So, the metric that you should think about is the one that we mentioned in the script, which is that, we are 52% on our vacancy at this point in the cycle, which is by far higher than the normal point in the cycle in terms of pre-leasing or re-leasing of our vacancies. These are proposals by the way. Yes, pretty hard to run leverage any lower than where we are, But we're not conscious with thinking of leveraging up. And the fact that the combination will actually improve or reduce our leverage is totally coincidental. We're not doing the deal to reduce our leverage. Our leverage is pretty low. So, I would say our leverage is probably much lower than it's likely to be across the cycle. But again, that's opportunity driven, not sort of top-down driven. Tim, anything else? Yes. Let me just give you an example of dispo guidance. We had a portfolio that we had on the market, nothing to -- obviously, with Duke. And the buyer came back for a price discount. And we basically told them, they can take a hike. The same thing happened in the week that the world shutdown because of COVID. A buyer came in, they were way down the road on the acquisition, and they came back, this is two years ago, for a price discount, okay? And we told them to go away. They came back a year and a half later, and they paid 15% more than they had the deal tied up on. So, 20% more than where they were trying to drive the price that. I'm not saying the same thing will happen, but I'm just saying, look, at the end of the day, no level of disposition or acquisition or development is going to affect the company that's of this scale and diversity. Third, at least well understood point. And you make a great point. What does the spot cap rate mean if your mark-to-market is 50 basis points. If you're investing in apartments, you're there is no mark-to-market. So, the cap rate is the cap rate. But the fact that you have that built-in mark-to-market, just as your question suggests, that alone would drive cap rates way down. So, I think the IRR is a much better measure of return requirements. And I would say, a quarter ago, we were seeing transactions go down in the low five unleveraged IRRs, which is the way we like to look at it. By the way, we're investing at those kinds of returns. But they were literally low five IRRs with an average, I would say, rent growth forecast a market rent growth forecast of probably 3%, okay? Today, I would say the discount rates that people are likely to look at are going to have a six in front of them, low 6s. But the rental growth forecast, even with the same 3% market rent forecast is going to be substantially higher than before because the mark-to-markets have expanded. So the lease mark-to-market of 3% is on top of the mark-to-market. So the total lease growth rate is increasing. So I'm not sure the cap rates are going to move around that much because of the mark-to-market issue. I think what's going to happen is most people don't get that. So they're going to pause a bit on volume of deployment. But any time anybody wants to bring a good deal in one of our markets at -- with 50% mark-to-market at the kind of cap rates that we saw maybe three quarters ago, our number is one 800 Prologis. We'd like to buy as much of that stuff as we can because I think to invest in that with that mark-to-market, -- and that level of discount to replacement costs is our dream come true, and our leveraged friends can't do that. So it's a great environment. Jamie, it would be pure speculation. I have no idea is a personal answer. First of all, I'm not sure we're going to have a recession. Secondly, I have no idea if we have a recession, how deep or extended it will be? I'm not sure even what the definition of the recession is anymore because when got not just committee deciding whether we're in a recession or not, and they usually declare it a couple of quarters after it happens. So the answer is, I have no clue. That's the honest answer. Okay. That was the last question. Really appreciate your interest and look forward in our continued dialogue. Take care."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Ron Hubbard. Please go ahead, sir.\nRon Hubbard: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Jim Connor, Chairman and CEO; Mark Denien, Chief Financial Officer; Steve Schnur, Chief Operating Officer; and Nick Anthony, Chief Investment Officer. Before we make our prepared remarks, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These risks and other factors could adversely affect our business and future results. For more information about those risk factors, we would refer you to our 10-K or 10-Q that we have on file with the SEC and the company's other SEC filings. All forward-looking statements speak only as of today, April 28, 2022, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. A reconciliation to GAAP of the non-GAAP financial measures that we provide in this call is included in our earnings release. Our earnings release and supplemental package were distributed last night after the market closed. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at dukerealty.com. You can also find our earnings release, supplemental package, SEC reports and an audio webcast of this call in the Investor Relations section of our website. Now for our prepared statement, I will turn it over to Jim Connor.\nJim Connor: Thanks, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. The fundamentals of our business continue to be at all-time record levels. We achieved record high occupancy levels in both our stabilized in-service and total in-service portfolio, record rent growth on a cash and GAAP basis, our development platform had nearly $340 million of development starts, our Coastal Tier 1 exposure is approaching 50%, our portfolio mark-to-market increased to 48%. All of these factors contributed to raising key components of our 2022 guidance, including over 10% growth in FFO, 11% growth in AFFO at the midpoint. Now let me turn it over to Steve to cover some of the market fundamentals and our operations.\nSteve Schnur: Thanks, Jim. On the fundamental side, first quarter demand was 95 million square feet, making it 5 of the last 6 quarters of demand in the 100 million square foot or greater range. First quarter deliveries were about 85 million square feet with the vacancy rate at quarter end remaining near record lows all-time at 3.1%. Taking the record low vacancy rate of near 3%, coupled with an expected positive demand supply gap again this year, we have revised our 2022 rent growth forecast for our markets from the 10% to 15% range to the high teens to low 20% range. On the long-term demand side, CBRE recently affirmed its outlook for 1.4 billion square feet of demand through 2026 with no periods of negative net absorption through 2032. Although we are paying close attention to headline data such as inflation, fuel and labor costs and a resurgence in bottlenecks occurring in some Asian ports, we have yet to see an impact to demand in our portfolio. Based on recent dialogues with our customers, RFPs to lease space and the most recent logistics manager index at record levels, the near-term outlook is as strong as it has been in this cycle. Long term, we believe the secular themes for greater inventory resiliency, and e-commerce are still very much intact and should continue to drive short-term and long-term demand. Turning to our own portfolio. We continue to see these positive indicators, evidenced by 62 leases executed during the quarter totaling over 7.7 million square feet. Demand was broad-based across categories with a number of leases between 250,000 and 850,000 square feet with customers such as FedEx, Samsung, Walgreens, Cardinal Health, International Paper, Sealy Mattress, some major 3PLs and a global e-commerce customer. Of note, we had only 2 spaces greater than 100,000 square feet in our in-service portfolio available at the end of the first quarter. And I'm happy and pleased to report that both are now leased. Our lease activity for the quarter, combined with the strong fundamentals I discussed, led to continued growth in rents on second-generation leases of 29% cash and 49% GAAP, both records. I'd also point out that only 18% of this lease activity was in coastal markets. Across our entire in-service portfolio, the portfolio leased mark-to-market is now 48% on a GAAP basis. We believe this presents strong visibility for significant rent growth for the foreseeable future. We finished the quarter with the total in-service portfolio 99.1% leased and the stabilized portfolio 99.4% leased, again, both all-time records. On the development front, we had a tremendous first quarter starts, breaking ground on 8 speculative projects totaling $339 million in cost. All of these projects are in well-located submarkets. Our confidence in leasing speculative space continues to be very strong, as evidence of the 5.6 million square feet of speculative developments placed in service over the past year. Those projects were originally 3% leased at the start and are now 100% leased. Our development pipeline at quarter end totaled $1.64 billion with 63% allocated to Coastal Tier 1 markets and 85% allocated to overall Tier 1 markets. This pipeline is 52% preleased, and we expect to generate value creation margins over 70%. Looking forward, our pipeline for future development starts is very strong. Our land balance at quarter end totaled $582 million with an additional $235 million uncovered land. 93% of this land bank is located in Coastal Tier 1 markets. Coupled with the land options we have, another land in our operating portfolio, we can support our current level of annual starts for the next 3 years. It is also important to note for modeling NAV that the market value of the land we own is about 2x our book basis and, on average, we've only owned this land for about 1 year. With the fundamentals I outlined and our best-in-class local operating teams, our outlook for new development starts as strong. This is reflected by our revised guidance, up about 20% from our original midpoint. I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover acquisitions and dispositions.\nNick Anthony: Thanks, Steve. I'll start with dispositions. As noted on the last call, earlier this quarter, we contributed to the third tranche of Amazon access to our joint venture with CBRE Investment Management, for which our share of the proceeds was $269 million. Coupled with the outright sale of another Amazon facility in Tampa, dispositions totaled $325 million for the quarter. As a result, our Amazon exposure was 5.7% at the end of the quarter. Given the strong prices for logistics real estate and particularly for a few of our strategically located assets, we are seeing an increase in reverse inquiries for some of our assets at prices we previously did not expect, did not have in our original plan to sell in 2022. As a result, we have increased our guidance for dispositions to a range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This will provide attractively priced capital to fund our increased development expectations. On the acquisition side, we purchased 1 facility totaling 75,000 square feet in the Southern California Mid-County submarket. The building was vacant, and given current leasing prospects, we expect it to stay at a 4.6% yield. I will now turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial results and guidance update.\nMark Denien: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.44 per share, which represents 12.8% growth over the first quarter of 2021. The increased core FFO per diluted share was primarily driven by rental rate growth, increased occupancy and portfolio growth in highly leased developments. AFFO totaled $156 million for the quarter. Our best in class low level of capital expenditures, along with strong NOI growth continues to generate significant AFFO growth on a share-adjusted basis even in excess of our FFO growth. Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021 was 7.3%. The growth in same-property NOI was due to increased occupancy and rent growth as well as the burn-off of some free rent compared to the first quarter of 2021. We do expect this growth to moderate a bit for the remainder of the year based mainly on less free rent burn-off. Same property NOI growth on a net effective basis was 5.2% for the quarter. As a result of our strong start to 2022, we announced revised core FFO guidance for 2022 to a range of $1.88 to $1.94 per share compared to the previous range of $1.87 to $1.93 per share. The $1.91 midpoint of our revised core FFO guidance represents an over 10.4% increase of 2021 results. We also announced revised guidance for growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis between 9.1% and 13% with a midpoint of 11% compared to the previous range of 8.4% to 12.3%. For same-property NOI growth on a cash basis, we have increased our guidance to a range of 5.8% to 6.6% from the previous range of 5.4% to 6.2%. This increase is mainly a result of expectations of continued strong rental rate growth and occupancy for the remainder of the year, similar to levels that we experienced in the first quarter. On the development guidance. The market fundamentals are submerged and continue to be very supportive of specular developments, and coupled with our lease-up track record, we are revising guidance development starts to be between $1.45 billion and $1.65 billion compared to the previous range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. This increase in development starts provide a key source of growth in 2023 and beyond. We've updated a couple of other components of our guidance based on our more optimistic outlook as detailed in our range of estimates excluded -- included in our supplemental information on website. I'll now turn it back to Jim for a few closing remarks.\nJim Connor: Thanks, Mark. In closing, even with some rising macro headwinds on inflation, interest rate and geopolitical side of things, we believe the multiple secular tailwinds driving our business and overall positive GDP and consumer spending set-up will continue to provide opportunities for strong leasing and development. This, combined with the substantial amount of embedded rent growth in our existing portfolio gives us great confidence in our ability to generate double-digit growth in FFO and AFFO for our shareholders not just in 2022, but in the foreseeable future, which should generate a commensurate level of growth in our annual dividend. I want to thank you all for your continued support in Duke Realty. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] And with that, operator, we'll open the lines and take our first question.\nOperator: Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman.\nJamie Feldman: I guess just thinking about the guidance, there's a lot -- several areas where clearly the outlook is better fundamentally, more development starts. Can you just talk about maybe some of the things that might have been a bigger drag than maybe some that we\u2019re thinking about, as you kind of weigh the positives and the negatives, if there was anything?\nMark Denien: Jamie, I'll start. This is Mark. There were no really big drags. I guess maybe the only thing you could kind of point to is this change negatively on this year's FFO number will be your increase in dispositions guidance. Most of that increase in dispositions guidance will go to fund the development pipeline. So that's modestly dilutive this year. But it will be certainly accretive in the long run as we trade a low cap rate on disposition sales for higher-yielding development assets. But that was probably a little bit of a drag from where we were last quarter. But I think we're pretty optimistic to start the year, and it's only better now.\nJamie Feldman: And then if you think about -- let's say, we do end up -- head into some sort of recession. Can you just talk about portfolio credit quality today and just how you think the -- whether it's earnings growth or occupancy or even leasing spreads would hold up if you did -- we did see a pullback in the economy versus prior cycles?\nJim Connor: Yes. Sure, Jamie. It's Jim. I would make a couple of observations. I think we can all point back to roughly 2 years ago at the start of pandemic, which was a great stress test for our portfolio and the quality of our credit tenants. And reminding everybody, 18 to 24 months ago, we were collecting 99.99% of our rents. So not that anybody wants to see that kind of thing again, but that's the kind of stress test that gives us confidence that in any sort of a downturn out there in the future, our portfolio will continue to perform.  And then as Steve pointed out earlier, even if the market softens to the point where there's no rent growth in the markets, we still have 48% embedded rent growth in our portfolio. So I would point to those 2 things as giving us a great deal of confidence in our ability to perform even if things were soft somewhat.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. I guess just to be fair, though, I mean, there was a lot of government stimulus that kept tenants healthier, I guess, thinking about even earlier downturns, if we look back at that, it's really declined.\nJim Connor: No, I don't -- if you look at the number of tenants in our portfolio that got any sort of government assistance, it's less than 10%. And if you go back and look at some of the tenants that we did rent offset agreements, half of them prepaid those early. So I think that speaks to the quality and the resiliency of the portfolio and the tenants we\u2019ve got.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman.\nEmmanuel Korchman: If we think about just the long-term drivers of the growth in this business, at this point in the cycle, how much of that should be coming from sort of the internal growth, especially with the mark-to-market as high as it is? I guess the deeper questions there is how much of that we get each year and the next few upcoming years here, how much of that is going to come from external growth? So if we take your, call it, around about 10% growth, is that half from development and half from this rent mark-to-market? Or is it a different proportion than that?\nMark Denien: You're close, Jamie -- or Jamie, sorry, Manny.\nEmmanuel Korchman: This question is mine, Mark.\nMark Denien: Yes. We have a slide in our investor deck that lays that out, and it really hasn't changed much. And you're pretty much right on. If you look at our external growth, I think we quoted a development return of like 10% to 12% to FFO, the impact on FFO, net of financing cost of [4 to 6], so that goes together in your 5% to 6%, give or take, of external growth. And then our -- what I call, our internal growth for GAAP FFO same property is about 5%. So it's about 50-50. You're right on. And I think the simple math way to think about it, our mark-to-market our portfolio, like Jim said, is 48%. If you will, plus or minus 10% a year that we've been doing at 48%, there's 5% growth. So that's simple math, but you're pretty close.\nEmmanuel Korchman: Great. And then on the development starts, is there a -- either a cost or a mix component there? So if we were to look at the number of starts that you're going to have this year versus -- in the new guidance versus the old guidance, has that changed? Is it new projects? Or is it more expensive projects or a couple of bigger projects versus some smaller ones before?\nSteve Schnur : Yes, Manny, this is Steve. I mean, there's always some ins and outs. I would tell you, it's a couple more projects. There's something significantly large that skew in that one way or the other, so somewhere along -- I mean, we go into this -- we've got most of next year mapped out as well. Again, there's always a few that we find along the way. But we've been pretty diligent about building our land bank and having visibility for the next couple of years in our development guidance.\nEmmanuel Korchman: So Steve, what would be the potential for that to start guidance to go up again this year at all? Or is that kind of fixed for '22 at this point?\nSteve Schnur : For development guidance to go up again, on starts?\nEmmanuel Korchman: Yes.\nSteve Schnur : Yes, if we found another project that we're able to start near term, but those are harder and harder to come by with entitlements. So could it go up modestly, perhaps. But most of what we have is, we're already in some level of process on.\nJim Connor: Yes. I think the only significant filter in that would be some big build-to-suits. And they're out there, but they take a lot of time. We've got a number of those built into the pipeline. But you add 1 or 2 or more of those, and I think you could see an appreciable increase.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim.\nJohn Kim : On your development land bank, you're saying now we could accommodate 3 years of development starts at your current run rate because the run rate has gone up. What's your ability to source more land in your Tier 1 markets and have development yields kind of remain attractive to you?\nSteve Schnur : Yes. I would say I think that's the strength of our team. We've been able to do that the last 3 years, looking back to 2019 -- 2019, 2020, 2021, we\u2019ve ran at a lower land bank number, and this development -- our development starts have been in the same range. So we've got -- as we've said in our opening remarks, we've got a land bank that can support this level of starts for the next 3 years. There's always a number of sites that are under contract, under option, some level of due diligence. But our teams are -- this is where our team shine. And I think we've done a really nice job with doing it.\nJim Connor: Yes. For perspective, John, we had almost double the land now that we had a year ago. And to Steve's point, we've been doing this level of development all along. Now a lot of that land is covered land. It's generating income, which is even better. But we've been buying about the same amount we've been monetizing every year. We've been doing it through this whole cycle.\nJohn Kim : Right. But development starts are going up. So it's just the visibility on developments, it doesn't seem as strong as it did before. So I was wondering, on the second part of the question, multi-store development in Tier 1 markets or non-Tier 1 markets doing developments there, when do these become more attractive?\nJim Connor: The spread between the Coastal Tier 1 and the Tier 1 of the other markets, John?\nJohn Kim : Right. Just given the difference in land cost. Does it become more attractive to do, developments outside of your Coastal Tier 1 cities?\nJim Connor: Yes. I would tell you, I think the land that we have either on the books or that we control, we believe is in the right submarkets in all of our various markets. So the margins are consistently -- have been consistently, let's just say, north of 50% in our development pipeline. So I would tell you, the value creation opportunity in the whole portfolio is really good. And it's not a situation of where we're differentiating between markets or shifting our strategy. I think we've got ample opportunity across the board.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows.\nCaitlin Burrows: I had another follow-up question on development. I guess initial '22 development start guidance was low versus '21, but you did revise it higher. And some of your peers have discussed issues with labor and materials impacting developments potential. So just wondering if you could comment to what extent you've been impacted by current labor or material headwinds impacting your development potential?\nSteve Schnur : Yes, Caitlin, I'd tell you, we're closely monitoring what's going on with materials. I'd tell you, our processes have changed a bit in terms of when we're starting design, how quickly or how far out in front we're procuring materials. I would tell you, all of our 2022 starts are locked in, in terms of our start dates and design and our permitting as well as our early long-lead material items. Labor hasn't been as big of an issue, but materials have been. But again, I think this is where we're able to use our size and our balance sheet and our 50 years of experience to stay out in front of us.\nJim Connor: Yes, Caitlin, I would add to Steve's comment. I think what's helping us drive our guidance on the development side isn't related to labor or material costs, it's the land that we have in the portfolio when those sites are entitled and ready to go and it's the leasing of our spec portfolio. And we've come out of the first quarter and most of the way through April much stronger than I think even we anticipated. So I think that's given us the confidence to go ahead and increase development guidance once again.\nCaitlin Burrows: Yes. And actually, my second question was going to be on that speculative side. I was just wondering, it does seem like speculative development at this point definitely makes sense. But wondering what metrics you look at to gauge what speculative development is warranted and you're open to it versus something that might be considered more risky.\nJim Connor: Well, I don't know what we can do, this is more risky than speculative development. I'm open to ideas, I suppose. So what we look at is a number of metrics. What's the percentage leased in the development pipeline. And even with the increase in the amount of speculative development we're doing versus build-to-suits, that number is still at roughly 50%, which is a number we're very comfortable with. We look at leasing volume. As Steve cited earlier, this is the, I think, eighth consecutive quarter that we're above 7 million square feet. And we look at the overall occupancy of the portfolio, the in-service and the total portfolio, both of which are above 99%. So I think the combination of all 3 of those metrics would tell you that we need to be doing more speculative development and bring more space into the portfolio.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Yes, no, I was saying that in certain market conditions, speculative development might be considered more risky, but based on those metrics you're talking about, it seems that's not necessarily the case.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico.\nNick Yulico : I was hoping to get, Mark, in terms of the rent spreads that you're assuming in guidance for the rest of the year on a GAAP and cash basis.\nMark Denien: Yes. Nick, I think they'll be very similar to what we posted in Q1. The mark-to-market on our portfolio sort of was going at 48%, is really close to the 49% we posted in the first quarter. Steve mentioned only 18% of that role was in coastal markets. That's pretty similar to what we expect for the last 9 months of the year. We still don't have a lot of coastal roll coming out of the last 9 months. So I think you'll see -- it may vary quarter-to-quarter, maybe a little higher or lower. But by and large, for the rest of the year, I think you'll see rent growth that we post on deals very similar to the first quarter. As we look out to next year, we're not going to give guidance yet. But I would tell you that the coastal role we have next year is a little bit over 30% compared to 18% this year. So as we sit here today, I would expect it to get only better next year.\nNick Yulico : Okay. Great. That's helpful. Just second question is on development. If you could talk a little bit more about the yield for the deliveries in the first quarter higher than it's been. You had a 67% expected cash yield there, kind of what's driving that. And then also, I guess going back to the yield that you quote on the development pipeline underway, 5.8%, how we should think about ultimately that yield once you deliver since you did raise your market rent forecast. And so I don't think you're trending rents in your development yields. So maybe you can just give us a feel for how that could play out.\nMark Denien: Well, I'll start the first question and maybe try to kind of turn it over to else. Our yields have popped for really 2 reasons. We are leasing our spec projects literally as they go in service. We've been talking about -- as Steve mentioned, we started the spec projects we delivered over the last 12 months. We started at 3%. There are now 100%. They are virtually 100% when they went in service. So we've been leasing these up at 2 months or less. We always underwrite 1 year. So when you look at our initial yields, we've got a year of carry costs buried in the cost. So it brings our yield down a little bit. So to the extent we can lease those up 10 or 12 months earlier, that helps yields. So that's part of it. And then the second part was just rent growth. You mentioned it, we don't trend rents when we do our underwriting. We underwrite current rents when we start to deal and then we only adjust that for signed deals. So the deals we're signing based on the market rent of what we are experiencing are substantially and accessible underwrote. So those 2 factors is what's creating that big pop in yields from initial underwriting to delivery. And I would tell you, as we look forward, to the extent that dynamic continues, you'll see that result continue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith.\nMichael Goldsmith: You talked a bit about the drivers that have greater inventory resiliency and e-commerce growth. But I wanted to dig into a little bit about reshoring. Do the shutdowns in China escalate this conversation again? And this driver kind of takes a little bit maybe longer than some of the others to kind of realize in demand. So when can we really start to see this as a major contributor to demand going forward?\nSteve Schnur : Yes. I think it's -- people are determining now, future proofing their supply chains. Whether you're talking about resiliency or future proofing, I think it's a trend we're going to see, I think, New Mexico and Central America relative to manufacturing, we're seeing some of it in spots and in certain industries in the U.S. But the bigger impact near term to us is just more product on our shores. So yes, I think it's definitely top of mind for all of our customers.\nJim Connor: Yes, Michael, I would add, I think Steve is exactly right. The near-term impact is the safety stock that our customers are out trying to put in their logistics and supply chain. I think the impact of onshoring and nearshoring will be a little slower but steady or steadier over the course of the next likely 5 to 7 years. Because rebuilding or reengineering, manufacturing, processing, assembly operations takes a little bit more time than just moving the logistics side of the business. So I think that's a better long -- midterm and long-term driver for our space.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. And as a follow-up, last year, you had a number -- you had more renewals than maybe expected as people look to renew early. What are you seeing on that this year? And how do those lease negotiations differ from kind of traditional expirations? And what sort of escalators are you currently getting in sort of your renewals?\nSteve Schnur : Yes. I would tell you -- it's Steve. I would say that, do we have customers trying to -- given the environment out there, trying to lock up space earlier? Certainly. I think it's -- a good brokerage firm representing them would tell them to do if it's a critical piece to their supply chain. We're -- we'll listen to customers. We'll talk with them. But obviously, it's a landlords market right now. So we don't tend to negotiate rents too far in advance in today's market. In terms of escalators, it's been a big point of emphasis for us. You saw us move our escalators up in the latter part of '21 up north of 3% in what we were signing then. In the first quarter of '22, that number has moved to 3.6%. I would tell you, I would expect that trend to continue the rest of the year. Certainly, we've -- there's inflation numbers out there that would suggest that they could go higher for us in our annual escalators within our leases.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem.\nRonald Kamdem : Just a quick one on inventory. And I know it's announced a lot of different ways, but when you're speaking to tenants, can you just give us a sense of what they're saying about their inventory levels? And are they happy? How much more do they need? Just any color or commentary would be really helpful because we keep hearing about inventory comment, and I'm wondering what you guys are seeing in your portfolio.\nSteve Schnur : Sure. I would tell you, our -- we do a space utilization exercise twice a year with our tenants. Tenants are utilizing space at sort of near record levels for as long as we've been doing it, just around 90%. The resiliency side of this or the build back of stock that they have, we still think, we pay a lot of attention in the inventory to sales ratio. There's been a lot of debate by a number of people on this call as to breaking that down by category. And we've done that. I would tell you, we still think that there's a 5% to 10% build back to get to pre-pandemic levels for inventories for our customers. And that would tell you there's 300 million to 400 million square feet of incremental demand that needs to get absorbed back into warehouses.\nRonald Kamdem : Got it. That makes sense. And then just another one on -- a big picture one on recession, which I know it's being debated in the market. Clearly, you're not seeing it, putting more capital to work here. But maybe can you give us a sense of what -- when would you see it, right? What are some of the signs that you would have to see in your businesses, it could be build-to-suits, it could be tenant commitments to capital. Like, how do you guys think about what the leading indicators in your businesses are for when things start to slow, if they start to slow?\nJim Connor: So Ron, I think we would -- it would first manifest itself with us in, I think, our leasing volumes, in our renewal discussions and things like that. Next, if you kind of peel back the onion, if we look at the deals that we're doing, and the capital that our customers are spending, if they start to pull back on capital investments inside the building, I think that's a pretty good leading economic indicator. So that's, I guess, one of the reasons we follow that so closely in terms of our renewal percentage, our leasing volume, where the development pipeline is, so that we can keep a pretty good handle on that in a sense of the kind of demand we're seeing. And then the other thing which we've talked about before is the build-to-suits. So the build-to-suits are the best leading economic indicator for us in our conversations with our clients for the next 18 to 24 months. Because you're talking about designing and entitling and building buildings that aren't going to be delivered until 2024, in some cases, 2025. And customers are -- if they're seeing problems out there in their logistics and supply chain, they're not going to be willing to make those commitments. And sitting here today, we've got lots of those opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone.\nVince Tibone: Could you provide your lease mark-to-market on a cash basis and also share how that differs between some of your top markets?\nMark Denien: Yes. Vince, it's Mark. We're leasing at 48% on a GAAP basis and 35% on cash. And then as far as the markets, I would tell you, it's pretty well spread. It's pretty even across all the markets with the 2 main outliers being Southern California and New Jersey. Obviously, our coastal markets are a little bit better overall. But if you pull back in on the coastal markets, Southern Cal and New Jersey are the biggest. And you got to keep in mind, those are the 2 newest markets for us as well, and that's why we're only rolling 18% this year versus the 45% plus exposure that we have on those coasts. And that's why we're still bullish on our future outlook of this mark-to-market continuing only get better. But pretty well spread out other than those 2 markets, are clearly at the top of the class.\nVince Tibone: No, that makes sense. Is there anything you can just quantify that a little bit? Just like how much higher is Southern California and New Jersey compared to the likes of Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta? Like what order of magnitude roughly?\nMark Denien: Double. Literally double, yes. Now I like to say, keep in mind, some of the Dallas and Chicago, places like that, we've got -- I'm trying to explain, we've got newer fresher leases buried in that number. So just hypothetically if Dallas is 45% and Southern Cal is doubled that, 90%, you've got numbers out, part of that is because Southern Cal, believe it or not, has to hold our leases in our portfolio because we haven't got them to roll yet, and Dallas has been rolled all along. So we don't have as much churn left to go in Dallas, if that makes sense. You got to look at the maturity at all, too, but yes.\nVince Tibone: No, that's really helpful color. One more for me, switching gears. Like, had your asset mix in terms of what's targeted for disposition this year changed at all given the higher rates? And do you think pricing has moved for properties that are longer lease, lower growth profile?\nNick Anthony: We haven't seen it yet. What we have seen is that we've seen the buyer pool shrink a bit on the assets. We've only had a few assets out in the market. One of them is under agreement at a pricing that we expected to transact at, sub-4 in a non-Tier 1 market. So we're keeping a very close eye on it. There's a lot of chatter out there about it. But I don't think anybody has really seen it yet. So we'll be back -- we'll be opportunistic on the disposition side and evaluate each one as we go about it. And if we think the price is right, we'll transact. If not, we won't.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim.\nKi Bin Kim: Just going back to your land bank commentary. You mentioned about 3 years of runway. I'm assuming you included the options that you have available. But if you look at the land, I mean, half of that if you include options, is actually in Columbus, Ohio, which I'm sure you can develop there. But I was just curious, from a practical standpoint, is it really 3 years? Because I can't imagine you guys doing a bunch of Ohio developments all of a sudden. Or should we expect you guys to continuously reload that land bank at a pretty strong pace?\nMark Denien: Ki Bin, why do you take it on Columbus, Ohio for, man? No, to your point, just to clarify, I think this is detailed in the supplemental. The only place we have a long-term land option agreement is at Rickenbacker Airport in Colombus, Ohio. So everything else supporting the numbers that Steve put out is land that we have either under contract, under agreement, covered land plays or already owned it on the books. So the Columbus option land is a very small piece. It does not represent the lion's share of our development pipeline for the next 3 years.\nKi Bin Kim: Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And just going back to the topic of demand. I think one of your competitors have talked about e-commerce not being able to sort of spear anymore for demand and other segments stepping up. And I know it doesn't work its way because of with the economy growth and population growth, but there's always kind of continuous demand. But in a simplistic sense, if -- or how far along are all these corporate users in terms of really just getting into the space they need and have locked it up and maybe the next round of demand just looks a little bit weaker?\nJim Connor: Well, I'll make a couple of comments, and then I think Steve can add some color as well. I think people have talked or speculated about Amazon pulling back, and we saw them pull back in terms of their deal signed last year. And yet we had record demand across the country. So I think while we may see their demand moderate because of the -- how far along they are in terms of the build-out of their supply chain, I think the vast majority of our other clients are still playing catch up. So I think we continue -- expect to see more continued demand on the e-commerce from everybody other than Amazon.  And I think a lot of companies are still playing catch up in terms of the capital investment in their e-commerce facilities. Material handling systems and the robotics are still in their early stages of development. We just saw a headline where Amazon is investing $1 billion in robotics. So I think we got a long runway to go in terms of e-commerce and its adaptation in the U.S. and its supply chain. And I think that bodes really good for us.\nSteve Schnur : Yes, Ki Bin, I would just add, for us, 3PLs continue to be the most active user in the market. We saw that in the first quarter. We saw that last year. Retail e-commerce for us has probably fallen to about the third category in terms of overall demand. So as Jim said, it's -- I think most of our customers are early on in their venture towards building out their own e-commerce platforms.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell.\nAnthony Powell: You've talked about how some of your noncoastal markets are showing increasing strength here. Can you maybe go into some more detail there? Which markets do you want to highlight? And how has the supply environment involved in some of those noncoastal markets?\nSteve Schnur : Yes. Look, it's hard to find a soft spot in today's world, right? I would tell you, for us, Houston, as \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about it before, Houston is probably in the one market that's been a little soft for us. But markets this past quarter, markets like Minneapolis, Raleigh, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta were all great markets for us in terms of rent growth and overall activity. Nashville has been a good market for us as of late. So it's -- again, it's hard to pick a market that's not doing well right now.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. Maybe one more. I guess in terms of lease mark-to-market, how should we think about that during a possible recession? How sticky do you think current rents are, looking back at prior recessions? Maybe not COVID, but other recessions, how did lease mark-to-market or overall rents trend? And how should we think about that risk over the next few years?\nMark Denien: Well, I'll start. I mean, I think -- forget the recession, 48%, we expect it to get better because we don't expect rents to pull back anytime soon. But I think the easiest way we think about it is, if they go flat, which is a dramatic decrease from what we've experienced the last several years, we still have that 48% baked into our numbers. So I think we're very comfortable that even if we have some period of dislocation here and rent growth stops, that it can stay in the range it's at right now and we'll still have 48% upside. So how low can it go? I don't know. I mean, it can go lower, anything can happen. But I think we're very comfortable that the 48% will get better. And sort of a downside scenario, maybe not a worst case, but the downside is it stays at 48%.\nAnthony Powell: How did rents trend in 2008 and 2001? Just curious as someone newer to the space.\nMark Denien: Well, I think you got to factor in the different starting point, first of all. 2008, we were at a 3% vacancy heading into 2008. We're in a -- I mean, I just don't know that you can always look at history in the environment we're in now and draw logical conclusions from it. That would be my starting point. I don't know, Jim, if you have anything to add to that.\nJim Connor: Yes. I don't know, off the top of my head, I have that -- I think to your point, even if market rents fell and went truly negative, even if they fell 15% or 20%, we've still got a 48% mark to market. So I can't imagine a scenario even in 2008 through 2010, rents didn't fall 50%.\nNick Anthony: The other thing I'd point out is in 2008 -- today, we have 44% of our NOI coming from Coastal Tier 1 markets that have 1% vacancy and don't have any land available. Back in 2008, that was less than 1%. So there's a big difference there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson.\nRich Anderson: Just a couple of quick follow-ups. A lot of my questions have been answered. But there was a -- you mentioned, just to answer to a previous question just a little bit ago, e-commerce is the third largest, what was that, in terms of activity, leasing activity in the first quarter? And maybe you can give me the breakdown of the industries. I might have missed that.\nSteve Schnur : Yes. Our top 1 was 3PLs. That made up -- for us that made up a little under half of our overall activity. Consumer product goods would be, I guess, the next category I would throw out there in terms of activity. Retail e-commerce would be the third. And then sort of what we call manufacturers assembled goods would be the fourth category.\nRich Anderson: And how has that changed over the past couple of years?\nSteve Schnur : I would say with e-commerce and 3PLs have probably shifted. Consumer products goods have always been in that -- usually in the top 4 for our portfolio. Amazon's activity the past 3, 4, 5 years has always put e-commerce up near the top.\nJim Connor: Rich, I would say you got to take that with a little bit of grain of salt. I'm not trying to make excuses, but the consumer products companies, how much of what they're doing is to support their e-commerce and how much is to support their more traditional supply chain, that's kind of the gray area that moves back and forth. It's pretty easy to track Amazon and Wayfair.com because that's purely an e-conference platform. So there's a little gray area in there. But I think to Steve's point, been pretty consistent all along.\nRich Anderson: Same could be said for 3PLs, too, obviously, right? It's very much a gray area, perhaps more. So I wanted to -- I had sort of an idea about leading indicator and what's driving you to expand spec development at this point with a war going on and inflation and so on. And you mentioned build-to-suits being the best leading indicator because those companies aren't going to make those types of commitments if they don't really see what they think they're seeing.  But at the end of the day, they're ingrained in this business, and you used the term catching up to Amazon, so they might be willing to take on a little bit of a risk to play that catch-up trade and not entirely an objective leading indicator, if you were to ask me. The real objective leading indicators might be declining consumer sentiment in the face of inflation. GDP growth, just released this morning, down 1.4% in the first quarter. And yet you're still hanging on to the speculative development process.  I don't know if I have a question in here. But I'm just wondering, beyond the build-to-suit observation as you're guiding like speculative development, what else is getting you there in the light -- in the face of all these other, what I would call, risks to the system?\nJim Connor: Rich, those are all valid points, occupancy, demand, leasing volume, nationwide vacancy, all of those things. If the roles were reversed, you could build more spec space. I mean, if you just think about it, at 99-plus percent in our in-service portfolio, we don't have enough space to handle just the organic growth of our existing customer base.\nRich Anderson: Yes. But 99% is a coincident indicator and could go down as much as it could go up depending on demand of tenants and vacancies and all that sort of stuff. I don't mean to litigate this on this call. I just feel like to expand speculative development at this point seems like a brave step, and you're not the only one doing it, but I guess I'll just leave it at that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller.\nMike Mueller: Two quick ones here. First, who are you typically buying land from today? And what portion of your spec activity is in existing parks?\nSteve Schnur : We typically buy, I would say, 2 different -- today, there's either private sellers, people who have owned land for a long time, whether that was a business or owned by a family or a private company. Two is, I would say, companies that are -- that we're redeveloping a site, something they've owned for a long time. And in terms of -- your other question was our development in the existing business parks, that might be --\nMike Mueller: Yes, what --\nSteve Schnur : One of our projects, looking at the list here, I think one of our projects is in an existing business park. Everything else was a site that we've been working on and had it in some version of our land bank that was asked on this call a number of times over the past year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck.\nBlaine Heck: Obviously, you guys put up some really sizable rents for this quarter, especially on a net effective basis at 49% and especially given that only 18% are in those Tier 1 markets. So I was wondering to what extent the term of the leases rolling off is affecting those strong rent spreads. So are those leases kind of 7 or more years old and that's what's driving that high mark to market? Or are they closer to 3 to 5 years old, and those rent spreads are really indicative of very strong rent growth that you've seen even in those lower-tier markets over that short period of time?\nMark Denien: Yes, Blaine, it's a little bit of both. They're not, what I would call, extremely long leases rolling. It's a little bit longer than the 3- to 4-year terms that you mentioned. I think the average term was enrolled was about 5 or 6, which is about what our overall portfolio is as we sit here today. So it's just a combination. We've seen great rent growth across all the markets, whether you pick a market like Chicago or Indi or Atlanta, places we've been a long time, rent growth has been great, not as good as Southern California and New Jersey but certainly been a lot better than the built-in escalators within the lease. So it's not like it's a lot of 15-year deals rolling or anything like that, it was like 6 \u2013 5 to 6-year deals rolling, just pretty good solid growth across all the markets.\nBlaine Heck: All right. Great. That's helpful, Mark. And then I noticed that about half of the year starts during the quarter on a square footage basis were in Indianapolis. Obviously, it's your hometown and we probably expect you guys to keep a footprint there. But can you talk about your longer-term plans for that market and if we should continue to expect growth there? And maybe Steve can talk about the fundamentals that you're seeing there relative to some of the trends in the Tier 1 market.\nSteve Schnur : Sure. I wouldn't read a lot into the fact that we started 3 buildings this quarter. It's just a timing thing with lots of land we had. We like the markets we're in. Obviously, we've got a long history in this market. We've got a very deep customer base. And we're in the right submarket. Indi's probably got some headlines recently about some overbuilding. I would tell you that's occurring on -- for those of you unfamiliar with Indianapolis, on the East side or the far South side, it's not where these buildings are located. Again, we've got great history here. I think we know this market better than anyone. And I expect those projects to be successful. Longer term, we haven't been super active on the development front in Indi. It's a good market for us. And when we see opportunities, we'll take advantage of them.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no questions in the queue. Please continue.\nJim Connor: I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to engaging with many of you throughout the year. Operator, you may disconnect the line.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jim Connor",
            "content": "Thanks, Ron. Good afternoon, everyone. The fundamentals of our business continue to be at all-time record levels. We achieved record high occupancy levels in both our stabilized in-service and total in-service portfolio, record rent growth on a cash and GAAP basis, our development platform had nearly $340 million of development starts, our Coastal Tier 1 exposure is approaching 50%, our portfolio mark-to-market increased to 48%. All of these factors contributed to raising key components of our 2022 guidance, including over 10% growth in FFO, 11% growth in AFFO at the midpoint. Now let me turn it over to Steve to cover some of the market fundamentals and our operations. Thanks, Mark. In closing, even with some rising macro headwinds on inflation, interest rate and geopolitical side of things, we believe the multiple secular tailwinds driving our business and overall positive GDP and consumer spending set-up will continue to provide opportunities for strong leasing and development. This, combined with the substantial amount of embedded rent growth in our existing portfolio gives us great confidence in our ability to generate double-digit growth in FFO and AFFO for our shareholders not just in 2022, but in the foreseeable future, which should generate a commensurate level of growth in our annual dividend. I want to thank you all for your continued support in Duke Realty. We will now open it up for questions. [Operator Instructions] And with that, operator, we'll open the lines and take our first question. Yes. Sure, Jamie. It's Jim. I would make a couple of observations. I think we can all point back to roughly 2 years ago at the start of pandemic, which was a great stress test for our portfolio and the quality of our credit tenants. And reminding everybody, 18 to 24 months ago, we were collecting 99.99% of our rents. So not that anybody wants to see that kind of thing again, but that's the kind of stress test that gives us confidence that in any sort of a downturn out there in the future, our portfolio will continue to perform.  And then as Steve pointed out earlier, even if the market softens to the point where there's no rent growth in the markets, we still have 48% embedded rent growth in our portfolio. So I would point to those 2 things as giving us a great deal of confidence in our ability to perform even if things were soft somewhat. No, I don't -- if you look at the number of tenants in our portfolio that got any sort of government assistance, it's less than 10%. And if you go back and look at some of the tenants that we did rent offset agreements, half of them prepaid those early. So I think that speaks to the quality and the resiliency of the portfolio and the tenants we've got. Yes. I think the only significant filter in that would be some big build-to-suits. And they're out there, but they take a lot of time. We've got a number of those built into the pipeline. But you add 1 or 2 or more of those, and I think you could see an appreciable increase. Yes. For perspective, John, we had almost double the land now that we had a year ago. And to Steve's point, we've been doing this level of development all along. Now a lot of that land is covered land. It's generating income, which is even better. But we've been buying about the same amount we've been monetizing every year. We've been doing it through this whole cycle. The spread between the Coastal Tier 1 and the Tier 1 of the other markets, John? Yes. I would tell you, I think the land that we have either on the books or that we control, we believe is in the right submarkets in all of our various markets. So the margins are consistently -- have been consistently, let's just say, north of 50% in our development pipeline. So I would tell you, the value creation opportunity in the whole portfolio is really good. And it's not a situation of where we're differentiating between markets or shifting our strategy. I think we've got ample opportunity across the board. Yes, Caitlin, I would add to Steve's comment. I think what's helping us drive our guidance on the development side isn't related to labor or material costs, it's the land that we have in the portfolio when those sites are entitled and ready to go and it's the leasing of our spec portfolio. And we've come out of the first quarter and most of the way through April much stronger than I think even we anticipated. So I think that's given us the confidence to go ahead and increase development guidance once again. Well, I don't know what we can do, this is more risky than speculative development. I'm open to ideas, I suppose. So what we look at is a number of metrics. What's the percentage leased in the development pipeline. And even with the increase in the amount of speculative development we're doing versus build-to-suits, that number is still at roughly 50%, which is a number we're very comfortable with. We look at leasing volume. As Steve cited earlier, this is the, I think, eighth consecutive quarter that we're above 7 million square feet. And we look at the overall occupancy of the portfolio, the in-service and the total portfolio, both of which are above 99%. So I think the combination of all 3 of those metrics would tell you that we need to be doing more speculative development and bring more space into the portfolio. Yes, Michael, I would add, I think Steve is exactly right. The near-term impact is the safety stock that our customers are out trying to put in their logistics and supply chain. I think the impact of onshoring and nearshoring will be a little slower but steady or steadier over the course of the next likely 5 to 7 years. Because rebuilding or reengineering, manufacturing, processing, assembly operations takes a little bit more time than just moving the logistics side of the business. So I think that's a better long -- midterm and long-term driver for our space. So Ron, I think we would -- it would first manifest itself with us in, I think, our leasing volumes, in our renewal discussions and things like that. Next, if you kind of peel back the onion, if we look at the deals that we're doing, and the capital that our customers are spending, if they start to pull back on capital investments inside the building, I think that's a pretty good leading economic indicator. So that's, I guess, one of the reasons we follow that so closely in terms of our renewal percentage, our leasing volume, where the development pipeline is, so that we can keep a pretty good handle on that in a sense of the kind of demand we're seeing. And then the other thing which we've talked about before is the build-to-suits. So the build-to-suits are the best leading economic indicator for us in our conversations with our clients for the next 18 to 24 months. Because you're talking about designing and entitling and building buildings that aren't going to be delivered until 2024, in some cases, 2025. And customers are -- if they're seeing problems out there in their logistics and supply chain, they're not going to be willing to make those commitments. And sitting here today, we've got lots of those opportunities. Well, I'll make a couple of comments, and then I think Steve can add some color as well. I think people have talked or speculated about Amazon pulling back, and we saw them pull back in terms of their deal signed last year. And yet we had record demand across the country. So I think while we may see their demand moderate because of the -- how far along they are in terms of the build-out of their supply chain, I think the vast majority of our other clients are still playing catch up. So I think we continue -- expect to see more continued demand on the e-commerce from everybody other than Amazon.  And I think a lot of companies are still playing catch up in terms of the capital investment in their e-commerce facilities. Material handling systems and the robotics are still in their early stages of development. We just saw a headline where Amazon is investing $1 billion in robotics. So I think we got a long runway to go in terms of e-commerce and its adaptation in the U.S. and its supply chain. And I think that bodes really good for us. Yes. I don't know, off the top of my head, I have that -- I think to your point, even if market rents fell and went truly negative, even if they fell 15% or 20%, we've still got a 48% mark to market. So I can't imagine a scenario even in 2008 through 2010, rents didn't fall 50%. Rich, I would say you got to take that with a little bit of grain of salt. I'm not trying to make excuses, but the consumer products companies, how much of what they're doing is to support their e-commerce and how much is to support their more traditional supply chain, that's kind of the gray area that moves back and forth. It's pretty easy to track Amazon and Wayfair.com because that's purely an e-conference platform. So there's a little gray area in there. But I think to Steve's point, been pretty consistent all along. Rich, those are all valid points, occupancy, demand, leasing volume, nationwide vacancy, all of those things. If the roles were reversed, you could build more spec space. I mean, if you just think about it, at 99-plus percent in our in-service portfolio, we don't have enough space to handle just the organic growth of our existing customer base. I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to engaging with many of you throughout the year. Operator, you may disconnect the line."

            "content": "Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Core FFO for the quarter was $0.44 per share, which represents 12.8% growth over the first quarter of 2021. The increased core FFO per diluted share was primarily driven by rental rate growth, increased occupancy and portfolio growth in highly leased developments. AFFO totaled $156 million for the quarter. Our best in class low level of capital expenditures, along with strong NOI growth continues to generate significant AFFO growth on a share-adjusted basis even in excess of our FFO growth. Same-property NOI growth on a cash basis for the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021 was 7.3%. The growth in same-property NOI was due to increased occupancy and rent growth as well as the burn-off of some free rent compared to the first quarter of 2021. We do expect this growth to moderate a bit for the remainder of the year based mainly on less free rent burn-off. Same property NOI growth on a net effective basis was 5.2% for the quarter. As a result of our strong start to 2022, we announced revised core FFO guidance for 2022 to a range of $1.88 to $1.94 per share compared to the previous range of $1.87 to $1.93 per share. The $1.91 midpoint of our revised core FFO guidance represents an over 10.4% increase of 2021 results. We also announced revised guidance for growth in AFFO on a share adjusted basis between 9.1% and 13% with a midpoint of 11% compared to the previous range of 8.4% to 12.3%. For same-property NOI growth on a cash basis, we have increased our guidance to a range of 5.8% to 6.6% from the previous range of 5.4% to 6.2%. This increase is mainly a result of expectations of continued strong rental rate growth and occupancy for the remainder of the year, similar to levels that we experienced in the first quarter. On the development guidance. The market fundamentals are submerged and continue to be very supportive of specular developments, and coupled with our lease-up track record, we are revising guidance development starts to be between $1.45 billion and $1.65 billion compared to the previous range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. This increase in development starts provide a key source of growth in 2023 and beyond. We've updated a couple of other components of our guidance based on our more optimistic outlook as detailed in our range of estimates excluded -- included in our supplemental information on website. I'll now turn it back to Jim for a few closing remarks. Jamie, I'll start. This is Mark. There were no really big drags. I guess maybe the only thing you could kind of point to is this change negatively on this year's FFO number will be your increase in dispositions guidance. Most of that increase in dispositions guidance will go to fund the development pipeline. So that's modestly dilutive this year. But it will be certainly accretive in the long run as we trade a low cap rate on disposition sales for higher-yielding development assets. But that was probably a little bit of a drag from where we were last quarter. But I think we're pretty optimistic to start the year, and it's only better now. You're close, Jamie -- or Jamie, sorry, Manny. Yes. We have a slide in our investor deck that lays that out, and it really hasn't changed much. And you're pretty much right on. If you look at our external growth, I think we quoted a development return of like 10% to 12% to FFO, the impact on FFO, net of financing cost of [4 to 6], so that goes together in your 5% to 6%, give or take, of external growth. And then our -- what I call, our internal growth for GAAP FFO same property is about 5%. So it's about 50-50. You're right on. And I think the simple math way to think about it, our mark-to-market our portfolio, like Jim said, is 48%. If you will, plus or minus 10% a year that we've been doing at 48%, there's 5% growth. So that's simple math, but you're pretty close. Yes. Nick, I think they'll be very similar to what we posted in Q1. The mark-to-market on our portfolio sort of was going at 48%, is really close to the 49% we posted in the first quarter. Steve mentioned only 18% of that role was in coastal markets. That's pretty similar to what we expect for the last 9 months of the year. We still don't have a lot of coastal roll coming out of the last 9 months. So I think you'll see -- it may vary quarter-to-quarter, maybe a little higher or lower. But by and large, for the rest of the year, I think you'll see rent growth that we post on deals very similar to the first quarter. As we look out to next year, we're not going to give guidance yet. But I would tell you that the coastal role we have next year is a little bit over 30% compared to 18% this year. So as we sit here today, I would expect it to get only better next year. Well, I'll start the first question and maybe try to kind of turn it over to else. Our yields have popped for really 2 reasons. We are leasing our spec projects literally as they go in service. We've been talking about -- as Steve mentioned, we started the spec projects we delivered over the last 12 months. We started at 3%. There are now 100%. They are virtually 100% when they went in service. So we've been leasing these up at 2 months or less. We always underwrite 1 year. So when you look at our initial yields, we've got a year of carry costs buried in the cost. So it brings our yield down a little bit. So to the extent we can lease those up 10 or 12 months earlier, that helps yields. So that's part of it. And then the second part was just rent growth. You mentioned it, we don't trend rents when we do our underwriting. We underwrite current rents when we start to deal and then we only adjust that for signed deals. So the deals we're signing based on the market rent of what we are experiencing are substantially and accessible underwrote. So those 2 factors is what's creating that big pop in yields from initial underwriting to delivery. And I would tell you, as we look forward, to the extent that dynamic continues, you'll see that result continue. Yes. Vince, it's Mark. We're leasing at 48% on a GAAP basis and 35% on cash. And then as far as the markets, I would tell you, it's pretty well spread. It's pretty even across all the markets with the 2 main outliers being Southern California and New Jersey. Obviously, our coastal markets are a little bit better overall. But if you pull back in on the coastal markets, Southern Cal and New Jersey are the biggest. And you got to keep in mind, those are the 2 newest markets for us as well, and that's why we're only rolling 18% this year versus the 45% plus exposure that we have on those coasts. And that's why we're still bullish on our future outlook of this mark-to-market continuing only get better. But pretty well spread out other than those 2 markets, are clearly at the top of the class. Double. Literally double, yes. Now I like to say, keep in mind, some of the Dallas and Chicago, places like that, we've got -- I'm trying to explain, we've got newer fresher leases buried in that number. So just hypothetically if Dallas is 45% and Southern Cal is doubled that, 90%, you've got numbers out, part of that is because Southern Cal, believe it or not, has to hold our leases in our portfolio because we haven't got them to roll yet, and Dallas has been rolled all along. So we don't have as much churn left to go in Dallas, if that makes sense. You got to look at the maturity at all, too, but yes. Ki Bin, why do you take it on Columbus, Ohio for, man? No, to your point, just to clarify, I think this is detailed in the supplemental. The only place we have a long-term land option agreement is at Rickenbacker Airport in Colombus, Ohio. So everything else supporting the numbers that Steve put out is land that we have either under contract, under agreement, covered land plays or already owned it on the books. So the Columbus option land is a very small piece. It does not represent the lion's share of our development pipeline for the next 3 years. Well, I'll start. I mean, I think -- forget the recession, 48%, we expect it to get better because we don't expect rents to pull back anytime soon. But I think the easiest way we think about it is, if they go flat, which is a dramatic decrease from what we've experienced the last several years, we still have that 48% baked into our numbers. So I think we're very comfortable that even if we have some period of dislocation here and rent growth stops, that it can stay in the range it's at right now and we'll still have 48% upside. So how low can it go? I don't know. I mean, it can go lower, anything can happen. But I think we're very comfortable that the 48% will get better. And sort of a downside scenario, maybe not a worst case, but the downside is it stays at 48%. Well, I think you got to factor in the different starting point, first of all. 2008, we were at a 3% vacancy heading into 2008. We're in a -- I mean, I just don't know that you can always look at history in the environment we're in now and draw logical conclusions from it. That would be my starting point. I don't know, Jim, if you have anything to add to that. Yes, Blaine, it's a little bit of both. They're not, what I would call, extremely long leases rolling. It's a little bit longer than the 3- to 4-year terms that you mentioned. I think the average term was enrolled was about 5 or 6, which is about what our overall portfolio is as we sit here today. So it's just a combination. We've seen great rent growth across all the markets, whether you pick a market like Chicago or Indi or Atlanta, places we've been a long time, rent growth has been great, not as good as Southern California and New Jersey but certainly been a lot better than the built-in escalators within the lease. So it's not like it's a lot of 15-year deals rolling or anything like that, it was like 6 \u2013 5 to 6-year deals rolling, just pretty good solid growth across all the markets."

            "name": "Nick Anthony",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. I'll start with dispositions. As noted on the last call, earlier this quarter, we contributed to the third tranche of Amazon access to our joint venture with CBRE Investment Management, for which our share of the proceeds was $269 million. Coupled with the outright sale of another Amazon facility in Tampa, dispositions totaled $325 million for the quarter. As a result, our Amazon exposure was 5.7% at the end of the quarter. Given the strong prices for logistics real estate and particularly for a few of our strategically located assets, we are seeing an increase in reverse inquiries for some of our assets at prices we previously did not expect, did not have in our original plan to sell in 2022. As a result, we have increased our guidance for dispositions to a range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. This will provide attractively priced capital to fund our increased development expectations. On the acquisition side, we purchased 1 facility totaling 75,000 square feet in the Southern California Mid-County submarket. The building was vacant, and given current leasing prospects, we expect it to stay at a 4.6% yield. I will now turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial results and guidance update. We haven't seen it yet. What we have seen is that we've seen the buyer pool shrink a bit on the assets. We've only had a few assets out in the market. One of them is under agreement at a pricing that we expected to transact at, sub-4 in a non-Tier 1 market. So we're keeping a very close eye on it. There's a lot of chatter out there about it. But I don't think anybody has really seen it yet. So we'll be back -- we'll be opportunistic on the disposition side and evaluate each one as we go about it. And if we think the price is right, we'll transact. If not, we won't. The other thing I'd point out is in 2008 -- today, we have 44% of our NOI coming from Coastal Tier 1 markets that have 1% vacancy and don't have any land available. Back in 2008, that was less than 1%. So there's a big difference there."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Steve Schnur",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. On the fundamental side, first quarter demand was 95 million square feet, making it 5 of the last 6 quarters of demand in the 100 million square foot or greater range. First quarter deliveries were about 85 million square feet with the vacancy rate at quarter end remaining near record lows all-time at 3.1%. Taking the record low vacancy rate of near 3%, coupled with an expected positive demand supply gap again this year, we have revised our 2022 rent growth forecast for our markets from the 10% to 15% range to the high teens to low 20% range. On the long-term demand side, CBRE recently affirmed its outlook for 1.4 billion square feet of demand through 2026 with no periods of negative net absorption through 2032. Although we are paying close attention to headline data such as inflation, fuel and labor costs and a resurgence in bottlenecks occurring in some Asian ports, we have yet to see an impact to demand in our portfolio. Based on recent dialogues with our customers, RFPs to lease space and the most recent logistics manager index at record levels, the near-term outlook is as strong as it has been in this cycle. Long term, we believe the secular themes for greater inventory resiliency, and e-commerce are still very much intact and should continue to drive short-term and long-term demand. Turning to our own portfolio. We continue to see these positive indicators, evidenced by 62 leases executed during the quarter totaling over 7.7 million square feet. Demand was broad-based across categories with a number of leases between 250,000 and 850,000 square feet with customers such as FedEx, Samsung, Walgreens, Cardinal Health, International Paper, Sealy Mattress, some major 3PLs and a global e-commerce customer. Of note, we had only 2 spaces greater than 100,000 square feet in our in-service portfolio available at the end of the first quarter. And I'm happy and pleased to report that both are now leased. Our lease activity for the quarter, combined with the strong fundamentals I discussed, led to continued growth in rents on second-generation leases of 29% cash and 49% GAAP, both records. I'd also point out that only 18% of this lease activity was in coastal markets. Across our entire in-service portfolio, the portfolio leased mark-to-market is now 48% on a GAAP basis. We believe this presents strong visibility for significant rent growth for the foreseeable future. We finished the quarter with the total in-service portfolio 99.1% leased and the stabilized portfolio 99.4% leased, again, both all-time records. On the development front, we had a tremendous first quarter starts, breaking ground on 8 speculative projects totaling $339 million in cost. All of these projects are in well-located submarkets. Our confidence in leasing speculative space continues to be very strong, as evidence of the 5.6 million square feet of speculative developments placed in service over the past year. Those projects were originally 3% leased at the start and are now 100% leased. Our development pipeline at quarter end totaled $1.64 billion with 63% allocated to Coastal Tier 1 markets and 85% allocated to overall Tier 1 markets. This pipeline is 52% preleased, and we expect to generate value creation margins over 70%. Looking forward, our pipeline for future development starts is very strong. Our land balance at quarter end totaled $582 million with an additional $235 million uncovered land. 93% of this land bank is located in Coastal Tier 1 markets. Coupled with the land options we have, another land in our operating portfolio, we can support our current level of annual starts for the next 3 years. It is also important to note for modeling NAV that the market value of the land we own is about 2x our book basis and, on average, we've only owned this land for about 1 year. With the fundamentals I outlined and our best-in-class local operating teams, our outlook for new development starts as strong. This is reflected by our revised guidance, up about 20% from our original midpoint. I'll now turn it over to Nick Anthony to cover acquisitions and dispositions. Yes, Manny, this is Steve. I mean, there's always some ins and outs. I would tell you, it's a couple more projects. There's something significantly large that skew in that one way or the other, so somewhere along -- I mean, we go into this -- we've got most of next year mapped out as well. Again, there's always a few that we find along the way. But we've been pretty diligent about building our land bank and having visibility for the next couple of years in our development guidance. For development guidance to go up again, on starts? Yes, if we found another project that we're able to start near term, but those are harder and harder to come by with entitlements. So could it go up modestly, perhaps. But most of what we have is, we're already in some level of process on. Yes. I would say I think that's the strength of our team. We've been able to do that the last 3 years, looking back to 2019 -- 2019, 2020, 2021, we've ran at a lower land bank number, and this development -- our development starts have been in the same range. So we've got -- as we've said in our opening remarks, we've got a land bank that can support this level of starts for the next 3 years. There's always a number of sites that are under contract, under option, some level of due diligence. But our teams are -- this is where our team shine. And I think we've done a really nice job with doing it. Yes, Caitlin, I'd tell you, we're closely monitoring what's going on with materials. I'd tell you, our processes have changed a bit in terms of when we're starting design, how quickly or how far out in front we're procuring materials. I would tell you, all of our 2022 starts are locked in, in terms of our start dates and design and our permitting as well as our early long-lead material items. Labor hasn't been as big of an issue, but materials have been. But again, I think this is where we're able to use our size and our balance sheet and our 50 years of experience to stay out in front of us. Yes. I think it's -- people are determining now, future proofing their supply chains. Whether you're talking about resiliency or future proofing, I think it's a trend we're going to see, I think, New Mexico and Central America relative to manufacturing, we're seeing some of it in spots and in certain industries in the U.S. But the bigger impact near term to us is just more product on our shores. So yes, I think it's definitely top of mind for all of our customers. Yes. I would tell you -- it's Steve. I would say that, do we have customers trying to -- given the environment out there, trying to lock up space earlier? Certainly. I think it's -- a good brokerage firm representing them would tell them to do if it's a critical piece to their supply chain. We're -- we'll listen to customers. We'll talk with them. But obviously, it's a landlords market right now. So we don't tend to negotiate rents too far in advance in today's market. In terms of escalators, it's been a big point of emphasis for us. You saw us move our escalators up in the latter part of '21 up north of 3% in what we were signing then. In the first quarter of '22, that number has moved to 3.6%. I would tell you, I would expect that trend to continue the rest of the year. Certainly, we've -- there's inflation numbers out there that would suggest that they could go higher for us in our annual escalators within our leases. Sure. I would tell you, our -- we do a space utilization exercise twice a year with our tenants. Tenants are utilizing space at sort of near record levels for as long as we've been doing it, just around 90%. The resiliency side of this or the build back of stock that they have, we still think, we pay a lot of attention in the inventory to sales ratio. There's been a lot of debate by a number of people on this call as to breaking that down by category. And we've done that. I would tell you, we still think that there's a 5% to 10% build back to get to pre-pandemic levels for inventories for our customers. And that would tell you there's 300 million to 400 million square feet of incremental demand that needs to get absorbed back into warehouses. Yes, Ki Bin, I would just add, for us, 3PLs continue to be the most active user in the market. We saw that in the first quarter. We saw that last year. Retail e-commerce for us has probably fallen to about the third category in terms of overall demand. So as Jim said, it's -- I think most of our customers are early on in their venture towards building out their own e-commerce platforms. Yes. Look, it's hard to find a soft spot in today's world, right? I would tell you, for us, Houston, as \u2013 we've talked about it before, Houston is probably in the one market that's been a little soft for us. But markets this past quarter, markets like Minneapolis, Raleigh, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta were all great markets for us in terms of rent growth and overall activity. Nashville has been a good market for us as of late. So it's -- again, it's hard to pick a market that's not doing well right now. Yes. Our top 1 was 3PLs. That made up -- for us that made up a little under half of our overall activity. Consumer product goods would be, I guess, the next category I would throw out there in terms of activity. Retail e-commerce would be the third. And then sort of what we call manufacturers assembled goods would be the fourth category. I would say with e-commerce and 3PLs have probably shifted. Consumer products goods have always been in that -- usually in the top 4 for our portfolio. Amazon's activity the past 3, 4, 5 years has always put e-commerce up near the top. We typically buy, I would say, 2 different -- today, there's either private sellers, people who have owned land for a long time, whether that was a business or owned by a family or a private company. Two is, I would say, companies that are -- that we're redeveloping a site, something they've owned for a long time. And in terms of -- your other question was our development in the existing business parks, that might be -- One of our projects, looking at the list here, I think one of our projects is in an existing business park. Everything else was a site that we've been working on and had it in some version of our land bank that was asked on this call a number of times over the past year. Sure. I wouldn't read a lot into the fact that we started 3 buildings this quarter. It's just a timing thing with lots of land we had. We like the markets we're in. Obviously, we've got a long history in this market. We've got a very deep customer base. And we're in the right submarket. Indi's probably got some headlines recently about some overbuilding. I would tell you that's occurring on -- for those of you unfamiliar with Indianapolis, on the East side or the far South side, it's not where these buildings are located. Again, we've got great history here. I think we know this market better than anyone. And I expect those projects to be successful. Longer term, we haven't been super active on the development front in Indi. It's a good market for us. And when we see opportunities, we'll take advantage of them."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce to you, Jill Sawyer, SVP with Investor Relations. Thank you, Jill. You may begin.\nJill Sawyer: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. Actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our fourth quarter earnings press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim.\nTim Arndt: Thanks, Jill. I'd like to start our call by recognizing and thanking our team for the incredible effort given over 2023. While it was a turbulent year in many ways, we ended it by delivering nearly 11% earnings growth and driving our 12-year earnings CAGR since merger to 10.3%. We deployed over $7 billion into new investments, raised nearly $2 billion of strategic capital in a very challenging environment and delivered excellent operating results while serving and growing customer relationships. We're also appreciative of the opportunity we had at our Investor Forum last month to share our vision and outlook for the company over the coming years. The environment is setting up in line or better than our expectations with development starts across the market continuing to decline by two-thirds from peak and an improvement in customer sentiment that appears more constructive than just 90 days ago. That said, we still see challenges in some submarkets as near-term outsized deliveries are met with still recovering demand. But our thesis remains the same as we've been describing for over a year and detailed last month in New York, which is that the supply cliff will converge with normalized demand later this year, delivering an environment conducive to strong market rent growth. We believe that annual market rent growth will average between 4% and 6% over the next three years, with 2024 being modestly positive and ramping thereafter. Turning to our results. We finished the year strong with quarterly core FFO, excluding promotes of $1.29 per share, bringing the full year to the top end of our guidance $5.10 per share. While market occupancy declined by approximately 100 basis points, our portfolio gained 10 basis points to end the year at 97.6%. Net effective rent change over the quarter was 74%, bringing the full year to a record of 77%, with another impressive results out of Southern California at over 150%, a reminder that it remains the strongest market for cash flow growth despite near-term choppiness given the large quantum of its lease mark-to-market. In the end, same-store on a net effective basis was 7.8%, while cash was 8.5%. We started over $2 billion of new developments in the quarter across 46 projects in 27 markets with nearly 50% of the activity in build-to-suit. In Energy and as seen in our new supplemental disclosure, we stand at year end with approximately 515 megawatts of solar and storage in operation with an additional 70 currently under construction. We had a quiet quarter on the financing front, raising approximately $300 million, but our full year of activity closed out at over $12 billion at a weighted average rate of 4.5% and term of 10 years. Our total debt portfolio remains at an overall in-place rate of just 3% with more than nine years of average remaining life. Turning to market conditions. The increase in fourth quarter market vacancy was in line with our expectations and driven by demand that remained moderate as customers exercised caution in their spending, while completions hit an all-time high. Development starts, however, have continued to fall across the U.S. and Europe, extending and deepening the future supply shortfall. On the ground, our teams are seeing revived customer interest with healthy showing activity to start the year. This includes build-to-suit inquiries, which we expect to remain active for Prologis following a strong year in 2023. Our proprietary metrics point to normal levels of activity with proposals and gestation timing in line or a bit better than historical norms. Utilization declined in the quarter to approximately 83% and keeping with this morning's report a decrease in the inventory to sales ratio. We view this positively because utilization also increased from here as stronger than expected retail sales over the fourth quarter and holiday season drove lower inventories, which will need to be replenished. Turning to market rents. Our global view is that rents declined this quarter by 90 basis points, but predominantly impacted by an estimated 7% decline in Southern California. Our full year view is that global market rents grew by 6%, just below our expectations, ultimately driving our lease mark-to-market to end the quarter at 57% after capturing approximately $100 million in realized NOI growth from leases rolling up to market. The outlier on rent growth is clearly Southern California. While our portfolio was only 2.6% vacant at year end, growing availability has made leasing very competitive. Combined with a 110% increase in rents since 2020, the rent retracement is understandable. Historically, there has never been a market where the delta between expiring and market rents has been so large that it provides ample room for property owners to deviate from market in order to attract customers. But looking ahead, the positive news is that we are launching two trends reverse. The first is that the supply pipeline is clearly emptying with little in the way of new starts. And the second is that the escalating issues in both the Suez and Panama canals together with the resolution of the West Coast labor negotiations are moving shipment volumes back to the West. While this bodes well for SoCal and still early, we are watching East Coast port markets more closely. In any event, all of these disruptions are reiterating the underlying need for resiliency and the just in case approach to inventories. Summing this all up globally, we recognize the high volume of near term deliveries that need to be absorbed into our markets over the next few quarters. But we are very pleased with our ability thus far to build occupancy, drive rents, and illustrate more differentiation in our portfolio as market vacancy grows. As for Strategic Capital and Valuations, we saw U.S. values decline approximately 5.5% during the quarter, which was our expectation and the reason we paused our appraisal based activity, which includes calling and redeeming capital as well as asset contributions. We run an industry leading franchise in which we aim to set the standard for governance, including timely, accurate, and independent valuations. Calling out when pronounced lags and valuations emerge has protected investors and demonstrated how we stand apart as a responsible partner. With this quarter's value declines in a more stabilized rate environment, we'll resume activity in USLF including the funding of our $250 million commitment announced in the second half of '23. Turning to guidance and all at our share. In terms of operating metrics, we are guiding average occupancy to range between 96.5% and 97.5% with occupancy likely to step down in the first quarter and rebuild over the course of the year. Cash same-store will range between 8% and 9% and net effective same-store growth will range from 7% to 8%. We are forecasting net G&A to range between $420 million and $440 million and Strategic Capital income to range from $530 million to $550 million. We have a very big year of stabilization activity ahead of us with a range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion, and expected yields of approximately 6.25%. On the new deployment front, we are guiding development starts to range between $3 billion and $3.5 billion with the estimated build to suit mix of 40%. And we plan to take sale portfolios to the market over the year with expected proceeds to range between $800 million and $1.2 billion and additionally forecast $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion in contributions to our Strategic Capital vehicles. In the end, we are forecasting GAAP earnings to range between $3.20 and $3.45 per share. Core FFO excluding promotes will range from $5.50 to $5.64 per share, while core FFO including net promote expense will range between $5.42 and $5.56 per share, each a bit higher than our preliminary guidance at the Investor Forum. While we do not forecast any promote revenue at this time, there are some small opportunities that do exist in FIBRA Prologis and our new PJLF vehicle in Japan. In closing, we know that the market is not yet out of the woods with regards to incoming supply, but the combination of a stronger backdrop continued low level of starts and a calmer capital markets environment has us optimistic that 2024 will be another great year. As you know from our Investor Day, we have many initiatives in flight designed to add value beyond our real estate and because of our real estate. We look forward to continuing to execute on our plan and providing you updates throughout the year. And before we move to Q&A, I'd like to get ahead of questions which have grown a little more frequent in recent quarters surrounding market rent growth. Unintentionally, we set an expectation that we could forecast market rents to a single point of accuracy in increasingly short time periods, and honestly, we're just not that good. We've gotten away from a practice that was originally aimed at being high level and directional. So what we've elected to do in order to help investors without perpetuating the issue is to simply provide high level rent growth expectations on a rolling 12 month forward view. As mentioned earlier, in terms of our three year CAGR of 4% to 6%, we believe we'll see modestly positive rent growth aligned with inflation over the next 12 months and we'll continue to update this rolling view on our future calls. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.\nThomas Catherwood: Excellent. Thank you. Kind of, maybe taking a look at your leasing spreads, obviously very strong performance during the quarter, but also a big spread between Prologis share and the kind of overall portfolio performance, which suggests a stronger performance out of the U.S. Going forward in the '24, are you expecting this gap in performance to tighten at all or should the U.S. continue to lead the way as far as spreads go this year?\nTim Arndt: I'll take that. I think, Tom, that it will actually be relatively similar. There's a pretty long tail on how the lease mark-to-market is going to affect quarterly rent change. It will sustain for quite a while in other words. And since it's much more pronounced in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world, I would expect we do see that continue to stay wide.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, just two quick ones from me. So one, we've been looking at a lot of the broker reports talking about rising availability rates. You guys have flagged it as well. So just curious what you guys are seeing in sort of the Sun Belt markets versus sort of the Coastal. And if that's trending sort of in line or with your expectations and so forth, would be the first. Thanks.\nChris Caton: Hey. It's Chris Caton. I'll take that. So the year is -- or the year closed out with market vacancy rates at mid-5%, just like Tim described, and the vacancy rates remained lower on the coast, excuse me, so both East Coast and West Coast and higher in the Sun Belt. What we are seeing as it relates to pricing is there was better pricing, better rent growth in the Sun Belt markets outperforming the Coast in 2023.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And if I could just follow up on the market rent growth comment. I think you said, rolling 12 months sort of inflationary plus or minus. So, clearly, that's implying sort of an acceleration in '25 and '26, as supply comes down to that. Is that sort of how you guys are thinking about it?\nTim Arndt: That's exactly right.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Mailman: Great. Thanks. Two quick ones here. I guess, first question would be, could you guys just go through what the uptick in property improvements in the CapEx section were? There's a pretty big jump in 4Q versus prior quarters. And then just second, Tim, you had kind of touched on this that tenant sentiment is improving here and there may be better traffic going back to the West Coast with everything going on the Red Sea, and the realization that just in case maybe a more prudent inventory method. But I'm just kind of curious because big tenant leasing has been kind of slower over the last 12 months to 18 months. Are you seeing any early green shoots on that improving as you guys are talking with customers?\nTim Arndt: Yeah. I'll take the first part here, Craig. On the CapEx, if you take a look at the supplemental, I'd first start by widening out on overall CapEx before staring at property improvements and there is just a good example here of the need to look at annual or trailing numbers as this can be a pretty volatile number quarterly. Here, you can see on the full year as a percentage of our NOI, we are about 14%, roughly 15% the prior year. And yeah, focusing in on property improvements, I'd suggest the same that you have to look at a trailing basis. We do tend to see higher levels of property improvement activity in the fourth quarter, just by nature. But we are catching up on the full year. You can see we averaged $0.12 on the year versus the $0.21 that we had in the quarter. So that's really just a timing issue. One more thing that you can see here is the year-over-year averaged on that basis $0.12 versus the prior year $0.10, and I'd explain that differential as just some inflationary piece. And then, the second would be some deferred maintenance and work that we're executing on the Duke portfolio.\nDan Letter: And maybe -- this is Dan. Craig, on the second part of your question related to tenant sentiment, I would say, at the Investor Day, we had talked about a marginally better tenant sentiment from the Q3 earnings call. And I would say, it's even marginally better than that in the last 30 days. This is fueled by our healthy proposal volumes. Customer dialogs have been strong. 45% of our available space is in discussion right now with active proposals. We've anecdotally had just a number of conversations with our customer-led solutions group. Our build-to-suit conversations are improving as well. Our overall build-to-suit pipeline has grown quarter-over-quarter. So, whether that be some of the issues related to the Red Sea issues and the Canal issues or not, I think Chris will have some comments on that.\nChris Caton: Yeah. I'll just go further, Craig, as it relates to port activity. We went out on a limb in September with the published research report calling for recovery in market share and that is really, really playing out in the port activities. In November, West Coast ports were up 24% year-on-year, inbound shipments are up even more and that will translate to leasing over time.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi. Good morning, team. Tim, earlier you mentioned how development starts are down maybe two-thirds from the peak, and that you're seeing little in terms of new starts broadly. When we look at your own build-to-suit split of development, it is up year-over-year and then that earlier question just on customer sentiment. So, I guess, combining all of those pieces, how do you think that impacts your decision to do spec development versus build-to-suit over the course of this year?\nDan Letter: Caitlin, this is Dan. I'll respond here. A few thoughts for you. First of all, we started just over $1 billion worth of spec in the fourth quarter. So, we had talked over the last several quarters about the decline in starts in the marketplace and that's when we wanted to come out of the gate here with some starts and that's what you're seeing us do right now. We have a pretty healthy guidance here for the 2024 starts, at owned and managed of about $4 billion. And if you think about it, that's 25 million square feet or so of starts that we could be doing this year. And we have a development portfolio right now of about 50 million square feet. So, we've got an appetite for spec. Our build-to-suit volume we think is going to shake out in that 40% range as we've projected. And then keep in mind, we talked about this plenty at the Investor Day, we have $40 billion worth of opportunities in our land bank. And we have the ability to make decisions on a quarterly basis where we're going to build. We own this land in 50 markets around the globe, 300 different sites. So, plenty of opportunities there.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks, and good morning. I just wanted to touch on the development start guidance of $3 billion plus this year. Can you just help us break that down versus -- so traditional industrial versus like data centers or other property types? And does the pre-lease percentage that you're expecting differ a whole lot? And sorry to add a third here, typically, how long would the data center developments take to cash flow?\nDan Letter: Sure. Ki Bin, this is Dan, I'll hit that. First of all, we gave some guidance on our data center business 30 days ago at Investor Day. We talked about over the next five years, 20 or so opportunities, 3 gigawatts of data centers, $7 billion to $8 billion worth of investment. Those numbers have not changed. As a matter of fact, one thing we couldn't disclose at Investor Day was, we started over $500 million worth of data centers in the fourth quarter alone. You won't see us guide to data centers. These are very lumpy deals. And if you think about our data center opportunities, we own over 5,500 buildings. We own or control over 12,000 acres globally. So we have one of the most important components of data centers. We control the land, right? We talked about power applications at Investor Day. We talked about a number below 50, that number is now approaching 60. Our team is very active growing that data center pipeline. Then the third component of it would be customers and we're talking to the big hyperscalers on a regular basis. And we think it's prudent for us to be careful on how we project out what our data center volume will be because there is a competitive nature to this as well. We're negotiating with these customers and we think it's important for us. So we will absolutely share with you, when these projects are on the horizon. But right now, our start volume is largely industrial. And then keep in mind, our data centers business is a part of our long -- higher and better use business we're going to build. We're going to merchant build these and we're going to recycle that capital into the business we love so much which is logistics.\nTim Arndt: Yeah. So your question about how long it will take them to cash flow and there is a wider range than traditional industrial. But I would say on kind of powered shell, it's more in the 12 month to 15 month range from start. And on turnkey, depending on who does it and whether the customer does it or we do it, it could be longer than that by about a year, because since the installations are pretty complicated to get these going. But all of that is built into the budgets and the economics of the transaction. And this point that Dan made on the negotiating posture is really important. I mean, the last thing we want to do, there are four or five customers out there and it's pretty obvious given the scale of the numbers they can figure out which project is in our guidance for the next quarter if we wanted to go in that direction, and that basically reduces our leverage. So we're just not going to do that.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jay Poskitt with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nJay Poskitt: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I was wondering, if you could just provide a little bit of commentary on the supply and demand trends over the next couple of quarters. You previously said that you think deliveries will outpace demand for the next couple of quarters and then the inverse will happen after that. So just any update on that would be great.\nChris Caton: Hi, Jay. It's Chris Caton. So we project 250 million square feet of net absorption in the calendar year and 285 million square feet of completions. And yeah, that's going to be front-end loaded, particularly on the supply side. And so we think you'll see the vacancy rate rise by another 50 basis points to 75 basis points here in the first half of the year, peaking at 6% maybe 6.1%, and then making a meaningful move through the subsequent rest of the year and into 2025 and 2026 based on the trend in starts that we've profiled for you.\nTim Arndt: Let me just punctuate that, the vacancy rates will go up through the second quarter. So don't be surprised by that. But we're pretty confident they'll come back down after that.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nNicholas Yulico: Thanks. I just wanted to go back to the space utilization comment you made, Tim, about feeling that at this point retailers like we have to restock inventories. So this is actually a good sign where space utilization is. I guess, I'm wondering, if you could give us some reminder sort of seasonally how this may play out historically in terms of leasing demand picking up from 3PL or retailers because of that issue of restocking? And then, as well in terms of the lease proposals picking up in the fourth quarter, if you had any benefit already from that industry, or even anecdotally, you could talk a little bit about the discussions there. Thanks.\nTim Arndt: Yeah. So the easy way of thinking about this is -- is this -- basically absorption and demand for our product follows a one, two, three, four scenario, as you move through the quarters, it's back end loaded towards the fourth quarter. And that's historically been the relationship because so much of the activity occurs in the fourth quarter and so much of that activity would have been based on anticipation laid earlier in terms of the Christmas season, so much of the sales are in the Christmas season, that volatility is the most in the fourth quarter. This year, our retail sales and in particular e-com sales were better than people's expectations. And the retailers were cut short in '21, they were a little overstocked in '22 and now they were back to being very careful with inventories. So they got cut in short of inventories again. That's why utilization is done. They're schizophrenic. They always have too much or too little. You can never get it right. And the good news is that this Christmas season was stronger than everybody anticipated. It's going to take for that to work its way back to normal.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nBlaine Heck: Great. Thanks. Can you just talk broadly about valuations in cap rates? And given the continued movement in the 10 year, I guess, do you think that pricing is adjusted correctly or could we see continued volatility in the near term? And I guess does that potential volatility present you with any investment opportunities?\nTim Arndt: Yeah. We don't think the real pricing and real returns have really changed because a return expectation should have been higher six months ago because the higher treasury rates. But nobody was trading based on those higher return requirements. So nothing really happened. So it was a theoretical decline in values. I think with the treasuries now having come down, I know they've gone up a little bit just most recently, but net-net, they're down. I think the reality is the expectations of the market participants and the theoretical pricing of assets is converging. Bottom line, we think we're seeing the near bottom valuations, both in the U.S. and Europe. And I think with this level of stability and sort of bottom forming, you'll see more volume coming through in terms of real deals.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Another supply demand question, but just as we think about the cliff of new deliveries coming online, it sounds like that, that drops off in the second quarter. Is there an extended period of time where we're going to need to lease these up? And so the inflection when supply gets better and then combined with what you're seeing on the demand side, does that mean that -- does that happen through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, or is that kind of happening just as soon as the deliveries slow? Thanks.\nChris Caton: Hi. It's Chris. So I'll start off by offering, look, the vacancy rate is going to go up to 6%. Hamid and I are very clear or the whole team is clear on that. Bear in mind that's a very low level in the context of history. And so, yes, it will take -- there'll be time for vacancy to decline to soak up that availability, but it's going from a low level to an even lower level. So it's a bit like the vacancy rate is going to go from 6%, it's going to move to 5.5% and likely to 5%, given the supply cliff that we see.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nCamille Bonnel: Hi. Good morning. Your outlook for development stabilizations is quite positive despite the supply environment remaining elevated for the first half of this year. So could you just expand on what the expected timing is around for this? And then, if you can just follow up a little bit more on your comments around tenant inventory. What are they telling you in terms of how they plan to adapt to any persisting disruption around East Coast ports? Thank you.\nDan Letter: Camille, this is Dan. I'll start with your question on stabilization. It is a big year on stabilizations for us. We actually started the year out with some good news. Late December, we actually pulled in for stabilizations that we had expected to happen in the first quarter of 2024. But overall, the timing of those stabilizations, it's spread out pretty well throughout the year. And one number I would just point to is, that 2024 stabilization volume is 46% leased already, which is actually 300 basis points, 400 basis points above the average at this point over the last several years.\nChris Caton: Hey, Camille. It's Chris. I want to jump in on the disruption of the ports. We are really just now seeing the diversions, as it relates to disruptions in both Panama and the Red Sea and Suez. And so, it's a bit early for us to see real medium term leasing decisions in response to these disruptions. But number one is the clarification or the ratification of the labor agreement on the West Coast is providing a clear landscape for decision making and engines of growth are beginning to kick in in Southern California.\nDan Letter: Let me make that point a little stronger. I think all this concern about LA is over, and it hasn't shown up in the numbers yet, but it will in the next six months. So, I don't think we'll be sitting here on calls like this worrying about LA and its absorption. Now, will we worry about something else? I'm sure we will. I don't know whether that's going to be the East Coast or Houston or whatever. But yeah, I mean, you've seen two big movements. It's not just Suez, it's also Panama Canal and the water issues there. And the expense of shipping stuff through the canal is leading to more reversion back to the normal way of doing it, which is getting it to LA and then land, bridging it over, but there could be other disruptions. It could be something can blow up in the Persian Gulf. So it's very hard to predict those things. The big message is this, we can spend a lot of time guessing as to what the share of West Coast is, East Coast is, all of that. The point is, people thought COVID was the big unknown factor. And now that COVID is over, the world is going to go back to a stable, predictable, just in time type of inventory strategy. I think each one of these things, whether it's Panama, whether it's Suez, whether it's -- or in the Middle East, whether it's something in the Persian Gulf, will remind people that they generally need to have a more conservative inventory strategy. And that's the big long term driver which is going to be a tailwind for demand that we haven't really seen play out just yet. We're pretty confident that will.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Mueller: Yeah. Hi. Do your comments about seeing revived customer interest apply to big-box leasing as well?\nTim Arndt: Yeah. In fact, I would say, some of the largest customers that we talk to, are to -- use an overused word. There are definitely some green shoots. Their posture is changing from that of let's hold off. And they've held off as long as they can because they're building out their networks, particularly on the e-com side. And I think given that the economy hasn't tanked like everybody thought it would a year and a half ago, I think they're tiptoeing out there, and with the first couple of doing it, I think the rest will follow. So, I think, yeah, the big-box guys are coming out of the shadows and taking up some space again.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. On your commentary on Southern California coming -- rents coming down 7%. Can you give the same color on New York, New Jersey? That's a market you've seen a larger decline sequentially in occupancy, and not you're discussing issues with port volumes and the canals.\nTim Arndt: We are not going to get into quarterly rent forecast and we're not going to get into market-by-market forecast. We run a 1.2 billion square foot business. And I think we already, in terms of a company of our size and disclosure and details, are definitely in the 99th percentile. And we just don't have that ability. So we're not going to put some numbers out there that we can't be certain of. So, if you don't mind just let's stay away from that fine level of dissection beyond our ability.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Nick Thillman with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nNicholas Thillman: You guys touched on a little bit on the [Technical Difficulty]. At your Investor Forum, you kind of mentioned that you expected ex-U.S. to outperform U.S. in a market rent growth standpoint. It's still -- is that still the case? And then maybe could you just highlight some markets that you're a little bit more incrementally positive on over the last 30 days of activity? Thanks.\nChris Caton: Hi. It's Chris. Yeah. Indeed, we saw international outperform in the fourth quarter. Our view is that it'll outperform in 2024. And there are wide range of international markets that are enjoying really strong market rent growth. Latin America, both Brazil and Mexico. Turning to Europe, probably Northern Europe is the strongest, and then here in North America, Toronto is a market that's also enjoying outsized growth.\nTim Arndt: Yeah. UK is outperforming too.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nVikram Malhotra: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones. So, just first of all going back, Chris, I guess to your comment around 250 million in demand, if I heard that correctly in '24. Can you just give us what's the actual number in '23, you're comparing that to? And with your leading indicators just how long does the -- do the leading indicator sort of take in terms of conversion to leases? So, that's just the first one to understand the comparison of the trajectory. And then second, do you mind just giving us some specifics on what you're baking in for numbers for cash rent spreads and where portfolio mark-to-market is? Thank you.\nChris Caton: Hey. It's Chris. Thanks for the question, Vikram. I'll take the first one. So, 250 million square feet of net absorption in 2024 compared to 192 million square feet of net absorption in 2023. And we consult a wide range of leading indicators, some of which are contemporary and some that have a nine months to 12-month lease.\nTim Arndt: Vikram, I'll take on the -- excuse me, it's Tim, on the lease mark-to-market. I'll just say again, I don't particularly value the cash view of the lease mark-to-market. I think it's fraught with a few issues. But to answer the question, we saw that 49% at the end of the year. And I would expect, we've seen a pretty wide divergence in cash to net effective of rent spreads because of a few things, the absolute level rents has been so high and the bumps has been pretty large around 4% as you've known. So the roughtly...\nChris Caton: And also Duke.\nTim Arndt: Duke is a factor as well, of course. So, the roughly 20, 25 points that we've been seeing lately, I expect we'll see mostly continue into next year.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Just wanted to ask about capital deployment, two questions actually. First, can you talk a little bit more about the acquisition pipeline today and whether you are seeing an increase in seller interest to transact more deals coming to market and more product hitting the market? And then second, the spread between stabilized yields and cap rates for both development stabilizations and new starts narrowed in the quarter, can you talk a little bit about that trend in spreads and what we might expect in '24, particularly as you move forward? Just given the mix of build-to-suits in spec developments and some of the higher and better-use projects that you're ramping up on.\nDan Letter: Todd, this is Dan. I'll respond to your questions here. First of all, yes, is the quick answer to your first part of the question regarding the acquisition pipeline. Our teams are out there, turning over every stone, but it was a low-volume year in the marketplace last year and I expect that to be much, much higher this year. So, very strong acquisition pipeline. And then spreads on the stabilized yields in our development portfolio, yeah, we've been talking for the last several quarters about that tightening. I remember five, six quarters ago talking about cap rate expansion and that spread tightening and what that would do to impact overall development portfolio. And that really just has to do with the cost of capital, volatile capital markets and who knows where that's going to go from here. It's certainly going to have something to do with the tenure and what the tenure does and the volatility in the capital markets. But overall, we build in forward risk in our overall development portfolio for the numbers that you actually see in that spread. Go ahead, Tim.\nChris Caton: Yeah. I'll just highlight, I think if we look at the development portfolio, see the margin they are estimated at 22. Historically, that's still a very good margin. And under conservative, underwriting assumptions, I would remind everybody we've got an inflated cost to carry. And there we've got longer lease-up times and things that we expect that will be. So I am pretty confident will be several points above that estimated margin anyway.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Carroll: Yeah. Thanks. I guess, maybe Chris, can you provide some color on tenants' mindsets to adding more inventory? I mean, is it fair to say that tenants, or at least some tenants have delayed these decisions over the past year, just due to the macro uncertainty? And what does this change may have customer discussions changed at all given the holiday season that you kind of highlighted and how they didn't have enough inventory levels. I mean, has that been changing, are they ready to make those investments today?\nChris Caton: Hey, Mike. It's Chris. I think you might have answered your own question, totally agree with the sentiment in the direction you're taking it. And there's likely to be a different posture going forward. And then I'd also look, propose that you can also reach out to them and get their feedback.\nTim Arndt: Yeah. I bet you that answer is, they have no idea. I mean, it's just been since 16 days, right? 16, 17 days since the end of the year. Many of them haven't even added up their numbers and I think those guys don't come out with earnings releases until much later. So with Michael's question, that was the last one. I wanted to thank you for not only this call but also attending our Investor Day, we got a lot of great feedback from you and we'll make these things better and better over time and look forward to talking to you next quarter, if not before. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Chris Caton",
            "content": "Hey. It's Chris Caton. I'll take that. So the year is -- or the year closed out with market vacancy rates at mid-5%, just like Tim described, and the vacancy rates remained lower on the coast, excuse me, so both East Coast and West Coast and higher in the Sun Belt. What we are seeing as it relates to pricing is there was better pricing, better rent growth in the Sun Belt markets outperforming the Coast in 2023. Yeah. I'll just go further, Craig, as it relates to port activity. We went out on a limb in September with the published research report calling for recovery in market share and that is really, really playing out in the port activities. In November, West Coast ports were up 24% year-on-year, inbound shipments are up even more and that will translate to leasing over time. Hi, Jay. It's Chris Caton. So we project 250 million square feet of net absorption in the calendar year and 285 million square feet of completions. And yeah, that's going to be front-end loaded, particularly on the supply side. And so we think you'll see the vacancy rate rise by another 50 basis points to 75 basis points here in the first half of the year, peaking at 6% maybe 6.1%, and then making a meaningful move through the subsequent rest of the year and into 2025 and 2026 based on the trend in starts that we've profiled for you. Hi. It's Chris. So I'll start off by offering, look, the vacancy rate is going to go up to 6%. Hamid and I are very clear or the whole team is clear on that. Bear in mind that's a very low level in the context of history. And so, yes, it will take -- there'll be time for vacancy to decline to soak up that availability, but it's going from a low level to an even lower level. So it's a bit like the vacancy rate is going to go from 6%, it's going to move to 5.5% and likely to 5%, given the supply cliff that we see. Hey, Camille. It's Chris. I want to jump in on the disruption of the ports. We are really just now seeing the diversions, as it relates to disruptions in both Panama and the Red Sea and Suez. And so, it's a bit early for us to see real medium term leasing decisions in response to these disruptions. But number one is the clarification or the ratification of the labor agreement on the West Coast is providing a clear landscape for decision making and engines of growth are beginning to kick in in Southern California. Hi. It's Chris. Yeah. Indeed, we saw international outperform in the fourth quarter. Our view is that it'll outperform in 2024. And there are wide range of international markets that are enjoying really strong market rent growth. Latin America, both Brazil and Mexico. Turning to Europe, probably Northern Europe is the strongest, and then here in North America, Toronto is a market that's also enjoying outsized growth. Hey. It's Chris. Thanks for the question, Vikram. I'll take the first one. So, 250 million square feet of net absorption in 2024 compared to 192 million square feet of net absorption in 2023. And we consult a wide range of leading indicators, some of which are contemporary and some that have a nine months to 12-month lease. And also Duke. Yeah. I'll just highlight, I think if we look at the development portfolio, see the margin they are estimated at 22. Historically, that's still a very good margin. And under conservative, underwriting assumptions, I would remind everybody we've got an inflated cost to carry. And there we've got longer lease-up times and things that we expect that will be. So I am pretty confident will be several points above that estimated margin anyway. Hey, Mike. It's Chris.

            "name": "Dan Letter",
            "content": "And maybe -- this is Dan. Craig, on the second part of your question related to tenant sentiment, I would say, at the Investor Day, we had talked about a marginally better tenant sentiment from the Q3 earnings call. And I would say, it's even marginally better than that in the last 30 days. This is fueled by our healthy proposal volumes. Customer dialogs have been strong. 45% of our available space is in discussion right now with active proposals. We've anecdotally had just a number of conversations with our customer-led solutions group. Our build-to-suit conversations are improving as well. Our overall build-to-suit pipeline has grown quarter-over-quarter. So, whether that be some of the issues related to the Red Sea issues and the Canal issues or not, I think Chris will have some comments on that. Caitlin, this is Dan. I'll respond here. A few thoughts for you. First of all, we started just over $1 billion worth of spec in the fourth quarter. So, we had talked over the last several quarters about the decline in starts in the marketplace and that's when we wanted to come out of the gate here with some starts and that's what you're seeing us do right now. We have a pretty healthy guidance here for the 2024 starts, at owned and managed of about $4 billion. And if you think about it, that's 25 million square feet or so of starts that we could be doing this year. And we have a development portfolio right now of about 50 million square feet. So, we've got an appetite for spec. Our build-to-suit volume we think is going to shake out in that 40% range as we've projected. And then keep in mind, we talked about this plenty at the Investor Day, we have $40 billion worth of opportunities in our land bank. And we have the ability to make decisions on a quarterly basis where we're going to build. We own this land in 50 markets around the globe, 300 different sites. So, plenty of opportunities there. Sure. Ki Bin, this is Dan, I'll hit that. First of all, we gave some guidance on our data center business 30 days ago at Investor Day. We talked about over the next five years, 20 or so opportunities, 3 gigawatts of data centers, $7 billion to $8 billion worth of investment. Those numbers have not changed. As a matter of fact, one thing we couldn't disclose at Investor Day was, we started over $500 million worth of data centers in the fourth quarter alone. You won't see us guide to data centers. These are very lumpy deals. And if you think about our data center opportunities, we own over 5,500 buildings. We own or control over 12,000 acres globally. So we have one of the most important components of data centers. We control the land, right? We talked about power applications at Investor Day. We talked about a number below 50, that number is now approaching 60. Our team is very active growing that data center pipeline. Then the third component of it would be customers and we're talking to the big hyperscalers on a regular basis. And we think it's prudent for us to be careful on how we project out what our data center volume will be because there is a competitive nature to this as well. We're negotiating with these customers and we think it's important for us. So we will absolutely share with you, when these projects are on the horizon. But right now, our start volume is largely industrial. And then keep in mind, our data centers business is a part of our long -- higher and better use business we're going to build. We're going to merchant build these and we're going to recycle that capital into the business we love so much which is logistics. Camille, this is Dan. I'll start with your question on stabilization. It is a big year on stabilizations for us. We actually started the year out with some good news. Late December, we actually pulled in for stabilizations that we had expected to happen in the first quarter of 2024. But overall, the timing of those stabilizations, it's spread out pretty well throughout the year. And one number I would just point to is, that 2024 stabilization volume is 46% leased already, which is actually 300 basis points, 400 basis points above the average at this point over the last several years. Let me make that point a little stronger. I think all this concern about LA is over, and it hasn't shown up in the numbers yet, but it will in the next six months. So, I don't think we'll be sitting here on calls like this worrying about LA and its absorption. Now, will we worry about something else? I'm sure we will. I don't know whether that's going to be the East Coast or Houston or whatever. But yeah, I mean, you've seen two big movements. It's not just Suez, it's also Panama Canal and the water issues there. And the expense of shipping stuff through the canal is leading to more reversion back to the normal way of doing it, which is getting it to LA and then land, bridging it over, but there could be other disruptions. It could be something can blow up in the Persian Gulf. So it's very hard to predict those things. The big message is this, we can spend a lot of time guessing as to what the share of West Coast is, East Coast is, all of that. The point is, people thought COVID was the big unknown factor. And now that COVID is over, the world is going to go back to a stable, predictable, just in time type of inventory strategy. I think each one of these things, whether it's Panama, whether it's Suez, whether it's -- or in the Middle East, whether it's something in the Persian Gulf, will remind people that they generally need to have a more conservative inventory strategy. And that's the big long term driver which is going to be a tailwind for demand that we haven't really seen play out just yet. We're pretty confident that will. Todd, this is Dan. I'll respond to your questions here. First of all, yes, is the quick answer to your first part of the question regarding the acquisition pipeline. Our teams are out there, turning over every stone, but it was a low-volume year in the marketplace last year and I expect that to be much, much higher this year. So, very strong acquisition pipeline. And then spreads on the stabilized yields in our development portfolio, yeah, we've been talking for the last several quarters about that tightening. I remember five, six quarters ago talking about cap rate expansion and that spread tightening and what that would do to impact overall development portfolio. And that really just has to do with the cost of capital, volatile capital markets and who knows where that's going to go from here. It's certainly going to have something to do with the tenure and what the tenure does and the volatility in the capital markets. But overall, we build in forward risk in our overall development portfolio for the numbers that you actually see in that spread. Go ahead, Tim."

            "name": "Tim Arndt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jill. I'd like to start our call by recognizing and thanking our team for the incredible effort given over 2023. While it was a turbulent year in many ways, we ended it by delivering nearly 11% earnings growth and driving our 12-year earnings CAGR since merger to 10.3%. We deployed over $7 billion into new investments, raised nearly $2 billion of strategic capital in a very challenging environment and delivered excellent operating results while serving and growing customer relationships. We're also appreciative of the opportunity we had at our Investor Forum last month to share our vision and outlook for the company over the coming years. The environment is setting up in line or better than our expectations with development starts across the market continuing to decline by two-thirds from peak and an improvement in customer sentiment that appears more constructive than just 90 days ago. That said, we still see challenges in some submarkets as near-term outsized deliveries are met with still recovering demand. But our thesis remains the same as we've been describing for over a year and detailed last month in New York, which is that the supply cliff will converge with normalized demand later this year, delivering an environment conducive to strong market rent growth. We believe that annual market rent growth will average between 4% and 6% over the next three years, with 2024 being modestly positive and ramping thereafter. Turning to our results. We finished the year strong with quarterly core FFO, excluding promotes of $1.29 per share, bringing the full year to the top end of our guidance $5.10 per share. While market occupancy declined by approximately 100 basis points, our portfolio gained 10 basis points to end the year at 97.6%. Net effective rent change over the quarter was 74%, bringing the full year to a record of 77%, with another impressive results out of Southern California at over 150%, a reminder that it remains the strongest market for cash flow growth despite near-term choppiness given the large quantum of its lease mark-to-market. In the end, same-store on a net effective basis was 7.8%, while cash was 8.5%. We started over $2 billion of new developments in the quarter across 46 projects in 27 markets with nearly 50% of the activity in build-to-suit. In Energy and as seen in our new supplemental disclosure, we stand at year end with approximately 515 megawatts of solar and storage in operation with an additional 70 currently under construction. We had a quiet quarter on the financing front, raising approximately $300 million, but our full year of activity closed out at over $12 billion at a weighted average rate of 4.5% and term of 10 years. Our total debt portfolio remains at an overall in-place rate of just 3% with more than nine years of average remaining life. Turning to market conditions. The increase in fourth quarter market vacancy was in line with our expectations and driven by demand that remained moderate as customers exercised caution in their spending, while completions hit an all-time high. Development starts, however, have continued to fall across the U.S. and Europe, extending and deepening the future supply shortfall. On the ground, our teams are seeing revived customer interest with healthy showing activity to start the year. This includes build-to-suit inquiries, which we expect to remain active for Prologis following a strong year in 2023. Our proprietary metrics point to normal levels of activity with proposals and gestation timing in line or a bit better than historical norms. Utilization declined in the quarter to approximately 83% and keeping with this morning's report a decrease in the inventory to sales ratio. We view this positively because utilization also increased from here as stronger than expected retail sales over the fourth quarter and holiday season drove lower inventories, which will need to be replenished. Turning to market rents. Our global view is that rents declined this quarter by 90 basis points, but predominantly impacted by an estimated 7% decline in Southern California. Our full year view is that global market rents grew by 6%, just below our expectations, ultimately driving our lease mark-to-market to end the quarter at 57% after capturing approximately $100 million in realized NOI growth from leases rolling up to market. The outlier on rent growth is clearly Southern California. While our portfolio was only 2.6% vacant at year end, growing availability has made leasing very competitive. Combined with a 110% increase in rents since 2020, the rent retracement is understandable. Historically, there has never been a market where the delta between expiring and market rents has been so large that it provides ample room for property owners to deviate from market in order to attract customers. But looking ahead, the positive news is that we are launching two trends reverse. The first is that the supply pipeline is clearly emptying with little in the way of new starts. And the second is that the escalating issues in both the Suez and Panama canals together with the resolution of the West Coast labor negotiations are moving shipment volumes back to the West. While this bodes well for SoCal and still early, we are watching East Coast port markets more closely. In any event, all of these disruptions are reiterating the underlying need for resiliency and the just in case approach to inventories. Summing this all up globally, we recognize the high volume of near term deliveries that need to be absorbed into our markets over the next few quarters. But we are very pleased with our ability thus far to build occupancy, drive rents, and illustrate more differentiation in our portfolio as market vacancy grows. As for Strategic Capital and Valuations, we saw U.S. values decline approximately 5.5% during the quarter, which was our expectation and the reason we paused our appraisal based activity, which includes calling and redeeming capital as well as asset contributions. We run an industry leading franchise in which we aim to set the standard for governance, including timely, accurate, and independent valuations. Calling out when pronounced lags and valuations emerge has protected investors and demonstrated how we stand apart as a responsible partner. With this quarter's value declines in a more stabilized rate environment, we'll resume activity in USLF including the funding of our $250 million commitment announced in the second half of '23. Turning to guidance and all at our share. In terms of operating metrics, we are guiding average occupancy to range between 96.5% and 97.5% with occupancy likely to step down in the first quarter and rebuild over the course of the year. Cash same-store will range between 8% and 9% and net effective same-store growth will range from 7% to 8%. We are forecasting net G&A to range between $420 million and $440 million and Strategic Capital income to range from $530 million to $550 million. We have a very big year of stabilization activity ahead of us with a range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion, and expected yields of approximately 6.25%. On the new deployment front, we are guiding development starts to range between $3 billion and $3.5 billion with the estimated build to suit mix of 40%. And we plan to take sale portfolios to the market over the year with expected proceeds to range between $800 million and $1.2 billion and additionally forecast $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion in contributions to our Strategic Capital vehicles. In the end, we are forecasting GAAP earnings to range between $3.20 and $3.45 per share. Core FFO excluding promotes will range from $5.50 to $5.64 per share, while core FFO including net promote expense will range between $5.42 and $5.56 per share, each a bit higher than our preliminary guidance at the Investor Forum. While we do not forecast any promote revenue at this time, there are some small opportunities that do exist in FIBRA Prologis and our new PJLF vehicle in Japan. In closing, we know that the market is not yet out of the woods with regards to incoming supply, but the combination of a stronger backdrop continued low level of starts and a calmer capital markets environment has us optimistic that 2024 will be another great year. As you know from our Investor Day, we have many initiatives in flight designed to add value beyond our real estate and because of our real estate. We look forward to continuing to execute on our plan and providing you updates throughout the year. And before we move to Q&A, I'd like to get ahead of questions which have grown a little more frequent in recent quarters surrounding market rent growth. Unintentionally, we set an expectation that we could forecast market rents to a single point of accuracy in increasingly short time periods, and honestly, we're just not that good. We've gotten away from a practice that was originally aimed at being high level and directional. So what we've elected to do in order to help investors without perpetuating the issue is to simply provide high level rent growth expectations on a rolling 12 month forward view. As mentioned earlier, in terms of our three year CAGR of 4% to 6%, we believe we'll see modestly positive rent growth aligned with inflation over the next 12 months and we'll continue to update this rolling view on our future calls. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator? I'll take that. I think, Tom, that it will actually be relatively similar. There's a pretty long tail on how the lease mark-to-market is going to affect quarterly rent change. It will sustain for quite a while in other words. And since it's much more pronounced in the U.S. than anywhere else in the world, I would expect we do see that continue to stay wide. That's exactly right. Yeah. I'll take the first part here, Craig. On the CapEx, if you take a look at the supplemental, I'd first start by widening out on overall CapEx before staring at property improvements and there is just a good example here of the need to look at annual or trailing numbers as this can be a pretty volatile number quarterly. Here, you can see on the full year as a percentage of our NOI, we are about 14%, roughly 15% the prior year. And yeah, focusing in on property improvements, I'd suggest the same that you have to look at a trailing basis. We do tend to see higher levels of property improvement activity in the fourth quarter, just by nature. But we are catching up on the full year. You can see we averaged $0.12 on the year versus the $0.21 that we had in the quarter. So that's really just a timing issue. One more thing that you can see here is the year-over-year averaged on that basis $0.12 versus the prior year $0.10, and I'd explain that differential as just some inflationary piece. And then, the second would be some deferred maintenance and work that we're executing on the Duke portfolio. Yeah. So your question about how long it will take them to cash flow and there is a wider range than traditional industrial. But I would say on kind of powered shell, it's more in the 12 month to 15 month range from start. And on turnkey, depending on who does it and whether the customer does it or we do it, it could be longer than that by about a year, because since the installations are pretty complicated to get these going. But all of that is built into the budgets and the economics of the transaction. And this point that Dan made on the negotiating posture is really important. I mean, the last thing we want to do, there are four or five customers out there and it's pretty obvious given the scale of the numbers they can figure out which project is in our guidance for the next quarter if we wanted to go in that direction, and that basically reduces our leverage. So we're just not going to do that. Let me just punctuate that, the vacancy rates will go up through the second quarter. So don't be surprised by that. But we're pretty confident they'll come back down after that. Yeah. So the easy way of thinking about this is -- is this -- basically absorption and demand for our product follows a one, two, three, four scenario, as you move through the quarters, it's back end loaded towards the fourth quarter. And that's historically been the relationship because so much of the activity occurs in the fourth quarter and so much of that activity would have been based on anticipation laid earlier in terms of the Christmas season, so much of the sales are in the Christmas season, that volatility is the most in the fourth quarter. This year, our retail sales and in particular e-com sales were better than people's expectations. And the retailers were cut short in '21, they were a little overstocked in '22 and now they were back to being very careful with inventories. So they got cut in short of inventories again. That's why utilization is done. They're schizophrenic. They always have too much or too little. You can never get it right. And the good news is that this Christmas season was stronger than everybody anticipated. It's going to take for that to work its way back to normal. Yeah. We don't think the real pricing and real returns have really changed because a return expectation should have been higher six months ago because the higher treasury rates. But nobody was trading based on those higher return requirements. So nothing really happened. So it was a theoretical decline in values. I think with the treasuries now having come down, I know they've gone up a little bit just most recently, but net-net, they're down. I think the reality is the expectations of the market participants and the theoretical pricing of assets is converging. Bottom line, we think we're seeing the near bottom valuations, both in the U.S. and Europe. And I think with this level of stability and sort of bottom forming, you'll see more volume coming through in terms of real deals. Yeah. In fact, I would say, some of the largest customers that we talk to, are to -- use an overused word. There are definitely some green shoots. Their posture is changing from that of let's hold off. And they've held off as long as they can because they're building out their networks, particularly on the e-com side. And I think given that the economy hasn't tanked like everybody thought it would a year and a half ago, I think they're tiptoeing out there, and with the first couple of doing it, I think the rest will follow. So, I think, yeah, the big-box guys are coming out of the shadows and taking up some space again. We are not going to get into quarterly rent forecast and we're not going to get into market-by-market forecast. We run a 1.2 billion square foot business. And I think we already, in terms of a company of our size and disclosure and details, are definitely in the 99th percentile. And we just don't have that ability. So we're not going to put some numbers out there that we can't be certain of. So, if you don't mind just let's stay away from that fine level of dissection beyond our ability. Yeah. UK is outperforming too. Vikram, I'll take on the -- excuse me, it's Tim, on the lease mark-to-market. I'll just say again, I don't particularly value the cash view of the lease mark-to-market. I think it's fraught with a few issues. But to answer the question, we saw that 49% at the end of the year. And I would expect, we've seen a pretty wide divergence in cash to net effective of rent spreads because of a few things, the absolute level rents has been so high and the bumps has been pretty large around 4% as you've known. So the roughtly... Duke is a factor as well, of course. So, the roughly 20, 25 points that we've been seeing lately, I expect we'll see mostly continue into next year. Yeah. I bet you that answer is, they have no idea. I mean, it's just been since 16 days, right? 16, 17 days since the end of the year. Many of them haven't even added up their numbers and I think those guys don't come out with earnings releases until much later. So with Michael's question, that was the last one. I wanted to thank you for not only this call but also attending our Investor Day, we got a lot of great feedback from you and we'll make these things better and better over time and look forward to talking to you next quarter, if not before. Take care."

These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management\u2019s beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our third quarter results press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I\u2019d like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I will hand the call over to Tim.\nTim Arndt: Thanks Jill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. The third quarter marked a continuation of themes we have been anticipating for more than a year, namely; growing supply translating to increased market vacancy; continued moderation of demand; and market rent growth that will slow until the low levels of new starts drive reduced availability over-time. We have operated in accordance with these views in both our approach to leasing, as well as timing of new development. What\u2019s incremental to our forecast is that continued hawkish posture from central banks and the impact it\u2019s had on rates is delaying decision-making and willingness to take expansion space early. The geopolitical backdrop has clearly become more troubling as well amounting to a lack of clarity that will likely weigh on demand. In the meantime, and also playing out to our expectations is that our existing lease mark-to-market will drive durable earnings growth as it did in delivering record rent change this quarter, as well as strong earnings and same-store growth. We remain focused on the fact that we own assets critical to the supply chain with long-term secular drivers that remain intact. Further, the outlook for future supply will continue to face structural barriers, ultimately driving occupancy, rents and values. In terms of our results, we had an excellent quarter with core FFO excluding net promote income of $1.33 per share. This result includes approximately $0.03 of one-time items related to interest and termination income, as well as the timing of expenses, which we can address in Q&A. Occupancy ticked up over the quarter to 97.5%, aided by retention of 77%. Net effective rent change was a record 84% at our share, with notable contributions from Northern New Jersey at 200%, Toronto at 187% and Southern California at 165%. Same-store growth on a net effective and cash basis was 9.3% and 9.5%, respectively, driven predominantly by rent change. We saw market rents grow roughly 60 basis points during the quarter, the slower pace embedded in our forecast. In combination with the strong build of in-place rents, our lease mark-to-market recalculates to 62% as of September. We raised approximately $1.4 billion in new financings at an average interest rate of 3.2%, comprised principally of $760 million within our ventures, as well as a recast of our Yen credit facility increasing our aggregate line availability. In combination with our cash position, we ended the quarter with a record $6.9 billion of liquidity. Finally, it\u2019s noteworthy that our debt-to-EBITDA has remained very low and essentially flat all year, hovering in the mid-4 times range, despite our increased financing activity, a demonstration of the tremendous growth in our nominal EBITDA. Turning to our markets, while rising, vacancy remains historically very low in the U.S., Mexico and Europe. Market vacancy increased approximately 70 basis points during the quarter in the U.S., driven by low absorption, as well as recently delivered but unleased completions. Europe experienced similar dynamics with an overall increase in market vacancy of 50 basis points. At the macro level our expectations for the U.S. are for completions to outpace net absorption by a cumulative 150 million square feet to 200 million square feet over the next three quarters. Then, over the subsequent three quarters, we see that trend reversing with demand exceeding supply and recovering the net 75 million to 125 million square feet. That trend may extend further into 2025, as we believe development starts over the next several quarters are likely to remain low. Whatever the precise path, we expect that as vacancy normalizes over the long-term, our portfolio will outperform the market due to both its location and quality, as well as the strength of our relationships and operating platform. In this regard, our portfolio has been largely resilient to moderating demand. Our teams would describe the depth of our leasing pipeline as consistent with the last few quarters. In coming fresh off of one of our customer advisory board sessions, it\u2019s clear that our customers have plans to continue to expand their footprint, increasing capacity and resiliency. However, what\u2019s also clear is that they are slowing such investments until there is more clarity in the economic environment. In the U.S., rents increased in most of our markets with the strongest located in the Sunbelt, Mid-Atlantic and Northern California regions. Europe and Mexico were also bright spots for growth in the quarter. Rents across our Southern California sub-markets declined approximately 2% as it continues to adjust to higher levels of vacancy. While the markets and outlook are mixed, we remain confident in continued market rent growth in the U.S. and globally over the coming year, albeit at a slow pace while the pipeline continues to get absorbed. From our appraisals, U.S. values declined approximately 3% while European values remain stable, in fact, having a very modest write-up. The difference isn\u2019t too surprising as the Fed\u2019s language around inflation and the economy has had more effect in the U.S. capital markets, driving the 10-year up 100 basis points since our last earnings call, compared to the bund [ph] at just 50 basis points. We believe that this is likely another instance, as we saw one year ago, where U.S. appraisals at the end of the quarter have not had sufficient time to react to the increase in rates and we are thus pausing on appraisal-based activity in USLF for at least one quarter. Elsewhere, values in Mexico are up 8.5%, while China experienced its first meaningful decline of 6.5%, a write-down that we don\u2019t believe has fully run its course. Our funds experienced their first quarter of net positive inflows with approximately $180 million of new commitments versus new redemption requests of $115 million. Given other activity in the quarter, the net redemptions have been reduced from their height of $1.6 billion to approximately $700 million or roughly 2% of third-party AUMs. In terms of our own deployment, development starts ramped up during the quarter, crossing $1 billion, over half of which is related to a data center opportunity in our central region, a testament to our higher and better use strategy and strategically located land bank. Also notable is the acquisition of $118 million of land, including a strategic parcel in Las Vegas, which will build out an additional 10 million square feet over time and brings our total build-out of land globally to over $40 billion. We are laser focused in identifying and executing on value creation in our core business, our energy business, and their adjacencies. Combined with the debt capacity and liquidity we have worked hard to build and preserve, we see the environment as rich with opportunity. Moving to guidance, we are increasing the average occupancy to a range between 97.25% and 97.5%. As a result, we are increasing our same-store guidance to a range of 9% to 9.25% on a net effective basis and 9.75% to 10% on a cash basis. We are maintaining our strategic capital revenue guidance, excluding promotes to a range of $520 million to $530 million and adjusting G&A guidance to range between $390 million and $395 million. Our development starts guidance is increased to a new range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion at our share, driven primarily from the data center start mentioned earlier. We have $500 million of contribution and disposition activity during the quarter and given our commentary on USLF valuations, we are pausing our planned contributions into that vehicle this quarter and reducing our combined contribution and disposition guidance to a range of $1.7 billion to $2.3 billion. In the end, we are adjusting guidance for GAAP earnings to a range of $3.30 per share to $3.35 per share. We are increasing our core FFO, including promotes guidance to a range of $5.58 per share to $5.60 per share and are increasing core FFO, excluding promotes to a range between $5.08 per share and $5.10 per share, growth of nearly 10.5%. I know that many of you are focusing on 2024, so I\u2019d like to take an opportunity to remind you that the Duke portfolio will be entering the same-store pool in 2024, which will widen the recently observed delta between net effective and cash same-store growth. This is, of course, because Duke rents were mark-to-market at close one year ago, so its contribution to net effective same-store growth and earnings will be minimal, even though the cash rent change will be on par with the rest of the Prologis portfolio. In closing, we are navigating the current environment, assured that whatever the economy brings in the short-term, we are positioned to outperform over the long-term. This stems from not only the premier logistics portfolio and customer franchise with one of the best balance sheets amongst corporates, but also highly visible earnings and portfolio growth ahead of us. We know that turbulent times can bring opportunity for those who are prepared and that\u2019s been central to our strategy and management as a company. I\u2019d like to also remind you of our upcoming Investor Forum on December 13th in New York, our first in four years. We are looking forward to spending the day with you, sharing more about our business, outlook and opportunities ahead. Additional information is available on our website and in our earnings press release. And with that, I will hand it back to the Operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I mean, Tim, can you help us reconcile some of the comments from the prepared remarks? You talked about maybe softer demand, but then there\u2019s -- you are calling for accelerating the number of build-to-suit developments. At the same time, occupancy has been stronger than anticipated and that\u2019s before the lower development starts hit the market. So how should we think about all of these moving pieces and just the trajectory of the supply-demand dynamics as we exit 2023 and into 2024? Thanks.\nTim Arndt: Sure. Demand is definitely softer. It\u2019s closer to normal, maybe even a little bit below normal at this instant. There is a lot of latent demand that large companies having large requirements are continuing to talk to us about build-to-suits, but they are reluctant to pull the [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Mailman: Hey, guys. Let me know if you are having trouble hearing me, because I am having trouble hearing you. But I just wanted to touch on the data center build-to-suits in the quarter and see if you guys could break out what the yields on those were relative to the blended yields on the overall development starts? And maybe just give a little bit more color about the opportunity with your partner on this one, the plan on whether you are going to hold this or anticipate selling it upon completion of that and just a little bit more about the capacity within the land bank to do more of the data center sales?\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, please remain on the line. We are just having a difficulty here. Thank you. Please remain on the line.\nTim Arndt: I am sorry. We are having some technical difficulties here and I can\u2019t really explain it.\nCraig Mailman: Hello.\nTim Arndt: Can you guys hear me? You can hear me again. Okay. So let me finish the first question and then I will go to the second question. To the extent I heard it, which wasn\u2019t great. On the first question, what I wanted to say is that, the data centers account for a pretty significant volume of the build-to-suits and that\u2019s why they are higher. But industrial logistics build-to-suits are kind of in par and in line with our expectations. The reason occupancy is higher, it\u2019s unique to the quality of our portfolio and just the natural role of leases, but market occupancy is slightly lower. So we are outperforming the market by more than we did before. I think that covers the first question. The second question was how should we think about the build-to-suits in terms of its effect on our going in yields and the like, and for that, I am going to turn it over to Dan here. But generally, we -- the build-to-suits strategy of ours is an extension of our higher and best-use strategy. We own a lot of high quality land in markets that are in the path of development and are popular data center markets. And while we may occasionally buy land for data centers, our primary strategy is converting our existing portfolio to data center products to the extent they have power availability. We are getting a lot of people knocking on our door for those opportunities and we think going forward, it\u2019s going to be a pretty significant part of our activity, although it\u2019s lumpy and less prone to precise predictions like the logistic business, but you will hear more about that. Now, strategically, this is important to understand. We funded our business without issuing any equity basically since 2012. The last 10 years or 11 years we have not issued any equity. How we financed our business is by disposing of real estate that was non-strategic to us, logistics real estate and we have done a lot of dispositions. You can think of the data center strategy as a way of funding our growth. That\u2019s where the growth capital is going to come from. We are not at the moment interested in being in that business in terms of long-term ownership, it\u2019s more of a development and harvest strategy and that capital that comes out of the margins of those deals will be a substantial contributor to our growth going forward. Dan, you want to talk about the initial yields on the data center?\nDan Letter: Well, what I would say is, on this particular data center, we are under a strict confidentiality. So we can\u2019t be speaking about any particular yield points by any means. But what I would say is, we have been building capabilities internally to ensure that we hit the market for these deals and you will see those play out as we announce more data centers going forward.\nTim Arndt: What I would say, generally, though, without getting specific on this opportunity, we think the margins that come out of our data center business, by definition, based on our historic cost of land or even the market value of land, will be orders of magnitude higher than they would be under logistics build-out. So multiples of a normal margin.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the development and just make sure I understand on the fourth quarter, I think, you have got something like $1.9 billion of planned starts, given that you have done about $1.4 billion year-to-date. So just curious, does that include other data centers or is that all traditional industrial? And if so, what is the mix between spec and build-to-suit on that fourth quarter starts volume? Thanks.\nDan Letter: Sure, Steve. This is Dan. So the lion\u2019s share of our Q4 starts are logistics starts. We have one, maybe two smaller data center starts that we have forecasted. But overall, it\u2019s about 50-50 build-to-suit and spec. And let me just highlight that we have been calling for a back-end loaded forecast for about four quarters now. As we talk about market development starts now at 65% -- I guess down 65% from the peak, this is playing out exactly as we expected and we have been gearing up all year for a really heavy Q4 start volume.\nTim Arndt: Yeah. The portion of build-to-suit is obviously a lot higher than that if you include the data centers. What Dan meant was a mix of logistics and logistics spec versus build-to-suit.\nDan Letter: Correct.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nTodd Thomas: Hi. Thanks. Question, as you think about 2024, Tim, you mentioned that market rent growth increased 60 basis points relative to last quarter. That\u2019s down from 2.5% last quarter. I think you indicated that market rent growth is expected to be positive in the year ahead. As we think about the trajectory of rent growth and what you are anticipating, do you see potential for sequential or year-over-year decreases in market rents in the U.S. or globally over the next few quarters as deliveries outpace absorption or do you expect rent growth to stay positive throughout that period during that timeframe?\nChris Caton: Hey, Todd. It\u2019s Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. Yes. We expect rent growth to remain positive throughout that time period. Market conditions are stable and there are a handful of markets that we have talked about that are softer, but by and large, markets are proving resilient with rent growth in line or ahead of inflation.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, everyone. Maybe we could talk about property acquisitions a little. I know it\u2019s not as large of an activity as developments, but guidance for this year increased while transaction volumes at an industry level are down significantly. You did the $3 billion acquisition mid-year. So what sorts of acquisitions are most interesting to you today? Could you talk a little bit about who you are buying from, maybe why they are selling and how you get comfortable on what the right price should be?\nHamid Moghadam: Sure. It\u2019s a dynamic market and I think that\u2019s the essence of your question. It\u2019s really hard to get a handle on what the returns should be and how we look at acquisitions. But here\u2019s a model for thinking about it. First of all, we are even pickier than we have been with respect to quality and fit with our portfolio. We are not -- before you had to buy the good with the great in portfolios and we had to go through the massive exercise of disposing of the properties that we didn\u2019t want, which we did actually quite successfully in a declining cap rate environment and we actually made money on it, but we don\u2019t expect that to be the case going forward. So we are really being picky about what we buy. The portfolios that we are going to buy are almost virtually 100% whole portfolios. Secondly, if you really think that, look at where treasuries are, 150 basis points have gone to, call it 4.5%, 300 basis points increased. Those kinds of properties, core properties, we are trading in the high 5%s, low 6% IRRs. Let\u2019s stay away from cap rates because of a market-to-market complexity of talking about cap rates. But call it 6%. So just adjusting for the change in treasury yields, simplistically, you would have to see a 9% on leveraged IRR and that\u2019s if supply and demand of capital were sort of in equilibrium. We get a sense that there\u2019s going to be more opportunities coming our way and it is in a capital-constrained environment and we happen to be in the fortunate position of having a really good balance sheet and able to take advantage of those. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be distress in the terms of a post-savings and loan crisis or any of the downturns, but I think the opportunity set is going to exceed the available capital and I think we will be taking advantage of that. So I would say on leveraged IRRs that have a 9% handle on them, maybe as much as 9.5% depending on the circumstances. And we are seeing that supply loosen up and come to the market. So expect to see more transactions in the next six months. Dan, do you have anything to add?\nDan Letter: The only thing I would add is, our teams around the globe are literally turning over every stone daily. And this is land acquisitions, this is core acquisitions, it\u2019s value-add acquisitions and the teams turn to opportunistic right now. So it\u2019s really hard to peg exactly where we are going to land our acquisition volume for the year, which is why you saw us move it up a couple hundred million after this Phoenix transaction. But overall, I think our teams are going to continue to find opportunistic transactions consistent with what Hamid just said on the returns.\nOperator: And the next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, so you are expecting over the next few quarters a significant demand shortfall. And I am wondering if during that time period, are you planning to be more aggressive on rents and concessions to try to hold occupancy or are you going to hold rates just given supply is going to start to come down after that? And also if you could provide an update on the market rental forecast for 2023.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. On the rental forecast, I am afraid you are going to have to wait for that when we issue guidance and we get into that. And one thing we are going to stay away from is quarter-by-quarter forecasting of rents. It\u2019s hard enough to guess what it is on an annual basis, much less on a quarter-to-quarter forecast. So what was the first part of the question? Oh, occupancy trade-off.\nTim Arndt: Occupancy.\nHamid Moghadam: It depends on the actual markets. There are about 20% of the markets that I can see us driving for occupancy and about 80% of the markets that are still in equilibrium or tighter. But the key to your question is what you asked in the middle of it, which is, how do you expect that to change? And the reason we are not going to get super aggressive on rents is because we have a belief that, I mean, just look at the starts. They are down 65% and even with moderating demand, we are going to get something like 60% or 70% of that shortfall that we are going to encounter in the next three quarters shortfall of demand, we are going to get it back in the subsequent three quarters. So there\u2019s no sense really going cheap, it\u2019s just. But I would say 20% of our markets, we are going to be more focused on occupancy.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nNicholas Yulico: Oh! Thanks. Just a two-porter on Southern California. So I guess, first, I wanted to see if you are seeing any benefit in your portfolio since September in terms of the port being resolved, the worker strikes impacting LA Basin or Inland Empire, if you are seeing any benefit there and pick up any activity. And then, secondly, just wanted to hear latest thoughts on why you think some of the weakness that you have cited there in rents in Southern California, what that dynamic is out there that would be different than other markets, meaning that Southern California is not a leading indicator for other parts of your portfolio?\nHamid Moghadam: Well, Southern California is very geared towards basically inflows, 40% of the inflows into this country came through Southern California and that number dropped dramatically because of the labor issues. It\u2019s too soon to see any recovery because we are also going into the Christmas season and anything that\u2019s going to be in a store for Christmas has already been on the water and through the ports and all that. So I think you are going to see the effects of that next year in terms of recovery of flows. About half of what used to come through LA used to stay in the LA Basin, Southern California and half of it was shipped elsewhere. We think the half that stays in Southern California for sure will stay there or come back and some of the rest will also revert back to Southern California. I am not smart enough to know whether we are going to get half of it back or three quarters of it back, but we will get a pretty substantial portion of it back. It will be more into the first quarter or second quarter of next year before you see it in the numbers. Chris, do you want to add anything?\nChris Caton: Yeah. I will build on that by saying as the market is digesting the demand and supply picture that Hamid described. We are beginning to see some differentiation in submarkets where LA, Orange County is proving more resilient and the Inland Empire is a bit softer.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nCamille Bonnel: Good morning. First, a clarification that I want to get your thoughts on guidance. Can you clarify if the SoCal market rent change in the opening remarks is on a sequential or annual basis? And then appreciate majority of your leasing for 2023 has been addressed and there\u2019s little that could change your core outlook from here, but want to better understand the level of conservatives being factored into guidance looking into your end. What could change your views more positively or negatively? Thank you.\nTim Arndt: Hey, Camille. It\u2019s Tim. Yeah. Just a clarification on the first part, that was a quarter-over-quarter number in SoCal, the 2% decline. And then in terms of what could change the fourth quarter, the answer is very little at this point. Certainly on the rent change side of things, most all of that leasing is already inked. We could have some surprises, very moderate I would say on the occupancy side, but I actually don\u2019t expect that. We have a pretty tight range on occupancy as you know. So I don\u2019t think you will see anything take us outside of our guidance.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRon Kamdem: Hey. Just a quick two-parter follow-up. Just one on the development starts and the data centers, which is intriguing. Any way to put some numbers on that on how many starts can be done annually? Is it $200 million, is it $500 million, like how big can this get is the follow-up number one. And then number two on sort of the rent growth, appreciate we want to stay away from sort of specific numbers, but as you are sort of thinking about next year, what are sort of the key markets, Southern California being one, potentially being sort of a headwind? Maybe can you talk about what are some of the neutral or potential tailwinds in terms of markets for next year? Thanks.\nHamid Moghadam: Okay. Your first question was great advertising for our Investor Day because that\u2019s what we are going to devote the time to is understanding our essentials business, our data center business and all those things. So let me defer answering that question to that date. And by the way, even on that date, you are not going to get as specific an answer as you would like. I just tell you that in advance, because these are very lumpy and it depends what quarter or what year a deal lands in. Chris, do you want to address the second part?\nChris Caton: Yeah. Absolutely. I might start by just saying one way to think about rent growth going forward is to think about the replacement cost math. We have really seen construction costs prove resilient and replacement costs prove resilient. And the interest rate dynamic that Hamid described earlier translates to the rents that are required to warrant new development. So over a medium-term horizon, a couple years, that\u2019s going to play one of the most important factors into evaluating rent growth. As it relates to different markets, which was your question, I think, it\u2019s probably fair to point to Tim\u2019s comments on the markets that have proved the strongest so far this year. Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, Northern California are markets that stand out in my mind in the U.S. and there is a range of them globally, whether it\u2019s Toronto, Mexico, Germany and the Netherlands. So that\u2019s what I would look to.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Powell: Hi. Good morning. I guess one more on market rent growth. I think last quarter you gave a 2023 forecast of 7% to 9%. I don\u2019t know if you updated that today and are you going to be providing those kind of updated on a quarterly basis going forward?\nTim Arndt: So, hey, the view is 7% in United -- globally and in the U.S. We are about mid-6s so far this year, so that implies growth in the fourth quarter as we described earlier. And then as it relates to forward guidance, I\u2019d like to underline our upcoming Investor Day in December as the time to look for new information.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Carroll: Yeah. Thanks. How does the 150 million square feet to 200 million square feet gap between supply and demand over the next three quarters compare to your expectation for all of 2023? Now, correct me if I am wrong, I believe that you highlighted that there\u2019s going to be about 150 million square foot gap in 2023. I mean, is that still a fair assumption or has this delay in demand due to the market uncertainty has kind of widened that out a little bit?\nChris Caton: Hi. Thanks for the question. Again, it\u2019s Chris. So, just to give you the total numbers, we are on pace to see 490 million square feet of deliveries in the United States this year against 195 million square feet of net absorption. So that gap is wider. And some of that relates simply not so much to the softness in demand that you are describing, but the timing of deliveries of the pipeline. If anything, our view of where the pipeline\u2019s going has come down, not gone up over the last 90 days related to the trend in starts and so really it\u2019s really timing as it relates to that gap.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. But I would say, our previous forecast did not anticipate the sudden jump in rates that has come in the last month and a half. We thought that treasuries were going to settle in the mid-3s, not mid-4s, maybe mid to high 3s and not mid-4s or approaching 5. So that I think has taken and shifted some of the demand out. But the thing that encourages me and we will have to see -- wait to see this, is that companies are not shutting down their dialogue with us in terms of their long-term needs and are build-to-suit discussions are every bit as good as they have been across most cycles. But they are not pulling the trigger just yet, given that those things generally involve major capital expenditures and those are all being scrutinized by the C-suite pretty tightly these days.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks. I just wanted to get a better sense of, you talked about deferring growth, I guess, across SoCal -- in rent growth across SoCal, Mid-Atlantic, I think, you referenced Sunbelt. Can you just give us a better sense of the magnitude of this dispersion? And I guess, Chris, do you expect this dispersion to continue over the next, call it, six months to months?\nChris Caton: So the magnitude of the dispersion, so just to be clear, in terms of strengths versus weaknesses, because I want to be sure that wasn\u2019t conflated, the strong markets include the Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, Northern California and really there are only a handful of soft markets. SoCal, we have talked about in these market that\u2019s been flat all year. In terms of dispersion, there is a fair amount of sameness in the trend, whether you look at it on a quarterly or a calendar year basis. So rents are trending in the annualized rate from the third quarter that Tim discussed, with some markets moderately ahead, like the strong markets I described and then just really one or two markets that are notably weaker. So I guess I suppose there\u2019s that dispersion.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Mueller: Yeah. Hi. I know you have used land in the past for higher and better uses, but do you think you would be looking at these development, the data center developments to the same degree that you would be looking at them if you weren\u2019t seeing a normalizing of a traditional industrial demand?\nHamid Moghadam: Absolutely. Because the margins embedded in the data center development, Mike, are orders of magnitude higher, certainly on the basis of market value under industrial use or purchase price under industrial use. So we would be doing that even if the market was tight as a drum. And by the way, let\u2019s not get carried away. The market is in the high 4s occupancy, I mean, vacancy, sorry, that is absent 2021 and 2022 I would have said that would be my Christmas present would be vacancy rates that are sub-5 in any part of the cycle other than the last couple of years. So the markets are strong, but the data center opportunities, if you can get the power, the demand is there and it\u2019s been boosted by AI and a bunch of other things. So we see sort of a rush of data center opportunities and the large players and they are all big credit players into the business and they can\u2019t get enough of this stuff to keep up with demand.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nBill Crow: Yeah. Thanks. Two quick questions. First of all, on the economy, I am wondering if you are seeing any changes to your watch list among your tenants or any sectors in particular that are starting to show weakness. And the second question is really in order to get the kind of 9% ROE returns on acquisitions, do you have to target longer waltz or how do you get that if we don\u2019t see distress among current holders or owners? Thanks.\nHamid Moghadam: So our credit issues are fairly modest and they usually involve retailers and we have a build-in 85% plus mark-to-market on those leases that we have identified as potential risks. And we have actually captured some of those spreads and already improved our position by buying out those leases or just getting them back and releasing the space in a short period of time. So I don\u2019t think credit is a particularly important consideration in this cycle.\nTim Arndt: And then the second question on the waltz, extended waltz being necessary for the kind of IRRs we are targeting in acquisitions.\nHamid Moghadam: We are using the same lease terms in acquisitions than we always have been. There is not -- I mean, if you look at 30 years of history, I mean, our waltz have been between four and a half years and six years or something like that on average in our leases. So it doesn\u2019t move around that much.\nTim Arndt: Yeah. I would just pile on there that we look at these opportunities of whether it be one year to three years or four years of negative leverage as an opportunity, really. We look at total return on every deal. And again, we take it through our filters of quality, mark-to-market and whether we want to hold it long-term or not and then we layer that on with our potential essentials, revenues and synergies and otherwise. So while it\u2019s one consideration, so are all these other factors.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nBlaine Heck: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on guidance. You touched on this a little bit, but guidance implies a decrease in FFO in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit more specifically about some of the moving pieces there and one-time items that are influencing the numbers in the third or fourth quarters and whether any of that noise is going to persist into 2024?\nTim Arndt: Yeah. To answer the last part, no, I don\u2019t expect anything into 2024. Basically, of the $0.03, a couple of pennies that were related to termination income from some leases that were canceled and then higher interest income. There\u2019s about $0.02 there I would call that, that\u2019s permanent to the year and then the other penny in the quarter I would say is more of a timing issue, specifically in taxes. We will see some lower taxes in the third quarter, but higher again in the fourth quarter. So if you take that with regard to the rule, if you take that $0.03 out, you are basically rolling from, let\u2019s call it $1.30 million to $1.28 million in the fourth quarter is what\u2019s implied in our guidance. And basically, you would roll NOI forward. We are going to add -- probably add $0.02 from just base same-store growth quarter-over-quarter. And then the declines are going to come from mainly ramping of development. We see much more investment and land and CIP starting to build. And you should be aware in your models, our cost of funding development in the short term is essentially 6%. Think of that as SOFR plus our line rate. We are capping interest at our in-place debt is how this works. That\u2019s at 3%. So in the short-term, that\u2019s a drag on core FFO seen mainly in interest expense. Obviously, over the long-term, the margin in value creation is there. But we will see that drag pick up as development\u2019s ramp.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks. Good morning. Two quick ones here. First, on the utilization rate that picked down a little bit this quarter, I was wondering if you can provide any more color around that. And second, if you look at the larger development landscape and look at competitors that are developing, I would assume that the pressure for them to lease up space and maybe they have to pay back the loans to banks probably increases as we move forward. I am not sure how big these developers are or how much capital they have behind them. But is there any risk that as these developers look to secure tenants that could drive rental rates lower going forward?\nChris Caton: Hey, Ki Bin. I will take the utilization question. Thanks for it. As you see on the page in supplemental, there are multiple metrics on the page and we look at all of them in totality and additional ones that are not included in the supplemental. So we have a range of proprietary data, whether it\u2019s our IBI survey, tenants in the market, customer decision-making timeframes, our sales pipeline. Specific to the utilization data, that lags. That does not lead economic and real estate cycles we have seen that over time. And so what I think this is best understood in the context of today\u2019s retail sales numbers, which shows a resilient consumer that is outperforming expectations and leading to lower utilization levels.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. On the second issue of opportunities, there are a lot of merchant developers that are bank financed and active in the market and they are just about completing their projects now. They have some interest reserve built into their lease-up plans, but their lease-up plans are going to get extended. So actually, I think, what\u2019s going to happen is that they can\u2019t really be afford to rent the space at the lower rate. I think they are more likely to sell their positions to people with stronger balance sheets and we have already seen and taken advantage of a couple of instances like this. So don\u2019t be surprised to see us buy some vacant completed shelves at discounts to replacement costs, because -- it\u2019s -- because of our view on demand and supply, with 65% decline in supply, we think if you get into late 2024, early 2025, we are going to be in a pretty strong market. So this is where balance sheet matters. This is where quality of location and product matters, and we are going to be very selective about the projects that I described. But that\u2019s why we have been building our balance sheet and keeping our leverage around 20% all this time. This is when we put it to work.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nVince Tibone: Hi. Good morning. I have a follow-up on an earlier comment about 20% of your markets you are managing for occupancy not pushing rent. So what are those markets where industrial landlords have less pricing power today?\nTim Arndt: Sure, Vince. We covered a couple of them. I talked about Southern California. I point to Houston, Indianapolis, and then outside the U.S., the softest market might be Poland.\nHamid Moghadam: And China.\nTim Arndt: And China and I think I\u2019d offer now that market vacancies are beginning to gap out again, I think we are going to see quality make a bigger difference in terms of portfolio mix.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nVikram Malhotra: I just wanted to get your thoughts to just clarify one thing more broadly. Two trends, I guess, one, just the whole reshoring team that we are hearing more and more about. And then second, just Amazon as they have put a lot of capital into the coast and across the country. I am just wondering sort of when you marry those two things together, is there sort of greater investment moving towards the Midwest or more manufacturing pockets? Is that an opportunity for PLD going forward?\nHamid Moghadam: So, generally speaking, I would say, on where manufacturing is taking place, in Asia, there\u2019s a lot of manufacturing still in Asia. It\u2019s not all in China and it had been gradually declining in China in the last couple of years anyway. It was first moving to western China and then it was spreading to other places in Southeast Asia. But there are going to be strong flows still from those places. It\u2019s just not going to be all from China. But the container doesn\u2019t care whether it\u2019s coming from somewhere else or China. It lands in the same ports. Secondly, demand in our product is mostly driven by consumption and not manufacturing. In manufacturing, the finished product ends up in a container and on a truck or a ship. So the warehouse is a truck or a ship. So that manufacturing per se doesn\u2019t generate a lot of demand. When those containers land in places where consumption takes place, that\u2019s when the demand is generated for deconsolidation. Now those markets happen to be in populous parts of the country, because that\u2019s where the consumption is and those markets tend to be high barrier to entry markets. So we don\u2019t think the dynamic of on-shoring to the extent that it exists is going to change things around all that much. The biggest beneficiary of on-shoring has been actually near-shoring and it\u2019s been in northern Mexico. Northern Mexico markets are 100% occupied and there\u2019s insatiable demand for product in those markets and most of that is for distribution buildings that are used for manufacturing purposes. So that\u2019s where we have seen the material demand. If there\u2019s more demand coming for manufacturing in the U.S., A, we haven\u2019t really seen it and if we do see it, we will be the beneficiary of it because we are well positioned in those central markets as well.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nBlaine Heck: Great. Thanks. Hamid, just a bigger picture question for you. Can you talk about how you are thinking about managing exposure to geopolitical risk and instability and maybe to what extent the latest turmoil in the Middle East could impact your operations, if at all?\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. I think the effect is going to be indirect, because the Middle East is not obviously a source of product or exports or we are not active in any of those markets. So it will be a second order effect on the macro economy. And if the Fed remains very aggressive on rates, if you believe their talk and all of a sudden we have some drop off in demand, because that conflict expands and the nightmare scenario would be that a couple of tankers get sunk in the Persian Gulf at the narrow end and oil goes to $200 a barrel. I mean, the bets are off. But boy, if we see that scenario, I can\u2019t think of a better business to want to be in and I hate to see that scenario happen. But actually on a relative basis, it should be good for our business, because it will mean that people will, first of all, inventory becomes really important and it means that -- it\u2019s yet one more uncertainty like the pandemic, like the earthquake, like all these other disruptions that we have seen that will push the general posture of companies from just in time to just in case. So I hate to say it would be good because it\u2019s an awful situation that\u2019s going there and before this is all over, a lot of innocent people are going to get killed and I don\u2019t want to see this happen. But I don\u2019t think its impact on the business on a relative basis is going to be terrible. I am honestly more worried about the Fed overdoing it than that conflict escalating. But those things are very hard to predict. I think that was our last question. So we really appreciate your participation. Really look forward to seeing all of you at our upcoming Investor Day and I promise it will be really good. So take care.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Caton",
            "content": "Hey, Todd. It's Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. Yes. We expect rent growth to remain positive throughout that time period. Market conditions are stable and there are a handful of markets that we have talked about that are softer, but by and large, markets are proving resilient with rent growth in line or ahead of inflation. Yeah. I will build on that by saying as the market is digesting the demand and supply picture that Hamid described. We are beginning to see some differentiation in submarkets where LA, Orange County is proving more resilient and the Inland Empire is a bit softer. Yeah. Absolutely. I might start by just saying one way to think about rent growth going forward is to think about the replacement cost math. We have really seen construction costs prove resilient and replacement costs prove resilient. And the interest rate dynamic that Hamid described earlier translates to the rents that are required to warrant new development. So over a medium-term horizon, a couple years, that's going to play one of the most important factors into evaluating rent growth. As it relates to different markets, which was your question, I think, it's probably fair to point to Tim's comments on the markets that have proved the strongest so far this year. Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, Northern California are markets that stand out in my mind in the U.S. and there is a range of them globally, whether it's Toronto, Mexico, Germany and the Netherlands. So that's what I would look to. Hi. Thanks for the question. Again, it's Chris. So, just to give you the total numbers, we are on pace to see 490 million square feet of deliveries in the United States this year against 195 million square feet of net absorption. So that gap is wider. And some of that relates simply not so much to the softness in demand that you are describing, but the timing of deliveries of the pipeline. If anything, our view of where the pipeline's going has come down, not gone up over the last 90 days related to the trend in starts and so really it's really timing as it relates to that gap. So the magnitude of the dispersion, so just to be clear, in terms of strengths versus weaknesses, because I want to be sure that wasn't conflated, the strong markets include the Mid-Atlantic, Sunbelt, Northern California and really there are only a handful of soft markets. SoCal, we have talked about in these market that's been flat all year. In terms of dispersion, there is a fair amount of sameness in the trend, whether you look at it on a quarterly or a calendar year basis. So rents are trending in the annualized rate from the third quarter that Tim discussed, with some markets moderately ahead, like the strong markets I described and then just really one or two markets that are notably weaker. So I guess I suppose there's that dispersion. Hey, Ki Bin. I will take the utilization question. Thanks for it. As you see on the page in supplemental, there are multiple metrics on the page and we look at all of them in totality and additional ones that are not included in the supplemental. So we have a range of proprietary data, whether it's our IBI survey, tenants in the market, customer decision-making timeframes, our sales pipeline. Specific to the utilization data, that lags. That does not lead economic and real estate cycles we have seen that over time. And so what I think this is best understood in the context of today's retail sales numbers, which shows a resilient consumer that is outperforming expectations and leading to lower utilization levels."

            "name": "Dan Letter",
            "content": "Well, what I would say is, on this particular data center, we are under a strict confidentiality. So we can't be speaking about any particular yield points by any means. But what I would say is, we have been building capabilities internally to ensure that we hit the market for these deals and you will see those play out as we announce more data centers going forward. Sure, Steve. This is Dan. So the lion's share of our Q4 starts are logistics starts. We have one, maybe two smaller data center starts that we have forecasted. But overall, it's about 50-50 build-to-suit and spec. And let me just highlight that we have been calling for a back-end loaded forecast for about four quarters now. As we talk about market development starts now at 65% -- I guess down 65% from the peak, this is playing out exactly as we expected and we have been gearing up all year for a really heavy Q4 start volume. Correct. The only thing I would add is, our teams around the globe are literally turning over every stone daily. And this is land acquisitions, this is core acquisitions, it's value-add acquisitions and the teams turn to opportunistic right now. So it's really hard to peg exactly where we are going to land our acquisition volume for the year, which is why you saw us move it up a couple hundred million after this Phoenix transaction. But overall, I think our teams are going to continue to find opportunistic transactions consistent with what Hamid just said on the returns."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Hamid Moghadam",
            "content": "Sure. It's a dynamic market and I think that's the essence of your question. It's really hard to get a handle on what the returns should be and how we look at acquisitions. But here's a model for thinking about it. First of all, we are even pickier than we have been with respect to quality and fit with our portfolio. We are not -- before you had to buy the good with the great in portfolios and we had to go through the massive exercise of disposing of the properties that we didn't want, which we did actually quite successfully in a declining cap rate environment and we actually made money on it, but we don't expect that to be the case going forward. So we are really being picky about what we buy. The portfolios that we are going to buy are almost virtually 100% whole portfolios. Secondly, if you really think that, look at where treasuries are, 150 basis points have gone to, call it 4.5%, 300 basis points increased. Those kinds of properties, core properties, we are trading in the high 5%s, low 6% IRRs. Let's stay away from cap rates because of a market-to-market complexity of talking about cap rates. But call it 6%. So just adjusting for the change in treasury yields, simplistically, you would have to see a 9% on leveraged IRR and that's if supply and demand of capital were sort of in equilibrium. We get a sense that there's going to be more opportunities coming our way and it is in a capital-constrained environment and we happen to be in the fortunate position of having a really good balance sheet and able to take advantage of those. I don't think there's going to be distress in the terms of a post-savings and loan crisis or any of the downturns, but I think the opportunity set is going to exceed the available capital and I think we will be taking advantage of that. So I would say on leveraged IRRs that have a 9% handle on them, maybe as much as 9.5% depending on the circumstances. And we are seeing that supply loosen up and come to the market. So expect to see more transactions in the next six months. Dan, do you have anything to add? Yeah. On the rental forecast, I am afraid you are going to have to wait for that when we issue guidance and we get into that. And one thing we are going to stay away from is quarter-by-quarter forecasting of rents. It's hard enough to guess what it is on an annual basis, much less on a quarter-to-quarter forecast. So what was the first part of the question? Oh, occupancy trade-off. It depends on the actual markets. There are about 20% of the markets that I can see us driving for occupancy and about 80% of the markets that are still in equilibrium or tighter. But the key to your question is what you asked in the middle of it, which is, how do you expect that to change? And the reason we are not going to get super aggressive on rents is because we have a belief that, I mean, just look at the starts. They are down 65% and even with moderating demand, we are going to get something like 60% or 70% of that shortfall that we are going to encounter in the next three quarters shortfall of demand, we are going to get it back in the subsequent three quarters. So there's no sense really going cheap, it's just. But I would say 20% of our markets, we are going to be more focused on occupancy. Well, Southern California is very geared towards basically inflows, 40% of the inflows into this country came through Southern California and that number dropped dramatically because of the labor issues. It's too soon to see any recovery because we are also going into the Christmas season and anything that's going to be in a store for Christmas has already been on the water and through the ports and all that. So I think you are going to see the effects of that next year in terms of recovery of flows. About half of what used to come through LA used to stay in the LA Basin, Southern California and half of it was shipped elsewhere. We think the half that stays in Southern California for sure will stay there or come back and some of the rest will also revert back to Southern California. I am not smart enough to know whether we are going to get half of it back or three quarters of it back, but we will get a pretty substantial portion of it back. It will be more into the first quarter or second quarter of next year before you see it in the numbers. Chris, do you want to add anything? Okay. Your first question was great advertising for our Investor Day because that's what we are going to devote the time to is understanding our essentials business, our data center business and all those things. So let me defer answering that question to that date. And by the way, even on that date, you are not going to get as specific an answer as you would like. I just tell you that in advance, because these are very lumpy and it depends what quarter or what year a deal lands in. Chris, do you want to address the second part? Yeah. But I would say, our previous forecast did not anticipate the sudden jump in rates that has come in the last month and a half. We thought that treasuries were going to settle in the mid-3s, not mid-4s, maybe mid to high 3s and not mid-4s or approaching 5. So that I think has taken and shifted some of the demand out. But the thing that encourages me and we will have to see -- wait to see this, is that companies are not shutting down their dialogue with us in terms of their long-term needs and are build-to-suit discussions are every bit as good as they have been across most cycles. But they are not pulling the trigger just yet, given that those things generally involve major capital expenditures and those are all being scrutinized by the C-suite pretty tightly these days. Absolutely. Because the margins embedded in the data center development, Mike, are orders of magnitude higher, certainly on the basis of market value under industrial use or purchase price under industrial use. So we would be doing that even if the market was tight as a drum. And by the way, let's not get carried away. The market is in the high 4s occupancy, I mean, vacancy, sorry, that is absent 2021 and 2022 I would have said that would be my Christmas present would be vacancy rates that are sub-5 in any part of the cycle other than the last couple of years. So the markets are strong, but the data center opportunities, if you can get the power, the demand is there and it's been boosted by AI and a bunch of other things. So we see sort of a rush of data center opportunities and the large players and they are all big credit players into the business and they can't get enough of this stuff to keep up with demand. So our credit issues are fairly modest and they usually involve retailers and we have a build-in 85% plus mark-to-market on those leases that we have identified as potential risks. And we have actually captured some of those spreads and already improved our position by buying out those leases or just getting them back and releasing the space in a short period of time. So I don't think credit is a particularly important consideration in this cycle. We are using the same lease terms in acquisitions than we always have been. There is not -- I mean, if you look at 30 years of history, I mean, our waltz have been between four and a half years and six years or something like that on average in our leases. So it doesn't move around that much. Yeah. On the second issue of opportunities, there are a lot of merchant developers that are bank financed and active in the market and they are just about completing their projects now. They have some interest reserve built into their lease-up plans, but their lease-up plans are going to get extended. So actually, I think, what's going to happen is that they can't really be afford to rent the space at the lower rate. I think they are more likely to sell their positions to people with stronger balance sheets and we have already seen and taken advantage of a couple of instances like this. So don't be surprised to see us buy some vacant completed shelves at discounts to replacement costs, because -- it's -- because of our view on demand and supply, with 65% decline in supply, we think if you get into late 2024, early 2025, we are going to be in a pretty strong market. So this is where balance sheet matters. This is where quality of location and product matters, and we are going to be very selective about the projects that I described. But that's why we have been building our balance sheet and keeping our leverage around 20% all this time. This is when we put it to work. And China. So, generally speaking, I would say, on where manufacturing is taking place, in Asia, there's a lot of manufacturing still in Asia.

            "name": "Tim Arndt",
            "content": "Thanks Jill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our call. The third quarter marked a continuation of themes we have been anticipating for more than a year, namely; growing supply translating to increased market vacancy; continued moderation of demand; and market rent growth that will slow until the low levels of new starts drive reduced availability over-time. We have operated in accordance with these views in both our approach to leasing, as well as timing of new development. What's incremental to our forecast is that continued hawkish posture from central banks and the impact it's had on rates is delaying decision-making and willingness to take expansion space early. The geopolitical backdrop has clearly become more troubling as well amounting to a lack of clarity that will likely weigh on demand. In the meantime, and also playing out to our expectations is that our existing lease mark-to-market will drive durable earnings growth as it did in delivering record rent change this quarter, as well as strong earnings and same-store growth. We remain focused on the fact that we own assets critical to the supply chain with long-term secular drivers that remain intact. Further, the outlook for future supply will continue to face structural barriers, ultimately driving occupancy, rents and values. In terms of our results, we had an excellent quarter with core FFO excluding net promote income of $1.33 per share. This result includes approximately $0.03 of one-time items related to interest and termination income, as well as the timing of expenses, which we can address in Q&A. Occupancy ticked up over the quarter to 97.5%, aided by retention of 77%. Net effective rent change was a record 84% at our share, with notable contributions from Northern New Jersey at 200%, Toronto at 187% and Southern California at 165%. Same-store growth on a net effective and cash basis was 9.3% and 9.5%, respectively, driven predominantly by rent change. We saw market rents grow roughly 60 basis points during the quarter, the slower pace embedded in our forecast. In combination with the strong build of in-place rents, our lease mark-to-market recalculates to 62% as of September. We raised approximately $1.4 billion in new financings at an average interest rate of 3.2%, comprised principally of $760 million within our ventures, as well as a recast of our Yen credit facility increasing our aggregate line availability. In combination with our cash position, we ended the quarter with a record $6.9 billion of liquidity. Finally, it's noteworthy that our debt-to-EBITDA has remained very low and essentially flat all year, hovering in the mid-4 times range, despite our increased financing activity, a demonstration of the tremendous growth in our nominal EBITDA. Turning to our markets, while rising, vacancy remains historically very low in the U.S., Mexico and Europe. Market vacancy increased approximately 70 basis points during the quarter in the U.S., driven by low absorption, as well as recently delivered but unleased completions. Europe experienced similar dynamics with an overall increase in market vacancy of 50 basis points. At the macro level our expectations for the U.S. are for completions to outpace net absorption by a cumulative 150 million square feet to 200 million square feet over the next three quarters. Then, over the subsequent three quarters, we see that trend reversing with demand exceeding supply and recovering the net 75 million to 125 million square feet. That trend may extend further into 2025, as we believe development starts over the next several quarters are likely to remain low. Whatever the precise path, we expect that as vacancy normalizes over the long-term, our portfolio will outperform the market due to both its location and quality, as well as the strength of our relationships and operating platform. In this regard, our portfolio has been largely resilient to moderating demand. Our teams would describe the depth of our leasing pipeline as consistent with the last few quarters. In coming fresh off of one of our customer advisory board sessions, it's clear that our customers have plans to continue to expand their footprint, increasing capacity and resiliency. However, what's also clear is that they are slowing such investments until there is more clarity in the economic environment. In the U.S., rents increased in most of our markets with the strongest located in the Sunbelt, Mid-Atlantic and Northern California regions. Europe and Mexico were also bright spots for growth in the quarter. Rents across our Southern California sub-markets declined approximately 2% as it continues to adjust to higher levels of vacancy. While the markets and outlook are mixed, we remain confident in continued market rent growth in the U.S. and globally over the coming year, albeit at a slow pace while the pipeline continues to get absorbed. From our appraisals, U.S. values declined approximately 3% while European values remain stable, in fact, having a very modest write-up. The difference isn't too surprising as the Fed's language around inflation and the economy has had more effect in the U.S. capital markets, driving the 10-year up 100 basis points since our last earnings call, compared to the bund [ph] at just 50 basis points. We believe that this is likely another instance, as we saw one year ago, where U.S. appraisals at the end of the quarter have not had sufficient time to react to the increase in rates and we are thus pausing on appraisal-based activity in USLF for at least one quarter. Elsewhere, values in Mexico are up 8.5%, while China experienced its first meaningful decline of 6.5%, a write-down that we don't believe has fully run its course. Our funds experienced their first quarter of net positive inflows with approximately $180 million of new commitments versus new redemption requests of $115 million. Given other activity in the quarter, the net redemptions have been reduced from their height of $1.6 billion to approximately $700 million or roughly 2% of third-party AUMs. In terms of our own deployment, development starts ramped up during the quarter, crossing $1 billion, over half of which is related to a data center opportunity in our central region, a testament to our higher and better use strategy and strategically located land bank. Also notable is the acquisition of $118 million of land, including a strategic parcel in Las Vegas, which will build out an additional 10 million square feet over time and brings our total build-out of land globally to over $40 billion. We are laser focused in identifying and executing on value creation in our core business, our energy business, and their adjacencies. Combined with the debt capacity and liquidity we have worked hard to build and preserve, we see the environment as rich with opportunity. Moving to guidance, we are increasing the average occupancy to a range between 97.25% and 97.5%. As a result, we are increasing our same-store guidance to a range of 9% to 9.25% on a net effective basis and 9.75% to 10% on a cash basis. We are maintaining our strategic capital revenue guidance, excluding promotes to a range of $520 million to $530 million and adjusting G&A guidance to range between $390 million and $395 million. Our development starts guidance is increased to a new range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion at our share, driven primarily from the data center start mentioned earlier. We have $500 million of contribution and disposition activity during the quarter and given our commentary on USLF valuations, we are pausing our planned contributions into that vehicle this quarter and reducing our combined contribution and disposition guidance to a range of $1.7 billion to $2.3 billion. In the end, we are adjusting guidance for GAAP earnings to a range of $3.30 per share to $3.35 per share. We are increasing our core FFO, including promotes guidance to a range of $5.58 per share to $5.60 per share and are increasing core FFO, excluding promotes to a range between $5.08 per share and $5.10 per share, growth of nearly 10.5%. I know that many of you are focusing on 2024, so I'd like to take an opportunity to remind you that the Duke portfolio will be entering the same-store pool in 2024, which will widen the recently observed delta between net effective and cash same-store growth. This is, of course, because Duke rents were mark-to-market at close one year ago, so its contribution to net effective same-store growth and earnings will be minimal, even though the cash rent change will be on par with the rest of the Prologis portfolio. In closing, we are navigating the current environment, assured that whatever the economy brings in the short-term, we are positioned to outperform over the long-term. This stems from not only the premier logistics portfolio and customer franchise with one of the best balance sheets amongst corporates, but also highly visible earnings and portfolio growth ahead of us. We know that turbulent times can bring opportunity for those who are prepared and that's been central to our strategy and management as a company. I'd like to also remind you of our upcoming Investor Forum on December 13th in New York, our first in four years. We are looking forward to spending the day with you, sharing more about our business, outlook and opportunities ahead. Additional information is available on our website and in our earnings press release. And with that, I will hand it back to the Operator for your questions. Sure. Demand is definitely softer. It's closer to normal, maybe even a little bit below normal at this instant. There is a lot of latent demand that large companies having large requirements are continuing to talk to us about build-to-suits, but they are reluctant to pull the [Technical Difficulty] I am sorry. We are having some technical difficulties here and I can't really explain it. Can you guys hear me? You can hear me again. Okay. So let me finish the first question and then I will go to the second question. To the extent I heard it, which wasn't great. On the first question, what I wanted to say is that, the data centers account for a pretty significant volume of the build-to-suits and that's why they are higher. But industrial logistics build-to-suits are kind of in par and in line with our expectations. The reason occupancy is higher, it's unique to the quality of our portfolio and just the natural role of leases, but market occupancy is slightly lower. So we are outperforming the market by more than we did before. I think that covers the first question. The second question was how should we think about the build-to-suits in terms of its effect on our going in yields and the like, and for that, I am going to turn it over to Dan here. But generally, we -- the build-to-suits strategy of ours is an extension of our higher and best-use strategy. We own a lot of high quality land in markets that are in the path of development and are popular data center markets. And while we may occasionally buy land for data centers, our primary strategy is converting our existing portfolio to data center products to the extent they have power availability. We are getting a lot of people knocking on our door for those opportunities and we think going forward, it's going to be a pretty significant part of our activity, although it's lumpy and less prone to precise predictions like the logistic business, but you will hear more about that. Now, strategically, this is important to understand. We funded our business without issuing any equity basically since 2012. The last 10 years or 11 years we have not issued any equity. How we financed our business is by disposing of real estate that was non-strategic to us, logistics real estate and we have done a lot of dispositions. You can think of the data center strategy as a way of funding our growth. That's where the growth capital is going to come from. We are not at the moment interested in being in that business in terms of long-term ownership, it's more of a development and harvest strategy and that capital that comes out of the margins of those deals will be a substantial contributor to our growth going forward. Dan, you want to talk about the initial yields on the data center? What I would say, generally, though, without getting specific on this opportunity, we think the margins that come out of our data center business, by definition, based on our historic cost of land or even the market value of land, will be orders of magnitude higher than they would be under logistics build-out. So multiples of a normal margin. Yeah. The portion of build-to-suit is obviously a lot higher than that if you include the data centers. What Dan meant was a mix of logistics and logistics spec versus build-to-suit. Occupancy. Hey, Camille. It's Tim. Yeah. Just a clarification on the first part, that was a quarter-over-quarter number in SoCal, the 2% decline. And then in terms of what could change the fourth quarter, the answer is very little at this point. Certainly on the rent change side of things, most all of that leasing is already inked. We could have some surprises, very moderate I would say on the occupancy side, but I actually don't expect that. We have a pretty tight range on occupancy as you know. So I don't think you will see anything take us outside of our guidance. So, hey, the view is 7% in United -- globally and in the U.S. We are about mid-6s so far this year, so that implies growth in the fourth quarter as we described earlier. And then as it relates to forward guidance, I'd like to underline our upcoming Investor Day in December as the time to look for new information. And then the second question on the waltz, extended waltz being necessary for the kind of IRRs we are targeting in acquisitions. Yeah. I would just pile on there that we look at these opportunities of whether it be one year to three years or four years of negative leverage as an opportunity, really. We look at total return on every deal. And again, we take it through our filters of quality, mark-to-market and whether we want to hold it long-term or not and then we layer that on with our potential essentials, revenues and synergies and otherwise. So while it's one consideration, so are all these other factors. Yeah. To answer the last part, no, I don't expect anything into 2024. Basically, of the $0.03, a couple of pennies that were related to termination income from some leases that were canceled and then higher interest income. There's about $0.02 there I would call that, that's permanent to the year and then the other penny in the quarter I would say is more of a timing issue, specifically in taxes. We will see some lower taxes in the third quarter, but higher again in the fourth quarter. So if you take that with regard to the rule, if you take that $0.03 out, you are basically rolling from, let's call it $1.30 million to $1.28 million in the fourth quarter is what's implied in our guidance. And basically, you would roll NOI forward. We are going to add -- probably add $0.02 from just base same-store growth quarter-over-quarter. And then the declines are going to come from mainly ramping of development. We see much more investment and land and CIP starting to build. And you should be aware in your models, our cost of funding development in the short term is essentially 6%. Think of that as SOFR plus our line rate. We are capping interest at our in-place debt is how this works. That's at 3%. So in the short-term, that's a drag on core FFO seen mainly in interest expense. Obviously, over the long-term, the margin in value creation is there. But we will see that drag pick up as development's ramp. Sure, Vince. We covered a couple of them. I talked about Southern California. I point to Houston, Indianapolis, and then outside the U.S., the softest market might be Poland. And China and I think I'd offer now that market vacancies are beginning to gap out again, I think we are going to see quality make a bigger difference in terms of portfolio mix."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Jill Sawyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nJill Sawyer: Thanks you, Adel. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our second quarter results, press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP measures and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance; Hamid Moghadam, our CEO and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that I\u2019ll hand the call over to Tim.\nTim Arndt: Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We had a very good quarter with outstanding results across our uniquely diversified business. It was highlighted by record rent change, a ramp up in development starts roughly half of which were build-to-suit and the acquisition of over $3 billion of real estate at accretive returns deepening our scale in key markets.  We also earned record strategic capital income and raised $1.2 billion in new equity across the vehicles. We are watching markets closely and we\u2019ve been clear that we expect vacancies to arise over the course of the year from a normalization of demand and elevated development deliveries.  We\u2019ve indeed seen vacancy build and expected to reach the mid-fours in the US by year end but continue to believe that fundamentals will regain momentum in 2024 with the outlook for new supply declining as development starts continue to fall this year. In short, our outlook is completely unchanged and we feel great about our business.  Turning to our results, core FFO excluding promotes was $1.25 per share and including promotes was $1.83 per share, both ahead of our forecast. Our promote income was generated from both USLF and FIBRA Prologis and meaningfully exceeded our guidance.  USLF generated promote revenue at Prologis share of over $635 million. In its three year performance period, assets grew by over $10 billion and the fund delivered an IRR of over 20% net of all fees and with very low leverage.  In terms of our operating results, average occupancy for the quarter was 97.5%, down 50 basis points from the first quarter and in line with our expectations. Rent change on starts was a record on both a net effective and cash basis, 79% and 48% respectively. Net effective rent change on signings of more forward-looking build was an impressive 87% with notable rent change from Phoenix at a 137%, Northern New Jersey at 150% and Southern California at a 181%.  Global markets also contributed to strong signings with Mexico at 34%, the UK at 36%, Central Europe at 51%, and Canada at a 150%. Bottom-line rent change has been both robust and broad based.  Market rents continued to grow albeit at a slower pace increasing a little over 1.5% in the quarter. In-place rents grew by approximately 2.5% over the quarter, the net of which translates to a lease mark-to-market of 66%, down from 68%. We explained last quarter that our lease mark-to-market would generate $2.85 per share of incremental earnings as leases roll over time without any additional market rent growth.  Interestingly, that future upside is virtually unchanged at June 30th, even though we crystallized rental increases over the quarter. This is because a lower lease market-to-market is now being applied to a larger base of in-place NOI. Ultimately, same-store growth is our most important operating metric and this quarter remained exceptional at 8.9% on a net effective basis and 10.7% on cash.  I'd like to highlight that even with $4 billion of investment during the quarter, the balance sheet remains in impeccable shape, with liquidity of approximately $6.4 billion and debt-to-EBITDA of 4.2x. We raised approximately $7 billion in debt financing across four currencies at an interest rate of 4.9% and an average term of eight years.  Turning to our markets, the trend to normalization, which we've been speaking to for some time continues. Proposal activity, gestation and pre-leasing of vacancy are all within a few percent of their pre-COVID levels, a period which we\u2019ve highlighted many times was itself historically strong. Our IDI sentiment index ticked in the quarter to over 58 indicating a continued strong backdrop for demand as described by our customers and further supported by utilization increasing to 85.5%.  Unsurprisingly, customers have been more deliberate in their decision-making amidst the uptick in vacancy. We continue to believe that this will be a short-lived reprieve as construction starts have indeed declined significantly for our expectations. Starts in the second quarter were down approximately 40% across our US markets and 50% in Europe.  We see deliveries in 2024 falling short of demand, reducing vacancy over the course of next year. Significant attention has been given to Southern California in recent months, while our portfolio is over 97% leased and we are achieving record rent change, vacancy has grown partially due to port operations that have not yet returned to normal.  Additionally, some customers are re-evaluating expansion in the Inland Empire diversifying operations to other Southwest markets. With all this in mind, we've reduced our rent growth forecast for Southern California in 2023.  However given what is still low vacancy together with structural headwinds to new supply and a huge consumption base, we believe strongly in this market. The global nature of our portfolio means that we will see markets contribute to growth in different periods evening out peaks and troughs. We see this playing out in a number of markets across the globe, where our rent growth forecast is increasing this quarter such as Las Vegas, Texas, Europe and Mexico to name a few.  All this together with the more than 5% rent growth to-date has us re-forecasting the full year to a range of 7% to 9% on a global basis. What matters more than what will transpire in the next six months is what we see over the medium term, which is growth that will be fueled by escalating replacement costs, growing barriers to new supply and ongoing secular drivers of demand.  Late in the second quarter we announced and closed on the acquisition of over 14 million square foot portfolio in many of our best US markets. We estimate an 8% unlevered IRR simply at the property level, exclusive of additional return driven by property management synergies, essentials opportunities, including solar and the upside we expect through revenue management.  While this was the largest transaction in the quarter, overall activity increased slightly bringing additional price discovery to the market.  In Europe values have been relatively stable, experiencing a 1% decline over the second quarter. Latin America saw an increase in values with write-ups in Brazil and Mexico of 2% and 5% respectively and write-downs in the US were in line with expectations approximately 5% driving the cumulative decline over the last year to 12%.  With this move, we view the values as fair and are proceeding on redemption in USLF for the third quarter.  New redemption requests in the quarter totaled approximately $800 million and was concentrated in USLF and our China venture where values have held up better. Together with other activity the net redemption queue stands at approximately $1.6 billion. Outside of open-ended funds, the company raised an incremental $1.2 billion comprised of $500 million in the FIBRA and NPR, as well as a new $700 million commitment for a complementary vehicle in Japan, PJLF, which is detailed in our supplemental.  Before turning to guidance, I'd like to mention a few updates across our Essentials business. We added 45 megawatts of new solar production and storage in the first half of the year, bringing our platform total to 450 megawatts, nearly 50% of the way to our 1 gigawatt goal for 2025.  Additionally, Prologis Mobility, our EV business has more than 65 lead charging sites in the pipeline across the US and Europe.  In terms of our outlook for the balance of the year, we are guiding average occupancy to range between 97% and 97.5%. We are increasing our same-store guidance eight three quarters to nine and a quarter percent on a net effective basis and 9.5% to 10% on a cash basis.  Net effective rent change propelling same stores will continue to accelerate in the next two quarters and average approximately 80% over the year. We are maintaining our G&A guidance to range between $380 million and $390 million and are increasing our strategic capital revenue guidance excluding promotes to range between $520 million and $530 million. As a result of the outperformance in USLF\u2019s promotes, we are increasing our forecast for net promote income to $475 million. Year-to-date, we are in excess of this amount, but the amortization expense will continue over the back half of the year.  Development starts picked up during the quarter with commencements of 12 projects around the globe and while we remained very selective on new spec starts, we are maintaining our guidance to $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the year. We had over $550 million in contribution in disposition activity during the quarter concentrated in Japan and Mexico and are maintaining guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion.  Putting it all together, we are increasing guidance for GAAP earnings to range between $3.30 and $3.40 per share. We are increasing core FFO including promotes guidance to a range of $5.56 to $5.60 per share and increasing core FFO executing promotes to range between $5.06 and $5.10 per share with the midpoint representing over 10% annual growth marking our fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth.  The quarter highlighted many ways that Prologis has diversified itself across geographies, business lines and capital sources, while rents in some markets decelerate, others with different demand drivers are now accelerating. We're seeing the same balance with property values as demonstrated over the quarter. Further, we generate incremental cash flows and value creation outside of the pure rent business in closely related and synergistic platforms, namely Strategic Capital development and now Essentials. Our fundraising efforts also demonstrate the value of having alternatives. Clearly, our wide access to debt capital has been a tremendous advantage, but we also benefit from access to varied equity sources for our ventures by utilizing open end vehicles, JVs and public structures, we have the ability to be opportunistic and proactive in changing capital markets.  As we close, I'd like to remind you of two upcoming events of Prologis later in the year. Our Groundbreakers Thought Leadership Forum on September 27th, right here in San Francisco, and our Investor Forum on December 13th in New York. Additional information for each is available on our website.  With that, I will hand it back to the operator for your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please state your question. \nTom Catherwood : Thank you, and good morning all. Tim, appreciate your commentary around guidance on projected rent growth. Kind of a two-part question on that first. Have you adjusted your projection for US rent growth? I think it was previously 10% and you mentioned it globally now. And then, can you provide some more detail around those markets or regions where as you said you've seen you know rent growth and values kind of exceed expectations and then conversely are there others like Southern California that have somewhat lagged your expectations?\nTim Arndt: Hey, Tom, I'll start and probably pitch it to Chris here for some help on the market detail. But the U.S. at this point, I would put in a similar range, really given the weight of the U.S. and the notion that we're going to put these things in ranges probably from here, it's going to be very similar to the globe. So I would just think of them as essentially the same.  And then, in terms of markets, clearly, I mentioned in my remarks that Southern California is the market that we've downgraded. That's broadly the base of our change and pretty much the only market and it is matched by various markets as are also detailed many in Southeast US, but it's pretty broad around the US, as well as globally that are picking up the slack and holding the average pretty close when you put it in a range. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please state your question. \nBlaine Heck: Great. Thanks. Good morning. So we noticed lease proposals trended downward throughout the quarter and gestation increased towards the end of the quarter. Can you just talk about what factors might be driving those trends? And whether you think we'll continue to see lease proposals trend down or should we expect an inflection in the second half? \nChris Caton: Hey, it's Chris Caton. So, really when we look at that data, the right way to look at that is against our open availabilities. And when you put those proposals against our open availabilities they are actually in line or above the historical average, 48% is that number, it's something we've used in the past on these calls. And so how we do make the proposal numbers you're talking about tie with that view, well, there are two or three drivers.  The first is that the availabilities just, the role that we have in the next 12 months are low relative to history. The second is those proposal volumes do include, sometimes multiple proposals on a single unit and that has declined over the last year as we've discussed previously. And then, third, there's some seasonality where June would be a soft month. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please state your question. \nCraig Mailman: Yes. Thank you very much. Maybe it's open two questions here, I guess, maybe Tim and Chris to follow-up on Tom's question around the market rent growth. It looks like the U.S. dropped about 200 basis points. And if could you give us some more numbers around what the biggest moving parts of that were from a market perspective? And then, separately on, on occupancy here, you guys seemed at 80 BPS sequentially on ending core occupancy and then you're 50 basis points on average.  But, Secaucus, New Jersey, Central Valley, Atlanta, all kind of came down here. Just curious if there's, if that's where you're seeing the more supply or if you had any incremental impact from the Blackstone acquisition that was laid some of those numbers? \nTim Arndt : Yeah, so, on the, on the rent piece, we're not going to go through market rent growth at a market level for a variety of reasons. I think the takeaway we want you and everyone to be left with is just how it can all come into a balance and we're very pleased to see that we're able to hold the forecast at least in a pretty tight range to where we were previously.  And on the occupancy side, you're right about where the ending pieces. I would just comment that that's in line with our forecast. If you look at our average same-store, average occupancy guidance that we have previously and that we have this quarter, it's unchanged. So, the decline that we have expected over the year remains and everything that you see in this quarter is in line with those expectations. \nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. The one thing I would add to that is that, I think we mentioned to you last quarter that we would be continuing to push rents pretty hard and would like to see occupancies a bit lower than 98%. So, what you think is consistent with what we're planning to do and actually we accomplished what we wanted to do in that we tracked a number of leases that we lose because of price and how hard we were pushing. And we modulate around that to figure out the trade-off between rents and occupancy.  So we did see as a result of our efforts, an uptick in basically the percentage of deals lost due to price. It went up from about 10% to about 20%, which is kind of where we would like to have it. So it\u2019s [Indiscernible]. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question. \nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, good morning, everyone. Maybe like to mention there has been a lot of discussion about Southern California. So ask another one there, but I guess just thinking about the idea that it might be lagging now, can you give more details on what could be causing the change in that market? Kind of how long it could last in which market could potentially face similar issues? \nChris Caton: Sure. Let me take a stab at that, because I've seen this now a couple of times over the last 30, 40 years. Southern California is really being adversely affected by two things. One, ports volumes. I think this labor strike has gone on longer than most people anticipated. And the timing of it was such that people have to make decisions about the Christmas season and they've shifted volumes to other ports. And that affect Southern California and honestly, the longer disclose out, I believe the worse it will be for Southern California in terms of doing permanent damage.  From now from everything we hear and we're not an expert on this, things are apparently heading in a positive direction with respect to a resolution. But you read the same things we do. So, I don't have any unique perspectives on that.  The other, the other difference with Southern California is just pricing. I mean, you had between \u201820 and \u201822, about an 130% increase in rents in Southern California, that compares to less than half of that for the overall markets that we operate in. So, there is more price sensitivity now because it's a very, very expensive market.  So to the extent possible, people will shift to adjacent markets. And combined, it's not just price, but up until a quarter ago, occupancies in the Inland Empire was 99 point something percent. So people couldn't even get the space that they wanted. I think with the more normalized vacancy level and we're still not at normal.  I mean, normalized in my experience is 95% occupancy and that would have been great for the last 15 or 20 years. I think with more normalized occupancy, you'll see, Peep and a resolution of the labor strike. I think you see a more normal pattern from which you can draw some conclusions. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please state your question. \nSteve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks. Hi, good morning. I guess, really kind of a two parter. Just, Hamid, if you could just maybe talk about demand by size of tenant and knowing of whether you're seeing any real disparities in sort of the under 250 or under 100 and anything kind of on the bigger side? And then, just I guess your confidence level around the level of development starts. It's obviously a very back-end weighted sort of hockey stick figure for the second half of the year.  So, how much of those projects are currently teed up. And what do you think that split of starts looks like between the third and the fourth quarters? \nHamid Moghadam : Yeah. Let me start on the development volume and then pitch it over to Dan for the other commentary. We do not care about development starts. We do not care about acquisition guidance. We will - we make all these decisions one-by-one and only when it makes sense to pull the trigger on these. They're buying large already more or less and we could, on a discretionary basis, start all of them today.  But that would not be a wise thing to do and we're not going to do it just to meet some artificial guidance. I think the main driver of earnings in this company, which is what we all care about is rental growth and same-store growth. And all I can tell you is that with mid-60s mark-to-market, you can model whatever scenario you want, including zero rent growth from here on out.  And for the next four years, five years, you're going to get same-store NOI increase of 7.5% with no rental growth from this point forward.  You put in our normalized forecast for a rental growth our best guess and that same-store growth will be at 8.5%. Both of those numbers are consistent with low-double-digit earnings growth, while maintaining our leverage, which is, which is so low. So, I don't - we don't need development starts to drive anything, and we're not going to get in a position of \u2013 or jeopardizing our pricing power by virtue of wanting to meet an artificial development goal.  Now having said all that, we will start the ones that we think we can lease efficiently and economically and quickly. And the land is there. The approvals are there. And our ability to put buildings up is there. So, there is no benefit in front end loading that stuff and pushing it ahead of where it needs to be. Dan, do you want to address the site question? \nDan Letter: Yeah. Sure. So, we have - we're seeing continued broad-based demand across all size ranges. Now there certainly are pockets of - in certain markets that there's some risk and maybe the bulk. And those are markets we've talked about historically. South Dallas, North Fort Worth, Indianapolis is getting a fair amount of bulk built out. But, and then I would say West Phoenix, as well. But what I would say with our portfolio overall, we're really isolated from any of this bulk risk and we're really confident in the demand across all site ranges.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please state your question. \nKi Bin Kim : Thanks. Tom, turning to your capital deployment, $3 billion Blackstone deal at a 5.75 stabilized cap rate. Can you just discuss how you viewed the attractiveness of this deal versus some other opportunities that you might have had such as spot buybacks or development? Or do you simply think the value per square foot, price shouldn't decrease much further from here on out? \nDan Letter: Yeah. I mean, certainly, portfolios that we would acquire would be at a discount to replacement cost. And replacement costs has moved up tremendously in the last couple of years by virtue of - forget about the land piece, because that's a squishy piece that's related to rent and all that. But the construction piece has really, really escalated. So to buy standing inventory in our best markets is always a really great thing that we look at.  The quality of the portfolio was quite high, I would say very close to our own portfolio. The percentage that we would dispose of is zero. So it was hand selected to meet our requirements. I wouldn't call it a steal. We didn't steal anything. I think it's a market rate transaction and with the upside built into the rents, you know, 8% IRR in a world that I think is going to be a sub 3% inflation rate.  And then, all the added things we can put on top of it and with Essentials and all that, I've developed capital at those rates all day long. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please state your question. \nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. The lease percentage of the development pipeline has been dropping pretty materially kind of back to 2019 levels. What are the factors there? And does this impact your ability that hate your yields expected on these developments? \nHamid Moghadam : Yeah, I think maybe the best way I\u2019ll summarize in this call would be, we are back to 2019. Okay. We are getting at it in 25 different ways. But the easiest way to think about it is, demand, supply, rental growth, all of those things that are trending back to 2019 pre-COVID.  And if you take \u201820 to \u201822 out of the picture and imagine, that in 2019, somebody would tell you that in 2023 you are still talking about the dynamics of 2019 market, I would be jumping up and down happy about that. So, that\u2019s where we are and almost to any question, I am not trying to avoid your question. But it would be the same answer on 20 other parameters, as well. We're back to 2019. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Thillman with Baird. Please state your question. \nNick Thillman: Hey, good morning. Hamid, kind of touched on you guys competing on price by 20% of tenants not renewing because of that. But retention is dropping down to 70%. So, are those tenants are renewing or do they not? Where do they end up going? Do they go to a new supply or a new product that's being delivered? Or is it more sort of a scenario where they're just completely priced out of the market? \nHamid Moghadam : No. They go somewhere else. I mean, those are real needs and at the end of the day, warehouse rent is - as a percentage of total logistic cost is relatively small. So they are not going to go out of business because of that. I mean, frankly, the pressure on energy prices, on fuel prices, on labor prices and all that, if you are going to worry about something those are more significant than their ability to pay rent. 70% is not a unusually low retention rate. I mean, if you, again forget about the last three years where there was no space and people had no choice, that would be a very normal rate of retention for us, going back and looking at it over 10, 20 year timeframe. So, and we are trying to find out what the efficient point is for losing customers because of price.  We can make that number be zero, but that would not be wise because that means we're not pushing rents as hard. So, 20% is definitely still below where I would start worrying about dial and get the other way. If it got to about 30%, we may want to moderate on that. But still, generally speaking, the bias is towards pushing rents and not occupancies.  Now markets where that is not the case, we\u2019ll dial it back some. But that's a decision we make day-to-day based on the data that we see. It\u2019s not a top down type of decision. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. \nRonald Kamdem: Hey. Just a couple quick ones. Just going back to the market rent growth forecast and also Southern California, can you give us some context in terms of what was the first half growth on the market rent growth? Number one. And then, number two, when you talk about sort of Southern California, decelerating, is there a way to get some context on \u2013 is it just a deceleration or should we be bracing for things to potentially turn negative in that market?\nTim Arndt: So, couple things. First of all, the most important thing about Southern California is the gas in the tank. Not rental growth going forward. I mean the gas in the tank in the Southern California is \u2013 I don\u2019t know the exact number, but it\u2019s probably over a 100% on your average lease. So, whether you think rents are going to grow 3% or negative 3% or 10% or whatever, it's not going to affect that number one Iota.  Are there markets in Southern California and elsewhere where you could see rental growth sliding? Sure, of course, there are. When something has escalated by 150%, I wouldn't be surprised if it backslid some. Do I worry about Southern California becoming a difficult market? No. I would like to have more Southern California, because that means we have more cars with more gas in the tank.  So, there's some markets that may continue to escalate, but they're still not going to be as good as a market that has embedded growth of well over a 100%. So I'm not trying to duck your question. But we're a global company, it's a 1.2 billion square foot portfolio and I think it would not be a productive use of my time or anybody else as your time to drill down into sub-market or individual rents.  Because frankly, we don't spend a lot of time ourselves looking at that. We look at it bottoms up a deal-by-deal. And then, we make our long-term investment decisions based on some macro bets. And what I'm telling you is that we like Southern California because of its embedded mark-to-market. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question. \nMichael Carroll: Yes. Thanks. I guess just direct it to Tim. I believe last quarter that you indicated the 2024 lease expirations had an 85 plus percent mark-to-market. I mean, can you touch on what is included in that estimate? Does that reflects expected market rent growth in 2023? And if so, does that 85% target in stats still hold today? \nTim Arndt: We would be in the 80s. Let me put it that way right now, and that would contemplate market rent growth from here. So, we feel good about still hitting that kind of number, but we will give full guidance on it later in the year. \nChris Caton: Yeah, I don't think we know anything that suggests a different number than when we told you before. So, so it's essentially the same number. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please state your question. \nCamille Bonnel : Good morning. So, to clarify on Hamid\u2019s comments around the portfolio's embedded NOI growth, if rents grew another 5% as you're projecting in the back half of this year, are you expecting core NOI growth to be tracking above that 7% mention or more closely to the growth you projecting this year? And Tim, from your opening remarks, it sounds like market rents have grown in line with expectations to-date but moderated into 2Q. Can you just comment on how the pace of growth looks like for the remainder of the year based on your teams\u2019 projections? \nTim Arndt: Well, I'll take the first one. I think I want to be sure we're not conflating a couple things on same-store. So Hamid\u2019s illustration earlier was about a four year horizon what we think will unfold in terms of market rent growth. That would be that roughly 8.5% coverage. And I'll go\u2026 \nHamid Moghadam : But the average same-store NOI growth, not the rent growth, same-store NOI growth. \nTim Arndt: Sorry. \nHamid Moghadam : I don't even have the number for rent growth because frankly, I don't really spend a lot of - that's a very volatile number. \nTim Arndt: Yeah. So, and that number by the way incidentally incorporates what will happen in due confirms of its fair value lease adjustments and what we think will happen in occupancy. So that's kind of fully baked and that's a four-year discussion. In terms of this year, there's going to be very little that could change in any direction on market rents that would affect this year's same-store growth.  Just too much of the lease mark-to-market and the year frankly are now baked that we're going to land pretty tightly in the range that I\u2026 \nHamid Moghadam : For next years. \nTim Arndt: Yeah, true. \nChris Caton : And then as it relates to the rent growth detailed, Tim\u2019s script included a way for you to kind of reconcile that. And I think within the numbers, the main thing to know is, many It's both in the US and globally continued to have really healthy pricing power and meaningful move in market rents, but the aggregate number is adjusted downward based on the disease on Southern California that we've discussed here. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nJohn Kim: Thank you. Just a follow-up on the $3 billion acquisition you made. How much of that did it contribute to your full-year guidance raise if at all? And can you comment on the pricing just given, 4% going in cap rate, not many buyers have Prologis use cost of capital. So I was wondering how you came to that level and how many competing bids or buyers there were at that level? \nTim Arndt: Yeah, I'll pick up on the on the earning side. It's about a $0.05 roughly of our are raise would be attributable to that. The remainder would be the same-store component. \nHamid Moghadam : Yeah. And on the number of competing buyers and all that, we don't know but we actually work collaboratively with the seller to pick a portfolio that makes sense for them and make sense for us. So it wasn't like there was a package and a competitive environment. But look, I would argue that two of the largest players in this space kind of know what's going on in the market and they don't need to know a lot of third-party validation of where pricing is. And we came to an agreement reasonably quickly on that.  So, we're really pleased about it because we don't have to go through the brain damage of cleaning up the portfolio. We bought what we wanted to buy at the price that we wanted to buy and presumably they got the price that they wanted. And everybody was very happy about that and we'd love to do more of that. \nOperator: The next question comes from Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please state your question. \nNicholas Yulico: Thanks. Just a question in terms of, what you're seeing with activity in the 3PL space. I mean, some commentary we were specifically about, LA and 3PL was that it was a market very tight to tenants took as much spaces they could get. In many cases took some excess space in recent years. And now that those same tenants in some cases are putting sublease space on the markers and then you also have less demand from the user group. Maybe it's a port issue in the near term.  But I guess I'm just wondering, broadly on 3PL what the activity of that tenant base looks like in - across your portfolio? \nChris Caton: Yeah, I'm going to make a general comment and it applies maybe a bit more to 3PLs, but it applies to everybody. Southern California is a market were embedded mark-to-market is well over 100%. The 3PL business is a very low margin business. Very thin margin business. If you've taken ten percent more space than you would needed and now with the changed outlook you think you need 10% less than you need it before that's a 20% swing in how much space you're going to need the over the over the longer term.  If you can make three or four x what you would make at a year - in a year, moving boxes around by subleasing that space, you would do that. So, the propensity to adjust your space to your needs is much greater in this cycle because of this significant mark-to-market that's in better than some of these leases. Now, if you're in a market where - and I can't think of a market like that.  But let's say you were in a market where you're essentially a market or 10% below, by the time you pay a leasing commission and encourage the downtime and maybe put some TI's in the space, you're not going to make money on that space. So it's more of a cost avoidance and therefore not much of that happens. Southern California is actually viewed as a source of profit for these guys to sublease their real estate. So they're going to do it much quicker than before and that's in fact what we\u2019ve seen.  So and - it all goes back to having less than 1% vacancy in this market not too long ago. So, look, Southern California has been a crazy rent growth market for the for as long as I remember, whether you look at 30 years or five years or three years, but the last three years have been have just been ridiculous. And for anybody to think that that would continue forever, I - we certainly don't make our investment decisions based on that and we don't operate our portfolio like that. So, we're not surprised about what's going on in Southern California. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please state your question. \nVikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the question. There is do two questions. One, just looking at the lease proposal chart, correct me if I'm wrong, I think this is all in square feet and I'm just wondering how this would compare, whether you look at it as a percent of expirations or the portfolio just because you're a much bigger portfolio today with Duke in there and other acquisitions. So as a percent of the portfolio is, there something unique in terms of the trend downward it would seem as a percentage it's probably much lower. So if you clarify that number one.  And then, just number two, bigger picture, Hamid, if you're talking about normalization in trends to still healthy levels but that's just in normalizing to 2019. Where do you think the risk premium should be for public private warehouse space? Should it be higher? Is it fair as it is today? Thanks. \nHamid Moghadam: Yeah, let me start with that. In 2009, there was a big difference between now and 2019. 2019, I don\u2019t remember the exact number, but I think vacancy rates were north of 5%, maybe even north of 6%. Today and the outlook in 2019 was that we had a long run of improving market conditions and I think as calls like this we are all worrying about for the sixth year in a row whether supply would exceed demand okay?  That today - it's a same market except the vacancy rates are substantially lower than they were at that time. And we have less of a concern about supply beyond this year that is than we had in 2019. So, it's a slightly different market but the dynamics are not that unusual.  With respected public to private, I continue to believe that - I don't know about the sector, but I continue to believe that we trade at a modest discount to NAV and private values. And I think once capital flows start up again, once the denominator effect starts going the other way because of improvements in public markets, I think that will be validated.  So, I do think private values in general are slightly higher than public values where these companies are priced. \nHamid Moghadam : And then Vikram on the proposal volumes, yes as square footage and as to reconciling it I'd point you to the answer earlier to the same question and happy to go through it offline if that's not sufficient for you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Just the number one on market rent growth. You've previously talked about a 300 to 500 basis points spread in market rent growth between coastal and non-coastal markets. In light of your comments around Southern California, can you just talk about how you expect that spread to trend as you look ahead to 2024? And are there other coastal markets that you would include in the discussion with Southern California as you think about the labor strikes and the impact that that's having at the ports? \nHamid Moghadam : Yeah, I want to be clear about what we said. If you look at all the markets that we operate in, Southern California is going to have the highest rent growth of all, not market rent growth, maybe the market rent growth will modulate, but because of the mark-to-market Southern California for the foreseeable future. And by that, I mean five years plus is going to have the highest growth rate of any market that I can think of five. Chris, do you? \nChris Caton : Yes, 100%. \nHamid Moghadam : Yeah, and that can go on literally for five to ten years. So, because the mark-to-market is so huge. Now, in terms of the market rent growth, I don't know, we'll find out, but it's our view has moderated. But that really doesn't matter. It's kind of like adding 2% to 3% in one direction or the other to a number that's north of 100% percent. So I think we're focusing on the wrong issues. I don't I don't really know the answer to your question. If I did I\u2019d tell you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please state your question. \nAnthony Powell: Hi, good morning. Just a question on contributions. It looks like you restarted in this quarter with Japan, and Mexico. Is there still to plan to restart contributions in the US or Europe later this year. And how \u2013how they're progressing overall? \nHamid Moghadam : Yeah, I\u2019ll start it and pitch it over to Chris then. Look, the reason we stopped contribution is not because we didn't have the capacity to buy these assets in our funds, we did because they're very low leveraged. The reason we did is that we couldn't really look our investors in the eyes and say that we all have clarity around the values for the fund, for \u2013 for the properties that are being contributed. So we're not in a rush to do that.  There were some companies that force these decisions back in the last cycle that that - and we didn't, and we fared much better than those companies that force, - forced the contributions. So as long as there is clarity on valuations, we will contribute assets at least we would be willing to contribute assets. But I remind all of you, at the end of the day, the independent advisory board for each fund makes a decision of whether they want to accept those contributions or not.  It's not a must put, must take kind of a situation at all. So, but, we couldn't very much look them in the eyes and say that this is the value because there was uncertainty around it. In the markets that you mentioned, there is clarity around the values. Europe, we felt that it reached a point of clarity at the end of last quarter and we believe the U.S. is not becoming very clear too.  And the whole process took about three quarters from the downturn, which is what we expected this to say based on experience. So you should expect contributions to continue at the sort of a normal or maybe somewhat modulated pace. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Mueller with - go ahead. \nHamid Moghadam : Caton, do you have anything to add to that? \nChris Caton : No, I think that's right. I mean, we will probably look at contributions in Q4. No rush as you said going through that ordinary course of business and split it between both in Europe and the US. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question from Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. \nMike Mueller: Okay. Thanks. I guess following up on that contribution question, are you seeing any traction yet in the third quarter with dispositions? \nHamid Moghadam : We are not trying to dispose of a whole lot because remember, we're almost through all the liberty ones and Duke had very little dispositions associated with. We sold a couple of them of late and the latest Blackstone portfolio has zero dispositions in it. So, I mean, other than the normal sort of Bluebird dispositions we're kind of reaching the end of cleaning up the portfolio.  There are few deals here and there, but then what would you add to that? \nChris Caton : I would say the transaction market is opening up and we're very confident. We're going to be able to dispose of what we want when we want. \nHamid Moghadam : But it's not a material amount. It\u2019s not going to move the need on our company. \nOperator: Next question comes from Craig Mailman with Citi. Please state your question. \nNick Joseph: Thanks actually, Nick Joseph here with Craig. Just going back to the comment you made earlier on the Blackstone portfolio deal you said you worked with the seller, kind of what would work the both sides and obviously they are lot clearly there was a lot to choose from. So, what were you focused on, is there from a portfolio or strategic perspective in terms of the assets you\u2019ve acquired?\nTim Arndt : Well, the markets that we like in the long term. And I can tell you that during the course of those that analysis and that thinking, what the market rent is going to do in the next six months to the last decimal point was not a consideration. I mean, it\u2019s - those are markets that we really believe based on daily interactions with customers as to where demand is going to be where we see that trends in supply which are by the way let\u2019s, we haven't talked about that in a couple of quarters.  But Supply is becoming extremely difficult to bring online in places like California. In fact, I'm kind of worried about it because some of these places are shutting down. I mean, we spent a lot of time with the legislature trying to defeat A B 1,000 which was a proposal to basically stop all warehouse development in Southern California. So in selecting those assets we focused on the markets that we liked a lot and we were prepared to pay - accept a lower yield for those markets because they have more embedded growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please state your question. \nJamie Feldman: Thank you and thanks for taking my question. So, I want to get your thoughts on just the different regions coming out of what should be a recession if we get a recession. There's a lot of talk about European wages really lagging the U.S. obviously, that's a big driver of retail spending in your business. Can you just talk about what might be different as you think about putting capital to work across Europe, Asia and the US or North America given what, might some of these macro trends we're seeing? \nHamid Moghadam : Yeah. U.S. has got the highest rent growth over time of any of these markets because it's a more dynamic economy, bigger GDP growth I think than Europe certainly. But Europe has always been a sort of more muted market in terms of supply. Vacancy rates are always lower in Europe and land is metered out by usually government authorities. It\u2019s not so much of a free market. You go buy from the former land.  So, it's a more muted growth pattern than the US one. But we mitigate that because we employ more of a fund structure in Europe. So the combination of the earnings on the fund management business plus the growth in the underlying real estate business makes up for the - makes up for that difference. Asia, China used to be a powerhouse in terms of economic growth.  It frankly has surprised everybody coming out of it with respect to how slow it's been to turnaround. I'm not smart enough to know whether that's a, that's a long-term trend, or a short-term trend. But that market has gone from basically 10% per year type of GDP growth to more like a 5% rate of growth. Japan, probably the best long-term market for us, from a development point of view has always had low rent growth. 1% to 2% rent growth would be great.  But boy!! there's no CapEx. There's no turnover. There is, - and yields have maintained themselves in Japan, better than anywhere else. There's been no cap rate expansion in Japan at all. And remember, there's hardly any mark-to-market. So there is no cap rate expansion. And in fact, I would say there's probably 10, 15 basis points of compression in the last 12 months.  So it's a good development market and from an operating point of view, we talk cap rates. But at the end of the day, the cash flows in Japan are very strong. There's very little of it leaks out to CapEx and other things. So, each market is different and each market when you look at it as a portfolio plays its role within our overall business. \nOperator: Thank you. And our final question for today comes from Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please state your question. \nCamille Bonnel : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Does the valuation of your USLF fun take into account the recent portfolio acquisition you announced or is that more of a comp for next quarter? \nHamid Moghadam : Good question, Camille. I don't know. We bought that portfolio on balance sheet. So it's not a fund investment, so. But I honestly don't know how long it's going to take the appraisers to reflect that. But it's - we bought it at the very consistent level of valuation to what we thought valuations would be this quarter. And I think we were right about that. So I think the market has adjusted in terms of understanding where values are going, I think we're at the tail end of those adjustments.  You were the last question Camille. So thank you all for your interest in the company. We certainly feel very good about our business going forward. And hope that we will have the opportunity to speak to you more over the summer. Thank you, everyone. \nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference of parties. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Caton",
            "content": "Hey, it's Chris Caton. So, really when we look at that data, the right way to look at that is against our open availabilities. And when you put those proposals against our open availabilities they are actually in line or above the historical average, 48% is that number, it's something we've used in the past on these calls. And so how we do make the proposal numbers you're talking about tie with that view, well, there are two or three drivers.  The first is that the availabilities just, the role that we have in the next 12 months are low relative to history. The second is those proposal volumes do include, sometimes multiple proposals on a single unit and that has declined over the last year as we've discussed previously. And then, third, there's some seasonality where June would be a soft month. Sure. Let me take a stab at that, because I've seen this now a couple of times over the last 30, 40 years. Southern California is really being adversely affected by two things. One, ports volumes. I think this labor strike has gone on longer than most people anticipated. And the timing of it was such that people have to make decisions about the Christmas season and they've shifted volumes to other ports. And that affect Southern California and honestly, the longer disclose out, I believe the worse it will be for Southern California in terms of doing permanent damage.  From now from everything we hear and we're not an expert on this, things are apparently heading in a positive direction with respect to a resolution. But you read the same things we do. So, I don't have any unique perspectives on that.  The other, the other difference with Southern California is just pricing. I mean, you had between \u201820 and \u201822, about an 130% increase in rents in Southern California, that compares to less than half of that for the overall markets that we operate in. So, there is more price sensitivity now because it's a very, very expensive market.  So to the extent possible, people will shift to adjacent markets. And combined, it's not just price, but up until a quarter ago, occupancies in the Inland Empire was 99 point something percent. So people couldn't even get the space that they wanted. I think with the more normalized vacancy level and we're still not at normal.  I mean, normalized in my experience is 95% occupancy and that would have been great for the last 15 or 20 years. I think with more normalized occupancy, you'll see, Peep and a resolution of the labor strike. I think you see a more normal pattern from which you can draw some conclusions. Yeah, I don't think we know anything that suggests a different number than when we told you before. So, so it's essentially the same number. And then as it relates to the rent growth detailed, Tim's script included a way for you to kind of reconcile that. And I think within the numbers, the main thing to know is, many It's both in the US and globally continued to have really healthy pricing power and meaningful move in market rents, but the aggregate number is adjusted downward based on the disease on Southern California that we've discussed here. Yeah, I'm going to make a general comment and it applies maybe a bit more to 3PLs, but it applies to everybody. Southern California is a market were embedded mark-to-market is well over 100%. The 3PL business is a very low margin business. Very thin margin business. If you've taken ten percent more space than you would needed and now with the changed outlook you think you need 10% less than you need it before that's a 20% swing in how much space you're going to need the over the over the longer term.  If you can make three or four x what you would make at a year - in a year, moving boxes around by subleasing that space, you would do that. So, the propensity to adjust your space to your needs is much greater in this cycle because of this significant mark-to-market that's in better than some of these leases. Now, if you're in a market where - and I can't think of a market like that.  But let's say you were in a market where you're essentially a market or 10% below, by the time you pay a leasing commission and encourage the downtime and maybe put some TI's in the space, you're not going to make money on that space. So it's more of a cost avoidance and therefore not much of that happens. Southern California is actually viewed as a source of profit for these guys to sublease their real estate. So they're going to do it much quicker than before and that's in fact what we've seen.  So and - it all goes back to having less than 1% vacancy in this market not too long ago. So, look, Southern California has been a crazy rent growth market for the for as long as I remember, whether you look at 30 years or five years or three years, but the last three years have been have just been ridiculous. And for anybody to think that that would continue forever, I - we certainly don't make our investment decisions based on that and we don't operate our portfolio like that. So, we're not surprised about what's going on in Southern California. Yes, 100%. No, I think that's right. I mean, we will probably look at contributions in Q4. No rush as you said going through that ordinary course of business and split it between both in Europe and the US. I would say the transaction market is opening up and we're very confident. We're going to be able to dispose of what we want when we want."

            "name": "Dan Letter",
            "content": "Yeah. Sure. So, we have - we're seeing continued broad-based demand across all size ranges. Now there certainly are pockets of - in certain markets that there's some risk and maybe the bulk. And those are markets we've talked about historically. South Dallas, North Fort Worth, Indianapolis is getting a fair amount of bulk built out. But, and then I would say West Phoenix, as well. But what I would say with our portfolio overall, we're really isolated from any of this bulk risk and we're really confident in the demand across all site ranges. Yeah. I mean, certainly, portfolios that we would acquire would be at a discount to replacement cost. And replacement costs has moved up tremendously in the last couple of years by virtue of - forget about the land piece, because that's a squishy piece that's related to rent and all that. But the construction piece has really, really escalated. So to buy standing inventory in our best markets is always a really great thing that we look at.  The quality of the portfolio was quite high, I would say very close to our own portfolio. The percentage that we would dispose of is zero. So it was hand selected to meet our requirements. I wouldn't call it a steal. We didn't steal anything. I think it's a market rate transaction and with the upside built into the rents, you know, 8% IRR in a world that I think is going to be a sub 3% inflation rate.  And then, all the added things we can put on top of it and with Essentials and all that, I've developed capital at those rates all day long."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Hamid Moghadam",
            "content": "Yeah. The one thing I would add to that is that, I think we mentioned to you last quarter that we would be continuing to push rents pretty hard and would like to see occupancies a bit lower than 98%. So, what you think is consistent with what we're planning to do and actually we accomplished what we wanted to do in that we tracked a number of leases that we lose because of price and how hard we were pushing. And we modulate around that to figure out the trade-off between rents and occupancy.  So we did see as a result of our efforts, an uptick in basically the percentage of deals lost due to price. It went up from about 10% to about 20%, which is kind of where we would like to have it. So it's [Indiscernible]. Yeah. Let me start on the development volume and then pitch it over to Dan for the other commentary. We do not care about development starts. We do not care about acquisition guidance. We will - we make all these decisions one-by-one and only when it makes sense to pull the trigger on these. They're buying large already more or less and we could, on a discretionary basis, start all of them today.  But that would not be a wise thing to do and we're not going to do it just to meet some artificial guidance. I think the main driver of earnings in this company, which is what we all care about is rental growth and same-store growth. And all I can tell you is that with mid-60s mark-to-market, you can model whatever scenario you want, including zero rent growth from here on out.  And for the next four years, five years, you're going to get same-store NOI increase of 7.5% with no rental growth from this point forward.  You put in our normalized forecast for a rental growth our best guess and that same-store growth will be at 8.5%. Both of those numbers are consistent with low-double-digit earnings growth, while maintaining our leverage, which is, which is so low. So, I don't - we don't need development starts to drive anything, and we're not going to get in a position of \u2013 or jeopardizing our pricing power by virtue of wanting to meet an artificial development goal.  Now having said all that, we will start the ones that we think we can lease efficiently and economically and quickly. And the land is there. The approvals are there. And our ability to put buildings up is there. So, there is no benefit in front end loading that stuff and pushing it ahead of where it needs to be. Dan, do you want to address the site question? Yeah, I think maybe the best way I'll summarize in this call would be, we are back to 2019. Okay. We are getting at it in 25 different ways. But the easiest way to think about it is, demand, supply, rental growth, all of those things that are trending back to 2019 pre-COVID.  And if you take \u201820 to \u201822 out of the picture and imagine, that in 2019, somebody would tell you that in 2023 you are still talking about the dynamics of 2019 market, I would be jumping up and down happy about that. So, that's where we are and almost to any question, I am not trying to avoid your question. But it would be the same answer on 20 other parameters, as well. We're back to 2019. No. They go somewhere else. I mean, those are real needs and at the end of the day, warehouse rent is - as a percentage of total logistic cost is relatively small. So they are not going to go out of business because of that. I mean, frankly, the pressure on energy prices, on fuel prices, on labor prices and all that, if you are going to worry about something those are more significant than their ability to pay rent. 70% is not a unusually low retention rate. I mean, if you, again forget about the last three years where there was no space and people had no choice, that would be a very normal rate of retention for us, going back and looking at it over 10, 20 year timeframe. So, and we are trying to find out what the efficient point is for losing customers because of price.  We can make that number be zero, but that would not be wise because that means we're not pushing rents as hard. So, 20% is definitely still below where I would start worrying about dial and get the other way. If it got to about 30%, we may want to moderate on that. But still, generally speaking, the bias is towards pushing rents and not occupancies.  Now markets where that is not the case, we'll dial it back some. But that's a decision we make day-to-day based on the data that we see. It's not a top down type of decision. But the average same-store NOI growth, not the rent growth, same-store NOI growth. I don't even have the number for rent growth because frankly, I don't really spend a lot of - that's a very volatile number. For next years. Yeah. And on the number of competing buyers and all that, we don't know but we actually work collaboratively with the seller to pick a portfolio that makes sense for them and make sense for us. So it wasn't like there was a package and a competitive environment. But look, I would argue that two of the largest players in this space kind of know what's going on in the market and they don't need to know a lot of third-party validation of where pricing is. And we came to an agreement reasonably quickly on that.  So, we're really pleased about it because we don't have to go through the brain damage of cleaning up the portfolio. We bought what we wanted to buy at the price that we wanted to buy and presumably they got the price that they wanted. And everybody was very happy about that and we'd love to do more of that. Yeah, let me start with that. In 2009, there was a big difference between now and 2019. 2019, I don't remember the exact number, but I think vacancy rates were north of 5%, maybe even north of 6%. Today and the outlook in 2019 was that we had a long run of improving market conditions and I think as calls like this we are all worrying about for the sixth year in a row whether supply would exceed demand okay?  That today - it's a same market except the vacancy rates are substantially lower than they were at that time. And we have less of a concern about supply beyond this year that is than we had in 2019. So, it's a slightly different market but the dynamics are not that unusual.  With respected public to private, I continue to believe that - I don't know about the sector, but I continue to believe that we trade at a modest discount to NAV and private values. And I think once capital flows start up again, once the denominator effect starts going the other way because of improvements in public markets, I think that will be validated.  So, I do think private values in general are slightly higher than public values where these companies are priced. And then Vikram on the proposal volumes, yes as square footage and as to reconciling it I'd point you to the answer earlier to the same question and happy to go through it offline if that's not sufficient for you. Yeah, I want to be clear about what we said. If you look at all the markets that we operate in, Southern California is going to have the highest rent growth of all, not market rent growth, maybe the market rent growth will modulate, but because of the mark-to-market Southern California for the foreseeable future. And by that, I mean five years plus is going to have the highest growth rate of any market that I can think of five. Chris, do you? Yeah, and that can go on literally for five to ten years. So, because the mark-to-market is so huge. Now, in terms of the market rent growth, I don't know, we'll find out, but it's our view has moderated. But that really doesn't matter. It's kind of like adding 2% to 3% in one direction or the other to a number that's north of 100% percent. So I think we're focusing on the wrong issues. I don't I don't really know the answer to your question. If I did I'd tell you. Yeah, I'll start it and pitch it over to Chris then. Look, the reason we stopped contribution is not because we didn't have the capacity to buy these assets in our funds, we did because they're very low leveraged. The reason we did is that we couldn't really look our investors in the eyes and say that we all have clarity around the values for the fund, for \u2013 for the properties that are being contributed. So we're not in a rush to do that.  There were some companies that force these decisions back in the last cycle that that - and we didn't, and we fared much better than those companies that force, - forced the contributions. So as long as there is clarity on valuations, we will contribute assets at least we would be willing to contribute assets. But I remind all of you, at the end of the day, the independent advisory board for each fund makes a decision of whether they want to accept those contributions or not.  It's not a must put, must take kind of a situation at all. So, but, we couldn't very much look them in the eyes and say that this is the value because there was uncertainty around it. In the markets that you mentioned, there is clarity around the values. Europe, we felt that it reached a point of clarity at the end of last quarter and we believe the U.S. is not becoming very clear too.  And the whole process took about three quarters from the downturn, which is what we expected this to say based on experience. So you should expect contributions to continue at the sort of a normal or maybe somewhat modulated pace. Caton, do you have anything to add to that? We are not trying to dispose of a whole lot because remember, we're almost through all the liberty ones and Duke had very little dispositions associated with. We sold a couple of them of late and the latest Blackstone portfolio has zero dispositions in it. So, I mean, other than the normal sort of Bluebird dispositions we're kind of reaching the end of cleaning up the portfolio.  There are few deals here and there, but then what would you add to that? But it's not a material amount. It's not going to move the need on our company. Yeah. U.S. has got the highest rent growth over time of any of these markets because it's a more dynamic economy, bigger GDP growth I think than Europe certainly. But Europe has always been a sort of more muted market in terms of supply. Vacancy rates are always lower in Europe and land is metered out by usually government authorities. It's not so much of a free market. You go buy from the former land.  So, it's a more muted growth pattern than the US one. But we mitigate that because we employ more of a fund structure in Europe. So the combination of the earnings on the fund management business plus the growth in the underlying real estate business makes up for the - makes up for that difference. Asia, China used to be a powerhouse in terms of economic growth.  It frankly has surprised everybody coming out of it with respect to how slow it's been to turnaround. I'm not smart enough to know whether that's a, that's a long-term trend, or a short-term trend. But that market has gone from basically 10% per year type of GDP growth to more like a 5% rate of growth. Japan, probably the best long-term market for us, from a development point of view has always had low rent growth. 1% to 2% rent growth would be great.  But boy!! there's no CapEx. There's no turnover. There is, - and yields have maintained themselves in Japan, better than anywhere else. There's been no cap rate expansion in Japan at all. And remember, there's hardly any mark-to-market. So there is no cap rate expansion. And in fact, I would say there's probably 10, 15 basis points of compression in the last 12 months.  So it's a good development market and from an operating point of view, we talk cap rates. But at the end of the day, the cash flows in Japan are very strong. There's very little of it leaks out to CapEx and other things. So, each market is different and each market when you look at it as a portfolio plays its role within our overall business. Good question, Camille. I don't know. We bought that portfolio on balance sheet. So it's not a fund investment, so. But I honestly don't know how long it's going to take the appraisers to reflect that. But it's - we bought it at the very consistent level of valuation to what we thought valuations would be this quarter. And I think we were right about that. So I think the market has adjusted in terms of understanding where values are going, I think we're at the tail end of those adjustments.  You were the last question Camille. So thank you all for your interest in the company. We certainly feel very good about our business going forward. And hope that we will have the opportunity to speak to you more over the summer. Thank you, everyone."

            "name": "Tim Arndt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We had a very good quarter with outstanding results across our uniquely diversified business. It was highlighted by record rent change, a ramp up in development starts roughly half of which were build-to-suit and the acquisition of over $3 billion of real estate at accretive returns deepening our scale in key markets.  We also earned record strategic capital income and raised $1.2 billion in new equity across the vehicles. We are watching markets closely and we've been clear that we expect vacancies to arise over the course of the year from a normalization of demand and elevated development deliveries.  We've indeed seen vacancy build and expected to reach the mid-fours in the US by year end but continue to believe that fundamentals will regain momentum in 2024 with the outlook for new supply declining as development starts continue to fall this year. In short, our outlook is completely unchanged and we feel great about our business.  Turning to our results, core FFO excluding promotes was $1.25 per share and including promotes was $1.83 per share, both ahead of our forecast. Our promote income was generated from both USLF and FIBRA Prologis and meaningfully exceeded our guidance.  USLF generated promote revenue at Prologis share of over $635 million. In its three year performance period, assets grew by over $10 billion and the fund delivered an IRR of over 20% net of all fees and with very low leverage.  In terms of our operating results, average occupancy for the quarter was 97.5%, down 50 basis points from the first quarter and in line with our expectations. Rent change on starts was a record on both a net effective and cash basis, 79% and 48% respectively. Net effective rent change on signings of more forward-looking build was an impressive 87% with notable rent change from Phoenix at a 137%, Northern New Jersey at 150% and Southern California at a 181%.  Global markets also contributed to strong signings with Mexico at 34%, the UK at 36%, Central Europe at 51%, and Canada at a 150%. Bottom-line rent change has been both robust and broad based.  Market rents continued to grow albeit at a slower pace increasing a little over 1.5% in the quarter. In-place rents grew by approximately 2.5% over the quarter, the net of which translates to a lease mark-to-market of 66%, down from 68%. We explained last quarter that our lease mark-to-market would generate $2.85 per share of incremental earnings as leases roll over time without any additional market rent growth.  Interestingly, that future upside is virtually unchanged at June 30th, even though we crystallized rental increases over the quarter. This is because a lower lease market-to-market is now being applied to a larger base of in-place NOI. Ultimately, same-store growth is our most important operating metric and this quarter remained exceptional at 8.9% on a net effective basis and 10.7% on cash.  I'd like to highlight that even with $4 billion of investment during the quarter, the balance sheet remains in impeccable shape, with liquidity of approximately $6.4 billion and debt-to-EBITDA of 4.2x. We raised approximately $7 billion in debt financing across four currencies at an interest rate of 4.9% and an average term of eight years.  Turning to our markets, the trend to normalization, which we've been speaking to for some time continues. Proposal activity, gestation and pre-leasing of vacancy are all within a few percent of their pre-COVID levels, a period which we've highlighted many times was itself historically strong. Our IDI sentiment index ticked in the quarter to over 58 indicating a continued strong backdrop for demand as described by our customers and further supported by utilization increasing to 85.5%.  Unsurprisingly, customers have been more deliberate in their decision-making amidst the uptick in vacancy. We continue to believe that this will be a short-lived reprieve as construction starts have indeed declined significantly for our expectations. Starts in the second quarter were down approximately 40% across our US markets and 50% in Europe.  We see deliveries in 2024 falling short of demand, reducing vacancy over the course of next year. Significant attention has been given to Southern California in recent months, while our portfolio is over 97% leased and we are achieving record rent change, vacancy has grown partially due to port operations that have not yet returned to normal.  Additionally, some customers are re-evaluating expansion in the Inland Empire diversifying operations to other Southwest markets. With all this in mind, we've reduced our rent growth forecast for Southern California in 2023.  However given what is still low vacancy together with structural headwinds to new supply and a huge consumption base, we believe strongly in this market. The global nature of our portfolio means that we will see markets contribute to growth in different periods evening out peaks and troughs. We see this playing out in a number of markets across the globe, where our rent growth forecast is increasing this quarter such as Las Vegas, Texas, Europe and Mexico to name a few.  All this together with the more than 5% rent growth to-date has us re-forecasting the full year to a range of 7% to 9% on a global basis. What matters more than what will transpire in the next six months is what we see over the medium term, which is growth that will be fueled by escalating replacement costs, growing barriers to new supply and ongoing secular drivers of demand.  Late in the second quarter we announced and closed on the acquisition of over 14 million square foot portfolio in many of our best US markets. We estimate an 8% unlevered IRR simply at the property level, exclusive of additional return driven by property management synergies, essentials opportunities, including solar and the upside we expect through revenue management.  While this was the largest transaction in the quarter, overall activity increased slightly bringing additional price discovery to the market.  In Europe values have been relatively stable, experiencing a 1% decline over the second quarter. Latin America saw an increase in values with write-ups in Brazil and Mexico of 2% and 5% respectively and write-downs in the US were in line with expectations approximately 5% driving the cumulative decline over the last year to 12%.  With this move, we view the values as fair and are proceeding on redemption in USLF for the third quarter.  New redemption requests in the quarter totaled approximately $800 million and was concentrated in USLF and our China venture where values have held up better. Together with other activity the net redemption queue stands at approximately $1.6 billion. Outside of open-ended funds, the company raised an incremental $1.2 billion comprised of $500 million in the FIBRA and NPR, as well as a new $700 million commitment for a complementary vehicle in Japan, PJLF, which is detailed in our supplemental.  Before turning to guidance, I'd like to mention a few updates across our Essentials business. We added 45 megawatts of new solar production and storage in the first half of the year, bringing our platform total to 450 megawatts, nearly 50% of the way to our 1 gigawatt goal for 2025.  Additionally, Prologis Mobility, our EV business has more than 65 lead charging sites in the pipeline across the US and Europe.  In terms of our outlook for the balance of the year, we are guiding average occupancy to range between 97% and 97.5%. We are increasing our same-store guidance eight three quarters to nine and a quarter percent on a net effective basis and 9.5% to 10% on a cash basis.  Net effective rent change propelling same stores will continue to accelerate in the next two quarters and average approximately 80% over the year. We are maintaining our G&A guidance to range between $380 million and $390 million and are increasing our strategic capital revenue guidance excluding promotes to range between $520 million and $530 million. As a result of the outperformance in USLF's promotes, we are increasing our forecast for net promote income to $475 million. Year-to-date, we are in excess of this amount, but the amortization expense will continue over the back half of the year.  Development starts picked up during the quarter with commencements of 12 projects around the globe and while we remained very selective on new spec starts, we are maintaining our guidance to $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the year. We had over $550 million in contribution in disposition activity during the quarter concentrated in Japan and Mexico and are maintaining guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion.  Putting it all together, we are increasing guidance for GAAP earnings to range between $3.30 and $3.40 per share. We are increasing core FFO including promotes guidance to a range of $5.56 to $5.60 per share and increasing core FFO executing promotes to range between $5.06 and $5.10 per share with the midpoint representing over 10% annual growth marking our fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth.  The quarter highlighted many ways that Prologis has diversified itself across geographies, business lines and capital sources, while rents in some markets decelerate, others with different demand drivers are now accelerating. We're seeing the same balance with property values as demonstrated over the quarter. Further, we generate incremental cash flows and value creation outside of the pure rent business in closely related and synergistic platforms, namely Strategic Capital development and now Essentials. Our fundraising efforts also demonstrate the value of having alternatives. Clearly, our wide access to debt capital has been a tremendous advantage, but we also benefit from access to varied equity sources for our ventures by utilizing open end vehicles, JVs and public structures, we have the ability to be opportunistic and proactive in changing capital markets.  As we close, I'd like to remind you of two upcoming events of Prologis later in the year. Our Groundbreakers Thought Leadership Forum on September 27th, right here in San Francisco, and our Investor Forum on December 13th in New York. Additional information for each is available on our website.  With that, I will hand it back to the operator for your questions. Hey, Tom, I'll start and probably pitch it to Chris here for some help on the market detail. But the U.S. at this point, I would put in a similar range, really given the weight of the U.S. and the notion that we're going to put these things in ranges probably from here, it's going to be very similar to the globe. So I would just think of them as essentially the same.  And then, in terms of markets, clearly, I mentioned in my remarks that Southern California is the market that we've downgraded. That's broadly the base of our change and pretty much the only market and it is matched by various markets as are also detailed many in Southeast US, but it's pretty broad around the US, as well as globally that are picking up the slack and holding the average pretty close when you put it in a range. Yeah, so, on the, on the rent piece, we're not going to go through market rent growth at a market level for a variety of reasons. I think the takeaway we want you and everyone to be left with is just how it can all come into a balance and we're very pleased to see that we're able to hold the forecast at least in a pretty tight range to where we were previously.  And on the occupancy side, you're right about where the ending pieces. I would just comment that that's in line with our forecast. If you look at our average same-store, average occupancy guidance that we have previously and that we have this quarter, it's unchanged. So, the decline that we have expected over the year remains and everything that you see in this quarter is in line with those expectations. So, couple things. First of all, the most important thing about Southern California is the gas in the tank. Not rental growth going forward. I mean the gas in the tank in the Southern California is \u2013 I don't know the exact number, but it's probably over a 100% on your average lease. So, whether you think rents are going to grow 3% or negative 3% or 10% or whatever, it's not going to affect that number one Iota.  Are there markets in Southern California and elsewhere where you could see rental growth sliding? Sure, of course, there are. When something has escalated by 150%, I wouldn't be surprised if it backslid some. Do I worry about Southern California becoming a difficult market? No. I would like to have more Southern California, because that means we have more cars with more gas in the tank.  So, there's some markets that may continue to escalate, but they're still not going to be as good as a market that has embedded growth of well over a 100%. So I'm not trying to duck your question. But we're a global company, it's a 1.2 billion square foot portfolio and I think it would not be a productive use of my time or anybody else as your time to drill down into sub-market or individual rents.  Because frankly, we don't spend a lot of time ourselves looking at that. We look at it bottoms up a deal-by-deal. And then, we make our long-term investment decisions based on some macro bets. And what I'm telling you is that we like Southern California because of its embedded mark-to-market. We would be in the 80s. Let me put it that way right now, and that would contemplate market rent growth from here. So, we feel good about still hitting that kind of number, but we will give full guidance on it later in the year. Well, I'll take the first one. I think I want to be sure we're not conflating a couple things on same-store. So Hamid's illustration earlier was about a four year horizon what we think will unfold in terms of market rent growth. That would be that roughly 8.5% coverage. And I'll go... Sorry. Yeah. So, and that number by the way incidentally incorporates what will happen in due confirms of its fair value lease adjustments and what we think will happen in occupancy. So that's kind of fully baked and that's a four-year discussion. In terms of this year, there's going to be very little that could change in any direction on market rents that would affect this year's same-store growth.  Just too much of the lease mark-to-market and the year frankly are now baked that we're going to land pretty tightly in the range that I... Yeah, true. Yeah, I'll pick up on the on the earning side. It's about a $0.05 roughly of our are raise would be attributable to that. The remainder would be the same-store component. Well, the markets that we like in the long term. And I can tell you that during the course of those that analysis and that thinking, what the market rent is going to do in the next six months to the last decimal point was not a consideration. I mean, it's - those are markets that we really believe based on daily interactions with customers as to where demand is going to be where we see that trends in supply which are by the way let's, we haven't talked about that in a couple of quarters.  But Supply is becoming extremely difficult to bring online in places like California. In fact, I'm kind of worried about it because some of these places are shutting down. I mean, we spent a lot of time with the legislature trying to defeat A B 1,000 which was a proposal to basically stop all warehouse development in Southern California. So in selecting those assets we focused on the markets that we liked a lot and we were prepared to pay - accept a lower yield for those markets because they have more embedded growth."

With that I hand the call over to Tim.\nTim Arndt: Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We began the year with results and conditions that remained strong. Market rents have continued to grow, demand has been consistent and we're seeing sharp declines in new construction limiting future supply. While logistics real estate is very healthy, the macroeconomic picture continues to be a concern and we anticipate it could weigh on customer sentiment over the balance of the year translate into some demand that could be delayed into 2024. However, this will overlap with a slowdown of new deliveries, creating a sustained dynamic for high occupancy and continued rent growth into next year. Beginning with our results, our core FFO excluding promotes was $1.23 per share and including promotes was $1.22 per share. Our results benefited from higher NOI in the quarter but offset by approximately $0.02 of higher insurance expense from an unusually active storm season experiencing a year's worth of claims activity in just the first quarter. In terms of our operating results, both ending and average occupancy for the quarter were 98%, holding average occupancy flat for the fourth quarter. Rent change was 69% on a net effective basis and 42% on a cash basis each a record. The unusually wide spread between the two is reflective of lower free rent and higher escalations in our new leasing. Despite the step-up of in-place rents, our lease mark-to-market expanded to 68% during the quarter as market rent growth remained strong and slightly ahead of expectations. With the remaining lease term of roughly four years, this lease mark-to-market represents over $2.85 per share of incremental earnings as our leases roll the market, providing visibility to future income and dividend growth. These results drove record same-store growth 9.9% on a net effective basis and 11.4% on a cash basis. During the quarter, our efforts on the balance sheet were focused on liquidity, raising over $3.6 billion in new financings for Prologis and our ventures at an interest rate of 4.6% and a term of nearly 14 years. This fundraising total does not include $1 billion of additional capacity from a recast of our global line-of-credit, which closed in April, and brings our total borrowing potential under our lines to $6.5 billion. As mentioned, fundamentals in our markets remain strong, but we expect that a more cautious outlook will weigh on the pace of demand. This is not a new perspective as our forecast 90 days ago prepared for a weakening sentiment and how the top-down view for some occupancy loss over the year. We haven't changed that outlook, but we also haven't upgraded it despite the quarter's outperformance. As an update on proprietary metrics, our proposal activity ticked up in absolute terms and is in line with strong market conditions as a percent of available space. Approximately 99% of the units across our 1.2 billion square feet are either leased or in negotiation. Utilization ticked down to 85%, which is normalizing to a level that our customers view as optimal. E-commerce leasing increased during the quarter to 19% of all new leasing. We avoid drawing conclusions from a single quarter of activity on most metrics, but it's notable here, that e-commerce leasing picked up meaningfully back towards its five-year average. As we've said before, we ultimately look at retention, pre-leasing and rent achievement as the best real-time metrics of portfolio health, and on that basis, our results are certainly very strong. We expect that the current 3.5% vacancy rate in our US markets will build to the low 4s toward the end of the year, before turning back to the mid-3s by late 2024, due to the lack of incoming supply and accounting for moderating demand. We anticipate a similar path in our European markets, and of course, even a 5% vacancy rate is historically excellent and supportive of strong rental growth. We expect this pattern to play out in our true months of supply metric, which was a very healthy 30 months in the US and should decline into the 20s next year. We are launching markets that have large development pipelines such as a few in the Sunbelt in the US, but so far that supply also seems manageable. In Europe, most of our focus is on the UK, where development starts have continued even as demand has moderated, which will lift market vacancies and may pressure rents. And Japan is also a market which is expected to see larger increases in vacancy over the year, but similarly, expects a slowdown in new supply due to surges in land and construction costs. Taking all of these movements into account, we are holding our market rent growth forecast for the year at 10% in the US and 9% globally. In capital markets, transactions continue to be few and far between, but the pickup in activity suggests, we will see a busier second quarter. Appraised values in our funds declined 1% in the US and 2% in Europe during the quarter and 8% and 18% respectively from the peak. It's worth noting that our view of public market prices and NAVs that they have adjusted much more than is warranted for these levels of write-down. Redemption requests and our open-ended funds have slowed significantly with the redemption queue nearly unchanged around 5% of net asset value. This is reflective of both a slower pace of new redemptions as well as rescissions of prior requests. Combined with over $150 million of new commitments made our net queue is essentially unchanged from last year. Last quarter, we described our approach to fulfilling redemption requests, which is based on an overarching objective to be consistent and fair to all investors, requiring a few quarters for valuers to catch up. In that regard, as appraisal seem to be nearing fair value, we plan to redeem units in this quarter, given the swift response to value changes in Europe and expect to do the same in USLF next quarter. In turn, we view this as an excellent time to invest more of our capital into the vehicles, which we'll be doing over the coming quarters and some meaningful numbers. Turning to guidance. We are tightening and increasing average occupancy to range between 97.25% and 97.75%, a 25 basis point increase at the midpoint. Our same-store will benefit from this increase driving our net effective guidance to a range of 8.5% to 9.25%, and cash same-store of 9% to 9.75%. We are forecasting our lease mark-to-market to end the year close to 70%. Extracting the 2024 component of this suggests rent change should exceed 85% next year, even without continued market rent growth, which is a clear illustration of how our exceptional rent change will not only endure but continue to grow. We expect G&A to range between $380 million and $390 million and strategic capital revenues excluding promotes to range between $515 million and $530 million. We are maintaining our forecast for net promote income of $380 million, and given the size of USLF and the potential for small changes in value to have a meaningful impact, there is potential for upside here and we believe we have the downside covered. We had few development starts in the quarter, a reflection of our discipline, but our pipeline is deep and we are maintaining our guidance of $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the year. We expect the pace to remain slow in the second quarter, putting the bulk of the activity into the second half. It's noteworthy that following the belief that construction costs may decline in the coming quarters. We now see them as likely to increase mostly in line with inflation. As new fundraising has become visible, we forecast contributions to be concentrated in the second half totaling $2 billion to $3 billion when combined with forecasted dispositions. So in total, we expect GAAP earnings to range between $3.10 per share and $3.25 per share. We are increasing our core FFO including promotes guidance to a range of $5.42 per share to $5.50 per share, and further, we are guiding core FFO excluding promotes to range between $5.02 per share and $5.10 per share, with the midpoint representing 10% growth over 2022. I'd like to close with a few observations that we've made about our standing in the equity markets, which we found interesting and wanted to share. Today, we sit as the 68th largest company in the S&P 500 ahead of names like GE, American Express, Cigna, Citigroup, as well as Ford and GM combined. Also of notice that with our planned $3.3 billion of dividends this year, we ranked 42nd in terms of total cash return to investors. Of these top 42 dividend payers, Prologis has outgrown the group by 500 basis points per year over the last three years. And in fact, since our IPO, we have paid over $15 billion in dividends at a 15% CAGR, ranking 13th on growth in the entire S&P 100. While getting bigger has never been our objective, we thought the context would be eye-opening. So in closing, we feel great about the health of our business, even in the face of a slowing economy, most importantly, nothing we have seen alters the path of its underlying secular drivers for the long-term potential of our platform. In that regard, we're excited to tell you much more about that outlook and our platform later in the year. Last week, we announced our upcoming Investor Day to be held at the New York Stock Exchange this December. We hope to see many of you there in person and tuned into the live webcast, where we will showcase our deep bench of talents and the strong differentiators that define our company. More details on that to come. But with that I'll hand it back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe on development. Tim, you touched on it briefly, but the earnings release mentions how the build-out of your land bank is a driver of growth, and this quarter, like you mentioned starts for only like $50 million versus recent quarters over a billion. And it sounds like that is expected to ramp up significantly to over a billion again in the second half. So just wondering what metrics or other things that you're looking at to drive the starts activity? And what makes you confident that increasing starts so significantly later this year is kind of possible and the right thing to do?\nDan Letter: Hi, Caitlin. This is Dan. I'll take a stab at that. Maybe Tim can pile on then. But first of all, let me just say, our teams are very much on the offense out there. Every day our teams around the globe looking at new opportunities. We have over $38 billion of potential TEI embedded in our land bank, and we could flip the switch tomorrow and start $10 billion if we wanted to. We're going to continue to look at these deals on a case-by-case basis, but when you see the overall volatility in the market, you see the 10-year move 50 basis points, 60 basis points on a weekly basis like we have, we're maintaining the discipline, and we're disciplined because we can be. And we're ramping-up our starts towards the end of the year, while we expect to see the overall marketplace ramp down.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nKi Bin Kim: Thank you. Good morning. So net absorption across the US in the first quarter was a little bit lighter than what we've seen in recent memory. So I was just curious what kind of risk do you see to occupancy or rent growth as a sector tries to in the near term absorb the new supply coming through?\nHamid Moghadam: Hi, Ki Bin. This is Hamid. There's always a risk in this environment. I mean there's so many unknowables, but we've gotten spoiled to 350 million square feet of demand in the last couple of years. Let's just put this in a context. I mean in the past, we would have been very happy with even these lower levels of absorption, particularly when you consider that starts are way down and they're going to -- deliveries are going to really slow down as we go into 2024. So it's normalizing. That's the best way I can describe, but I wouldn't even be surprised if it falls further given all the stuff that we read in the papers. The CEOs that are making big CapEx decisions, basically push their people to see if they can start the week -- a quarter later or two quarters later. But that's all borrow demand, if you will, that is future demand that is getting deferred. So we're not that excited by one way or another. And just to finish the previous question that Dan started, our view, we don't have a forecast for development starts. We only have one because you guys asked us for one. We don't internally have one. We have a plan. We have entitlements on much of that land, about 80% of that land, we can start at any time. And we don't just look at our data at the end-of-the quarter. We see it every day as we lease a million square feet a day, so we can meter that development into the marketplace, as we see fit and make those adjustments. We're ready to go if we need to do more or less either way. At the end of the day, our company's story is about organic growth, and that's the high value form of growth and that's the one that we pay the most attention to, and actually, that's easier to figure out in this environment, given the very big mark-to-market which I've never seen in this business before. So in a way, our job is actually easier in terms of predictability of earnings and growth.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to focus a little bit on the acquisitions, which is not a very large number in there, Hamid, but I'm just wondering what you're seeing from a distressed opportunity said, and then maybe tie into the comments Tim made about the funds and you know you tend to like you'd be putting more money into the funds as you redeem some of the partners. So just trying to put tie those two I guess capital uses together.\nHamid Moghadam: Sure. I think there is very little distress in the marketplace. Industrial real estate has done really well. I assume other people have significant mark-to-market, although I doubt if there -- it's quite the same level as ours. But there is protection in terms of that mark-to-market and other portfolios, and there are no fore sellers because leverage in the industry is pretty low. So we're not looking for distressed opportunities, but we are looking for opportunities that reflect the increasing cost of capital compared to call it a year, year and a half ago. And you should know, we look at every deal that anybody does and reads in the papers. Not hard to figure out that if you want to sell something, you call Prologis. So, you know, our feeling is people are still stuck on the old values, and buyers are expecting a substantial discount for those values. I suspect that most of those numbers will move closer together in the next couple of quarters and the market will start transacting. The funds have always been a place where we either take capital out or put capital in, and depending on the cycle of the marketplace. And back even in the global financial crisis, when AMB was much smaller and the balance sheet was weaker, we stepped in and put a couple hundred million dollars in our funds, when I thought -- when we thought that the time was right. So we continue to do the same thing. I don't think it's a big deal one way or another, but it's a great place to buy a high quality real estate that we know and we like. So that's the way we think about it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nBlaine Heck: Great. Thanks. Good morning out there. Can you talk about demand related to near-shoring or on-shoring? Which markets are seeing an outsized impact related to the trend and maybe how Prologis is positioned to benefit from it?\nHamid Moghadam: Sure. Let me start and then I'll pitch it over to Chris. The biggest impact is on Northern Mexico. Those markets along the border are literally on fire. There is no vacancy and we're seeing a lot of near shoring happening there as sort of a diversification move. We're also seeing some of the China manufacturing bleed out to the rest of Southeast Asia, but we're not really active in those smaller markets, but we do see that. And it's moving west in China and it's moving to other areas in Southeast Asia. But Mexico is the big story here. The on-shoring part, I mean, honestly, other than what I read in the papers, and the chip business which is real, the rest of it is wishful thinking mostly. So they're very isolated examples, but you look at the numbers and they are not that significant. Chris, do you want to add to that?\nChris Caton: Sure. I think that's really well described. Blaine, I'd say there isn't great data on this, but that which we see is that it is a building trend in Northern Mexico. So it takes time for those supply chains to relocate instead of the ecosystems they need to really function properly and resiliently. And that is happening and will continue to happen, so I would expect it to grow in the coming years as well.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Mailman: Thank you. Maybe just a clarification and a follow-up question. Tim, I think in your prepared remarks, you said that the mark-to-market could end this year by 70% and be 85% by the end of next year in the absence of rent growth. So maybe clarify that if I misheard it. And then second question, just as you guys are seeing conditions on the ground, clearly, we saw some of the numbers you guys discussed it normalize here in the first quarter, but could you just talk about maybe how we should think about the cadence or anything incremental, what tenants are saying so that we don't get surprised the next quarter or two with some of the fundamental numbers here coming through as supply does deliver in some of the markets that have had more in the pipeline, like L.A., Inland Empire, Dallas sort of market. So then just also, you guys maintained your 10% market rent growth. Has that shifted dramatically within markets where some may have weakened significantly while others have grown? Or is it pretty consistent across the border? I apologize. I know that was a lot at once.\nHamid Moghadam: Nice try unpacking all that in one question.\nTim Arndt: I guess I will address all three of those. So I'll start, Craig, and I'm glad you asked if there was confusion on the point. You're right that we said we will -- we believe we will see a 70% lease mark-to-market of the entire portfolio at the end of this year, after we roll leases over the course of the year and we have some continued rent growth build. What I was trying to highlight there was that, if you just take out the component of that, that is rolling in 2024, to see have a sense of how this rent change is going to endure, that slice of the 70% on its own is 85% without any more market rent growth in the next nine months. So that just gives you very clear visibility on how the rent change is going to stay high, how it's going to translate to the same-store growth. So that was the intention there.\nHamid R. Moghadam: Yeah. Let me take the second part and I'll pitch it to Chris for the third part of the question. Look, you'll be surprised if we're surprised. So -- and we really worked hard at not being surprised. And the best indicator of what's happening is the ongoing leasing and proposals and all that stuff that we're involved and you guys don't really see directly other than at the end of the quarter. So I would say -- I would describe market conditions as very good to excellent. They are not exceptional like they were a year and a half or two years ago, but they are very good to excellent. The markets you mentioned LA and Inland Empire, not worried about those at all. I mean, those markets are in the one percentage -- one percentage to two percentage vacancy rate. When you get to Dallas and particularly South Dallas and some other markets like Atlanta, way down the South, et cetera, those markets through all the cycles have been prone to over-development and softening of demand when a business was down. So we're watching those very carefully, but I wouldn't characterize any of them as watchlist markets now, otherwise, we would have classified them as such. The 10% rental growth is an overall number, but there is a very wide dispersion around that 10%. And Chris, do you want to elaborate on that?\nChris Caton: Yeah, indeed, there is a wide dispersion. And we've been a customer over the years talking about outperformance on the coast and lower growth and lower barrier markets. Historically, that outperformance has averaged 250 basis points to 500 basis points on -- in any given year. This year, that 10% sees more at the lower end of that range, more like 200 basis point, 250 basis point outperformance on the coast versus the lower barrier markets. And so that is where we saw the resilience, and I would also point to other global markets outside the United States. We talked about Mexico on an earlier call. It's probably one of the hotter parts of the world from a logistics real estate perspective. We're also seeing resiliency in Toronto and Northern Europe, Germany and the Netherlands.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDerek Johnston: Hi, everybody, and good morning. The dislocation between public and private market logistic asset values obviously is weighing on possible M&A. But as Fed policy nears peak rates and currently projects a pause, do you see valuations converging between public and private assets, and secondly, thus a pickup in capital recycling?\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. I definitely do see a convergence over time, and private markets are always slow to adjust on the way up and on the way down because it's all backward looking appraisals and people look for comps. And -- but we don't really view the market that way and we view that disconnect as an opportunity because look, we have a very clear view of what the capital markets tell us in terms of the new cost of capital, and we're interested in deploying capital at above that new higher number. And private values are not yet there that's why we see some continued erosion on private values in the next quarter particularly in the United States. On the other hand, I think the public values are over-discounted and we see those actually picking up as there is more evidence in the private market that the world is not falling off the cliff. So I think you'll get a conversion from both sides and this is not at all unusual compared to past cycles. I would say every cycle gets a little better, but there is still a pretty significant disconnect. And of course, private values can be, whatever you want them to be if you're trying again to prove a point or trying to make a statement. So we are actually, our moat with appraisals -- appraisers that we work with is to continue to point them to the cost of capital as opposed to comps that don't exist. So we are on the other side of that argument. We're trying to get this market to get unlock and to transact and trying to get these appraisers to be realistic about their valuations. But I can tell you, based on conversations with them, they're getting a lot of pressure the other way from a lot of other people. So they find it somewhat unusual that we want to see a more aligned set of values that will unlock market and liquidity.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the questions. So just maybe going back to your comments about more unevenness or maybe just some upward pressure on vacancy across the US. Can you just sort of give us your latest view on -- you said not worried about SoCal, but how would you rank sort of SoCal across your other coastal markets today? And if there is a sort of additional or some softening that you may see, does the Duke acquisition sort of change the overall prospects for the PLD US portfolio?\nHamid Moghadam: Well, I don't know for sure how to predict the direction of markets, but I can tell you, I don't lose any sleep over SoCal at all. I think that market is extremely tight and some of the shift in demand or softening of demand is to adjacent markets because the space just doesn't exist in Southern California. So if we had more space, I think we would have more absorption in Southern California as well. The Duke acquisition, as we've described many times, it's very aligned with our portfolio, so fundamentally doesn't change in any way our view on markets or desired allocation of our capital to those markets. It's very much aligned with the pre-merger Prologis portfolio. So the only thing I would tell you about Duke is that I -- generally speaking, based on the leases that we've done, since we acquired portfolio, we are kind of on the order of 4% to 5% higher than we thought we would be in terms of the performance of that portfolio.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Good morning. Tim, you mentioned the fund redemption requests were unchanged at 5% of NAV. Do you still expect the redemptions to go basically down to zero in the back half of the year in light of I think you mentioned weakening sentiment on tenant demand?\nTim Arndt: Hey, John, we didn't hear any of that. Are you on a cell phone? And if you are, can you get closer to it or something because you were cutting in there?\nJohn Kim: Is that better?\nTim Arndt: It's better. Yeah.\nJohn Kim: Okay. Sorry about that.\nTim Arndt: So can you start all over?\nJohn Kim: Sure. You mentioned the fund redemption requests were unchanged, but I was wondering if you expect those redemptions to go down to zero in the back half of the year as previously stated in light of weakening demand that you're seeing on the tenant side.\nTim Arndt: I don't know. I can't really predict the portfolio decisions of well over a couple of hundred different investors making those decisions differently. I would say to the extent that there is -- there are redemptions. They are generally not because of the performance of the real estate assets that are invested with us. They are either have to do with denominator issues on their other asset classes, private equity, stock bonds, et cetera, because everything has gotten hit with increased interest rates. Bonds have not been a safe place to be either. So it's because of them getting over allocated to real estate because of the decline in the value of the other asset classes more than real estate. And among real estate, if you want liquidity, where are you going to go? You're going to go to industrial. You're going to go to apartments, et cetera, et cetera. You're not going to go to office buildings because you're not going to be able to get any liquidity out of those. So that's what's driving all this. It doesn't -- I wouldn't look there for learning anything about what's going on with the industrial market because that's a reaction to a lot of different things that have nothing to do with industrial demand with supply.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nVince Tibone: Hi. Good morning. Have you seen any material changes in tenant demand or industry-wide development starts activity since the banking crisis? And then on the latter point, has the availability of construction loans changed significantly in the last few months?\nHamid Moghadam: I'm sorry the last part was the availability of loan.\nTim Arndt: Constructions loan.\nHamid Moghadam: Construction loan. The answer to that one is --\nVince Tibone: Construction loan.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes, the answer to that one is absolutely, yes. I think there's been a significant pullback in the availability of construction loans. On the rest, I mean, what do you think?\nTim Arndt: Yes, you were talking about customer demand. We're seeing broad-based customer demand really even looking at our e-commerce, we had 40 unique e-commerce users last quarter alone with Amazon actually being a small size of that very, very small. So overall, broad-based demand, no particular pockets of softness.\nHamid Moghadam: I would say housing is probably the only, the only aspect that's a little below normal. But again, if you look at the overall numbers, these -- if you sort of forget about 2021 and early '22, and you saw these numbers that we're seeing now, you would feel really good about them. It's just that in the context of those exceptional years are a little bit softer, but they're still considered to be really good markets, Chris.\nChris Caton: Hey, Vince, I think I heard in the middle of your question, what is the trend in development starts in the wake of SVB. So it's worth knowing the numbers, which is in the first quarter in the United States development starts were off 40% from their peak across our markets and 45% in Europe. And based on the comment I made earlier around construction debt availability, these numbers are going to -- you're going to continue to see starts to curtail in the marketplace.\nHamid Moghadam: I mean, I've never seen such a fast slowdown such a sudden slowdown in construction volume in our business. It's just been -- and I'm not sure it's only -- it was related to Silicon Valley Bank. It was already happening before that, and SVB just made it worse.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico in Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nNicholas Yulico: Thanks. I just want to go back to some of the commentary about demand may be spilling into 2024 as companies take a longer time and make financial decisions. I guess what I'm wondering is, how much is that an outlook or just broader corporations taking longer times to make financial decisions versus some of the larger categories of leasing like 3PL, general retail, but it may be expecting consumer slowdown and perhaps not fully utilizing their space. And so that's creating some delay in taking space this year.\nHamid Moghadam: The utilization rate peaked all time at 87%. And today, it's at 85%. And there is a couple of points of margin error on those numbers anyway. But -- so I would say utilization is really high. If it were -- if utilization were in the high 70s, I would tell you there's a lot of shadow space and people are going to wait to grow into that space or put it on the market for sub leasing, but we're not seeing that. So I don't think there's a lot of excess slack in the system. And even if you look at the well over publicized Amazon stories that a lot of people waste a lot of time on. I mean, they basically haven't given anything space back, maybe 7 million or 8 million square feet. Yet it's taken half the airtime on all these costs for the last year. It just has not been material. I mean, we're looking for something that just doesn't exist. Will it exist? I don't know. I'm not clairvoyant. But so far, it doesn't appear that customers are giving back material amounts of space or anything like that. It's totally within the normal band of how our business works across the cycle.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My question is on your view for the balance of the year and what has changed, if anything, on a qualitative and quantitative basis? So you provided some commentary on your cautious outlook on demand and that wasn't new, but at the same time, you took up the same-store NOI guidance, maintained your rent forecasts. Just trying to understand if there's been an evolution in your thinking on how the rest of the year plays out? Thanks.\nTim Arndt: Hey, Michael, it's Tim. Now, look, I think you heard our comments correctly and I like that you pointed out, they're relatively unchanged. The same-store move is largely a function of an occupancy move. We just retained a decent amount of occupancy in the first quarter. We think that's going to extend throughout the year, so that's two-thirds of our increase in our same-store guide. The remainder of it is frankly some outperformance in the first quarter, that's more one time in nature, deals with seasonal expenses. We had very little bad debt in the quarter, out of interest, but we don't forecast that to continue. So that's some of the one-time items, but that combination is what is impacting same-store from here.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Nick Thillman with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Thillman: Hey, good morning. Retention remains pretty elevated here, but at 80%. But maybe on the tenants that don't resign, what's like their primary reason for not resigning? Is it them outgrowing their current footprint or a case of them just getting priced out of the market? Trying to tie that really to your occupancy in the sub 100,000 square foot area, it's been a little bit lighter than the rest of the leasing categories.\nHamid Moghadam: So the reason for non-renewal are either good reasons or bad reasons. The bad reason is that the company goes broke or the company -- so the neutral reasons are the company decides to go somewhere else out of one market into another market. The bad reasons are, sorry, the good reasons are that we just don't have a space that fits the growing need of that customer to be accommodated or the shrinking need of that customer to be accommodated. So they have to go somewhere else. We do track the reason for non-renewal of every single lease that doesn't renew. And one of the things that we track very closely is that we lose the space to a competitor because of pricing. And that statistic is like in the 2%, 3%, 4% range, and I think it's too low because it means that we're not pushing rents hard enough. So it's -- we're not losing tenants because of rent. We're losing tenants because we just can't accommodate them or they go broke or they move somewhere else. And those have been the reasons for the last 40 years I've been doing this.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nCamille Bonnel: Hello. Following up on an earlier comment about the vacancy in Southern California region being below 2%. I think the growing concern is actually on the availability rate or how much sublease activity has picked up which is something we really haven't seen in the past. So I understand, at least within the Southern California region, the supply seems manageable given how difficult it is to build in this market, but could you share your thoughts on how you think this might evolve in upcoming months? And whether or not this is a potential risk you're tracking closely?\nChris Caton: So two ways to approach that. First, I'll give you the -- this is Chris, by the way, Camille. First is the sublease data, and the second is our true months of supply data. So sublease nationally in the United States is on an availability rate basis, 60 basis points in the first quarter. The 10-year average, 60 basis points. The recent low indeed was 40 basis points, so it's moved up 20 basis points. Now the pre-COVID average or the pre-COVID low was 50 basis points and the peak in the global financial crisis was 1.1%. If you just summarize all that, first off, I'd offer that it's not a lot of availability. And the second is we're at the low end or at a normal level in sublease. And then I'd also point you to our views on true months of supply that Tim described in our earnings transcript, which said that at 30 months today, we have a very good market environment, consistent with 10% market rent growth. And as supply decelerates and slows, we think that will go back down into the 20s, improving the market landscape.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, great. Just one quick one and so on the expected vacancy rate, you talked about 3.5 currently rising throughout the year and then going back down by the end of '24. I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the supply and the demand assumptions that are going into that? How much is sort of demand normalizing, how much supply normalizing to get back to that 3.5. And the corollary to that would be, if you're expecting 10% market rent growth this year, historically, if you find yourself at that vacancy level at the end of '24, what sort of the market rent growth experience that we should have? And then the other quick one, sorry, on the 85% mark-to-market GAAP mark-to-market for '24, can you talk about what that number is for '23? Thanks.\nChris Caton: Thanks for the question, Ronald. So thank you for the opportunity to clarify our market statistics. I want to be very clear. So let's talk about net absorption in the 30 markets where Prologis operates in the United States. Last year, net absorption was 375 million square feet. We call that at 275 this year, and we expect a similar or perhaps higher numbers of macro environment clarifies and some of the decisions that get delayed this year land into '24. So that will be on the demand side completions. We have a bit of a clearer view as we look out to '24. So but starting with 2022, 375 million square feet of supply as well, that's deliveries. We expect 445 million square feet of deliveries this year as a supply pipeline empties and that will fall sharply, perhaps by half or more into 2024. And so when you put these numbers together, you'll see the vacancy rising from low 3s last year to 4 or a bit higher later this year and then back into the mid-3s.\nHamid Moghadam: The way to think about it is that demand is normalized from exceptionally high levels and the supply response has been in excess of that normalization of demand because of banking crisis and sort of macro constraints. So I think the supply response has been much more dramatic than the effects on demand. And that's why the market is going to tighten up again. Of course, absence, a calamity or something like that.\nTim Arndt: One important point to keep in mind is what is a normal vacancy rate because we have been years away from a normal vacancy rate. The historical range for our business is 5% to 10% with pricing power occurring in the 6% to 7% market vacancy rate. So we're talking about 3.5% to 4% market vacancies, half of what is typically seen as a way to see pricing power.\nChris Caton: And I would just pile on your third question there on the '24 component of our lease mark-to-market. This year, the same metric is in the low 80s. I think I intimated that last quarter on the call, just as a measure of what we expected our rent change would be this year. Those are -- I'm really talking about the same thing in that context. So roughly in the low 80s for '23.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Mueller: Hi. I dropped for a minute, so I apologize if this was asked. Can you talk about like the full year development start yield expectation is compared to the high 7% plus yield that you had in the first quarter.\nDan Letter: Yes. Hi, Mike. This is Dan. The yield that you saw in the first quarter was a couple of build-to-suits, really small volume. And what I would say is I would just look to last year and doing better than last year's yield on our starts this year.\nHamid Moghadam: I think the vast majority of the starts are in the 6s. And I would say the cap rates are up 75 basis points. So margins have gone from 30%, 40% to 20%, 30% something like that. I mean, those are some rough numbers.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.\nThomas Catherwood: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I want to touch on tenant health for a bit. Obviously, we talked about higher cost of capital and less availability of debt when it comes to real estate but it's also impacting operating industries across the board. With your expectation of slower economic activity this year, are there any industries where you would be concerned about increasing your exposure at this point in time.\nHamid Moghadam: Let's talk about credit loss as a measure of customer stability. Bad debt ratio and all that. It's historically, in our business has been in the tens of basis points. Even when you had the lapse in demand in the immediate aftermath of COVID that number got to 60 basis points. So -- and Chris, what would you guess our number is going to get to in the cycle when it's all over in terms of bad debt.\nChris Caton: I'd say 20, I'm jumping in here. I think 20 will be on average.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. So I mean, we don't see it in the numbers and the number of bankruptcies, et cetera, et cetera, that we're monitoring and working on are really not unusual in fact, I would say, that's somewhat unusual. I was expecting more of them than we're seeing in this point in the cycle. And honestly, we would like to see more of them because, frankly, there's so much mark-to-market in those leases that those kinds of tenant departures are actually an upside. So if anybody sort of has problems with their business or is looking to downsize. We look at that as an opportunity to do a buyout and actually be able to extract higher rents in the marketplace. So really not a concern. And that number -- those numbers that I talked about are out there. You can go look at them and plot the curve. They've been coming down substantially as opposed to from very low levels, but they're still coming down.\nTim Arndt: I might add on to that one final thought, which is I think the 20 that I'm throwing out is a reflection of some mix shift on credit, I think, in the last five years with the markets this tight, we've not only been able to push rents, keep the portfolio occupied, but we've been greatly enhancing the credit profile of our rent roll, and we think we've got a really strong customer base.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. One final statistic that you guys don't have visibility to, but I'm reading off my sheet of stats here. Historical average of credit watch tenants for us, long-term historical average has been 4.9%. We just watch them. By the way, the average actual default has been 0.15. So we worry about a lot more things than we should. That credit watch number today is at 3.35. So it's down substantially. And so is the actual bad debt ratio. So we worry about a lot of things, but most of them don't actually happen and the numbers are actually quite healthy, not just -- not even adjusting for the cycle and the fact that it's a softening cycle, but just even in the best of markets, these statistics would show up as very good.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc. Please proceed.\nTodd Thomas: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the demand environment and your comments about a more challenging macro in relation to the development starts. I guess, how much visibility do you actually have on starts in the second half of the year as it pertains to the full year target of $2.5 billion to $3 billion? How quickly can that ramp up? And then development yields for what's under construction, they were higher by 20 basis points versus last quarter on the '23 and '24 under construction pipeline. Is that due to improved economics around rents or moderating construction costs which I think you mentioned or really a combination of the two? And do you expect to see further improvements in development yields as you look out in the future?\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. Most of our land is entitled and entitlement is a pretty broad definition. I mean, fully entitled means that you pulled the building permit on this specific building that you can start but you might have entitlements and you haven't pulled the specific building permit because you don't exactly know how big a building you're going to build or in what configuration. But 80% of our land is entitled in terms of discretionary entitlements and about 20% to 30% of our land is really good to go with building permits pulled. So that is not a limiter on our ability to start development. So we can start whatever development we want to as we monitor the marketplace. The reason for development yields going on -- going up is that rent growth has been higher than we forecast. And the costs are essentially the same because we've locked in some of those construction values on the buildings that are starting today. The comment about construction cost has nothing to do with what you're seeing on the starts today. It will affect yield on starts down the road. Our view has changed. That's one area where our view has changed materially. We thought there would be some softening of construction costs to the tune of 5% to 10% and because of IRA and all this new fiscal stimulus going into the construction industry, I mean, it uses the same labor, same materials and everything. Contractors still have pretty good pricing power. So that -- what we thought was going to be a 5% to 10% decline, it's going to be inflationary increase. So the swing is actually pretty material. Having said all of that, the rental growth more than makes up for it. So I think our yields are trending up.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed.\nAnthony Powell: Hi. Good morning. Quick one for me, I guess, any change in the tenor of conversations with your lending partners or underwriters after the SIVB collapse? Or are you seeing just increased confidence from your partners that you seek to do financing in the future?\nHamid Moghadam: They're asking us a lot of money. No, it's not really. I mean where that balance sheet is bulletproof. I mean, frankly, we have better balance sheet than most of our banks. So no and we're not really a bank borrower per se, we tap into the capital markets all the time.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC. Please proceed.\nMichael Carroll: Yeah, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on your planner potential willingness to invest into the property funds. And can you quantify how much you would like? Or are you willing to invest in those funds? And are there any particular ones that you would want to invest in like USLF or PELF or is that still a TBD right now?\nHamid Moghadam: Well, we're going to invest in PELF sooner than USLF because we think the value adjustments in Europe have been quicker than they have been in the U.S. But I suspect we're only a quarter or so away from even the U.S. adjusting to a normalized value at least we hope. So look, it's a $140 billion balance sheet. So even if we just wanted to allocate 1% of it, and I'm not saying we're going to allocate 1%. I'm just kind of size the issue for you, that could be $1.5 billion. We're probably not going to invest $1.5 billion, but it's got to be like a small portion of our overall balance sheet. But we love that stuff because we know it. We like it. It's exactly the kind of property we want to have. And redemptions give us a really good opportunity to do that without affecting the strategy of the fund.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nJames Feldman: Great. Thank you. I thought your commentary on credit was pretty interesting in terms of how low it is. I guess you have such a wide view of what's going on in the world. Can you just talk through maybe across your regions, some of the data points you're seeing that either give you some confidence in where the economy is heading or give you some concern about where the economy is heading and how that factors into where you want to put capital to work?\nHamid Moghadam: I'll just take two things. This is more a global comment than US comment. Japan is having more supply than it normally has, but demand is actually still pretty strong. I'm a little worried about vacancy rates in Japan going up into the mid-teens. So that's one place we're seeing it. The U.K. has actually been pretty surprisingly good on the industrial side. If you look at the headlines for the U.K., you would expect more trouble than what we're seeing in the industrial market. In the U.S., it's -- I can't think of a trend that it's worth talking about that. The markets are generally pretty good. I mean can you guys think of anything?\nChris Caton: Hey, Jamie, it's Chris Caton. There's been a lot of economic news over the last few weeks, and I think there are probably three takeaways. The first is consumers are stable, notwithstanding all the noise in that. And it seems to be treading towards perhaps GDP growth of 2%, if not a bit higher. Second, I think quite clearly, e-commerce is reaccelerating with online shopping, now back on trend taking 100 basis points of share from in-store. And the third is, indeed, inventories are rising but they have not yet risen to pre-COVID level, little on a higher level for resilience.\nHamid Moghadam: With Jamie's question, that's the last one in the queue. I wanted to thank all of you for participating in our call. We're excited over here because it's our 40th anniversary that we'll be celebrating in June. And there are going to be lots of opportunities between the investor meeting later on in the year and also GROUNDBREAKERS where we will be speaking to you. So I look forward to seeing all of you and take care.\nOperator: And that concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hamid Moghadam",
            "content": "Hi, Ki Bin. This is Hamid. There's always a risk in this environment. I mean there's so many unknowables, but we've gotten spoiled to 350 million square feet of demand in the last couple of years. Let's just put this in a context. I mean in the past, we would have been very happy with even these lower levels of absorption, particularly when you consider that starts are way down and they're going to -- deliveries are going to really slow down as we go into 2024. So it's normalizing. That's the best way I can describe, but I wouldn't even be surprised if it falls further given all the stuff that we read in the papers. The CEOs that are making big CapEx decisions, basically push their people to see if they can start the week -- a quarter later or two quarters later. But that's all borrow demand, if you will, that is future demand that is getting deferred. So we're not that excited by one way or another. And just to finish the previous question that Dan started, our view, we don't have a forecast for development starts. We only have one because you guys asked us for one. We don't internally have one. We have a plan. We have entitlements on much of that land, about 80% of that land, we can start at any time. And we don't just look at our data at the end-of-the quarter. We see it every day as we lease a million square feet a day, so we can meter that development into the marketplace, as we see fit and make those adjustments. We're ready to go if we need to do more or less either way. At the end of the day, our company's story is about organic growth, and that's the high value form of growth and that's the one that we pay the most attention to, and actually, that's easier to figure out in this environment, given the very big mark-to-market which I've never seen in this business before. So in a way, our job is actually easier in terms of predictability of earnings and growth. Sure. I think there is very little distress in the marketplace. Industrial real estate has done really well. I assume other people have significant mark-to-market, although I doubt if there -- it's quite the same level as ours. But there is protection in terms of that mark-to-market and other portfolios, and there are no fore sellers because leverage in the industry is pretty low. So we're not looking for distressed opportunities, but we are looking for opportunities that reflect the increasing cost of capital compared to call it a year, year and a half ago. And you should know, we look at every deal that anybody does and reads in the papers. Not hard to figure out that if you want to sell something, you call Prologis. So, you know, our feeling is people are still stuck on the old values, and buyers are expecting a substantial discount for those values. I suspect that most of those numbers will move closer together in the next couple of quarters and the market will start transacting. The funds have always been a place where we either take capital out or put capital in, and depending on the cycle of the marketplace. And back even in the global financial crisis, when AMB was much smaller and the balance sheet was weaker, we stepped in and put a couple hundred million dollars in our funds, when I thought -- when we thought that the time was right. So we continue to do the same thing. I don't think it's a big deal one way or another, but it's a great place to buy a high quality real estate that we know and we like. So that's the way we think about it. Sure. Let me start and then I'll pitch it over to Chris. The biggest impact is on Northern Mexico. Those markets along the border are literally on fire. There is no vacancy and we're seeing a lot of near shoring happening there as sort of a diversification move. We're also seeing some of the China manufacturing bleed out to the rest of Southeast Asia, but we're not really active in those smaller markets, but we do see that. And it's moving west in China and it's moving to other areas in Southeast Asia. But Mexico is the big story here. The on-shoring part, I mean, honestly, other than what I read in the papers, and the chip business which is real, the rest of it is wishful thinking mostly. So they're very isolated examples, but you look at the numbers and they are not that significant. Chris, do you want to add to that? Nice try unpacking all that in one question. Yeah. I definitely do see a convergence over time, and private markets are always slow to adjust on the way up and on the way down because it's all backward looking appraisals and people look for comps. And -- but we don't really view the market that way and we view that disconnect as an opportunity because look, we have a very clear view of what the capital markets tell us in terms of the new cost of capital, and we're interested in deploying capital at above that new higher number. And private values are not yet there that's why we see some continued erosion on private values in the next quarter particularly in the United States. On the other hand, I think the public values are over-discounted and we see those actually picking up as there is more evidence in the private market that the world is not falling off the cliff. So I think you'll get a conversion from both sides and this is not at all unusual compared to past cycles. I would say every cycle gets a little better, but there is still a pretty significant disconnect. And of course, private values can be, whatever you want them to be if you're trying again to prove a point or trying to make a statement. So we are actually, our moat with appraisals -- appraisers that we work with is to continue to point them to the cost of capital as opposed to comps that don't exist. So we are on the other side of that argument. We're trying to get this market to get unlock and to transact and trying to get these appraisers to be realistic about their valuations. But I can tell you, based on conversations with them, they're getting a lot of pressure the other way from a lot of other people. So they find it somewhat unusual that we want to see a more aligned set of values that will unlock market and liquidity. Well, I don't know for sure how to predict the direction of markets, but I can tell you, I don't lose any sleep over SoCal at all. I think that market is extremely tight and some of the shift in demand or softening of demand is to adjacent markets because the space just doesn't exist in Southern California. So if we had more space, I think we would have more absorption in Southern California as well. The Duke acquisition, as we've described many times, it's very aligned with our portfolio, so fundamentally doesn't change in any way our view on markets or desired allocation of our capital to those markets. It's very much aligned with the pre-merger Prologis portfolio. So the only thing I would tell you about Duke is that I -- generally speaking, based on the leases that we've done, since we acquired portfolio, we are kind of on the order of 4% to 5% higher than we thought we would be in terms of the performance of that portfolio. I'm sorry the last part was the availability of loan. Construction loan. The answer to that one is -- Yes, the answer to that one is absolutely, yes. I think there's been a significant pullback in the availability of construction loans. On the rest, I mean, what do you think? I would say housing is probably the only, the only aspect that's a little below normal. But again, if you look at the overall numbers, these -- if you sort of forget about 2021 and early '22, and you saw these numbers that we're seeing now, you would feel really good about them. It's just that in the context of those exceptional years are a little bit softer, but they're still considered to be really good markets, Chris. I mean, I've never seen such a fast slowdown such a sudden slowdown in construction volume in our business. It's just been -- and I'm not sure it's only -- it was related to Silicon Valley Bank. It was already happening before that, and SVB just made it worse. The utilization rate peaked all time at 87%. And today, it's at 85%. And there is a couple of points of margin error on those numbers anyway. But -- so I would say utilization is really high. If it were -- if utilization were in the high 70s, I would tell you there's a lot of shadow space and people are going to wait to grow into that space or put it on the market for sub leasing, but we're not seeing that. So I don't think there's a lot of excess slack in the system. And even if you look at the well over publicized Amazon stories that a lot of people waste a lot of time on. I mean, they basically haven't given anything space back, maybe 7 million or 8 million square feet. Yet it's taken half the airtime on all these costs for the last year. It just has not been material. I mean, we're looking for something that just doesn't exist. Will it exist? I don't know. I'm not clairvoyant. But so far, it doesn't appear that customers are giving back material amounts of space or anything like that. It's totally within the normal band of how our business works across the cycle. So the reason for non-renewal are either good reasons or bad reasons. The bad reason is that the company goes broke or the company -- so the neutral reasons are the company decides to go somewhere else out of one market into another market. The bad reasons are, sorry, the good reasons are that we just don't have a space that fits the growing need of that customer to be accommodated or the shrinking need of that customer to be accommodated. So they have to go somewhere else. We do track the reason for non-renewal of every single lease that doesn't renew. And one of the things that we track very closely is that we lose the space to a competitor because of pricing. And that statistic is like in the 2%, 3%, 4% range, and I think it's too low because it means that we're not pushing rents hard enough. So it's -- we're not losing tenants because of rent. We're losing tenants because we just can't accommodate them or they go broke or they move somewhere else. And those have been the reasons for the last 40 years I've been doing this. The way to think about it is that demand is normalized from exceptionally high levels and the supply response has been in excess of that normalization of demand because of banking crisis and sort of macro constraints. So I think the supply response has been much more dramatic than the effects on demand. And that's why the market is going to tighten up again. Of course, absence, a calamity or something like that. I think the vast majority of the starts are in the 6s. And I would say the cap rates are up 75 basis points. So margins have gone from 30%, 40% to 20%, 30% something like that. I mean, those are some rough numbers. Let's talk about credit loss as a measure of customer stability. Bad debt ratio and all that. It's historically, in our business has been in the tens of basis points. Even when you had the lapse in demand in the immediate aftermath of COVID that number got to 60 basis points. So -- and Chris, what would you guess our number is going to get to in the cycle when it's all over in terms of bad debt. Yes. So I mean, we don't see it in the numbers and the number of bankruptcies, et cetera, et cetera, that we're monitoring and working on are really not unusual in fact, I would say, that's somewhat unusual. I was expecting more of them than we're seeing in this point in the cycle. And honestly, we would like to see more of them because, frankly, there's so much mark-to-market in those leases that those kinds of tenant departures are actually an upside. So if anybody sort of has problems with their business or is looking to downsize. We look at that as an opportunity to do a buyout and actually be able to extract higher rents in the marketplace. So really not a concern. And that number -- those numbers that I talked about are out there. You can go look at them and plot the curve. They've been coming down substantially as opposed to from very low levels, but they're still coming down. Yes. One final statistic that you guys don't have visibility to, but I'm reading off my sheet of stats here. Historical average of credit watch tenants for us, long-term historical average has been 4.9%. We just watch them. By the way, the average actual default has been 0.15. So we worry about a lot more things than we should. That credit watch number today is at 3.35. So it's down substantially. And so is the actual bad debt ratio. So we worry about a lot of things, but most of them don't actually happen and the numbers are actually quite healthy, not just -- not even adjusting for the cycle and the fact that it's a softening cycle, but just even in the best of markets, these statistics would show up as very good. Yes. Most of our land is entitled and entitlement is a pretty broad definition. I mean, fully entitled means that you pulled the building permit on this specific building that you can start but you might have entitlements and you haven't pulled the specific building permit because you don't exactly know how big a building you're going to build or in what configuration. But 80% of our land is entitled in terms of discretionary entitlements and about 20% to 30% of our land is really good to go with building permits pulled. So that is not a limiter on our ability to start development. So we can start whatever development we want to as we monitor the marketplace. The reason for development yields going on -- going up is that rent growth has been higher than we forecast. And the costs are essentially the same because we've locked in some of those construction values on the buildings that are starting today.

I mean where that balance sheet is bulletproof. I mean, frankly, we have better balance sheet than most of our banks. So no and we're not really a bank borrower per se, we tap into the capital markets all the time. Well, we're going to invest in PELF sooner than USLF because we think the value adjustments in Europe have been quicker than they have been in the U.S. But I suspect we're only a quarter or so away from even the U.S. adjusting to a normalized value at least we hope.

We're excited over here because it's our 40th anniversary that we'll be celebrating in June. And there are going to be lots of opportunities between the investor meeting later on in the year and also GROUNDBREAKERS where we will be speaking to you. So I look forward to seeing all of you and take care."

Every day our teams around the globe looking at new opportunities. We have over $38 billion of potential TEI embedded in our land bank, and we could flip the switch tomorrow and start $10 billion if we wanted to. We're going to continue to look at these deals on a case-by-case basis, but when you see the overall volatility in the market, you see the 10-year move 50 basis points, 60 basis points on a weekly basis like we have, we're maintaining the discipline, and we're disciplined because we can be. And we're ramping-up our starts towards the end of the year, while we expect to see the overall marketplace ramp down. Yes. Hi, Mike. This is Dan. The yield that you saw in the first quarter was a couple of build-to-suits, really small volume. And what I would say is I would just look to last year and doing better than last year's yield on our starts this year."

            "name": "Chris Caton",
            "content": "Sure. I think that's really well described. Blaine, I'd say there isn't great data on this, but that which we see is that it is a building trend in Northern Mexico. So it takes time for those supply chains to relocate instead of the ecosystems they need to really function properly and resiliently. And that is happening and will continue to happen, so I would expect it to grow in the coming years as well. Yeah, indeed, there is a wide dispersion. And we've been a customer over the years talking about outperformance on the coast and lower growth and lower barrier markets. Historically, that outperformance has averaged 250 basis points to 500 basis points on -- in any given year. This year, that 10% sees more at the lower end of that range, more like 200 basis point, 250 basis point outperformance on the coast versus the lower barrier markets. And so that is where we saw the resilience, and I would also point to other global markets outside the United States. We talked about Mexico on an earlier call. It's probably one of the hotter parts of the world from a logistics real estate perspective. We're also seeing resiliency in Toronto and Northern Europe, Germany and the Netherlands. Hey, Vince, I think I heard in the middle of your question, what is the trend in development starts in the wake of SVB. So it's worth knowing the numbers, which is in the first quarter in the United States development starts were off 40% from their peak across our markets and 45% in Europe. And based on the comment I made earlier around construction debt availability, these numbers are going to -- you're going to continue to see starts to curtail in the marketplace. So two ways to approach that. First, I'll give you the -- this is Chris, by the way, Camille. First is the sublease data, and the second is our true months of supply data. So sublease nationally in the United States is on an availability rate basis, 60 basis points in the first quarter. The 10-year average, 60 basis points. The recent low indeed was 40 basis points, so it's moved up 20 basis points. Now the pre-COVID average or the pre-COVID low was 50 basis points and the peak in the global financial crisis was 1.1%. If you just summarize all that, first off, I'd offer that it's not a lot of availability. And the second is we're at the low end or at a normal level in sublease. And then I'd also point you to our views on true months of supply that Tim described in our earnings transcript, which said that at 30 months today, we have a very good market environment, consistent with 10% market rent growth. And as supply decelerates and slows, we think that will go back down into the 20s, improving the market landscape. Thanks for the question, Ronald. So thank you for the opportunity to clarify our market statistics. I want to be very clear. So let's talk about net absorption in the 30 markets where Prologis operates in the United States. Last year, net absorption was 375 million square feet. We call that at 275 this year, and we expect a similar or perhaps higher numbers of macro environment clarifies and some of the decisions that get delayed this year land into '24. So that will be on the demand side completions. We have a bit of a clearer view as we look out to '24. So but starting with 2022, 375 million square feet of supply as well, that's deliveries. We expect 445 million square feet of deliveries this year as a supply pipeline empties and that will fall sharply, perhaps by half or more into 2024. And so when you put these numbers together, you'll see the vacancy rising from low 3s last year to 4 or a bit higher later this year and then back into the mid-3s. And I would just pile on your third question there on the '24 component of our lease mark-to-market. This year, the same metric is in the low 80s. I think I intimated that last quarter on the call, just as a measure of what we expected our rent change would be this year. Those are -- I'm really talking about the same thing in that context. So roughly in the low 80s for '23. I'd say 20, I'm jumping in here. I think 20 will be on average. Hey, Jamie, it's Chris Caton. There's been a lot of economic news over the last few weeks, and I think there are probably three takeaways. The first is consumers are stable, notwithstanding all the noise in that. And it seems to be treading towards perhaps GDP growth of 2%, if not a bit higher. Second, I think quite clearly, e-commerce is reaccelerating with online shopping, now back on trend taking 100 basis points of share from in-store. And the third is, indeed, inventories are rising but they have not yet risen to pre-COVID level, little on a higher level for resilience."

            "name": "Tim Arndt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We began the year with results and conditions that remained strong. Market rents have continued to grow, demand has been consistent and we're seeing sharp declines in new construction limiting future supply. While logistics real estate is very healthy, the macroeconomic picture continues to be a concern and we anticipate it could weigh on customer sentiment over the balance of the year translate into some demand that could be delayed into 2024. However, this will overlap with a slowdown of new deliveries, creating a sustained dynamic for high occupancy and continued rent growth into next year. Beginning with our results, our core FFO excluding promotes was $1.23 per share and including promotes was $1.22 per share. Our results benefited from higher NOI in the quarter but offset by approximately $0.02 of higher insurance expense from an unusually active storm season experiencing a year's worth of claims activity in just the first quarter. In terms of our operating results, both ending and average occupancy for the quarter were 98%, holding average occupancy flat for the fourth quarter. Rent change was 69% on a net effective basis and 42% on a cash basis each a record. The unusually wide spread between the two is reflective of lower free rent and higher escalations in our new leasing. Despite the step-up of in-place rents, our lease mark-to-market expanded to 68% during the quarter as market rent growth remained strong and slightly ahead of expectations. With the remaining lease term of roughly four years, this lease mark-to-market represents over $2.85 per share of incremental earnings as our leases roll the market, providing visibility to future income and dividend growth. These results drove record same-store growth 9.9% on a net effective basis and 11.4% on a cash basis. During the quarter, our efforts on the balance sheet were focused on liquidity, raising over $3.6 billion in new financings for Prologis and our ventures at an interest rate of 4.6% and a term of nearly 14 years. This fundraising total does not include $1 billion of additional capacity from a recast of our global line-of-credit, which closed in April, and brings our total borrowing potential under our lines to $6.5 billion. As mentioned, fundamentals in our markets remain strong, but we expect that a more cautious outlook will weigh on the pace of demand. This is not a new perspective as our forecast 90 days ago prepared for a weakening sentiment and how the top-down view for some occupancy loss over the year. We haven't changed that outlook, but we also haven't upgraded it despite the quarter's outperformance. As an update on proprietary metrics, our proposal activity ticked up in absolute terms and is in line with strong market conditions as a percent of available space. Approximately 99% of the units across our 1.2 billion square feet are either leased or in negotiation. Utilization ticked down to 85%, which is normalizing to a level that our customers view as optimal. E-commerce leasing increased during the quarter to 19% of all new leasing. We avoid drawing conclusions from a single quarter of activity on most metrics, but it's notable here, that e-commerce leasing picked up meaningfully back towards its five-year average. As we've said before, we ultimately look at retention, pre-leasing and rent achievement as the best real-time metrics of portfolio health, and on that basis, our results are certainly very strong. We expect that the current 3.5% vacancy rate in our US markets will build to the low 4s toward the end of the year, before turning back to the mid-3s by late 2024, due to the lack of incoming supply and accounting for moderating demand. We anticipate a similar path in our European markets, and of course, even a 5% vacancy rate is historically excellent and supportive of strong rental growth. We expect this pattern to play out in our true months of supply metric, which was a very healthy 30 months in the US and should decline into the 20s next year. We are launching markets that have large development pipelines such as a few in the Sunbelt in the US, but so far that supply also seems manageable. In Europe, most of our focus is on the UK, where development starts have continued even as demand has moderated, which will lift market vacancies and may pressure rents. And Japan is also a market which is expected to see larger increases in vacancy over the year, but similarly, expects a slowdown in new supply due to surges in land and construction costs. Taking all of these movements into account, we are holding our market rent growth forecast for the year at 10% in the US and 9% globally. In capital markets, transactions continue to be few and far between, but the pickup in activity suggests, we will see a busier second quarter. Appraised values in our funds declined 1% in the US and 2% in Europe during the quarter and 8% and 18% respectively from the peak. It's worth noting that our view of public market prices and NAVs that they have adjusted much more than is warranted for these levels of write-down. Redemption requests and our open-ended funds have slowed significantly with the redemption queue nearly unchanged around 5% of net asset value. This is reflective of both a slower pace of new redemptions as well as rescissions of prior requests. Combined with over $150 million of new commitments made our net queue is essentially unchanged from last year. Last quarter, we described our approach to fulfilling redemption requests, which is based on an overarching objective to be consistent and fair to all investors, requiring a few quarters for valuers to catch up. In that regard, as appraisal seem to be nearing fair value, we plan to redeem units in this quarter, given the swift response to value changes in Europe and expect to do the same in USLF next quarter. In turn, we view this as an excellent time to invest more of our capital into the vehicles, which we'll be doing over the coming quarters and some meaningful numbers. Turning to guidance. We are tightening and increasing average occupancy to range between 97.25% and 97.75%, a 25 basis point increase at the midpoint. Our same-store will benefit from this increase driving our net effective guidance to a range of 8.5% to 9.25%, and cash same-store of 9% to 9.75%. We are forecasting our lease mark-to-market to end the year close to 70%. Extracting the 2024 component of this suggests rent change should exceed 85% next year, even without continued market rent growth, which is a clear illustration of how our exceptional rent change will not only endure but continue to grow. We expect G&A to range between $380 million and $390 million and strategic capital revenues excluding promotes to range between $515 million and $530 million. We are maintaining our forecast for net promote income of $380 million, and given the size of USLF and the potential for small changes in value to have a meaningful impact, there is potential for upside here and we believe we have the downside covered. We had few development starts in the quarter, a reflection of our discipline, but our pipeline is deep and we are maintaining our guidance of $2.5 billion to $3 billion for the year. We expect the pace to remain slow in the second quarter, putting the bulk of the activity into the second half. It's noteworthy that following the belief that construction costs may decline in the coming quarters. We now see them as likely to increase mostly in line with inflation. As new fundraising has become visible, we forecast contributions to be concentrated in the second half totaling $2 billion to $3 billion when combined with forecasted dispositions. So in total, we expect GAAP earnings to range between $3.10 per share and $3.25 per share. We are increasing our core FFO including promotes guidance to a range of $5.42 per share to $5.50 per share, and further, we are guiding core FFO excluding promotes to range between $5.02 per share and $5.10 per share, with the midpoint representing 10% growth over 2022. I'd like to close with a few observations that we've made about our standing in the equity markets, which we found interesting and wanted to share. Today, we sit as the 68th largest company in the S&P 500 ahead of names like GE, American Express, Cigna, Citigroup, as well as Ford and GM combined. Also of notice that with our planned $3.3 billion of dividends this year, we ranked 42nd in terms of total cash return to investors. Of these top 42 dividend payers, Prologis has outgrown the group by 500 basis points per year over the last three years. And in fact, since our IPO, we have paid over $15 billion in dividends at a 15% CAGR, ranking 13th on growth in the entire S&P 100. While getting bigger has never been our objective, we thought the context would be eye-opening. So in closing, we feel great about the health of our business, even in the face of a slowing economy, most importantly, nothing we have seen alters the path of its underlying secular drivers for the long-term potential of our platform. In that regard, we're excited to tell you much more about that outlook and our platform later in the year. Last week, we announced our upcoming Investor Day to be held at the New York Stock Exchange this December. We hope to see many of you there in person and tuned into the live webcast, where we will showcase our deep bench of talents and the strong differentiators that define our company. More details on that to come. But with that I'll hand it back to the operator for your questions. I guess I will address all three of those. So I'll start, Craig, and I'm glad you asked if there was confusion on the point. You're right that we said we will -- we believe we will see a 70% lease mark-to-market of the entire portfolio at the end of this year, after we roll leases over the course of the year and we have some continued rent growth build. What I was trying to highlight there was that, if you just take out the component of that, that is rolling in 2024, to see have a sense of how this rent change is going to endure, that slice of the 70% on its own is 85% without any more market rent growth in the next nine months. So that just gives you very clear visibility on how the rent change is going to stay high, how it's going to translate to the same-store growth. So that was the intention there. Hey, John, we didn't hear any of that. Are you on a cell phone? And if you are, can you get closer to it or something because you were cutting in there? It's better. Yeah. So can you start all over? I don't know. I can't really predict the portfolio decisions of well over a couple of hundred different investors making those decisions differently. I would say to the extent that there is -- there are redemptions. They are generally not because of the performance of the real estate assets that are invested with us. They are either have to do with denominator issues on their other asset classes, private equity, stock bonds, et cetera, because everything has gotten hit with increased interest rates. Bonds have not been a safe place to be either. So it's because of them getting over allocated to real estate because of the decline in the value of the other asset classes more than real estate. And among real estate, if you want liquidity, where are you going to go? You're going to go to industrial. You're going to go to apartments, et cetera, et cetera. You're not going to go to office buildings because you're not going to be able to get any liquidity out of those. So that's what's driving all this. It doesn't -- I wouldn't look there for learning anything about what's going on with the industrial market because that's a reaction to a lot of different things that have nothing to do with industrial demand with supply. Constructions loan. Yes, you were talking about customer demand. We're seeing broad-based customer demand really even looking at our e-commerce, we had 40 unique e-commerce users last quarter alone with Amazon actually being a small size of that very, very small. So overall, broad-based demand, no particular pockets of softness. Hey, Michael, it's Tim. Now, look, I think you heard our comments correctly and I like that you pointed out, they're relatively unchanged. The same-store move is largely a function of an occupancy move. We just retained a decent amount of occupancy in the first quarter. We think that's going to extend throughout the year, so that's two-thirds of our increase in our same-store guide. The remainder of it is frankly some outperformance in the first quarter, that's more one time in nature, deals with seasonal expenses. We had very little bad debt in the quarter, out of interest, but we don't forecast that to continue. So that's some of the one-time items, but that combination is what is impacting same-store from here. One important point to keep in mind is what is a normal vacancy rate because we have been years away from a normal vacancy rate. The historical range for our business is 5% to 10% with pricing power occurring in the 6% to 7% market vacancy rate. So we're talking about 3.5% to 4% market vacancies, half of what is typically seen as a way to see pricing power. I might add on to that one final thought, which is I think the 20 that I'm throwing out is a reflection of some mix shift on credit, I think, in the last five years with the markets this tight, we've not only been able to push rents, keep the portfolio occupied, but we've been greatly enhancing the credit profile of our rent roll, and we think we've got a really strong customer base."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce you to your host, Justin Meng, SVP, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Justin, you may begin.\nJustin Meng: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our third quarter earnings press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP, and in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO; Dan Letter, President; and Chris Caton, Managing Director, are also with us today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim.\nTim Arndt: Thank you, Justin, and welcome to everybody joining our call. Before diving in, I'd like to share our concern for those affected by the recent hurricanes in the U.S. and Europe that impacted our employees, customers and communities. Thankfully, our teams are safe and their proactive customer outreach and assistance has been outstanding. Our property sustained limited damage for such strong storms. Overall, we are pleased with our operating and financial results as the third quarter played out to our expectations. While occupancy and rent softened against the backdrop of positive yet subdued demand, we continue to deliver impressive net effective rent change due to the still powerful lease mark-to-market embedded in our portfolio, which bridges us through this soft patch to the next cycle of rent growth. Turning to the quarter, core FFO, excluding net promote expense, was $1.45 per share and included in net promotes was $1.43 per share. These results were slightly ahead of our forecast and the quarter included approximately $0.03 of income from the Prologis Ventures' exit. Period-ending occupancy was 96.2% [at our share] (ph), nearly 300 basis points above the market as the flight to quality continues. Net effective rent change was 68% and cash rent change was 44%. We captured over $90 million of NOI by rolling leases up to market. The portfolio produced net effective and cash same store growth of 6.2% and 7.2%, respectively. Revenues were impacted by approximately 35 basis points of bad debt, which is elevated from our normal 15 to 20 basis points. While bankruptcy filings are on the rise broadly, the good news is that the space we've taken back as a result has had embedded rental upside of over 60%. Our overall portfolio lease mark-to-market finished the quarter at 34%, representing $1.6 billion of potential NOI. Finally, on the balance sheet, we raised $4.6 billion of new debt across Prologis and our funds at a weighted average rate of 4.6% and the maturity of approximately nine years. In terms of deployment, we had a very active quarter. We started over $0.5 billion in development projects, including incremental capital to an existing data center development now pre-leased to a hyperscale customer with a turnkey buildout. We expanded our land bank, driving our potential development opportunity over $40 billion, which now includes our first two projects in India that support over 5 million square feet of new development. We deployed over $1.4 billion in third-party acquisitions. Year-to-date, we have acquired over 14 million square feet of strategic assets at an estimated 20% discount to replacement cost. We started development on 54 megawatts of new energy systems. Our momentum here is building, and we continue to have and we expect to have generation capacity well over 600 megawatts at the end of this year, with good line of sight to our 1 gigawatt goal by the end of 2025. As mentioned, Prologis Ventures had a successful exit of an early round investment in the Japanese workforce solution, [indiscernible]. This produced a 9-times multiple on our investment, realizing a 65% IRR. Beyond the economics, our strategy and supply chain venture investing has delivered valuable insights for Prologis and our customers. Finally, FIBRA Prologis, our strategic capital vehicle in Mexico, successfully closed a tender for the shares of Terrafina, of which it now owns nearly 80%, enhancing its leadership position in one of our best-performing and highest-growth global markets. Turning to the operating environment, conditions remain soft in many of our markets, and as we've described over the last few quarters, this is despite healthy GDP and consumption growth. We ascribe the weaker relationship between economic output and industrial absorption to the availability built into the supply chain through COVID, originally earmarked for resiliency, but now available to operators as a source for cost containment. But ultimately, the ability to rely on this [excess] (ph) is diminishing as utilization reaches a level that will force decision making and expansion, the pace of which will vary by market. Many customers are making progress in reducing this capacity through growth, while others are gaining efficiencies through consolidation. In the end, it's all serving to hold net absorption below pre-COVID levels, impacting rents. Globally, we estimate that market rents decreased approximately 3% this quarter and roughly half this amount when excluding Southern California. As we noted before, Southern California will take the longest to reach equilibrium. While activity has improved, the remaining amounts of excess capacity will simply take time to work through. That said, it's important to keep this context, our SoCal portfolio generated 84% rent change on commencements this quarter even as it led the globe in market rent decline, a great example of the interplay between the spot reduction in rents against our lease mark-to-market. This has us well positioned to navigate the cyclical downturn and taking it a step further, we see the structural investment case for SoCal as strengthening with new supply barriers that come into effect from recently enacted legislation and continued focus on carbon emissions. As always, the rent picture is mixed and there remain many markets that are either flat on rents or positive, such as Houston, Atlanta, Nashville, Northern Europe, and of course, LatAm remains very strong. Overall, bottoming process is underway, and we expect demand to remain soft in the near term. Looking ahead, market vacancy is at or near its peak and will hover there as utilization improves, and global rents will bottom sometime mid next year. It stands to reason then that the near-term growth will be affected by the path market rents and occupancy have already taken. We remain very positive on the outlook for our business, as vacancies are still low in the context of history, starts are down significantly, and supply deliveries are falling below their pre-COVID levels. Additionally, with replacement cost rents approximately 15% above today's market, even with land values marked down by a third from their peak, the long-term growth trajectory remains highly favorable. Moving on to capital markets, we've seen improved pricing and activity in the transaction market and values continue to grow. U.S. and European values, again, increased approximately 1% in the quarter, and Mexico saw an impressive 2.2%. With the bottom seemingly in, our strategic capital business had its most productive quarter in the last two years, raising a net $460 million. Overall, it appears private market sentiment is stronger than the public markets. During the quarter, transaction volumes increased and unlevered IRRs compressed another 25 basis points. In terms of guidance, which I'll review [at our share] (ph), we are tightening our forecast for average occupancy to a range of 96% to 96.5%, and also tightening our forecast for cash same store growth to a range of 6.5% to 7%. Our net effective same store growth is for a range of 5.5% to 6%, which has been tightened and reduced modestly at the midpoint for the increased non-cash write-offs we expect from higher bankruptcies in the balance of the year. We are tightening and slightly reducing our G&A guidance to a range of $415 million to $425 million, and tightening our range for strategic capital revenue to $525 million to $535 million. We are reducing our overall development starts guidance to a range of $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion, which reflects both slow decision-making in build-to-suits and discipline on our part in deferring new spec development amid stubborn demand. Of course, we are in the best position to react quickly as conditions warrant with approximately $8 billion of pad-ready development opportunities. We see attractive acquisition opportunities in the market and are increasing our guidance here, taking our range up to $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion. And finally, the forecast for our contribution and disposition activity is increasing to a new range of $3 billion to $4 billion, reflecting the improving transaction market and stronger fundraising and strategic capital. The positive spread between our buying and selling IRRs year-to-date has been approximately 100 basis points. Putting it all together, we are increasing our GAAP earnings to a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share, core FFO, including net promote expense, will range between $5.42 and $5.46 per share, while core FFO, excluding net promote expense, will range between $5.49 and $5.53 per share, a $0.01 increase from our prior guidance. Core FFO, obviously, excludes our development gain guidance, but it's noteworthy to highlight our increase to a new range of $375 million to $425 million. In closing, we had a very productive quarter in which we delivered strong operating results, high occupancy, high rent change and meaningful same store growth in a challenging market environment. Alongside that performance, it's clear that we are focused on the future as evidenced in our very active deployment, spanning our global reach and product offerings. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the structural demand for logistics real estate and our focus on operational excellence, customer centricity and value creation will continue to drive strong performance across all market cycles. Consistent with this drive for excellence, I'd be remiss to not highlight our annual GROUNDBREAKERS forum, which we just held in London. It featured some of the most innovative companies of our day, and we heard from the likes of the legendary Fred Smith of FedEx and Sir Tony Blair amongst many others. GROUNDBREAKERS deepens our customer relationships and builds upon our thought leadership across the supply chain and its emerging foundation for clean energy and digital infrastructure. It's great to see so many of you there, and a replay of the event is available on our website. With that, I'll hand the call back to the operator for your questions. Unfortunately, Hamid is feeling under the weather today, and while he's on the call, he may be limited in his responses. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you, sir. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Catherwood: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. So, Tim, you noted mixed signals in the industrial markets, vacancies are up, obviously, customers are taking longer to make decisions. And on the macro side, obviously, we see if the consumer continues to be stretched. But you also noted there was strong leasing activity in Q3. You've raised acquisition guidance now for the second straight quarter. So, kind of how do we square these two kind of seemingly divergent topics together? And what do you think it takes for customers -- what kind of catalyst you think it takes for customers to move from hesitant when it comes taking space to more active as we move into '25?\nTim Arndt: Thanks, Tom. Thanks for the question. Look, if I just start with the acquisitions guidance, I would probably read that as our confidence in the long term for starters. We're very engaged in the business. We are very much looking at markets that we see to build additional scale and deepen our presence and our teams are scouring the market in that regard looking for opportunities. One thing implicit in my remarks that I'd like you to really hear is, we're not really a buyer at market IRRs. We are typically looking for unusual constructs, upmarket deals, deals that we source where we're looking for a premium to prevailing IRRs such as those we see in our appraisals. So, take that as you're looking at our activity in the acquisitions market. In the near term, we just recognized that utilization has really been the culprit of keeping a lid on demand. And the message we're trying to send here is that, that has an end to it. Ultimately, customers will work through what's available to them, and it's going to be sort of a spillover out of utilization into growth in occupancy.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Tom. Operator, next question?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nVikram Malhotra: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess just, Tim, maybe another one to perhaps square. You talked about the bottoming process on the call and the press release. I guess, bottoming, not bottom. But do you mind sort of scurrying that with two things? One, just your updated view on market rent growth over the next 12 months? And two, just reducing development starts, I thought the plan originally was to keep starts high, so that when the market inflects in '25, you'd sort of have the product ready. Can you just square the bottoming in those two things? Thanks so much.\nDan Letter: Yeah. Thanks, Vikram. Let me start with your first question, which was squaring the rent growth in the near term here. And let me highlight that we are near or in an inflection period right now. This is a time when forecast have very high variability. So, the quick answer to the near-term view on rents is pretty much in line with where we were 90 days ago. Customers are very engaged, but they are just not making decisions. So, we expect this softness in rents to continue throughout this period. But the way we actually think about this is for the long term. 90% of our leases roll after the next 12 months. So, even if rents fluctuate minus 3%, plus 3%, it doesn't really matter. It won't have significant impact on our long-term earnings nor the value of the business. And the real driver for rent growth is replacement cost rents, which Tim said in his script, replacement cost rents are 15% higher than today's market rents. So, the gap between the market rents and the replacement cost rents will ultimately lead to this rent growth. And so, if you think about us being at a peak vacancy or close to peak vacancy, which we expect to endure for a certain segment -- portion maybe throughout 2025 with a recovery in that vacancy emerging late next year and then accelerating thereafter. So, we know the trend and we'll capture that rent growth in the longer term. We just don't necessarily know the slope of that recovery and it's really hard to peg that. And honestly, when it comes down to it, guessing on the short term has never been one of our strong suits. We're running Prologis for the long term. And the second part of your question had to do with our development starts. Development starts, so we push those off. Tim talked about discipline in the script here. Build-to-suits, while the pipeline remains pretty strong, it's just flat. Feel like for the last four quarters, we've been talking about customers kicking the can down the road. That's continuing and those build-to-suits are just moving into next year. And then, from a spec perspective, we are going to maintain that discipline that we've always maintained. We don't want to be building into the market fundamentals in many of these markets today, but that's not categorical. So, for example, this quarter, we actually started two buildings in Atlanta. Atlanta's headline vacancy is 9%. But then, we look at the infill site that we have with no competition, we're only 150 basis points vacant. We don't have any spec risk. So, we decided to move forward to that. So, we move forward with that building or those two buildings, so we could be building into those [dirt] (ph) of completions a year out, like we've been talking about doing. So, it is happening here and there. We just see that accelerating more in the coming quarters. And then, let me finish with the fact that we have a very large development book right now, $5.5 billion underway on Prologis share, and that's 33 million square feet of development underway. And then, we also have $40 billion worth of opportunities right now in our land bank. And so -- and actually 30% of that land is entitled ready-to-go and then two-thirds of that is actually pad-ready, which means we really truncated the timeframes to go vertical with those sites. So, we're going to be able to execute the strategy just like we talked about over the last several quarters, we're just -- you're going to see that happen a little bit later.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Vikram. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you, and good morning. So, it looks like you had a $0.06 beat on a core FFO this quarter. I think, Tim, you mentioned part of that was the Prologis Ventures exit that you had. And also, on our numbers, you had better-than-expected currency gains and income taxes. I wanted to make sure that was the case. But also, why only raise full-year guidance by $0.01, given the beat you had during this quarter?\nTim Arndt: Hey, John, thanks for the question. I would say, you see it as a beat, we don't see it as a beat. These were events that we were forecasting for the year and for the quarter. And I would also highlight that the FX gains I think you're seeing in the P&L might be better offline, but there's complication between unrealized and [on realized] (ph). You're probably seeing a lot of unrealized there and you have to flow through to the FFO statement to understand what's actually realized. Suffice it to say, very probably say you're never going to hear FX as variance item in our FFO as we hedge all of our FFO earnings as I think you know. There was an item in tax where we had some sale of investment tax credits in the quarter. We'll have fewer of those in the following quarter. But, once again, that together with the ventures gain were all previously contemplated in our guidance.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, John. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I guess, on Page 12, you guys break out your ending occupancy by unit size. And I noticed, sequentially, there was a much bigger drop on the spaces that were kind of below [250] (ph). So, I'm just wondering if you can sort of speak to the strength of the bigger boxes, maybe the softness in the weaker. And then, just on the Southern California, I noticed that your lease percentage in SoCal went up about 120 basis points sequentially. So, any comments just around Southern California demand either by product type or LA versus Inland Empire would be helpful. Thanks.\nChris Caton: Hey, Steve, it's Chris Caton. Thank you for the question. I'll start with Southern California and then I think a couple of us will jump in on different trends by size category. So -- and I think I'll answer your short-term question, but it's worthwhile to step back and look at the broader trends in Southern California and take a medium-term view. We think Southern California has a really bright outlook. Couple of legs to that stool. The first is, look, Southern California is a major consumption center. It's a $2 trillion economy, it's got 23 million people, and the region is growing. Employment is up in the last year, and jobs are up 3% since 2019. Second leg of the stool, Southern California is growing as a gateway for international goods. Container imports into the ports of LA and Long Beach are up 12% since 2019. Now, global manufacturing patterns are shifting, as I think you're aware, but they remain positive for Southern California. Asian imports in the United States are up 21% since 2019 on an inflation adjusted basis. Now, yes, I think you're aware China should be down and it is, but only 6% since 2019. And so, this is a testament to the China Plus One strategy that we and others have been talking about. There is significant growth in all other Asia. It's up 40% since 2019. Third leg of the stool on the outlook for Southern California, barriers to supply, they are high and rising. Southern California has had scarce land availability, onerous municipal requirements, and now there are state restrictions with the adoption of State Bill AB 98. These together restrict future new development. Now, Steve, as you're asking, I think it's important to recognize headwinds remain for Southern California, as Tim alluded to in his script. Customers are still working through spare capacity, having taken more than they needed when vacancies were zero, but these long-term trends will be more important over time. As it relates to the very short-term cyclical contours, as you're asking about, a couple of things have emerged in the last 90 days. One is demand remains soft in LA and there is a clear sort of upgrade cycle emerging there, where Class A is outperforming Class B. Generally demand is better in the Inland Empire, given the growth of the ports that I described earlier. And Orange County has a low market vacancy with -- and that position is better to recover earlier. Now, you asked after the first size -- the first question as it relates to size, I'm going to turn that over to Dan.\nDan Letter: Yeah, just quickly on the sizes, certainly, we've had some impacts on the smaller size spaces in China that you see there, but when I look at this number quarter-over-quarter, the smaller size space is typically underperforming on an occupancy basis to the other three buckets. As a matter of fact, quarter-over-quarter, three of the four buckets were down slightly. So, nothing really specific as it relates to historical trends.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Steve. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You talked a little bit about how the customer has remained engaged, but then, also, there remains a lot of sources of uncertainty and presumably that's related to the macro and interest rates and the election. So, I guess, the question is, within the context of maybe past cycles or other periods of uncertainty, how quickly, given that demand get pick up as that uncertainty has been released? So, said another way, like, when some of these factors stop weighing on the customer, does that translate to an almost immediate translation to demand or does it take a couple of quarters to ramp up from there? Thanks.\nChris Caton: Hi, Michael. Yeah, I heard your question as how quickly can demand recover as uncertainty ebbs. So, a couple of thoughts on that. First, I think we should have a measured outlook on demand. Customers are engaged, but taking their time in terms of making decisions. And we really are focused on spare capacity in the supply chain getting used up, as Tim described earlier, and we're seeing that happening. So, utilization, early this year, at the beginning of this year, was below 84%, and it's mid-80%s -- 84%s now. So, it is indeed building, which will be a catalyst for our customers to take space. And indeed, there are these tailwinds of economic growth, of trade growth, of consumption growth, and the acceleration of e-commerce continues. So, I think it we should, just over the near term, have a measured level of optimism here. We just need to watch the market advance.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Mailman: Hey, good afternoon. Maybe just circling back to capital deployment here on the development and acquisition front. I guess, on the development side, very helpful where you think replacement cost rents are relative to new starts. But from a land basis perspective, could you give us a sense of kind of what's in that ready-to-go bucket that actually kind of works from a basis perspective given where rents are today? I guess, that's one part of the question. And then the other part, just on acquisitions, you guys are talking seems like more bullish. You raised guidance here. Just curious kind of globally where you think the best uses of that or best targets are today? And how do you fund that, given, on a stabilized basis, your equity is probably up around 6% at least on my numbers? Are these more debt financed? Are these through the fund business? Can you just give us a sense of where and how you kind of want to put that capital out and whether you're interested in more bigger private portfolios or the historic bigger platform deals you guys have done in the past?\nTim Arndt: Hey, Craig, it's Tim. Let me congratulate you on getting three questions in there at once. Let me just start on the funding and the balance sheet and pass it back to Dan on the capital deployment pieces. I would still view us as having a lot of capacity in our own balance sheet, which has been incredible, I'll say. We've raised a lot of debt proceeds over the last few years, while our normal capital recycling has been a little bit slow. But if you look at our supplemental, look at our credit ratios over the last few years, including this morning, they're very healthy and consistent and even quite strong for our rating. So, we've been able to tap into that. And the reason that's been occurring is that, EBITDA growth, as what really guides that capacity, remains very strong alongside the earnings growth. Alongside that, I would also say that, as mentioned in my remarks, strategic capital fundraising is improving, not just what we raised in the quarter, but I feel like the body language and call notes that we're getting suggest that it will continue to be strong. So, I think a resumption of more normalized levels of capital recycling via contributions is very close and that has been, as you know, our principal source of funding in any event.\nDan Letter: Yeah. Then, Craig, on the deployment front, we own land in about 50 -- over 50 markets globally. The average vintage year is about 4.5 years old, 5 years old. And the mark on that book is about 120% of book. So, we have plenty of opportunities that pencil today. And then, keep in mind, a lot of that land, the other 60% or so is in its way through entitlement where we create a lot of lift ourselves as well over time. So, we don't have a shortage of opportunities. And keep in mind, as we underwrite these deals, we put them in at market value. So, we just have such a wide dispersion of where this land bank exists. And then, we also have a land bank that consists of covered land plays and options that you actually don't see in that land bank. So, again, not a shortage of opportunities. And it's tough to point to any place globally where we want to allocate more than others. It's not the way we've ever operated. We're at scale in virtually every market in which we operate. So, it really comes down to looking at every deal on a deal-by-deal basis and doing the highest quality deals.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Craig. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, good morning, everyone. The earnings release commentary mentioned how Prologis is a partner of choice to meet supply chain, digital and energy infrastructure needs. So, could you give an update on the digital and energy side? I know it's a pretty open-ended question, but with those business lines newer, what has been the focus year-to-date for them? Kind of what are the next near-term steps? And also, can you clarify what portion of the starts -- development starts in the quarter might have been data centers? Thanks.\nTim Arndt: Hey, Caitlin, I'll just pick up the energy piece and maybe pass it to Dan for data centers. As we mentioned, we have a good run rate of new energy starts in the quarter, we're talking about the solar business, both generation and storage, over 50 megawatts in the quarter, which puts us at a really good pace run rate that has been accelerating in our solar program, which two years ago was broadly focused really just in the United States, has now expanded around the globe and is active in Europe, LatAm and Asia. So, we feel, as I mentioned, really good about the escalating pace of that activity and where it's ultimately going to get us over 2025 marching towards that 1 gigawatt goal.\nDan Letter: Yeah, then, on the data center front, overall 2024 has been, call it, a bit of a plan -- exceeding the plan. We have focused on two things, building our pipeline and building the internal capabilities. Both are going extremely well. We have 1.6 gigawatts of secured power of which 490 megawatts is currently under construction. We have an additional 1.4 gigawatts in advanced stages where we have high visibility to that procurement. And then, another over 1.5 gigawatts of applications submitted in dozens of different locations around the world. So, very pleased with the pipeline we're building and the team we're establishing there. You asked about the third quarter start that you see there, that is a powered shell building that we started a couple of years ago with a few different customers we're working with that ended up turning into a turnkey deal. So, what you see there is a conversion from a powered shell to a turnkey.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Caitlin. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nVince Tibone: Hi, good morning. Could you share net absorption and supply completions in the quarter for U.S. portfolio? And then, also provide any update to your full-year outlook for supply and demand? It sounds like nothing big change or surprised too much during the quarter, but just want to confirm your outlook and get the recent actuals there.\nChris Caton: Hi, Vince, it's Chris Caton. Thank you for the question, and your read on the quarter is correct. So, we saw 40 million square feet of net absorption in the quarter, 63 million square feet of completions. So, let's just zoom out and talk about the year and talk about how it's -- the direction it's heading, because we are progressing through this bottoming phase. So, net absorption, this year, will amount to 160 million square feet, and that's against deliveries that are 300 million square feet. So, naturally, market vacancies are rising. They're rising up to 6.8%. And it sounds like you're very familiar with historical data, so you'll know that 6.8% is a low number in the totality of history. But there's something that's happening in the background that's really -- that doesn't always get attention we're talking about, which is the emptying of supply chains. So, deliveries peaked a year ago at 135 million square feet per quarter, and they fall into that number I gave you 63 million here this quarter, so less than half in terms of the decline, and they'll continue to decline into next year. At work here, in the backdrop, also is starts are very low. We have them at 40 million, 42 million square feet in the quarter. So, when you put all this together, what you find is the under-construction pipeline, which is about 215 million square feet today, is at its lowest point since 2017. So, we're going to be going into 2025 with a relatively low level of supply and an opportunity for demand to improve as we progress through this uncertainty in the spare capacity.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Vince. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Hey, just two quick ones, sort of following that last question in terms of asking in a different way. When are you thinking availability sort of peaks to the portfolio? I remember it was 4Q '24. Has that sort of changed at all, once that pushed out to? And then, the second part of the question, when you think about the same store cash NOI guidance for this year, are there any sort of one-timers, puts and takes or comps that we should be aware of as we start to think about 2025? Thanks.\nChris Caton: Hey, Ron, it's Chris Caton. So, I think you said portfolio, but I think you might have meant market. So, I'm going to answer for the market in terms of vacancies. So, we still have vacancies peaking in the later part of this year, but just taking a cautious stance on the direction of demand and that uncertainty and that spare capacity that we've described, we think you should anticipate a measured pace of basically elongation of the peak over the course of the first part of next year. You'll see recovery emerge later next year and accelerate into 2026. I think that's something Dan described earlier.\nTim Arndt: Hey, Ron, it's Tim. And then, just picking up the second part of your question, with regard to cash same store, the answer would be no. I can't think of anything that would be one-time in nature. As we report that metric, we exclude things like lease termination fees that might fall in that category. So, that's not there anyway. The only thing I could maybe think of is free rent is normalizing back to market norms. There could be a little more free rent next year than we want to see in the first half of this year, but that would be relatively small. If I widen out a little bit though and take the question further on same store out in the future anyway, it's probably a good opportunity to just level set people on. We've seen market rent declines thus far this year. We've been clear about them continuing a bit into next year. We've highlighted that occupancy is bottoming here and going to sit here for a handful of quarters. So, looking ahead to next year, it's probably best to think about just the things that we know. And what I would -- the way I would assemble a same store view going into next year would be to look at, for starters, the rent change either on a cash or net effective basis that we've had thus far this year. We know that that's got a half year effect going into 2025. And then, also make some assumptions about what rent change might be in 2025 similarly following the half year convention. I think if you put that math together today and think about a [roll level] (ph) at 10% or 11%, on a net effective basis, you probably find yourselves as -- at something like 5.5% to 6% component of -- for that component of same store. Now, net effective basis, of course, we would have the impact of the [indiscernible] from the Duke portfolio that takes something like 100 off of that. So, you're squarely somewhere around 5. And then, the last thing to think about is just occupancy trends. And again, things really murky to forecast occupancy from here, but you could at least take into account the fact that occupancies have been declining over the course of this year. So, with standard reason on at least an average basis this year to next, that would probably be an additional headwind on same store.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Ron. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nBlaine Heck: Great, thanks. Good morning out there. We've heard a lot recently about strong demand from Asian e-commerce and 3PL companies. So, I was hoping you could talk about whether you signed any deals with those tenants, and just your view on whether this is just a massive pull forward of demand ahead of potential tariff increases or whether you think those groups will continue to lease space into 2025 and beyond?\nChris Caton: Hi, Blaine, it's Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. I'll give you a concise answer and then I'll provide you some context, because this is a growing category. And so, yes, we are leasing with these customers, and yes, we think they will continue to lease space into next year and beyond. And no, we don't really think it's much related to any sort of pull-forward as you asked. But let's just zoom out and understand kind of the broader context here. So, to understand really all these 3PL companies, it is productive to first start with the Chinese e-commerce platforms. They're enjoying rapid growth this year, last year. We're talking about 25%, 50% annual growth and more depending on the concept. And so, the Chinese 3PLs, obviously, are performing the logistics here and they're growing rapidly. I'd say they represent roughly 20% of net absorption this year. And what it also offers their businesses are diversifying as now they compete for all contracts, not just Chinese e-commerce. And so, many of these customers are positioned for growth. They're signing long-term leases and they're investing in their space. You ask after this concept of a pull-forward, and so it is natural to think about how might tariffs and changes in tariffs affect these customers. And a couple of ways to think about it. First, the growth of this ecosystem. This is one that connects Asian manufacturers with American consumers. And what they're doing is they're bypassing the traditional import distributors, and they're doing this in response to the past tariffs, the margin pressure brought about by those tariffs. So, in summary, of that point, some of the growth this year is simply a shift in business model in response to past tariffs. The second point, which I described earlier, is, look, Asian imports are up 21% versus 2019 on an inflation-adjusted basis, and this is really fueled by that China Plus One manufacturing model, and the growth of Asia ex China -- imports from Asia ex China, which are up 40%, as I said. And then the third, in the details of tariffs is something called de minimis provision. You may be aware, this is a provision that allows goods to come in and avoid tariffs under a certain value. These are likely to be wound down under a wide range of scenarios, but it's worth knowing that these are only 3% goods coming in under the de minimis provision, only 3% of Asian imports. And so, look, as the category matures, this is a growth category for sure, there will be winners and losers. And please know that we employ the same rigorous credit evaluation process here as we do with any and all of our prospective customers.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Blaine. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Nick Thillman with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Thillman: Thanks. Good morning out there. We noticed, in the past few quarters, there's been an uptick in lease commencements with term less than a year in the core portfolio, roughly like 50% of commencement. I guess, wanted to get some more color on those tenants specifically. Are these tenants opting for shorter-term renewals? These new tenants kind of looking for swing space given an uncertain macro? Anything you could provide there would be pretty helpful. Thank you.\nTim Arndt: Hey, Nick, it's Tim. I think that's an element of it, some uncertainly on the part of the customer. I think more so it's recognition in certain cases we're being very strategic about the level of rents in some of our markets and what's being locked in now. And there's just bespoke certain situations where we see an opportunity to keep it on the shorter end, where we see some of the rent recovery happening sooner than the overall forecast. And so, there's a strategy in that part as well.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Nick. Operator, next question.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Dennerlein: Hey, guys. Thanks for this. I'm filling in for Jeff today. Just looking at the occupancy across the regions, it looks like Asia and LatAm kind of sort of stepped back. Any kind of trends to flag in those two regions versus like maybe what you're seeing in the U.S., where it looks like it's more stabilizing at this point?\nDan Letter: Thanks for the question, Josh. Really this comes down to the impact from China. Japan certainly has some oversupply issues we're dealing with as well, but our portfolio is in good shape there, but it's really China is the impact.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Josh. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Mueller: Yeah, hi. Are there any specific pockets of the portfolio or regions that are driving higher development stabilization guidance?\nDan Letter: Thanks for the question there, Mike. No, this development book is spread all around the globe. So, there's no trend to point to.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Mike. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nNicholas Yulico: Thanks. I just wanted to clarify a couple of numbers. I think you said that the market rents globally were down 3% this quarter. And then, last quarter, the forecast was for the next 12 months down 2% to 5%. So, are those the same periods on measurement? I just want to -- because it would seem then that forecast was already hit this quarter alone based on the sequential decline, unless I'm confusing something here. Thanks.\nChris Caton: Hi, Nicholas, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. So, the time periods are going to be different. You have the correct numbers. And as Dan described, we continue to see rents be soft in our view today is now a different rolling 12-month view, and we remain cautious on rents over that time period. And as Tim described in his script, rent softness should persist into the middle part of next year.\nTim Arndt: Look, I might just add that it's fair to interpret the way you're looking at those two numbers that, yeah, we may be at the -- depending how you count at the north or south end of that range, maybe that will be closer to 5% over that preceding 12-month period that we described last quarter than not, given what we saw so far in the third quarter.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Nick. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [Aditi] (ph) on for Mike. I was just wondering what drove the jump in CapEx this quarter? Thanks.\nTim Arndt: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the end of that question. What drove what?\nUnidentified Analyst: The jump in CapEx for this quarter?\nTim Arndt: A lot of that is focused -- and you can see the components of CapEx in the supplemental between property improvements and leasing commissions, tenant improvements. There is a lot of leasing in SoCal, in particular. It's just a sort of a reminder that rents there are very high, the commissions wind up in turn being quite high. And then, as you -- it's quite clear from our supplemental as well where we have property improvements disclosure that can be pretty lumpy between quarters and it was a bit elevated here in Q3, but on a trailing 12-month basis, very normal.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Aditi. Operator, next question?\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, thanks. First, can you just talk about leasing demand and absorption trends throughout the quarter a little bit, how the quarter played out a bit, July through September? And then, also in terms of the space utilization and comments that you've made around capacity in the portfolio, which seems to be an important input into your forecast, your portfolio skews toward consumption and I'm just curious if you have any thoughts around the utilization metrics from inventory levels or I guess inventory build, ahead of the election and potential tariffs and also the East Coast port strikes and whether you might expect to see some volatility on utilization in the near term.\nChris Caton: Hey, Todd, it's Chris Caton. Thank you for the questions. Answer on the first one is demand was steady through the quarter, so no meaningful acceleration or deceleration, which I think is what you're asking. As it relates to utilization, I think maybe we step back and cover some of the numbers that I alluded to earlier. So, there is an upward trend this year. The year started below 84%, like I think I mentioned, it's in the sup, I think you said 84.4%. And there is noise from quarter to quarter, which is a combination of goods coming in and coming out, as well as just the methodology, which is survey based. I think if you step back and consider some of the context, one thing I want to add to your consideration is, look, import activity really shows there's an effort to restock supply chains. But this is occurring amidst perhaps more resilient consumer than was expected. And so, those consumers are pulling goods out of supply chains and kind of keeping utilization a little bit below what we consider to be a normal level.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Todd. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Brendan Lynch with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nBrendan Lynch: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm hoping you can help us reconcile the guidance from the December Investor Day. It sounds like rent growth is around 0% through 2026 and vacancy is going to peak out a little bit higher than what you had been expecting. So, how should we think about your core FFO CAGR over the next three years?\nTim Arndt: Hey, Brendan, it's Tim. I would probably just put that aside. I think there's been so much change right now in the markets that as I was doing earlier and describing the way to think about 2025 and just take a fresh look of where we are now with regard to the lease mark-to-market, a dip in rents over the next 12 months or whatever that period is before we start to see it accelerate again. It's really important to appreciate how much that 34% lease mark-to-market will sustain earnings. If you kind of map out that is where rents will start a bit of a decline for the next 12 months and then an increase thereafter, you'll see on rent change alone five, six, seven years of very strong mid-single-digit same store growth just out of the rent growth component by itself. So, that's the underpinning. Over the long term, you're going to think about the adders to that as you march down to the bottom-line between financial and operating leverage. Admittedly, there's some headwinds on the financial leverage piece in the near term as interest rates are rolling up, but over the long term, that will be productive to the bottom end again. And for Prologis, then you're really going to think about all the other things that we do, which is really growth in capital deployment, our higher and better use activity in data center, strategic capital, ventures, the energy business, these are all adders to our growth that are complementary on their own, but I would say synergistic back to the core business as well. And that's how you should think about long-term growth for us.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Brendan. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yeah, thanks. Just wanted to clarify just two things. I think, Chris, you said something about 25% of, I think, the demand this year was from these Asian 3PL companies. I just -- was that your portfolio specifically or were you making a comment about the market or Southern California in particular? I just wanted to sort of clarify that.\nChris Caton: Steve, thanks for the opportunity to clarify. That's broadly across the marketplace.\nTim Arndt: Okay. Thank you. That was the last question here. I'd like to just wrap up by making a few points. First, the quarterly results met our expectations. Secondly, we think we're in a bottoming process that's underway, with completions very clearly in a downtrend. Lastly, capital values are increasing, fundraising has improved and we're actively investing in the future of our business and we're in this for the long run. With that, we look forward to speaking to you at the upcoming conferences and again next quarter.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great rest of the day.",

            "name": "Chris Caton",
            "content": "Hey, Steve, it's Chris Caton. Thank you for the question. I'll start with Southern California and then I think a couple of us will jump in on different trends by size category. So -- and I think I'll answer your short-term question, but it's worthwhile to step back and look at the broader trends in Southern California and take a medium-term view. We think Southern California has a really bright outlook. Couple of legs to that stool. The first is, look, Southern California is a major consumption center. It's a $2 trillion economy, it's got 23 million people, and the region is growing. Employment is up in the last year, and jobs are up 3% since 2019. Second leg of the stool, Southern California is growing as a gateway for international goods. Container imports into the ports of LA and Long Beach are up 12% since 2019. Now, global manufacturing patterns are shifting, as I think you're aware, but they remain positive for Southern California. Asian imports in the United States are up 21% since 2019 on an inflation adjusted basis. Now, yes, I think you're aware China should be down and it is, but only 6% since 2019. And so, this is a testament to the China Plus One strategy that we and others have been talking about. There is significant growth in all other Asia. It's up 40% since 2019. Third leg of the stool on the outlook for Southern California, barriers to supply, they are high and rising. Southern California has had scarce land availability, onerous municipal requirements, and now there are state restrictions with the adoption of State Bill AB 98. These together restrict future new development. Now, Steve, as you're asking, I think it's important to recognize headwinds remain for Southern California, as Tim alluded to in his script. Customers are still working through spare capacity, having taken more than they needed when vacancies were zero, but these long-term trends will be more important over time. As it relates to the very short-term cyclical contours, as you're asking about, a couple of things have emerged in the last 90 days. One is demand remains soft in LA and there is a clear sort of upgrade cycle emerging there, where Class A is outperforming Class B. Generally demand is better in the Inland Empire, given the growth of the ports that I described earlier. And Orange County has a low market vacancy with -- and that position is better to recover earlier. Now, you asked after the first size -- the first question as it relates to size, I'm going to turn that over to Dan. Hi, Michael. Yeah, I heard your question as how quickly can demand recover as uncertainty ebbs. So, a couple of thoughts on that. First, I think we should have a measured outlook on demand. Customers are engaged, but taking their time in terms of making decisions. And we really are focused on spare capacity in the supply chain getting used up, as Tim described earlier, and we're seeing that happening. So, utilization, early this year, at the beginning of this year, was below 84%, and it's mid-80%s -- 84%s now. So, it is indeed building, which will be a catalyst for our customers to take space. And indeed, there are these tailwinds of economic growth, of trade growth, of consumption growth, and the acceleration of e-commerce continues. So, I think it we should, just over the near term, have a measured level of optimism here. We just need to watch the market advance. Hi, Vince, it's Chris Caton. Thank you for the question, and your read on the quarter is correct. So, we saw 40 million square feet of net absorption in the quarter, 63 million square feet of completions. So, let's just zoom out and talk about the year and talk about how it's -- the direction it's heading, because we are progressing through this bottoming phase. So, net absorption, this year, will amount to 160 million square feet, and that's against deliveries that are 300 million square feet. So, naturally, market vacancies are rising. They're rising up to 6.8%. And it sounds like you're very familiar with historical data, so you'll know that 6.8% is a low number in the totality of history. But there's something that's happening in the background that's really -- that doesn't always get attention we're talking about, which is the emptying of supply chains. So, deliveries peaked a year ago at 135 million square feet per quarter, and they fall into that number I gave you 63 million here this quarter, so less than half in terms of the decline, and they'll continue to decline into next year. At work here, in the backdrop, also is starts are very low. We have them at 40 million, 42 million square feet in the quarter. So, when you put all this together, what you find is the under-construction pipeline, which is about 215 million square feet today, is at its lowest point since 2017. So, we're going to be going into 2025 with a relatively low level of supply and an opportunity for demand to improve as we progress through this uncertainty in the spare capacity. Hey, Ron, it's Chris Caton. So, I think you said portfolio, but I think you might have meant market. So, I'm going to answer for the market in terms of vacancies. So, we still have vacancies peaking in the later part of this year, but just taking a cautious stance on the direction of demand and that uncertainty and that spare capacity that we've described, we think you should anticipate a measured pace of basically elongation of the peak over the course of the first part of next year. You'll see recovery emerge later next year and accelerate into 2026. I think that's something Dan described earlier. Hi, Blaine, it's Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. I'll give you a concise answer and then I'll provide you some context, because this is a growing category. And so, yes, we are leasing with these customers, and yes, we think they will continue to lease space into next year and beyond. And no, we don't really think it's much related to any sort of pull-forward as you asked. But let's just zoom out and understand kind of the broader context here. So, to understand really all these 3PL companies, it is productive to first start with the Chinese e-commerce platforms. They're enjoying rapid growth this year, last year. We're talking about 25%, 50% annual growth and more depending on the concept. And so, the Chinese 3PLs, obviously, are performing the logistics here and they're growing rapidly. I'd say they represent roughly 20% of net absorption this year. And what it also offers their businesses are diversifying as now they compete for all contracts, not just Chinese e-commerce. And so, many of these customers are positioned for growth. They're signing long-term leases and they're investing in their space. You ask after this concept of a pull-forward, and so it is natural to think about how might tariffs and changes in tariffs affect these customers. And a couple of ways to think about it. First, the growth of this ecosystem. This is one that connects Asian manufacturers with American consumers. And what they're doing is they're bypassing the traditional import distributors, and they're doing this in response to the past tariffs, the margin pressure brought about by those tariffs. So, in summary, of that point, some of the growth this year is simply a shift in business model in response to past tariffs. The second point, which I described earlier, is, look, Asian imports are up 21% versus 2019 on an inflation-adjusted basis, and this is really fueled by that China Plus One manufacturing model, and the growth of Asia ex China -- imports from Asia ex China, which are up 40%, as I said. And then the third, in the details of tariffs is something called de minimis provision. You may be aware, this is a provision that allows goods to come in and avoid tariffs under a certain value. These are likely to be wound down under a wide range of scenarios, but it's worth knowing that these are only 3% goods coming in under the de minimis provision, only 3% of Asian imports. And so, look, as the category matures, this is a growth category for sure, there will be winners and losers. And please know that we employ the same rigorous credit evaluation process here as we do with any and all of our prospective customers. Hi, Nicholas, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. So, the time periods are going to be different. You have the correct numbers. And as Dan described, we continue to see rents be soft in our view today is now a different rolling 12-month view, and we remain cautious on rents over that time period. And as Tim described in his script, rent softness should persist into the middle part of next year. Hey, Todd, it's Chris Caton. Thank you for the questions. Answer on the first one is demand was steady through the quarter, so no meaningful acceleration or deceleration, which I think is what you're asking. As it relates to utilization, I think maybe we step back and cover some of the numbers that I alluded to earlier. So, there is an upward trend this year. The year started below 84%, like I think I mentioned, it's in the sup, I think you said 84.4%. And there is noise from quarter to quarter, which is a combination of goods coming in and coming out, as well as just the methodology, which is survey based. I think if you step back and consider some of the context, one thing I want to add to your consideration is, look, import activity really shows there's an effort to restock supply chains. But this is occurring amidst perhaps more resilient consumer than was expected. And so, those consumers are pulling goods out of supply chains and kind of keeping utilization a little bit below what we consider to be a normal level. Steve, thanks for the opportunity to clarify. That's broadly across the marketplace."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Dan Letter",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Vikram. Let me start with your first question, which was squaring the rent growth in the near term here. And let me highlight that we are near or in an inflection period right now. This is a time when forecast have very high variability. So, the quick answer to the near-term view on rents is pretty much in line with where we were 90 days ago. Customers are very engaged, but they are just not making decisions. So, we expect this softness in rents to continue throughout this period. But the way we actually think about this is for the long term. 90% of our leases roll after the next 12 months. So, even if rents fluctuate minus 3%, plus 3%, it doesn't really matter. It won't have significant impact on our long-term earnings nor the value of the business. And the real driver for rent growth is replacement cost rents, which Tim said in his script, replacement cost rents are 15% higher than today's market rents. So, the gap between the market rents and the replacement cost rents will ultimately lead to this rent growth. And so, if you think about us being at a peak vacancy or close to peak vacancy, which we expect to endure for a certain segment -- portion maybe throughout 2025 with a recovery in that vacancy emerging late next year and then accelerating thereafter. So, we know the trend and we'll capture that rent growth in the longer term. We just don't necessarily know the slope of that recovery and it's really hard to peg that. And honestly, when it comes down to it, guessing on the short term has never been one of our strong suits. We're running Prologis for the long term. And the second part of your question had to do with our development starts. Development starts, so we push those off. Tim talked about discipline in the script here. Build-to-suits, while the pipeline remains pretty strong, it's just flat. Feel like for the last four quarters, we've been talking about customers kicking the can down the road. That's continuing and those build-to-suits are just moving into next year. And then, from a spec perspective, we are going to maintain that discipline that we've always maintained. We don't want to be building into the market fundamentals in many of these markets today, but that's not categorical. So, for example, this quarter, we actually started two buildings in Atlanta. Atlanta's headline vacancy is 9%. But then, we look at the infill site that we have with no competition, we're only 150 basis points vacant. We don't have any spec risk. So, we decided to move forward to that. So, we move forward with that building or those two buildings, so we could be building into those [dirt] (ph) of completions a year out, like we've been talking about doing. So, it is happening here and there. We just see that accelerating more in the coming quarters. And then, let me finish with the fact that we have a very large development book right now, $5.5 billion underway on Prologis share, and that's 33 million square feet of development underway. And then, we also have $40 billion worth of opportunities right now in our land bank. And so -- and actually 30% of that land is entitled ready-to-go and then two-thirds of that is actually pad-ready, which means we really truncated the timeframes to go vertical with those sites. So, we're going to be able to execute the strategy just like we talked about over the last several quarters, we're just -- you're going to see that happen a little bit later. Yeah, just quickly on the sizes, certainly, we've had some impacts on the smaller size spaces in China that you see there, but when I look at this number quarter-over-quarter, the smaller size space is typically underperforming on an occupancy basis to the other three buckets. As a matter of fact, quarter-over-quarter, three of the four buckets were down slightly. So, nothing really specific as it relates to historical trends. Yeah. Then, Craig, on the deployment front, we own land in about 50 -- over 50 markets globally. The average vintage year is about 4.5 years old, 5 years old. And the mark on that book is about 120% of book. So, we have plenty of opportunities that pencil today. And then, keep in mind, a lot of that land, the other 60% or so is in its way through entitlement where we create a lot of lift ourselves as well over time. So, we don't have a shortage of opportunities. And keep in mind, as we underwrite these deals, we put them in at market value. So, we just have such a wide dispersion of where this land bank exists. And then, we also have a land bank that consists of covered land plays and options that you actually don't see in that land bank. So, again, not a shortage of opportunities. And it's tough to point to any place globally where we want to allocate more than others. It's not the way we've ever operated. We're at scale in virtually every market in which we operate. So, it really comes down to looking at every deal on a deal-by-deal basis and doing the highest quality deals. Yeah, then, on the data center front, overall 2024 has been, call it, a bit of a plan -- exceeding the plan. We have focused on two things, building our pipeline and building the internal capabilities. Both are going extremely well. We have 1.6 gigawatts of secured power of which 490 megawatts is currently under construction. We have an additional 1.4 gigawatts in advanced stages where we have high visibility to that procurement. And then, another over 1.5 gigawatts of applications submitted in dozens of different locations around the world. So, very pleased with the pipeline we're building and the team we're establishing there. You asked about the third quarter start that you see there, that is a powered shell building that we started a couple of years ago with a few different customers we're working with that ended up turning into a turnkey deal. So, what you see there is a conversion from a powered shell to a turnkey. Thanks for the question, Josh. Really this comes down to the impact from China. Japan certainly has some oversupply issues we're dealing with as well, but our portfolio is in good shape there, but it's really China is the impact. Thanks for the question there, Mike. No, this development book is spread all around the globe. So, there's no trend to point to."

            "name": "Tim Arndt",
            "content": "Thank you, Justin, and welcome to everybody joining our call. Before diving in, I'd like to share our concern for those affected by the recent hurricanes in the U.S. and Europe that impacted our employees, customers and communities. Thankfully, our teams are safe and their proactive customer outreach and assistance has been outstanding. Our property sustained limited damage for such strong storms. Overall, we are pleased with our operating and financial results as the third quarter played out to our expectations. While occupancy and rent softened against the backdrop of positive yet subdued demand, we continue to deliver impressive net effective rent change due to the still powerful lease mark-to-market embedded in our portfolio, which bridges us through this soft patch to the next cycle of rent growth. Turning to the quarter, core FFO, excluding net promote expense, was $1.45 per share and included in net promotes was $1.43 per share. These results were slightly ahead of our forecast and the quarter included approximately $0.03 of income from the Prologis Ventures' exit. Period-ending occupancy was 96.2% [at our share] (ph), nearly 300 basis points above the market as the flight to quality continues. Net effective rent change was 68% and cash rent change was 44%. We captured over $90 million of NOI by rolling leases up to market. The portfolio produced net effective and cash same store growth of 6.2% and 7.2%, respectively. Revenues were impacted by approximately 35 basis points of bad debt, which is elevated from our normal 15 to 20 basis points. While bankruptcy filings are on the rise broadly, the good news is that the space we've taken back as a result has had embedded rental upside of over 60%. Our overall portfolio lease mark-to-market finished the quarter at 34%, representing $1.6 billion of potential NOI. Finally, on the balance sheet, we raised $4.6 billion of new debt across Prologis and our funds at a weighted average rate of 4.6% and the maturity of approximately nine years. In terms of deployment, we had a very active quarter. We started over $0.5 billion in development projects, including incremental capital to an existing data center development now pre-leased to a hyperscale customer with a turnkey buildout. We expanded our land bank, driving our potential development opportunity over $40 billion, which now includes our first two projects in India that support over 5 million square feet of new development. We deployed over $1.4 billion in third-party acquisitions. Year-to-date, we have acquired over 14 million square feet of strategic assets at an estimated 20% discount to replacement cost. We started development on 54 megawatts of new energy systems. Our momentum here is building, and we continue to have and we expect to have generation capacity well over 600 megawatts at the end of this year, with good line of sight to our 1 gigawatt goal by the end of 2025. As mentioned, Prologis Ventures had a successful exit of an early round investment in the Japanese workforce solution, [indiscernible]. This produced a 9-times multiple on our investment, realizing a 65% IRR. Beyond the economics, our strategy and supply chain venture investing has delivered valuable insights for Prologis and our customers. Finally, FIBRA Prologis, our strategic capital vehicle in Mexico, successfully closed a tender for the shares of Terrafina, of which it now owns nearly 80%, enhancing its leadership position in one of our best-performing and highest-growth global markets. Turning to the operating environment, conditions remain soft in many of our markets, and as we've described over the last few quarters, this is despite healthy GDP and consumption growth. We ascribe the weaker relationship between economic output and industrial absorption to the availability built into the supply chain through COVID, originally earmarked for resiliency, but now available to operators as a source for cost containment. But ultimately, the ability to rely on this [excess] (ph) is diminishing as utilization reaches a level that will force decision making and expansion, the pace of which will vary by market. Many customers are making progress in reducing this capacity through growth, while others are gaining efficiencies through consolidation. In the end, it's all serving to hold net absorption below pre-COVID levels, impacting rents. Globally, we estimate that market rents decreased approximately 3% this quarter and roughly half this amount when excluding Southern California. As we noted before, Southern California will take the longest to reach equilibrium. While activity has improved, the remaining amounts of excess capacity will simply take time to work through. That said, it's important to keep this context, our SoCal portfolio generated 84% rent change on commencements this quarter even as it led the globe in market rent decline, a great example of the interplay between the spot reduction in rents against our lease mark-to-market. This has us well positioned to navigate the cyclical downturn and taking it a step further, we see the structural investment case for SoCal as strengthening with new supply barriers that come into effect from recently enacted legislation and continued focus on carbon emissions. As always, the rent picture is mixed and there remain many markets that are either flat on rents or positive, such as Houston, Atlanta, Nashville, Northern Europe, and of course, LatAm remains very strong. Overall, bottoming process is underway, and we expect demand to remain soft in the near term. Looking ahead, market vacancy is at or near its peak and will hover there as utilization improves, and global rents will bottom sometime mid next year. It stands to reason then that the near-term growth will be affected by the path market rents and occupancy have already taken. We remain very positive on the outlook for our business, as vacancies are still low in the context of history, starts are down significantly, and supply deliveries are falling below their pre-COVID levels. Additionally, with replacement cost rents approximately 15% above today's market, even with land values marked down by a third from their peak, the long-term growth trajectory remains highly favorable. Moving on to capital markets, we've seen improved pricing and activity in the transaction market and values continue to grow. U.S. and European values, again, increased approximately 1% in the quarter, and Mexico saw an impressive 2.2%. With the bottom seemingly in, our strategic capital business had its most productive quarter in the last two years, raising a net $460 million. Overall, it appears private market sentiment is stronger than the public markets. During the quarter, transaction volumes increased and unlevered IRRs compressed another 25 basis points. In terms of guidance, which I'll review [at our share] (ph), we are tightening our forecast for average occupancy to a range of 96% to 96.5%, and also tightening our forecast for cash same store growth to a range of 6.5% to 7%. Our net effective same store growth is for a range of 5.5% to 6%, which has been tightened and reduced modestly at the midpoint for the increased non-cash write-offs we expect from higher bankruptcies in the balance of the year. We are tightening and slightly reducing our G&A guidance to a range of $415 million to $425 million, and tightening our range for strategic capital revenue to $525 million to $535 million. We are reducing our overall development starts guidance to a range of $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion, which reflects both slow decision-making in build-to-suits and discipline on our part in deferring new spec development amid stubborn demand. Of course, we are in the best position to react quickly as conditions warrant with approximately $8 billion of pad-ready development opportunities. We see attractive acquisition opportunities in the market and are increasing our guidance here, taking our range up to $1.75 billion to $2.25 billion. And finally, the forecast for our contribution and disposition activity is increasing to a new range of $3 billion to $4 billion, reflecting the improving transaction market and stronger fundraising and strategic capital. The positive spread between our buying and selling IRRs year-to-date has been approximately 100 basis points. Putting it all together, we are increasing our GAAP earnings to a range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share, core FFO, including net promote expense, will range between $5.42 and $5.46 per share, while core FFO, excluding net promote expense, will range between $5.49 and $5.53 per share, a $0.01 increase from our prior guidance. Core FFO, obviously, excludes our development gain guidance, but it's noteworthy to highlight our increase to a new range of $375 million to $425 million. In closing, we had a very productive quarter in which we delivered strong operating results, high occupancy, high rent change and meaningful same store growth in a challenging market environment. Alongside that performance, it's clear that we are focused on the future as evidenced in our very active deployment, spanning our global reach and product offerings. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the structural demand for logistics real estate and our focus on operational excellence, customer centricity and value creation will continue to drive strong performance across all market cycles. Consistent with this drive for excellence, I'd be remiss to not highlight our annual GROUNDBREAKERS forum, which we just held in London. It featured some of the most innovative companies of our day, and we heard from the likes of the legendary Fred Smith of FedEx and Sir Tony Blair amongst many others. GROUNDBREAKERS deepens our customer relationships and builds upon our thought leadership across the supply chain and its emerging foundation for clean energy and digital infrastructure. It's great to see so many of you there, and a replay of the event is available on our website. With that, I'll hand the call back to the operator for your questions. Unfortunately, Hamid is feeling under the weather today, and while he's on the call, he may be limited in his responses. Operator? Thanks, Tom. Thanks for the question. Look, if I just start with the acquisitions guidance, I would probably read that as our confidence in the long term for starters. We're very engaged in the business. We are very much looking at markets that we see to build additional scale and deepen our presence and our teams are scouring the market in that regard looking for opportunities. One thing implicit in my remarks that I'd like you to really hear is, we're not really a buyer at market IRRs. We are typically looking for unusual constructs, upmarket deals, deals that we source where we're looking for a premium to prevailing IRRs such as those we see in our appraisals. So, take that as you're looking at our activity in the acquisitions market. In the near term, we just recognized that utilization has really been the culprit of keeping a lid on demand. And the message we're trying to send here is that, that has an end to it. Ultimately, customers will work through what's available to them, and it's going to be sort of a spillover out of utilization into growth in occupancy. Hey, John, thanks for the question. I would say, you see it as a beat, we don't see it as a beat. These were events that we were forecasting for the year and for the quarter. And I would also highlight that the FX gains I think you're seeing in the P&L might be better offline, but there's complication between unrealized and [on realized] (ph). You're probably seeing a lot of unrealized there and you have to flow through to the FFO statement to understand what's actually realized. Suffice it to say, very probably say you're never going to hear FX as variance item in our FFO as we hedge all of our FFO earnings as I think you know. There was an item in tax where we had some sale of investment tax credits in the quarter. We'll have fewer of those in the following quarter. But, once again, that together with the ventures gain were all previously contemplated in our guidance. Hey, Craig, it's Tim. Let me congratulate you on getting three questions in there at once. Let me just start on the funding and the balance sheet and pass it back to Dan on the capital deployment pieces. I would still view us as having a lot of capacity in our own balance sheet, which has been incredible, I'll say. We've raised a lot of debt proceeds over the last few years, while our normal capital recycling has been a little bit slow. But if you look at our supplemental, look at our credit ratios over the last few years, including this morning, they're very healthy and consistent and even quite strong for our rating. So, we've been able to tap into that. And the reason that's been occurring is that, EBITDA growth, as what really guides that capacity, remains very strong alongside the earnings growth. Alongside that, I would also say that, as mentioned in my remarks, strategic capital fundraising is improving, not just what we raised in the quarter, but I feel like the body language and call notes that we're getting suggest that it will continue to be strong. So, I think a resumption of more normalized levels of capital recycling via contributions is very close and that has been, as you know, our principal source of funding in any event. Hey, Caitlin, I'll just pick up the energy piece and maybe pass it to Dan for data centers. As we mentioned, we have a good run rate of new energy starts in the quarter, we're talking about the solar business, both generation and storage, over 50 megawatts in the quarter, which puts us at a really good pace run rate that has been accelerating in our solar program, which two years ago was broadly focused really just in the United States, has now expanded around the globe and is active in Europe, LatAm and Asia. So, we feel, as I mentioned, really good about the escalating pace of that activity and where it's ultimately going to get us over 2025 marching towards that 1 gigawatt goal. Hey, Ron, it's Tim. And then, just picking up the second part of your question, with regard to cash same store, the answer would be no. I can't think of anything that would be one-time in nature. As we report that metric, we exclude things like lease termination fees that might fall in that category. So, that's not there anyway. The only thing I could maybe think of is free rent is normalizing back to market norms. There could be a little more free rent next year than we want to see in the first half of this year, but that would be relatively small. If I widen out a little bit though and take the question further on same store out in the future anyway, it's probably a good opportunity to just level set people on. We've seen market rent declines thus far this year. We've been clear about them continuing a bit into next year. We've highlighted that occupancy is bottoming here and going to sit here for a handful of quarters. So, looking ahead to next year, it's probably best to think about just the things that we know. And what I would -- the way I would assemble a same store view going into next year would be to look at, for starters, the rent change either on a cash or net effective basis that we've had thus far this year. We know that that's got a half year effect going into 2025. And then, also make some assumptions about what rent change might be in 2025 similarly following the half year convention. I think if you put that math together today and think about a [roll level] (ph) at 10% or 11%, on a net effective basis, you probably find yourselves as -- at something like 5.5% to 6% component of -- for that component of same store. Now, net effective basis, of course, we would have the impact of the [indiscernible] from the Duke portfolio that takes something like 100 off of that. So, you're squarely somewhere around 5. And then, the last thing to think about is just occupancy trends. And again, things really murky to forecast occupancy from here, but you could at least take into account the fact that occupancies have been declining over the course of this year. So, with standard reason on at least an average basis this year to next, that would probably be an additional headwind on same store. Hey, Nick, it's Tim. I think that's an element of it, some uncertainly on the part of the customer. I think more so it's recognition in certain cases we're being very strategic about the level of rents in some of our markets and what's being locked in now. And there's just bespoke certain situations where we see an opportunity to keep it on the shorter end, where we see some of the rent recovery happening sooner than the overall forecast. And so, there's a strategy in that part as well. Look, I might just add that it's fair to interpret the way you're looking at those two numbers that, yeah, we may be at the -- depending how you count at the north or south end of that range, maybe that will be closer to 5% over that preceding 12-month period that we described last quarter than not, given what we saw so far in the third quarter. I'm sorry, I didn't hear the end of that question. What drove what? A lot of that is focused -- and you can see the components of CapEx in the supplemental between property improvements and leasing commissions, tenant improvements. There is a lot of leasing in SoCal, in particular. It's just a sort of a reminder that rents there are very high, the commissions wind up in turn being quite high. And then, as you -- it's quite clear from our supplemental as well where we have property improvements disclosure that can be pretty lumpy between quarters and it was a bit elevated here in Q3, but on a trailing 12-month basis, very normal. Hey, Brendan, it's Tim. I would probably just put that aside. I think there's been so much change right now in the markets that as I was doing earlier and describing the way to think about 2025 and just take a fresh look of where we are now with regard to the lease mark-to-market, a dip in rents over the next 12 months or whatever that period is before we start to see it accelerate again. It's really important to appreciate how much that 34% lease mark-to-market will sustain earnings. If you kind of map out that is where rents will start a bit of a decline for the next 12 months and then an increase thereafter, you'll see on rent change alone five, six, seven years of very strong mid-single-digit same store growth just out of the rent growth component by itself. So, that's the underpinning. Over the long term, you're going to think about the adders to that as you march down to the bottom-line between financial and operating leverage. Admittedly, there's some headwinds on the financial leverage piece in the near term as interest rates are rolling up, but over the long term, that will be productive to the bottom end again. And for Prologis, then you're really going to think about all the other things that we do, which is really growth in capital deployment, our higher and better use activity in data center, strategic capital, ventures, the energy business, these are all adders to our growth that are complementary on their own, but I would say synergistic back to the core business as well. And that's how you should think about long-term growth for us. Okay. Thank you. That was the last question here. I'd like to just wrap up by making a few points. First, the quarterly results met our expectations. Secondly, we think we're in a bottoming process that's underway, with completions very clearly in a downtrend. Lastly, capital values are increasing, fundraising has improved and we're actively investing in the future of our business and we're in this for the long run. With that, we look forward to speaking to you at the upcoming conferences and again next quarter."

I would now like to turn the call over to Justin Meng, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nJustin Meng: Thanks, Daryl. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com, under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results maybe affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our second quarter earnings press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP and in accordance with Reg-G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions, and guidance; Hamid Moghadam, our Founder and CEO; Dan Letter, our President; and Chris Caton, Managing Director, are also with us today. With that, I'll hand the call over to Tim.\nTim Arndt: Thank you, Justin, and thank you all for joining our call. We had solid execution against our second quarter plan, which showed improvement over the first quarter, underpinned by a pickup in overall market activity. In fact, we leased 52 million square feet in our portfolio, a 27% increase over the first quarter and one of our highest quarters in the past few years. This helped in delivering occupancy, which outperformed our forecast and more importantly at rent change well over 70%. This was achieved in an environment where decision making has remained slow as many customers optimize existing footprints before committing to new space. As a result, we expect many property owners to continue to prioritize occupancy in select markets with higher availability, keeping pressure on rents. That said, the bright spot continues to be the depletion of the supply pipeline and successive quarters of very low development starts. We believe we are near peak vacancy and this dearth of new supply is setting the stage for more favorable conditions in 2025. As evidenced by very strong rent change this quarter, our lease mark-to-market is serving to sustain meaningful growth through this transition. In terms of results for the quarter, core FFO, excluding promotes, was $1.36 per share and including net promote expense was $1.34 per share. We earned promote revenue within our FIBRA vehicle in Mexico, marking the seventh year of such achievements since its IPO and speaking to the high quality of our portfolio and team in that market. Global occupancy at our share ended the quarter at 96.5%. Our U.S. portfolio continues to outperform the market by over 320 basis points, a meaningful spread that has widened from our historic norm of roughly 175 basis points. As vacancy normalizes in our markets, we expect this flight to quality to continue. We crystallized $100 million of our lease mark to market during the quarter. As of June, we estimate that the net effective market rents are 42% above in-place rents, representing $2 billion of potential NOI. Over 40% of the decline in our lease mark to market ratio is due to this quarter's mark-to-market capture. Net effective rent change was nearly 74% based on commencement and is 64% based on new signings. This metric can be volatile between quarters due to mix, but we continue to expect full year net effective rent change to be above 70%, illustrating the outsized mark to market opportunity that will remain in the near and intermediate term. Our same-store growth was 7.2% on a cash basis, 5.5% on a net effective basis, each strong despite the impact of over 100 basis points of decline in average occupancy year over year, as well as the effect of fair value lease adjustments on net effective growth from the Duke acquisition. We deployed over $700 million into new development projects and acquisitions during the quarter and also closed on over $1 billion in dispositions and contributions at values exceeding our initial expectations. We continue to grow our solar energy business with the installed capacity of our operating portfolio now at 524 megawatts, with an additional 134 megawatts currently under construction, the total of which will generate approximately $55 million of NOI once stabilized in line with our forecast. Finally, we raised $1.2 billion of debt across our balance sheet and funds at a weighted average rate of 4.4% and a term of 11 years. Outside of this total, we also launched our $1 billion commercial paper program, which has thus far saved an average of 60 basis points on our short-term borrowing costs in the U.S. In terms of our markets, there are several encouraging signs for demand, including port volumes on both the East and West Coast, as well as increased volume of proposal activity we've seen across our portfolio. While overall leasing has increased since the first quarter, the tone of our conversations with customers warrants continued caution in the near term. Even though space utilization sits at near a normal range, approximately 85%, we find that many customers simply lack urgency, still prioritizing cost containment in light of an uncertain economic and political environment, both of which will be clearer soon. In the meantime, development starts remain muted and below pre-COVID levels. Quarterly completions peaked last year at 140 million square feet and are projected to approach 50 million square feet by the fourth quarter of this year. We estimate vacancies in our U.S. and European markets will peak over the next few quarters, likely creating a shift in tone as customers assess the requirements heading into 2025. Until then, rent growth will be anemic in most markets and down modestly in some. Southern California remains its own story, where demand remains sluggish and vacancy continues to drift higher. While we've observed some green shoots over the last 90 days, we expect soft conditions to persist over the next 12 months. Globally, we estimate that effective market rents declined 2% during the quarter, with 75% of the decline attributed to SoCal. Because there is so much conflicting data available to investors, it's worth mentioning that we measure market rent growth by evaluating effective rents achieved, not asking rents before concessions, a difference that can be as wide as 5% to 10%. We'd summarize by highlighting that most of the puts and takes across our global portfolio have provided conditions that are largely stable with reason for intermediate-term optimism due to several quarters of low starts and subdued but positive demand. Turning to capital markets. Value saw modest increases in the second quarter for our U.S. and European funds. There's greater depth amongst buyers of logistics properties and lenders are more active, together reducing yield requirements. In particular, buyer pools for well-located core product are growing now with multiple bidders back in the mix. We saw this very clearly in a large portfolio sale we closed this quarter, which was originally brought to the market last fall. Interest was reasonable at the time, but we felt pricing was off, elected to wait, and achieved 28% higher value in the end. I'd like to provide a brief update on our data center business, where we are having very good momentum across our pipeline. As you know, access to power is the key to unlocking value, and our dedicated energy and sustainability teams are leveraging our expertise in net-zero carbon solutions, solar generation, and battery storage to ensure that we're in the pole position with all of the major utilities. To date, we have secured 1.3 gigawatts of power. Of this, 450 megawatts is currently under construction in $1.2 billion of TEI. 300 megawatts is in active pre-development with an expected $700 million of TEI, leaving 550 megawatts as available and currently undergoing build-to-suit discussions. Beyond all of this, we are also in advanced stages of procurement for an additional 1.5 gigawatts, which is key to delivering on our five-year outlook for $7 billion to $8 billion of total data center investment. Overall, we've made significant progress growing this business and are optimistic about the targets we laid out at our Investor Day. Turning to guidance. We are making few changes as the year is playing out to our expectations. As such, we're maintaining our forecast for average occupancy, same-store, G&A, development starts, and stabilizations. There are only a few small changes otherwise. We are lowering our guidance for strategic capital revenue by $10 million only to account for the impact of FX rates, which are hedged elsewhere under P&L and will not affect overall earnings. Due to the increased activity we're seeing in the capital markets and deals completed year-to-date, we are increasing our acquisitions guidance to a new range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion and similarly increasing our guidance for overall dispositions and contributions to a range of $2.75 billion to $3.65 billion. Ultimately, we are increasing our GAAP earnings to a range of $3.25 to $3.45 per share. Core FFO excluding net promote expense will range between $5.46 and $5.54 per share, while core FFO including promotes will range from $5.39 to $5.47 per share, a slight increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance attributed to the FIBRA promote. Our core earnings guidance calls for nearly 8% growth at the midpoint, which ranks in the 87th percentile of S&P 500 REITs. We've been unique in our ability to generate leading growth over a long period of time, not only through a superior business model and portfolio, but also from our commitment to leveraging all that comes from our scale, including adjacent verticals strategic to our core business. Our focus is simply to continue to deliver on this industry-leading and durable growth. As we close, I'd also like to highlight an upcoming event, our annual GROUNDBREAKERS Thought Leadership Forum on October 2nd in London. The program is taking shape as our best yet, exploring the surprising intersection of logistics and health, energy, and even fashion. Additional information for the forum is available on our website, and we hope to see you there or online. With that, I'll hand the call back to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nBlaine Heck: Thanks. Good morning out there. It looks like your occupancy and rent spreads improved as the quarter progressed just looking at results versus the NAREIT update. Can you just talk about whether that momentum has continued into the third quarter, and if there are any specific markets that might have driven that improvement? And related to that, on occupancy guidance, the maintained guidance implies some downside during the second half of the year. Can you just talk about what's driving that trajectory, please?\nTim Arndt: Hi, Blaine, it's Tim. I'll start with the first part, and I may ask you to repeat the second. I'm not sure if I understood the question. But coming into the first few weeks of the third quarter, I think we are maintaining the momentum that I guess you're inferring was picked up between NAREIT and the end of the quarter, which is that proposal activity is strong, leasing activity is strong. We see it more in renewals, a little less so in new leasing. We're achieving our rents outside of the drag that we discussed in SoCal just continues to be the market that we watch most. But I think when I put that all together, what we think is we're pleased to see the way the second quarter executed. I think it executed pretty much precisely as we expected from our discussion 90 days ago and feel good about the year.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Blaine. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Next question. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Craig. Maybe just on the demand side. Obviously, it sounds like you're seeing and feeling an improvement there, but I was hoping you could talk about some of the demand differences across different size ranges and geographies?\nChris Caton: All right. Thanks for the question. It's Chris. I'll start with the geographies. The healthiest part in the U.S. is the southeastern US. But I'd also really point out. Latin America as well as Europe as being areas that are a boost to the overall global picture as it relates to size categories the story remains the same relative to what we discussed on our last earnings call, which is to say sizes above 100, maybe even certainly over 250, and 500, that's where demand momentum is the best, but there's also more availability there. Demand is stable below 100, but that's where vacancies are especially low.\nJustin Meng: Thank you. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Kamden with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nRonald Kamden: Great. Just a quick question on sort of the rent growth conversation I think you talked about down 2% in 2Q after being down 1% in 1Q '24. Maybe if you could just provide some commentary on what the expectations are for the back half of the year and the 4% to 6% sort of rent growth targets long term. How do you guys think about that going forward? Thanks.\nTim Arndt: Hi, Ron, thanks for the question. It's Tim. Yes, and let me start. I'll. Just reemphasize we're talking about effective rents here from all the distortion we see out there in quotation method. So this is ultimately taking rents incorporating in all concessions starting with the next 12 months. I'll do it that way, as we've described we would. We talked about at NAREIT, we basically would divide our portfolio into SoCal as its own special case and then everything else. And within everything else, there are strong, stable and weak markets, and I would put all of those other non-SoCal markets around flat. Maybe modestly negative on market rent growth over the next 12 months which is a long way of saying it's really going to be a function of what do we think SoCal does in the next 12 months when we put that all together, inclusive? Of SoCal, we would probably put that. In a range of something like 2% to possibly 5% down in the next 12 months before inflecting. And this is a good place to just remind everybody that even in light of that, I mean, we've had three quarters now of some negative market rent growth, 1% down in the fourth quarter of last year, 1% down in the first quarter, 2% down, this last second quarter. In the meantime, we're putting up very significant rent change. And growth within our NOI 74%, one of our highest quarters. Just this last quarter. So it's very fortuitous the position we're in where we have this large lease mark to market carry us through this transition period.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Ron. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes, thanks. Tim, I think you commented on the lease proposals, but I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail. Obviously, that green line is up strongly and to the right. And I'm just curious how much of that is for new activity, for vacant space or development, and how much of that might be for renewal activity, just to frame it out, because that number is up quite a bit, even from the past couple of years.\nTim Arndt: It is. And thanks, Steve. The chart that you're looking at in the supplemental is new leasing, just to be clear. And you highlight something that I'm glad you did. We do see the very big uptick in nominal proposals, 112 million square feet, meaningfully above where we've been. That's a function of a few things. One is just more space to lease. We have some increased vacancy in the portfolio. And this is also a function of just how the next 12 months of overall looks. And there's a little bit more there as well. This is why we added, for those who've noticed, a new line just this quarter, which puts that proposal activity in the context of what is available to lease. You see that measured 42% this last quarter, which we would characterize, and you can see when you look at the chart, as normal.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Steve. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nCamille Bonnel: Good morning. The pace of development stabilization seems to be tracking ahead at this halfway point of the year. So, was wondering, how does this compare to what was budgeted in your guidance? And out in the West Coast, it looks like you've made some good progress stabilizing some of these developments. So, can you talk to some general terms on rents versus underwriting and how much of that was new leases signed in the quarter? Thank you.\nDan Letter: Yes, thanks for the question, Camille. This is Dan. I'll handle the question here. So it was a big stabilization quarter for us. Certainly development leasing has slowed a bit. I think the best way to look at our development portfolio is look at the whole book of business. Don't look at it necessarily on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So if you look at that, the whole $6 billion development portfolio, all $35 million feet we're trending to our long-term margin of 24% to. 25%. So if you look at our 20 year average, it's in the high 20s. So feel really good about. Our development portfolio.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Camille. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Peterson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathon Petersen: Great. Thank you. So I was looking at your top tenant list. It looks like an increase in square feet lease to Amazon and Home Depot. We're hearing from other people that Amazon is more active this year. Whether you want to talk about them specifically or maybe we can frame it. In the context of what impact is some of these larger players in the market being more active in leasing have on the overall market. Like are people waiting for them to make decisions before we start to see an uptick in activity. Is that kind of what's happening right now?\nDan Letter: Yes Jon. This is Dan. Thanks for the question. So what you're pointing to is our top 25 list where. You saw some big completions come into the operating portfolio. Those were decisions that were made a year ago. And sure, we've had some success with Amazon this year. I would actually talk about the e-commerce segment overall. E-commerce has been very strong. We talked about this happening multiple quarters ago, before it was a story, and it's played out as exactly as we expected. E-commerce continues to be strong. Amazon was a little quiet for us this last quarter, but at any given time, they're are our top customer. We've got a lot going on with them, and it's a very strong segment for us.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Jon. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, everyone. Maybe just on the transaction market, I think Tim, earlier you mentioned how the depth of buyers is deeper and the disposition you did was at a materially higher valuation now versus. 2023. So I guess. What are you guys seeing from an acquisition potential on your side who is selling and kind of your opportunity there in the near term?\nDan Letter: Hi, Caitlin. Thanks for the question. Yes, we have seen the transaction market open up. I would say normalize. We're hearing from the brokerage community that they're doing. A lot of broker opinion of values, so we expect to see. The transaction market continue. We've had a lot of success in the disposition we've outperformed across the Board. In our disposition business which is why you saw us move our guidance up. We definitely want to take advantage of the market as it's opened up. And we have also been turning over all sorts of interesting opportunities. And many markets around the globe, and we're really excited about our acquisition volume for the year.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes, the other thing I would add to that, Caitlin, is that you have closed end funds that are coming to the end of their lives, and those portfolios need to be liquidated. And the investors generally because of what's going on in their portfolio not just in real estate, but also in other private asset classes need liquidity because they have outstanding commitment. So there's pressure from those guys to realize these sales and industrial real estate has been one of the places that their performance has been really great and crystallization of those values is important. So it's a natural course of things. And you have some deferred sales volume. That was put on suspended animation for the last 24 months. That's now coming through. But generally, I would say the transaction market is very good right now, with multiple offers for good portfolios and the sweet spot is a couple of $200 million, I would say. Not mega deals and not timing deals, but sort of in the $100 million $200 million range.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Caitlin. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Thillman with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Thillman: Hi, good morning out there, Tim. You kind of mentioned the uptick in new lease proposals. Maybe just wanted to dig in on retention for the next 12 months. Are you expecting that to be historical averages and then also continue to see kind of free rent uptick as the elevated concessions. Does that spur demand a little bit. Just want a little more color on that. Thanks.\nTim Arndt: Sure. Nick. Thanks. On the retention front, we typically forecast between 70% and 80%. Think of it as 75, and that's a good number, and I would characterize that as our expectations over the coming several quarters and then free rent. I think we may have discussed this recently. I would view free rent as. Just reverting to mean levels. We had kind of is another area where we had some surge pricing, if you will. Some much lower free rent over the last few years. And now the market normalizes as at different pace in different places. It's coming back to a more normalized level as well.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Nick. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nVikram Malhotra: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So I guess just two parts. One, Chris could you just update us, sort of, your view on the, I think, $175 million. Of net absorption, sort of what you anticipate for the second half, and then, I guess. You also mentioned sort of the rolling rent growth projection. Could you expand upon that in context of your three year view that you provided at the Investor Day on occupancy and term NOI growth?\nChris Caton: Hi, Vikram. Thanks for the question. It's Chris. So as it relates to demand, just for those following along, net absorption in the first quarter was $26 million square feet, 27 million square feet. We have it at $43 million square feet in the second. And so, we expect 40 to 50 million square feet in net absorption. I think that's the tone that Tim had in his script and that we have here on the call for you. That'll leave - us with a full year net absorption on 160 million to 170 million square feet. Tim's going to take the rest.\nTim Arndt: Yes, Vikram, in terms of the three years, the way we think about that, we clearly have an environment now where the window of time that, we think about the three years in has shifted. We've highlighted that we think rents are going to continue to fall modestly in the coming 12 months, grow thereafter. But the time that is then left, to measure up to the end of 2026 has, of course, been shortened. If we look at that same period, the end of 2023 to the end of 2026, our sense is that rents are going to be flat then, to modestly positive over that entire period. But we would couch that as rent that's really been deferred, that the window's moving and not ultimately lost.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes, one other perspective I might provide to you is that the big change since our 4% to 6% three-year forecast, has actually been in concessions. So those concessions have, I mean, in other words, if you had two forecasts, one for asking rents and one for effective rents, the effective rent one has been affected more since our Investor Day when we laid out that assumption. Not all of it. The face rents have come down in Southern California, certainly, but most of it has been expansion in the concessions. And we see those burning off over the next 12 months as markets come into, even the weaker markets come into balance. Just to give you a sense of something that Chris mentioned before, Southern California accounts for about 23% of our rents over the next 12 months. What we categorize as sort of the weakest market, are another 21% of our rental profile for the next 12 months. And only 56% of the rents rolling over in the next 12 months are in stable or healthy markets. So, this is really a Southern California problem where it's both an expansion in concessions and a reduction in face rent. Fortunately, and this is really important. Southern California is the market with the largest mark-to-market in the next 12 months, even with the declines that we're projecting. So there is pretty good downside protection, in fact, upside protection, if there's such a word, on those expiring rents in Southern California. So, ironically, the weakest markets have the most mark-to-market, certainly in the near term.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Vikram. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the occupancy trajectory for the remainder of this year. At NAREIT, there was some discussion that this would dip below 96% in the near term and then recover. Is that still on the table, or are you now past that risk given the end of the quarter at 96.4%?\nHamid Moghadam: Thanks, John. And I realize this was also Blaine's question that I missed earlier, so thanks for coming back to it. The 96% comment was very specific about where we thought the second quarter was going to land. I would say that the year-to-date average that we have so far, we're around 96.6% year-to-date. The midpoint of our guidance is 96.25%. That just reflects some tougher roll and so a little bit longer lease-up time that we see in new leasing. I hope it's conservative. I suppose there's that possibility, but we feel good about the range that we've established.\nChris Caton: One other way of - and I think this was in Tim's prepared remarks. I think the quality of the portfolio manifests itself in two ways. It manifests itself in terms of a premium in occupancy, which if anything has expanded in this market environment, because when markets are really tight, people don't have a choice. They can't be picky about the quality of space. Pretty much everything leases. But as markets get more normalized, softer in some cases, business goes towards the higher quality businesses. So it's hard to predict the absolute level of occupancy, certainly quarter-by-quarter, because one or two leases, even as large as our portfolio is, can really move around the numbers. But I can tell you our premium, I'm very confident of our premium in occupancy, compared to the rest of the market. I think it's going to expand even further.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, John. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nVince Tibone: Hi, good morning. Cap allocation guidance implies an acceleration of starts in the back half of the year. Are these all mostly planned logistics starts, or are there some data centers in there as well? And related to all this, kind of what markets would you be comfortable starting a spec project today in the current environment?\nDan Letter: Vince, hi, it's Dan. Thanks for the question. So I think, well, first of all, your question around what's in our start volume. That is entirely logistics that you see there. And the better way to think about where we're going to build, is look at the sheer amount of opportunities we have. We have $40 billion worth of opportunities in dozens of markets around the world. We've raised the bar on spec. We take it through a rigorous process, pay attention to the market fundamentals, and look at every deal on a deal-by-deal basis. So, we have many markets around the world that we'll be building in this year. And I think decisions that we make, on a deal-by-deal basis may change between now and when we start. So it's hard to peg anything, certainly, right now.\nHamid Moghadam: But if you're asking for specific names of markets, I would say Mexico is super strong. Nashville, Houston, the Southeast, pretty strong and demand there. Northern Europe is very strong. So those are the places you're most likely to see spec development starts.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Vince. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to talk about your data center business. Given the updates you provided, at least from outside looking in, it seems like you're ahead of your five-year plan for three gigawatts of deployment. I'm not sure if that's correct, but maybe you can just comment on incremental changes in demand you're seeing in that business?\nHamid Moghadam: We are more optimistic about our data center business, since the time of our Investor Day. I think where some of those numbers come from, Ki Bin. Part of it is, we've done some excellent recruiting in terms of specialists in the sector that, have joined the team and are very excited. And secondly, the energy team that we have, the renewable energy team that we have, has excellent relationships with utilities. And that's something that oftentimes is missing, in a lot of data center companies that have just got the real estate component. And obviously we know the five hyperscalers really well. And in this environment, the ability to finance and deliver and execute becomes super important. These are mission critical deployments for these companies. And it is increasingly difficult for private players that don't have a balance sheet, to compete in that market. So, we think the competitive position for a lot just both, because of talent and balance sheet, are just going to get better and better going forward.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Ki Bin. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Mueller: Yes, hi. Where do you think we are in terms of 3PLs resetting their footprints?\nHamid Moghadam: Hi, Mike. Thanks for the question. So the 3PL market is really an interesting dynamic right now. What we're seeing is certainly slack in the system, more acute in Southern California, where there are simply just more 3PLs, almost double the average across the U.S. And that's where they took up a lot more space during COVID. Now, you can't deliver for a customer in a market that you don't have space. And a lot of the excess space that 3PLs have, is scattered throughout their networks. By way of example, one of our top 25 customers came to us recently and said, we have six to seven percent excess space in our network. Yet a 750,000 square foot need emerged in a major market, which led to a long-term, very large lease for us.\nChris Caton: Yes, one way to think about the 3PL market is this, that 3PLs basically serve two purposes. Some 3PL business and volume comes from players that just want to outsource that activity to somebody else, because they want to focus on their own business. And what I consider that to be base-load business, it doesn't act any differently than leases that are directly entered into by those companies, those principles. Then there is sort of the surge component of 3PLs. That is the component that is likely to be more volatile. On the way down, when markets are becoming softer, you expect that component, to actually suffer more. And when the markets are in the upswing, that's where you see the excess activity. The base part stays pretty consistent, with the rest of the portfolio. Southern California, to be specific, has in the low 30% range, in terms of 3PL share of the business. Now, a lot of that is base-load business, but some of it is search business. Versus the average of the U.S., which is about 18% of the total portfolio, is leased by 3PLs. So obviously those markets with bigger exposure to 3PLs have more of this problem on the search component.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Mike. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You continue to remain confident on the intermediate term outlook, particularly on the demand side. So maybe just to sum everything up that we've heard already today, what evidence do you see today that gets you excited? And then can you kind of walk us through, how you see the timing of the recovery playing out? Thanks.\nHamid Moghadam: Look, predicting market cycles, particularly when you've got a couple of wars going on, you've got a Fed that's at an inflection point, with respect to interest rates. And you've got a Presidential election coming up, which is, obviously with the events of this weekend, and are that are highly volatile. You've got three major things going on. And to the extent that you're asking us for very specific forecasts. Let me tell you, we're not that good. And you should know that. But what gives us confidence? We can argue whether the full recovery of the market is six months or 12 months or 18 months. I frankly think this is just my sense, having done this for 40 years that, the Southern California markets that are the softest are going to stabilize the latest in about 12 months out. And the other soft markets are a matter of between now and 12 months. And more than half the markets are actually, they don't need to recover, because they've never unrecovered. They've been going straight up. So, I think you're talking about the next 12 months as various markets sort of turn the corner. If I were going to pick a number, and I think if you kind of get your head into January of next year. The Presidential uncertainty will be gone. I'm pretty sure that the Fed uncertainty will be gone. So, we'll be down to the political starts. And what we know for a fact, which is not a prediction, is that start volume is very low. And replacement costs have continued to go up. Construction costs have moderated, but exactions on land and approvals and entitlements, those continue to go up. So, I'm super confident about the long-term, strength of our business. And calling it over quarters or even couple of quarters is really difficult, but if you want an answer, you have it.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Michael. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nTodd Thomas: Hi, thanks. Hamid, just following up on that a little bit, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on another maybe uncertain item, the potential impact tariffs might have on trade and industrial real estate in the U.S. And just, whether conversations you're having today with tenants, or prospective tenants might be impacted as a result. And really, does that change anything, potentially, how you think about allocating capital globally?\nHamid Moghadam: Yes, that's a really good question. So, first of all, I think there's a race between both parties on tariffs. So, I'm not sure which outcome is going to lead to more tariffs. Probably the Trump outcome, which is a higher probability at this point, is going to lead to more tariffs, specifically on China. But at the end of the day, I think what you need to remember is that we are in supporting the consumption side of the supply chain. We've never focused on the production end of the supply chain. So the same amount of goods, volume of goods, needs to get - consumed in these markets. With respect to specific tariffs on China, all that business as part of China Plus One strategy of a lot of suppliers has already moved to other markets. Most of them are in Asia. A lot of them are in Southeast Asia. Some of it has shifted over to Mexico, particularly on the Northern border. But at the end of the day, they're going to get consumed where the people are in the U.S. So, we don't see a radical demand shift between markets or in terms of overall need for our kind of product. So that's the main driver. The second order effect is, to the extent there are tariffs, Economics 101, you're going to have higher inflation and that could cause the Fed to relax slower. And that will have obviously a headwind effect on the overall economy, which in turn will affect demand for industrial real estate, and everything else. So, I'm not worried at all about the primary effect, the direct effect of China, the way people think about this China-LA connection, and the fact that that's somehow going to be under pressure, because the containers are going to land in LA. We don't really care where they come from. But the second order effect, which most people don't think about, I think is kind of important. But, that will be a problem in everybody's earnings calls if it were to materialize.\nJustin Meng: Thank you, Todd. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question.\nNicholas Yulico: Oh, yes. Hi, thanks. You talked earlier about the transaction market pricing improving. Can you relate that to the strategic capital revenue? How should we think about kind of where the funds are valued right now, whether there could be upside potential revenue for that versus on the fund flow side, what you're seeing?\nHamid Moghadam: On our fund valuation, I can confidently tell you that we have turned the corner in both U.S. and Europe. We were early adjusting our values, and I think we're now on the good side of the cycle. I think in a lot of other people's funds, they've been dragging their feet in adjusting the real values part of it - parts of, some of it intentionally and some of it not intentionally, because the appraisers are always backward-looking. And until there's data and it takes time for data to reflect itself in the comp set, those values haven't adjusted. So I think the market will continue to experience the decline in values that really occurred six, nine, 12 months ago, but are just now being acknowledged. I think we've already passed that, and our funds will be going up in values, because of a more direct link between our valuation process which is, by the way, independent. That's really important to also understand. A lot of these funds don't do independent appraisals and others. So you may hear mixed messages on that, and that's just, because we've been ahead of the curve. As to the second part of your question, which is fund flows into industrial real estate, there is a tremendous amount of money that has been raised and not spent in acquisitions and by investment managers. And my experience tells me that that money is going to get spent. And so, I think that's going to be the source of capital for a lot of transactions going forward. In terms of new allocations to industrial real estate and everything else, remember these portfolios are under a lot of pressure, because they've had office buildings that have declined in value 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, which has been the biggest component of their portfolios. So, they're under pressure and they're looking for more liquidity as opposed to being in a front foot forward investing mode. So I think, the volume of new capital allocations to all kinds of real estate will be slow coming back, but it is on the upswing. It's just slower coming back then most other cycles.\nJustin Meng: All right. So I think that was the last question. Thank you again for your interest in the company and everybody enjoy the rest of the summer. We'll see you pretty soon hopefully at Groundbreakers. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Chris Caton",
            "content": "All right. Thanks for the question. It's Chris. I'll start with the geographies. The healthiest part in the U.S. is the southeastern US. But I'd also really point out. Latin America as well as Europe as being areas that are a boost to the overall global picture as it relates to size categories the story remains the same relative to what we discussed on our last earnings call, which is to say sizes above 100, maybe even certainly over 250, and 500, that's where demand momentum is the best, but there's also more availability there. Demand is stable below 100, but that's where vacancies are especially low. Hi, Vikram. Thanks for the question. It's Chris. So as it relates to demand, just for those following along, net absorption in the first quarter was $26 million square feet, 27 million square feet. We have it at $43 million square feet in the second. And so, we expect 40 to 50 million square feet in net absorption. I think that's the tone that Tim had in his script and that we have here on the call for you. That'll leave - us with a full year net absorption on 160 million to 170 million square feet. Tim's going to take the rest. One other way of - and I think this was in Tim's prepared remarks. I think the quality of the portfolio manifests itself in two ways. It manifests itself in terms of a premium in occupancy, which if anything has expanded in this market environment, because when markets are really tight, people don't have a choice. They can't be picky about the quality of space. Pretty much everything leases. But as markets get more normalized, softer in some cases, business goes towards the higher quality businesses. So it's hard to predict the absolute level of occupancy, certainly quarter-by-quarter, because one or two leases, even as large as our portfolio is, can really move around the numbers. But I can tell you our premium, I'm very confident of our premium in occupancy, compared to the rest of the market. I think it's going to expand even further. Yes, one way to think about the 3PL market is this, that 3PLs basically serve two purposes. Some 3PL business and volume comes from players that just want to outsource that activity to somebody else, because they want to focus on their own business. And what I consider that to be base-load business, it doesn't act any differently than leases that are directly entered into by those companies, those principles. Then there is sort of the surge component of 3PLs. That is the component that is likely to be more volatile.

The base part stays pretty consistent, with the rest of the portfolio. Southern California, to be specific, has in the low 30% range, in terms of 3PL share of the business. Now, a lot of that is base-load business, but some of it is search business. Versus the average of the U.S., which is about 18% of the total portfolio, is leased by 3PLs. So obviously those markets with bigger exposure to 3PLs have more of this problem on the search component."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Hamid Moghadam",
            "content": "Yes, the other thing I would add to that, Caitlin, is that you have closed end funds that are coming to the end of their lives, and those portfolios need to be liquidated. And the investors generally because of what's going on in their portfolio not just in real estate, but also in other private asset classes need liquidity because they have outstanding commitment. So there's pressure from those guys to realize these sales and industrial real estate has been one of the places that their performance has been really great and crystallization of those values is important. So it's a natural course of things. And you have some deferred sales volume. That was put on suspended animation for the last 24 months. That's now coming through. But generally, I would say the transaction market is very good right now, with multiple offers for good portfolios and the sweet spot is a couple of $200 million, I would say. Not mega deals and not timing deals, but sort of in the $100 million $200 million range. Yes, one other perspective I might provide to you is that the big change since our 4% to 6% three-year forecast, has actually been in concessions. So those concessions have, I mean, in other words, if you had two forecasts, one for asking rents and one for effective rents, the effective rent one has been affected more since our Investor Day when we laid out that assumption. Not all of it. The face rents have come down in Southern California, certainly, but most of it has been expansion in the concessions. And we see those burning off over the next 12 months as markets come into, even the weaker markets come into balance. Just to give you a sense of something that Chris mentioned before, Southern California accounts for about 23% of our rents over the next 12 months. What we categorize as sort of the weakest market, are another 21% of our rental profile for the next 12 months. And only 56% of the rents rolling over in the next 12 months are in stable or healthy markets. So, this is really a Southern California problem where it's both an expansion in concessions and a reduction in face rent. Fortunately, and this is really important. Southern California is the market with the largest mark-to-market in the next 12 months, even with the declines that we're projecting. So there is pretty good downside protection, in fact, upside protection, if there's such a word, on those expiring rents in Southern California. So, ironically, the weakest markets have the most mark-to-market, certainly in the near term. Thanks, John. And I realize this was also Blaine's question that I missed earlier, so thanks for coming back to it. The 96% comment was very specific about where we thought the second quarter was going to land. I would say that the year-to-date average that we have so far, we're around 96.6% year-to-date. The midpoint of our guidance is 96.25%. That just reflects some tougher roll and so a little bit longer lease-up time that we see in new leasing. I hope it's conservative. I suppose there's that possibility, but we feel good about the range that we've established. But if you're asking for specific names of markets, I would say Mexico is super strong. Nashville, Houston, the Southeast, pretty strong and demand there. Northern Europe is very strong. So those are the places you're most likely to see spec development starts. We are more optimistic about our data center business, since the time of our Investor Day. I think where some of those numbers come from, Ki Bin. Part of it is, we've done some excellent recruiting in terms of specialists in the sector that, have joined the team and are very excited. And secondly, the energy team that we have, the renewable energy team that we have, has excellent relationships with utilities. And that's something that oftentimes is missing, in a lot of data center companies that have just got the real estate component. And obviously we know the five hyperscalers really well. And in this environment, the ability to finance and deliver and execute becomes super important. These are mission critical deployments for these companies. And it is increasingly difficult for private players that don't have a balance sheet, to compete in that market.

            "name": "Tim Arndt",
            "content": "Thank you, Justin, and thank you all for joining our call. We had solid execution against our second quarter plan, which showed improvement over the first quarter, underpinned by a pickup in overall market activity. In fact, we leased 52 million square feet in our portfolio, a 27% increase over the first quarter and one of our highest quarters in the past few years. This helped in delivering occupancy, which outperformed our forecast and more importantly at rent change well over 70%. This was achieved in an environment where decision making has remained slow as many customers optimize existing footprints before committing to new space. As a result, we expect many property owners to continue to prioritize occupancy in select markets with higher availability, keeping pressure on rents. That said, the bright spot continues to be the depletion of the supply pipeline and successive quarters of very low development starts. We believe we are near peak vacancy and this dearth of new supply is setting the stage for more favorable conditions in 2025. As evidenced by very strong rent change this quarter, our lease mark-to-market is serving to sustain meaningful growth through this transition. In terms of results for the quarter, core FFO, excluding promotes, was $1.36 per share and including net promote expense was $1.34 per share. We earned promote revenue within our FIBRA vehicle in Mexico, marking the seventh year of such achievements since its IPO and speaking to the high quality of our portfolio and team in that market. Global occupancy at our share ended the quarter at 96.5%. Our U.S. portfolio continues to outperform the market by over 320 basis points, a meaningful spread that has widened from our historic norm of roughly 175 basis points. As vacancy normalizes in our markets, we expect this flight to quality to continue. We crystallized $100 million of our lease mark to market during the quarter. As of June, we estimate that the net effective market rents are 42% above in-place rents, representing $2 billion of potential NOI. Over 40% of the decline in our lease mark to market ratio is due to this quarter's mark-to-market capture. Net effective rent change was nearly 74% based on commencement and is 64% based on new signings. This metric can be volatile between quarters due to mix, but we continue to expect full year net effective rent change to be above 70%, illustrating the outsized mark to market opportunity that will remain in the near and intermediate term. Our same-store growth was 7.2% on a cash basis, 5.5% on a net effective basis, each strong despite the impact of over 100 basis points of decline in average occupancy year over year, as well as the effect of fair value lease adjustments on net effective growth from the Duke acquisition. We deployed over $700 million into new development projects and acquisitions during the quarter and also closed on over $1 billion in dispositions and contributions at values exceeding our initial expectations. We continue to grow our solar energy business with the installed capacity of our operating portfolio now at 524 megawatts, with an additional 134 megawatts currently under construction, the total of which will generate approximately $55 million of NOI once stabilized in line with our forecast. Finally, we raised $1.2 billion of debt across our balance sheet and funds at a weighted average rate of 4.4% and a term of 11 years. Outside of this total, we also launched our $1 billion commercial paper program, which has thus far saved an average of 60 basis points on our short-term borrowing costs in the U.S. In terms of our markets, there are several encouraging signs for demand, including port volumes on both the East and West Coast, as well as increased volume of proposal activity we've seen across our portfolio. While overall leasing has increased since the first quarter, the tone of our conversations with customers warrants continued caution in the near term. Even though space utilization sits at near a normal range, approximately 85%, we find that many customers simply lack urgency, still prioritizing cost containment in light of an uncertain economic and political environment, both of which will be clearer soon. In the meantime, development starts remain muted and below pre-COVID levels. Quarterly completions peaked last year at 140 million square feet and are projected to approach 50 million square feet by the fourth quarter of this year. We estimate vacancies in our U.S. and European markets will peak over the next few quarters, likely creating a shift in tone as customers assess the requirements heading into 2025. Until then, rent growth will be anemic in most markets and down modestly in some. Southern California remains its own story, where demand remains sluggish and vacancy continues to drift higher. While we've observed some green shoots over the last 90 days, we expect soft conditions to persist over the next 12 months. Globally, we estimate that effective market rents declined 2% during the quarter, with 75% of the decline attributed to SoCal. Because there is so much conflicting data available to investors, it's worth mentioning that we measure market rent growth by evaluating effective rents achieved, not asking rents before concessions, a difference that can be as wide as 5% to 10%. We'd summarize by highlighting that most of the puts and takes across our global portfolio have provided conditions that are largely stable with reason for intermediate-term optimism due to several quarters of low starts and subdued but positive demand. Turning to capital markets. Value saw modest increases in the second quarter for our U.S. and European funds. There's greater depth amongst buyers of logistics properties and lenders are more active, together reducing yield requirements. In particular, buyer pools for well-located core product are growing now with multiple bidders back in the mix. We saw this very clearly in a large portfolio sale we closed this quarter, which was originally brought to the market last fall. Interest was reasonable at the time, but we felt pricing was off, elected to wait, and achieved 28% higher value in the end. I'd like to provide a brief update on our data center business, where we are having very good momentum across our pipeline. As you know, access to power is the key to unlocking value, and our dedicated energy and sustainability teams are leveraging our expertise in net-zero carbon solutions, solar generation, and battery storage to ensure that we're in the pole position with all of the major utilities. To date, we have secured 1.3 gigawatts of power. Of this, 450 megawatts is currently under construction in $1.2 billion of TEI. 300 megawatts is in active pre-development with an expected $700 million of TEI, leaving 550 megawatts as available and currently undergoing build-to-suit discussions. Beyond all of this, we are also in advanced stages of procurement for an additional 1.5 gigawatts, which is key to delivering on our five-year outlook for $7 billion to $8 billion of total data center investment. Overall, we've made significant progress growing this business and are optimistic about the targets we laid out at our Investor Day. Turning to guidance. We are making few changes as the year is playing out to our expectations. As such, we're maintaining our forecast for average occupancy, same-store, G&A, development starts, and stabilizations. There are only a few small changes otherwise. We are lowering our guidance for strategic capital revenue by $10 million only to account for the impact of FX rates, which are hedged elsewhere under P&L and will not affect overall earnings. Due to the increased activity we're seeing in the capital markets and deals completed year-to-date, we are increasing our acquisitions guidance to a new range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion and similarly increasing our guidance for overall dispositions and contributions to a range of $2.75 billion to $3.65 billion. Ultimately, we are increasing our GAAP earnings to a range of $3.25 to $3.45 per share. Core FFO excluding net promote expense will range between $5.46 and $5.54 per share, while core FFO including promotes will range from $5.39 to $5.47 per share, a slight increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance attributed to the FIBRA promote. Our core earnings guidance calls for nearly 8% growth at the midpoint, which ranks in the 87th percentile of S&P 500 REITs. We've been unique in our ability to generate leading growth over a long period of time, not only through a superior business model and portfolio, but also from our commitment to leveraging all that comes from our scale, including adjacent verticals strategic to our core business. Our focus is simply to continue to deliver on this industry-leading and durable growth. As we close, I'd also like to highlight an upcoming event, our annual GROUNDBREAKERS Thought Leadership Forum on October 2nd in London. The program is taking shape as our best yet, exploring the surprising intersection of logistics and health, energy, and even fashion. Additional information for the forum is available on our website, and we hope to see you there or online. With that, I'll hand the call back to the operator for your questions. Hi, Blaine, it's Tim. I'll start with the first part, and I may ask you to repeat the second. I'm not sure if I understood the question. But coming into the first few weeks of the third quarter, I think we are maintaining the momentum that I guess you're inferring was picked up between NAREIT and the end of the quarter, which is that proposal activity is strong, leasing activity is strong. We see it more in renewals, a little less so in new leasing. We're achieving our rents outside of the drag that we discussed in SoCal just continues to be the market that we watch most. But I think when I put that all together, what we think is we're pleased to see the way the second quarter executed. I think it executed pretty much precisely as we expected from our discussion 90 days ago and feel good about the year. Hi, Ron, thanks for the question. It's Tim. Yes, and let me start. I'll. Just reemphasize we're talking about effective rents here from all the distortion we see out there in quotation method. So this is ultimately taking rents incorporating in all concessions starting with the next 12 months. I'll do it that way, as we've described we would. We talked about at NAREIT, we basically would divide our portfolio into SoCal as its own special case and then everything else. And within everything else, there are strong, stable and weak markets, and I would put all of those other non-SoCal markets around flat. Maybe modestly negative on market rent growth over the next 12 months which is a long way of saying it's really going to be a function of what do we think SoCal does in the next 12 months when we put that all together, inclusive? Of SoCal, we would probably put that. In a range of something like 2% to possibly 5% down in the next 12 months before inflecting. And this is a good place to just remind everybody that even in light of that, I mean, we've had three quarters now of some negative market rent growth, 1% down in the fourth quarter of last year, 1% down in the first quarter, 2% down, this last second quarter. In the meantime, we're putting up very significant rent change. And growth within our NOI 74%, one of our highest quarters. Just this last quarter. So it's very fortuitous the position we're in where we have this large lease mark to market carry us through this transition period. It is. And thanks, Steve. The chart that you're looking at in the supplemental is new leasing, just to be clear. And you highlight something that I'm glad you did. We do see the very big uptick in nominal proposals, 112 million square feet, meaningfully above where we've been. That's a function of a few things. One is just more space to lease. We have some increased vacancy in the portfolio. And this is also a function of just how the next 12 months of overall looks. And there's a little bit more there as well. This is why we added, for those who've noticed, a new line just this quarter, which puts that proposal activity in the context of what is available to lease. You see that measured 42% this last quarter, which we would characterize, and you can see when you look at the chart, as normal. Sure. Nick. Thanks. On the retention front, we typically forecast between 70% and 80%. Think of it as 75, and that's a good number, and I would characterize that as our expectations over the coming several quarters and then free rent. I think we may have discussed this recently. I would view free rent as. Just reverting to mean levels. We had kind of is another area where we had some surge pricing, if you will. Some much lower free rent over the last few years. And now the market normalizes as at different pace in different places. It's coming back to a more normalized level as well. Yes, Vikram, in terms of the three years, the way we think about that, we clearly have an environment now where the window of time that, we think about the three years in has shifted. We've highlighted that we think rents are going to continue to fall modestly in the coming 12 months, grow thereafter. But the time that is then left, to measure up to the end of 2026 has, of course, been shortened. If we look at that same period, the end of 2023 to the end of 2026, our sense is that rents are going to be flat then, to modestly positive over that entire period. But we would couch that as rent that's really been deferred, that the window's moving and not ultimately lost."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Prologis First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Natasha Law, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Natasha. You may begin.\nNatasha Law: Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. The supplemental document is available on our website at prologis.com under Investor Relations. I'd like to state that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about the market and the industry in which Prologis operates, as well as management's beliefs and assumptions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance, and actual operating results may be affected by a variety of factors. For a list of those factors, please refer to the forward-looking statement notice in our 10-K or other SEC filings. Additionally, our first quarter earnings press release and supplemental do contain financial measures such as FFO and EBITDA that are non-GAAP. And in accordance with Reg G, we have provided a reconciliation to those measures. I'd like to welcome Tim Arndt, our CFO, who will cover results, real-time market conditions and guidance. Hamid Moghadam, our CEO, and our entire executive team are also with us today. With that, I will hand the call over to Tim.\nTim Arndt: Good morning and thank you for joining our call. We've had a good start to the year in terms of our operating and financial results in the first quarter. We delivered strong rent change, drove occupancy slightly ahead of our forecast, raised nearly $5 billion in capital, including $750 million in strategic capital, and made important headway in our Energy business. That said, as we evaluate the market, persistent inflation and high interest rates have kept more customers focused on controlling costs. The resulting delay in decision making, easily observed through the first quarter's below average net absorption, will translate to lower leasing volume within the year. Accordingly, we've opted to adjust our guidance early, getting ahead of what looks like a period of occupancy below our forecast in the near term and its effect on same store in a number of our higher rent markets. This is punctuated, of course, by a more pronounced period of correction still underway in Southern California. New starts, however, continues to be surprisingly disciplined, adding to the expectation for limited new supply in the back half of '24, but also extending deeper into '25. When considered alongside muted demand, we arrive at a view that the operating environment has only changed modestly in aggregate, and that demand is simply pushing out by a few quarters. The outcome of this may simply mean moving towards a long-term occupancy expectation more swiftly this year, which sets up for a better next year. Turning to our results for the quarter. Core FFO, excluding promotes, was $1.31 per share and including net promote expense was $1.28 per share, essentially in line with our forecast. Occupancy in the portfolio ended the quarter at 97%. For context, the US market declined 310 basis points since its peak in the summer of '22, while our portfolio's occupancy has only declined 80 basis points, resulting in vacancy today for Prologis that is less than half of that in our markets and reflective of our portfolio quality. Net effective rent change was 68% based on commencements and 70% based on new signings. Following this in-place increase and changes in market rents, our net effective lease mark-to-market stands at 50%, representing over $2.2 billion of rent to harvest without any additional market rent growth from here. Rent growth captured just for the single quarter was approximately $110 million on an annualized basis and at our share. Our same-store growth on a cash basis was 5.7% and on a net effective basis was 4.1%. The same-store from rent change alone was strong at approximately 9%, but is impacted by a 130 basis point change in year-over-year vacancy, as well as 150 basis points from fair value lease adjustments with the Duke portfolio's inclusion in our same-store pool. Additionally, there were approximately 175 basis points of items specific to the quarter, including one-time reconciling items from 2023, as well as unfavorable comps from low expenses last year. We started over $270 million of new developments in the quarter, bringing our portfolio to approximately $7.5 billion at our share, with estimated value creation of over $1.7 billion, a number we feel increasingly confident in with value stabilizing. In our Energy business, we've made meaningful progress on this year's deployment, including the signing of 405 megawatts of long-term storage-related contracts with investment-grade utilities. We also delivered the largest EV fleet charging project in the United States, less than 15 miles from both the ports of LA and Long beach. Finally, we raised $4.1 billion of debt across our balance sheet and funds at a weighted average rate of 4.7% and a term of 10 years. Our debt portfolio has an overall in-place rate of just 3.1%, with more than nine years of average remaining life and liquidity at the end of the quarter of over $5.8 billion. Turning to market conditions. Most broad economic data from unemployment to retail sales to the health of the consumer remain very strong. And while our tour proposal and other proprietary metrics are similarly positive, overall leasing activity and net absorption are running below expectations. Net absorption in the US, for example, was very low this quarter at just 27 million square feet. So while the macro landscape and supply chains continue to generate a need for space, we think it's prudent to expect continued headwinds on overall absorption over the next few quarters. The interest rate environment and its associated volatility have weighed on customer decision making, especially as the 10 year has increased 70 basis points from its level just 90 days ago and expectations for Fed rate cuts have moved from potentially six to now possibly zero. In parallel, sublease and space utilization rates highlight that some customers have available capacity, driven in part by the high rate of absorption through the pandemic. This dynamic of available space intersecting with the desire for cost containment is what leads to lower absorption and is playing out at different rates across submarkets and customers. For example, while slow leasing has persisted so far this year for less capitalized customers and 3PLs, we see a handful of large e-commerce and retail customers further along in this process, such as Amazon, who voiced caution two years ago, but is now active in several global markets and has openly discussed plans to commit to significant amounts of new space. The overall leasing slowdown is most felt in only a handful of markets. Southern California and the Inland Empire being the most acute. In fact, rents in most of our US markets are generally flat, several are up, and it is mainly elongated downtime affecting near-term occupancy and NOI. While Southern California leasing has been challenging, it has not slowed the tremendous uplift we realize every single quarter from rent change on rollover, which was 120% for the market in the first quarter, with the Inland Empire at 156%, nearly the highest in our portfolio. In Europe, rents grew overall during the quarter, which we believe will remain the case over the balance of the year. And of course, LATAM continues to impress with very high occupancy and market rent growth that has led the globe in recent quarters. Overall, global market rents declined slightly over 1% in the quarter, driven mostly by Southern California, and would have been slightly positive if excluded. I'd like to spend a moment on Baltimore, where we own over 18 million square feet and has been a dynamic market of ours for decades. Our employees, customers and properties are all safe following the bridge collapse last month and our customers expect to be able to withstand the disruption with little impact to their businesses. Shifting to capital markets. Valuations increased in all of our geographies, except for China, which saw a very small decline. Over the last 1.5 years, global values have decreased despite increases in cash flow due to cap rate expansion. As cap rates have stabilized, cash flow growth now has the ability to translate to value growth. Even though modest, the value uplift in the US and Europe are important as strategic capital investors have been looking for values to not only bottom, but actually turn upwards before committing new capital. With Europe a bit ahead of the US in this regard, it is indeed where we've seen stronger fund-raising interest in recent quarters. We also had a successful equity raise in FIBRA Prologis, raising over $500 million for deployment into both assets to be contributed from our balance sheet, as well as pursuits of third-party acquisitions. Transaction volumes and activity have ticked up in recent weeks and pricing has certainly improved. As always, we are actively looking at acquisition opportunities across all of our markets, but our focus remains on the development of our land bank, which provides an opportunity for over $38 billion of build out with a return on incremental capital of approximately 8.5%. In terms of guidance, in light of our views on demand and leasing pace in the coming quarters, we are reducing our average occupancy guidance to range between 95.75% and 96.75% of the 75 basis point adjustment from the midpoint. It's important to understand that approximately two-thirds of this change stems from our higher rent markets, meaning they create a disproportionate impact on same store in 2024. Same-store growth on a net effective basis will range between 5.5% and 6.5%, a reduction of 150 basis points, which accounts for the average occupancy decline, slightly lower rent change for the year as well as 30 basis points of annualized impact from the one-time items in the first quarter mentioned earlier. Our revised range on a cash basis is now 6.25% to 7.25%. We are maintaining our guidance for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes, to a range of $530 million to $550 million and reducing our G&A guidance to a range of $415 million to $430 million. We are adjusting development start guidance for the year to a revised range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion at our share, reflecting our discipline in speculative starts and the timing impact this has in the calendar year. As we've always said, we don't consider our guidance to be a target internally and each deal ultimately needs to be rational and accretive on its own. In the end, we are forecasting GAAP earnings to range between $3.15 per share and $3.35 per share. Core FFO, including net promote expense, will range between $5.37 per share and $5.47 per share, while core FFO, excluding promotes, will range from $5.45 per share to $5.55 per share. Our updated guidance calls for core earnings growth of nearly 8% at the midpoint. As we close out, I'd like to underscore the message of the call, which is that while we have only a modest change of view in the intermediate term, our confidence in the long term is intact. And putting timing aside, we are encouraged by the outlook for supply in the back half of this year and '25, have tremendous lease mark-to-market to harvest in the interim, and are pleased to see valuations, fundraising and transaction activity all picking up. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi. Good morning, everyone. It seems like, I guess, occupancy and maybe pricing are coming in a little lower than you had previously expected. So I was wondering, could you go through how much or what pieces might be more macro driven and how much is certain markets weighing on the outlook? Tim, you did mention how some of the high rent markets are having an outsize impact. So wondering if you could just go through what might be more macro versus market specific. Thanks.\nChris Caton: Hey, Caitlin. It's Chris Caton. I'll start by saying I think it's a combination of factors. For sure, as Tim described, Southern California and a handful of other high rent markets, the leasing velocity has been subdued and rent growth has been a little bit below expectations. So there is that softness. But we also want to point to a couple of quarters of deferred decision making leading aggregate customer demand across the United States to be a little bit below what we previously expected. The other thing I might add, Caitlin, would be just nominally in the sense of dollars and the impact in same store. We do see about half of our adjustments as coming from SoCal.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning out there. I guess, for Tim or Hamid, can you maybe just help kind of flush out sort of maybe the timing of when some of these things became a little bit more evident? I guess I'm thinking back to some of the conferences and the like in March, and my sense was the tone and concern about the business maybe wasn't as acute as it is right now. And I know you have confidence in the long term, but it sort of feels like there's a sea change in your outlook in maybe the last 30, maybe 45 days. So I guess, what is prompting that other than maybe saying hard data? But maybe just help flush out kind of the timing of this. And are there other factors at work here?\nTim Arndt: Steve, let me take a stab at that. If you are sensing any acute change in our outlook, you're not reading our call correctly. We have picked a three-year window, I think, in our Analyst Day to give you our expectations. And the first year of that window has moved around. So our outlook for the back period of second and third year essentially the same and could be even better given how much deferred demand is building up. If our proposals were down, if our tours were down, I would be more concerned. But companies are out looking at this space. And if you think nothing has changed in the last 45 or 90 days with respect to the Fed outlook, you must be reading different newspapers than I am. So I would tell you that people are just scared of pulling the trigger until the Fed gives the all clear sign with the first rate cut. So, yes, we are not instantaneous in our data transmission to us and to you, but I can assure you that you will always hear our views immediately as we form them and as we get them from the marketplace.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It sounds like demand has been pushed out or the rebound in demand has been pushed out of a few quarters. So I was wondering what evidence do you have that would support that? And then how do we compare that to some of the proprietary metrics that you put together, which seem to indicate that things are actually pretty positive or accelerating? Thank you.\nChris Caton: Hi, Michael. Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. As we've kind of covered in the script, and I think we are pointing out here, whether it's consumer resilience as revealed by economic indicators like the labor metrics or retail sales, whether you look at our own customers and supply chain momentum as revealed by our RBI volumes through the ports and our proposal volumes. The broader economy is generating a normal amount of demand. A couple of things to consider though. One is as you can see in utilization data and in sublease space, some customers have spare capacity that they are utilizing to accommodate some of this growth. We also have these leading indicators. We needed to simply see customers convert space requirements into signed leases. So just the simple conversion of investigation into signed leasing. And indeed, we already are seeing the front edge of some leading global e-commerce companies and other retailers begin to make space. It's just not broadly yet occurring across the whole marketplace.\nTim Arndt: Yeah. The only thing I would add to that is that the effect is not uniform in all markets. And I think what's going on -- and this is a theory. This is not a fact. It's a theory, but it's based on 40 years of looking at this stuff. Southern California has over 30% share for 3PLs and the rest of the US market has a little under 20% share of 3PLs. 3PLs are serve two purposes. One, they provide outsourcing of for logistic activities, but they also create surge space. In other words, companies use 3PLs as a way of flexing up and down. So markets that have a bigger exposure to 3PLs are likely to feel the impacts of shifts in sentiment sooner than other markets on the way down and on the way up. Also, there are certain customers who have instantaneous access to sales data and activity. And I would say the e-commerce players, the big ones, have the best data on that, because they see the trends on a daily minute-by-minute basis. Those guys were early in terms of curtailing their demand. And I got to tell you, they're out there pretty aggressively and don't listen to what we say, listen to what they say in their own annual reports, in their own interviews with the press. And I think you'll see that they feel pretty confident about their business and they're a bit ahead of the curve. Now, all of this is subject to missiles not flying in the Middle East and the Fed not going crazy and God knows what else can happen in this world. So but as far as we see, the indications are really good. And this certainly does not feel like any of the other downturns that I've been part of. So again the word huge sounds a little bit of an overreaction to me.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Mailman: Hey guys. Maybe coming at this from another way, and Hamid, I know you don't like the word acute, but maybe this seems a little bit more preemptive, because if you guys are seeing a lot of the metrics in line with your budget, retention was kind of in line with where you guys have been the last couple of quarters. It feels like this is an anticipation of maybe slower takedowns that you're seeing. I mean, is there anything else on the expiration side of the equation that you guys have a couple bigger known move outs now that are going to skew numbers? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of this is actually what you're seeing real time versus just giving yourself a little bit of cushion so that you don't have to kind of readjust later in the year. And also, just a question on development. How much of this kind of occupancy decline is just developments coming out a little bit less leased than maybe you had thought? A couple of months ago, we noticed your development margins were pretty -- were single-digit this quarter. I don't remember the last time I've seen that. And is that a reflection of this? Or is there something else going on as well?\nTim Arndt: Okay. Let me start that, and then I'll turn it over to Chris and then to Dan to talk about development margins specifically. We like to be early and thoughtful in outlooks that we share with you, and we've always prided ourselves in doing that. And in some cases in the past, as you know, you've been following us for a long time, we've taken pretty bold statements on the way up and on the way down and actually been proven pretty right about it. So for us to be late on this stuff is not something that we look forward to. So we always try to be on the lookout for trends that may be interesting to our investors and to you, who are looking at our company on a real-time basis. So I'm not smart enough to assign percentages of how much of this is preemptive and how much of it is. But I can tell you there's nothing going on in the portfolio. There's not some news embedded deep in our customer behavior or some market that we're not sharing with you. This is just looking at the tone of the marketplace and sharing with you what we see playing out in the next two to three quarters, nothing beyond that. And the outlook for the long term is very much the same as it was before. Dan, do you want to talk about the margins?\nDan Letter: Yeah. The margins this quarter, it's actually an isolated event here. We had about 15, 17 projects stabilized. We had one project that just had a confluence of events take place, whether it be weather, some infrastructure, municipal requirements. And it just came in at a pretty negative margin, weighing down the overall average margin for the quarter. If you pull that out, our margin for the quarter would actually be more reasonable 15%, 16%.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nCamille Bonnel: Hi. Hamid, you mentioned how the company likes to be early on calling things, but I noticed that you only updated your outlook on operations and guidance. So can you help us understand how conservative guidance levels are? Or could we see more downward revisions, for example, if you start to pull back on the capital deployment front? Thank you.\nHamid Moghadam: Well, on capital deployment specifically, you may remember that I'm always saying the only reason we provide guidance is because you ask us. We actually don't have a budget or a plan for deploying capital. We look at every investment opportunity one at a time. So all our elements of our guidance. And this doesn't go for just this period. It goes for any period. I would take that one with a grain of salt. We are not afraid to deploy a lot more or a lot less capital if the market conditions warrant it. With respect to conservatism, I would say, we call it as close to the pin as we can get it with a very slight bit of conservative. Not a lot, just a bit. So that, in the majority of the cases, we are pretty confident of what we are saying, but we are not 100% confident. There could be downside beyond that. But I would say we try to call it as we see it and be careful that we don't -- we don't want to disappoint 50% of the time, which is really calling it right on the pin. We'd like to be a little more conservative than that. Now, we don't always get it right. So let's admit that.\nTim Arndt: And Camille, it's Tim, I might build on your first -- the first part of your question as well, which is that at prevailing cap rates and the cost of debt and everything else, there's very little you could actually do in deployment in the year to affect earnings in year one or two. I find that deployment changes tend to have kind of a push effect on earnings. So you should probably have that in your thinking as you watch our guidance.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Nikita Bely with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nNikita Bely: Good morning, guys. The $150 million of other real estate investments. Curious, what exactly was that on the sales? And maybe also, if you could talk about the reduction in development starts. So any color on that, geographic focus or spec or something else?\nHamid Moghadam: That's basically -- the $150 million is some non-core assets. And we could not hear the second part of your question. Could you repeat that?\nNikita Bely: Reduction in development starts for this year. Any additional information you could provide on what drove that, whether it was geographic based or asset specific or built-to-suit pullback?\nDan Letter: Yeah. Thanks. This is Dan. I'll -- I got a couple of thoughts on that point there around development starts. We adjusted our guidance on development consistent with the adjustment in the occupancy and the operating pool. So as we see demand shifting out, we just expect that we are going to start fewer buildings. We reduced it by about $0.5 billion. That's about half build-to-suit, half spec. We are raising the bar on spec. As Hamid said earlier, we put that guidance out there because you ask for it. We don't need to start these projects. We own the land. We have $38 billion worth of opportunity embedded in that land bank. We have entitlements. We have the teams. They're all geared up, ready to start. We can literally pull the trigger on $10 billion, $12 billion of that tomorrow. So we just look at that. We are just trying to be consistent and tie it to our overall outlook on demand. And there's no particular location or otherwise that we -- that drag that down.\nHamid Moghadam: Yeah. And the only thing I would add to that is that even though we made the adjustment on both the built-to-suit and the spec part, the bias is greater on the spec part. We actually feel pretty good about our built-to-suit volume going forward. So it's really the spec which is discretionary, and we can, as Dan said, write that at any time.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nBlaine Heck: Great. Thanks. So you've called out Southern California as being soft again. Can you just talk about any specific segments of the market that are particularly weak whether that's by submarket or size? And what makes you confident in the recovery even as it seems it might be delayed kind of relative to your original expectations? And secondly, just curious if you can expand on which other high-rent markets might be weighing on the outlook. Thanks.\nChris Caton: Hey, Blaine, it's Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. So Southern California is a market that continues to soften, vacancy rates are continuing to rise, yes, after different submarkets. The softest area of Southern California is midsized and smaller units in the Inland Empire. The strongest area is probably Orange County. And Los Angeles, while subdued, has a 4% market vacancy rate, so as demand comes into that marketplace, bear in mind, demand has been negative over the last year, a very rare occurrence, as demand comes back in that marketplace, you're likely to see the vacancy rate make a difference in Los Angeles as well. In terms of other markets where we're watchful, the soft markets in the US include New Jersey, Seattle and Savannah.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. The other thing I would say about Southern California is that don't discount the effect of the port labor issue that was resolved. That took longer, a lot longer than most people thought. And that affects a lot of the people -- a lot of the users in the South Bay immediately adjacent to the ports and the like. So that market can get tight real quick if that port volume comes back. I think that the small to medium spaces in the Inland Empire are kind of a mismatch. They're, by and large, the older buildings that were built there when the market was not really designed for the big 500,000 million square foot buildings. And those are -- somebody who wants a lot of space has to go to the Inland Empire. Somebody who wants 100,000 to 200,000 feet has more choices. So that's where the softness is in the Inland Empire.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nVince Tibone: Hi. Good morning. Could you discuss the markets of relative strength in your portfolio in terms of demand and market rents? And also, are you seeing any different levels of demand by building size, more broadly? We noticed that occupancy fell the most on a sequential basis, for buildings less than 100,000 square feet, but actually grew for buildings 250,000 to 500,000. So just curious if those trends on occupancy are kind of a fair representation of the demand profile today.\nChris Caton: Hi, Vince. It's Chris Caton here. So first, in terms of strength, there is a wide range. And speaking of the benefits of diversity, the strongest markets in the world include Mexico, Texas, parts of the Southeast US, Pennsylvania, but also looking out to the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil, Toronto as well, as a strong market. You also have stable markets, Chicago, Southern Florida, Baltimore, D.C. And then really at Southern California alone is really the main weak market. So that would be the range. In terms of size categories, what you see -- what you hear in the marketplace in terms of tours and, in fact, some leases that are getting made, is there's a bit more activity, particularly among self-performing e-com and retailers at the larger end of the spectrum. That would be the main, I'd say, new news in the last 90 days.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ki Bin Kim with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question\nKi Bin Kim: Thanks and good morning. So going back to your comments about the softer environment. I'm curious if you've seen any changes in CapEx or concessions that might be -- that might not be so apparent in the headline face rents. And second question, going back to your comments on strategic capital. Where do you think cap rates are selling out at for good assets and good markets? And does that change your view on the level of contributions that you might make going forward? Thank you.\nTim Arndt: Hey, Ki Bin, it's Tim. I'll take the front half of your question just on free rent. We have seen an increase in free rent. I think what's important to remember there is we've had exceedingly low amounts of free rent granted in the last few years. And I would say the current rates that we've seen in this last quarter, and what we're bracing forward this year, would still not really be on par with long-term averages. I would say that concession is not fully back to normal. But it is turning up logically in this environment.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. In terms of where deals are being priced out, I would say nine months ago, a year ago, there was very little activity, and we were pricing deals in good markets in the US in the low nine IRRs, albeit not much was happening at those kinds of return expectations. Today, I would say those are 100 basis points lower and there's a lot more volume in that a lot of transactions happening in the marketplace in the low 8s. Europe, that number -- those numbers would be in the mid-7 IRRs. The reason I'm answering in IRR and not cap rate is that the mark-to-market in different locations is significantly vary. For example, for the same IRR, you would be a lot lower cap rate in Southern California than you would be in a market that is leased at market rents.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Tom Catherwood with BTIG. Please proceed with your question\nThomas Catherwood: Thank you and good morning, everybody. Hamid, I appreciate your comments on rates and the Fed's actions or inaction serving as the key governor of customer activity and leasing right now. But how are you seeing supply chain disruption, like in Baltimore, and geopolitical risks impacting customer behavior, if at all?\nHamid Moghadam: I don't think Baltimore has been a big deal in terms of its impact on our business. It's obviously been a big deal to the people who died in the accident and the like, but -- and to traffic patterns. But not to the customer. The customers have enough optionality that they can deal with those kinds of disruptions. I do think the geopolitical stuff has people a little wigged out, more -- definitely more than last quarter. And look at the interest rates, I mean, we're up a good 70, 80 basis points since the last time we all met. And I think that didn't happen evenly throughout the quarter. I think in the last month that sentiment has changed pretty dramatically. So I think both of those things are weighing on decisions, particularly if the decisions are discretionary. And people, when there are no choices like they were no choices in Southern California, they always lease more space than they need because they don't want to be held short. And when the opposite is and they have some choices, they take their time because they expect better deals if they wait. And that difference, even if it's minor, even if it's 5% to the upside and 5% to the downside can be a 10% swing, which are sort of the kind of numbers we're talking about here. So that's very much what happens in the short term. In the long term, demand has to match supply and they can't keep doing that forever. So now if you're going to ask me exactly what that point is, I can't really tell you. But we think it's a matter of quarters, not years.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jon Petersen with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question\nJonathan Petersen: Great. Thank you. Maybe one more question on the port of Baltimore. I know it's not a big container traffic port, but have you seen any knock-on demand show up in other East Coast markets given the dislocation that's created? And then also, maybe a part two, but I know SoCal has been weak over the past year, you've talked about that a lot, and the resets already happened. I guess I'm curious if you could help us contextualize, from where we stand today, if you compare the strength of like SoCal versus the East Coast markets like New Jersey and Pennsylvania, like from where we stand today, which one looks the best over the next year?\nChris Caton: Hey, Jon, it's Chris Caton. First on Baltimore, you're right. The container traffic there is typically 50,000 TEUs a month. The time horizon of necessary diversions is not thought to be more than a couple of months. By comparison, New York, New Jersey is a 300,000, 350,000 TEU port. And a lot of these diversions have gone to Norfolk. So you've seen some leasing in Norfolk. It's not a market where we operate. So no, there are not knock-on effects. As it relates to Southern California versus the East Coast, the SoCal market remains fluid, and I believe -- we believe it will underperform. This is a six-month, 12-month view. Naturally, New Jersey has a completely different set of factors as it relates to rent growth that it's experienced over the last several years in terms of the level of demand that we see in that marketplace as well as sublease trends. Now it's not the moment to get bullish on New Jersey. Let's see the port agreement, the IOI port agreement get made. But over time, both will be very strong performers after this period of fluidity and uncertainty.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. The way I would answer that question is that if you limit it to the next 12 months, I would go PA, New Jersey, SoCal. And if you ask me for the longer term, I would go SoCal, New Jersey, PA. And I would put all three of them in the upper 1/3 of markets across cycles. Maybe the upper 20% of markets across cycles.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, good morning. Just hoping we could put some numbers on the soft demand that you seem to be messaging. So previously you were forecasting 1.5% of stock of net absorption this year. I'm just wondering what that number has shifted to given what's happened over the past 30 to 45 days. And if you can tie in where you see sort of availability rates and next 12-month market rent growth. Thanks.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. Let me take -- we have taken demand down for this year internally from 250 million feet in the US to 175 million, and fundamentally have kept demand at the same level going forward. What we debated that we were going to do is whether we add the 75 million that we missed this year into the subsequent two years, and that's where the bid and ask is in our shop. And we're not clairvoyant, so that's -- I'm just giving you the range of how we think about it. Now you answer the second part of your question, Chris.\nChris Caton: Yes. As it relates to market vacancies, we look at vacancies, not availabilities. Availability is a range between 150 and 250 basis points above these figures, depending on the cycle. We have vacancies peaking in the mid-6s later this year. So that's up about 20, 30 basis points versus what we discussed last year. I think what's important to understand in the cycle is the recovery potential in 2025 related to each of the constituent pieces. Hamid walked you through the demand picture. But what's important to recognize is the supply picture. That was a big factor over the last year, 18 months. And the meaningful falloff in supply is marked. It's off 80% from peak. It's off about 1/3 from pre-COVID levels. So we're talking about 35 million square feet of starts in the first quarter. That annualizes to about 160 million, 170 million square feet. So you're going to actually see this snap later this year and into next year, and those vacancy rates moving noticeably down, likely to move noticeably down from mid-6s towards 5% over the course of next year.\nHamid Moghadam: One other thing I would -- your response has triggered this. Vacancy rates do not linearly affect pricing power. I think when you're operating under 5%, you've got a lot of pricing power. Now whether that's 2% or 3%, doesn't matter. You have a lot of pricing power. And even though you might have two customers that really need the space, four are looking for the space because they just don't want to be cut short down the road. So it just sort of feeds on itself. When the market gets to sort of around 6%, you're at equilibrium. When it gets too much above that, you get into a soft market. And that's a macro analysis, obviously, you've got to apply that market to market in each situation. But that's the way we look at it. We don't think we're getting into those levels of vacancy that we've seen in other cycles, even during the good times. The worst that we're projecting in this period is almost as good as the best we've seen in other cycles. So that's a key distinction. And we've just been spoiled by market in three years where vacancies have been lower than they've ever been. And I think you've heard me say at times that, if the normal range of a market is 1 to 10, we've been operating in a 12, 13, and more recently, I've said we're in an 8 or 9. And today, I would say we're in probably 6.5, 7.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question\nJohn Kim: Thank you. I just wanted to get some additional color on the weaker net absorption due to tenants becoming more cost conscious. I'm wondering if this test-the-thesis that industrial rent is somewhat inelastic given it's a small portion of the overall transport and logistics costs? And also, where are tenants going in your view? Are they simply not expanding, or are they downsizing or going to less expensive markets or submarkets?\nHamid Moghadam: So we've actually tried to test that theory by looking at whether Southern California's loss has translated into an equal gain in adjacent markets like Vegas and Phoenix. And the answer is, while absorption has increased in those markets, it doesn't fully account for the drop-off in Southern California. So some of that demand has just been deferred. And the question is when will deferred demand convert to real demand. And that's the $64 million question. Is it one quarter? Is it two quarters? Is it three quarters? Don't know. We think it's a couple of quarters. But it will happen. And particularly the port coming back, that part accounts for over 30% of imports in the US, and it's been basically down. So we think it's going to -- that's going to have a dramatic effect. Now we may have missed it already for this Christmas season, I don't know. But certainly, next year, that market is going to come back absent a recession or some kind of geopolitical blow-up.\nTim Arndt: And John, I might just add, I guess, the way you're putting the equation together, it is what we see that, yes, the rate environment causes this consternation. But as Chris has been highlighting in a number of his answers, as we look at where utilization sits and some of the capacity that's available, it's just the first place that customers can look in terms of finding a way to continue to operate in the short term. That would ostensibly end, and we'll watch for that as utilization rises, and that's what would add to new demand.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question\nVikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones. First of all, just on the three-year outlook. So it sounds like you're saying '24 is a bit lower than you predicted, '25 and '26 is similar. Does that essentially mean the three-year outlook is kind of adjusted down somewhat? And then secondly, just to be -- just to give us some numbers. I think what you were saying is the rest of the market rent growth is now, I guess, flattish, but SoCal is down. Do you mind just putting some more numbers on that? Like just how much is SoCal down Q-over-Q or year-over-year versus what other markets in the US are doing? Thanks.\nTim Arndt: Hey, Vikram, it's Tim. We're not calling anything on '25 and '26. In my prepared remarks -- or maybe I should say, I think our view would be that our views are upheld. And what I tried to highlight in the opening remarks is that if we get to a little bit lower average occupancy this year, recognizing that our three-year forecast called for a more normalized level of occupancy in the end anyway, that's where this concept of, well, maybe the adjustment to same-store from an occupancy change is coming a bit more this year than it would otherwise next year. But right now, we would hold out our view for '25 and '26 in terms of aggregate NOI and same store. Now rent change in this very immediate term, I'm sorry, market rent growth is a little bit below expectations. That will have some effect, but that will be relatively muted through same-store over the period.\nHamid Moghadam: Yes. Let's just put some numbers since you asked on it. I think in the Analyst Day, we talked about a three-year forecast for '24, '25 and '26 rental growth of -- sorry, 4% to 6%. I would say we're at the lower end of that range and maybe a little bit lower than that when you look at it over a three-year period. My number, and this is not the official number, my number would be north of 3% and around 4% probably, just shy of 4%.\nChris Caton: And then just on the detailed question on what's happening in market rent growth in the first quarter. Southern California, down 6%, and US down about 1%, 1.2%. So when you multiply it through, you can see all other markets are flat.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotiabank. Please proceed with your question\nNicholas Yulico: Yeah, hi. I was just hoping to get a feel for, again, going back to the occupancy guidance, if there's a way that you can give us a feel for how much decline in new leasing commencements you have been embedded in the number this year. Because it sounds like the retention ratios have been better, so leasing velocity on the new side seems subdued. You talked about that leasing demand forecast being down, I think it was 30% on the numbers you gave, the 250 million to 175 million in the US. How much is like new leasing in the portfolio going to be down this year for the guidance?\nTim Arndt: Well, this is Tim. I'll give it to you in this way. And this might help some of the folks who have struggled looking at the supplemental and some of the stats there, and our messaging. Because what you don't see in the supplemental would be things like, well, how much lease signing occurred in the first quarter. And that was down. Even though you see strong occupancy, that's on commencements, signings were off about 12% in the first quarter. So that's down. You can see that when you look through our pages in our leasing versus occupied statistic where there's only about a 10 basis point difference in those versus a more historical norm of 40 to 50 basis points. So those are the pieces a little bit underneath the surface that are guiding our view that the pre-leasing that we're normally looking for at this point, which is ranging four to six months ahead of commencements is shy and why we think the average occupancy is ultimately going to be lower.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question\nTodd Thomas: Hi. Thanks. Two questions. I guess, first, can you discuss your rent change expectations for the full year and whether anything has changed there as it pertains to the revisions to your outlook? And it looked like rent change on signings was trending in the low 70% range through February, which was higher than the rent change in the quarter. I guess, any thoughts about rent change -- trends relative to this quarter and for the year? And then my second question, in terms of the occupancy breakout by unit size and your comments about larger and smaller spaces earlier in the call, do you expect a recovery later in the year to be broad-based from a space or unit size? Or do you expect to see more strength or maybe more persistent weakness in either the larger or smaller unit size as conditions tighten up in a few quarters?\nTim Arndt: Hey, Todd, it's Tim. Yes. On rent change, so as mentioned, we had 67% start in the quarter. The signings were 70. So you do get a sense that it can move up and down each quarter. You may also recall, we had very strong rent change on signings in Q4, which may leave you wondering why didn't that show up here in Q1 on the commencements? And that's speaking to just how long this pre-leasing period can be. It can be more than just three months. And for that reason, I expect we'll probably see rent change right now, my view would be it's going to be above Q1, in Q2, and then also higher on the full year, in the low to mid-70s, over 2024 is our current view.\nChris Caton: As it relates to the contours, I think I'd first point you to the market color that was given earlier as illustrating the shape of the recovery going forward. As it pertains to different size categories, there is more vacancy and more availability in the over 500,000 category, but that's also where, in the last 90 days, we've seen a little bit of a pickup. So I think we'll see size categories advancing at a similar pace over the course of the year, and there'll be real differentiation across the different markets.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Vince Tibone with Green Street. Please proceed with your question\nVince Tibone: Hi. Thanks for the follow up. I was just curious, are you seeing any other landlords gain to offer more free rent or tenant allowances to try to attract tenants to their vacancies?\nHamid Moghadam: A really interesting question. So this is what has really surprised me from this cycle. We are getting calls from merchant developers that have had financing, have completed projects and are getting panicked. And for us to look at those opportunities. Boy, we're looking at those opportunities. Because that's where a good balance sheet and that's where being on your front foot is all about. I think there were a lot of people in this business that thought, we'll just get some financing at zero cost and throw up some buildings and it will lease. And I think that's what accounted for some of that over-exuberance on the development side. And I think we're going to end up being beneficiaries of that, and I'm seeing that real time. So, yes, I think people who are merchant developers and do not have the financial wherewithal are acting in a somewhat distressed way sooner than I would have guessed. And we're happy about that.\nHamid Moghadam: So that was the last question, Vince. So with that, I want to thank you for your interest. And this is part of a long story and we'll be there next quarter to tell you about the following chapters of it. Take care. Bye-bye.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Chris Caton",
            "content": "Hey, Caitlin. It's Chris Caton. I'll start by saying I think it's a combination of factors. For sure, as Tim described, Southern California and a handful of other high rent markets, the leasing velocity has been subdued and rent growth has been a little bit below expectations. So there is that softness. But we also want to point to a couple of quarters of deferred decision making leading aggregate customer demand across the United States to be a little bit below what we previously expected. The other thing I might add, Caitlin, would be just nominally in the sense of dollars and the impact in same store. We do see about half of our adjustments as coming from SoCal. Hi, Michael. Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. As we've kind of covered in the script, and I think we are pointing out here, whether it's consumer resilience as revealed by economic indicators like the labor metrics or retail sales, whether you look at our own customers and supply chain momentum as revealed by our RBI volumes through the ports and our proposal volumes. The broader economy is generating a normal amount of demand. A couple of things to consider though. One is as you can see in utilization data and in sublease space, some customers have spare capacity that they are utilizing to accommodate some of this growth. We also have these leading indicators. We needed to simply see customers convert space requirements into signed leases. So just the simple conversion of investigation into signed leasing. And indeed, we already are seeing the front edge of some leading global e-commerce companies and other retailers begin to make space. It's just not broadly yet occurring across the whole marketplace. Hey, Blaine, it's Chris Caton. Thanks for the question. So Southern California is a market that continues to soften, vacancy rates are continuing to rise, yes, after different submarkets. The softest area of Southern California is midsized and smaller units in the Inland Empire. The strongest area is probably Orange County. And Los Angeles, while subdued, has a 4% market vacancy rate, so as demand comes into that marketplace, bear in mind, demand has been negative over the last year, a very rare occurrence, as demand comes back in that marketplace, you're likely to see the vacancy rate make a difference in Los Angeles as well. In terms of other markets where we're watchful, the soft markets in the US include New Jersey, Seattle and Savannah. Hi, Vince. It's Chris Caton here. So first, in terms of strength, there is a wide range. And speaking of the benefits of diversity, the strongest markets in the world include Mexico, Texas, parts of the Southeast US, Pennsylvania, but also looking out to the Netherlands, Germany and Brazil, Toronto as well, as a strong market. You also have stable markets, Chicago, Southern Florida, Baltimore, D.C. And then really at Southern California alone is really the main weak market. So that would be the range. In terms of size categories, what you see -- what you hear in the marketplace in terms of tours and, in fact, some leases that are getting made, is there's a bit more activity, particularly among self-performing e-com and retailers at the larger end of the spectrum. That would be the main, I'd say, new news in the last 90 days. Hey, Jon, it's Chris Caton. First on Baltimore, you're right. The container traffic there is typically 50,000 TEUs a month. The time horizon of necessary diversions is not thought to be more than a couple of months. By comparison, New York, New Jersey is a 300,000, 350,000 TEU port. And a lot of these diversions have gone to Norfolk. So you've seen some leasing in Norfolk. It's not a market where we operate. So no, there are not knock-on effects. As it relates to Southern California versus the East Coast, the SoCal market remains fluid, and I believe -- we believe it will underperform. This is a six-month, 12-month view. Naturally, New Jersey has a completely different set of factors as it relates to rent growth that it's experienced over the last several years in terms of the level of demand that we see in that marketplace as well as sublease trends. Now it's not the moment to get bullish on New Jersey. Let's see the port agreement, the IOI port agreement get made. But over time, both will be very strong performers after this period of fluidity and uncertainty. Yes. As it relates to market vacancies, we look at vacancies, not availabilities. Availability is a range between 150 and 250 basis points above these figures, depending on the cycle. We have vacancies peaking in the mid-6s later this year. So that's up about 20, 30 basis points versus what we discussed last year. I think what's important to understand in the cycle is the recovery potential in 2025 related to each of the constituent pieces. Hamid walked you through the demand picture. But what's important to recognize is the supply picture. That was a big factor over the last year, 18 months. And the meaningful falloff in supply is marked. It's off 80% from peak. It's off about 1/3 from pre-COVID levels. So we're talking about 35 million square feet of starts in the first quarter. That annualizes to about 160 million, 170 million square feet. So you're going to actually see this snap later this year and into next year, and those vacancy rates moving noticeably down, likely to move noticeably down from mid-6s towards 5% over the course of next year. And then just on the detailed question on what's happening in market rent growth in the first quarter. Southern California, down 6%, and US down about 1%, 1.2%. So when you multiply it through, you can see all other markets are flat. As it relates to the contours, I think I'd first point you to the market color that was given earlier as illustrating the shape of the recovery going forward. As it pertains to different size categories, there is more vacancy and more availability in the over 500,000 category, but that's also where, in the last 90 days, we've seen a little bit of a pickup.

            "name": "Dan Letter",
            "content": "Yeah. The margins this quarter, it's actually an isolated event here. We had about 15, 17 projects stabilized. We had one project that just had a confluence of events take place, whether it be weather, some infrastructure, municipal requirements. And it just came in at a pretty negative margin, weighing down the overall average margin for the quarter. If you pull that out, our margin for the quarter would actually be more reasonable 15%, 16%. Yeah. Thanks. This is Dan. I'll -- I got a couple of thoughts on that point there around development starts. We adjusted our guidance on development consistent with the adjustment in the occupancy and the operating pool. So as we see demand shifting out, we just expect that we are going to start fewer buildings. We reduced it by about $0.5 billion. That's about half build-to-suit, half spec. We are raising the bar on spec. As Hamid said earlier, we put that guidance out there because you ask for it. We don't need to start these projects. We own the land. We have $38 billion worth of opportunity embedded in that land bank. We have entitlements. We have the teams. They're all geared up, ready to start. We can literally pull the trigger on $10 billion, $12 billion of that tomorrow. So we just look at that. We are just trying to be consistent and tie it to our overall outlook on demand. And there's no particular location or otherwise that we -- that drag that down."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Hamid Moghadam",
            "content": "Well, on capital deployment specifically, you may remember that I'm always saying the only reason we provide guidance is because you ask us. We actually don't have a budget or a plan for deploying capital. We look at every investment opportunity one at a time. So all our elements of our guidance. And this doesn't go for just this period. It goes for any period. I would take that one with a grain of salt. We are not afraid to deploy a lot more or a lot less capital if the market conditions warrant it. With respect to conservatism, I would say, we call it as close to the pin as we can get it with a very slight bit of conservative. Not a lot, just a bit. So that, in the majority of the cases, we are pretty confident of what we are saying, but we are not 100% confident. There could be downside beyond that. But I would say we try to call it as we see it and be careful that we don't -- we don't want to disappoint 50% of the time, which is really calling it right on the pin. We'd like to be a little more conservative than that. Now, we don't always get it right. So let's admit that. That's basically -- the $150 million is some non-core assets. And we could not hear the second part of your question. Could you repeat that? Yeah. And the only thing I would add to that is that even though we made the adjustment on both the built-to-suit and the spec part, the bias is greater on the spec part. We actually feel pretty good about our built-to-suit volume going forward. So it's really the spec which is discretionary, and we can, as Dan said, write that at any time. Yes. The other thing I would say about Southern California is that don't discount the effect of the port labor issue that was resolved. That took longer, a lot longer than most people thought. And that affects a lot of the people -- a lot of the users in the South Bay immediately adjacent to the ports and the like. So that market can get tight real quick if that port volume comes back. I think that the small to medium spaces in the Inland Empire are kind of a mismatch. They're, by and large, the older buildings that were built there when the market was not really designed for the big 500,000 million square foot buildings. And those are -- somebody who wants a lot of space has to go to the Inland Empire. Somebody who wants 100,000 to 200,000 feet has more choices. So that's where the softness is in the Inland Empire. Yes. In terms of where deals are being priced out, I would say nine months ago, a year ago, there was very little activity, and we were pricing deals in good markets in the US in the low nine IRRs, albeit not much was happening at those kinds of return expectations. Today, I would say those are 100 basis points lower and there's a lot more volume in that a lot of transactions happening in the marketplace in the low 8s. Europe, that number -- those numbers would be in the mid-7 IRRs. The reason I'm answering in IRR and not cap rate is that the mark-to-market in different locations is significantly vary. For example, for the same IRR, you would be a lot lower cap rate in Southern California than you would be in a market that is leased at market rents. I don't think Baltimore has been a big deal in terms of its impact on our business. It's obviously been a big deal to the people who died in the accident and the like, but -- and to traffic patterns. But not to the customer. The customers have enough optionality that they can deal with those kinds of disruptions. I do think the geopolitical stuff has people a little wigged out, more -- definitely more than last quarter. And look at the interest rates, I mean, we're up a good 70, 80 basis points since the last time we all met. And I think that didn't happen evenly throughout the quarter. I think in the last month that sentiment has changed pretty dramatically. So I think both of those things are weighing on decisions, particularly if the decisions are discretionary. And people, when there are no choices like they were no choices in Southern California, they always lease more space than they need because they don't want to be held short. And when the opposite is and they have some choices, they take their time because they expect better deals if they wait. And that difference, even if it's minor, even if it's 5% to the upside and 5% to the downside can be a 10% swing, which are sort of the kind of numbers we're talking about here. So that's very much what happens in the short term. In the long term, demand has to match supply and they can't keep doing that forever. So now if you're going to ask me exactly what that point is, I can't really tell you. But we think it's a matter of quarters, not years. Yes. The way I would answer that question is that if you limit it to the next 12 months, I would go PA, New Jersey, SoCal. And if you ask me for the longer term, I would go SoCal, New Jersey, PA. And I would put all three of them in the upper 1/3 of markets across cycles. Maybe the upper 20% of markets across cycles. Yes. Let me take -- we have taken demand down for this year internally from 250 million feet in the US to 175 million, and fundamentally have kept demand at the same level going forward. What we debated that we were going to do is whether we add the 75 million that we missed this year into the subsequent two years, and that's where the bid and ask is in our shop. And we're not clairvoyant, so that's -- I'm just giving you the range of how we think about it. Now you answer the second part of your question, Chris. One other thing I would -- your response has triggered this. Vacancy rates do not linearly affect pricing power. I think when you're operating under 5%, you've got a lot of pricing power. Now whether that's 2% or 3%, doesn't matter. You have a lot of pricing power. And even though you might have two customers that really need the space, four are looking for the space because they just don't want to be cut short down the road. So it just sort of feeds on itself. When the market gets to sort of around 6%, you're at equilibrium. When it gets too much above that, you get into a soft market. And that's a macro analysis, obviously, you've got to apply that market to market in each situation. But that's the way we look at it. We don't think we're getting into those levels of vacancy that we've seen in other cycles, even during the good times. The worst that we're projecting in this period is almost as good as the best we've seen in other cycles. So that's a key distinction. And we've just been spoiled by market in three years where vacancies have been lower than they've ever been. And I think you've heard me say at times that, if the normal range of a market is 1 to 10, we've been operating in a 12, 13, and more recently, I've said we're in an 8 or 9. And today, I would say we're in probably 6.5, 7. So we've actually tried to test that theory by looking at whether Southern California's loss has translated into an equal gain in adjacent markets like Vegas and Phoenix. And the answer is, while absorption has increased in those markets, it doesn't fully account for the drop-off in Southern California. So some of that demand has just been deferred. And the question is when will deferred demand convert to real demand. And that's the $64 million question. Is it one quarter? Is it two quarters? Is it three quarters? Don't know. We think it's a couple of quarters. But it will happen. And particularly the port coming back, that part accounts for over 30% of imports in the US, and it's been basically down. So we think it's going to -- that's going to have a dramatic effect. Now we may have missed it already for this Christmas season, I don't know. But certainly, next year, that market is going to come back absent a recession or some kind of geopolitical blow-up. Yes. Let's just put some numbers since you asked on it. I think in the Analyst Day, we talked about a three-year forecast for '24, '25 and '26 rental growth of -- sorry, 4% to 6%. I would say we're at the lower end of that range and maybe a little bit lower than that when you look at it over a three-year period. My number, and this is not the official number, my number would be north of 3% and around 4% probably, just shy of 4%. A really interesting question. So this is what has really surprised me from this cycle. We are getting calls from merchant developers that have had financing, have completed projects and are getting panicked. And for us to look at those opportunities. Boy, we're looking at those opportunities. Because that's where a good balance sheet and that's where being on your front foot is all about. I think there were a lot of people in this business that thought, we'll just get some financing at zero cost and throw up some buildings and it will lease. And I think that's what accounted for some of that over-exuberance on the development side. And I think we're going to end up being beneficiaries of that, and I'm seeing that real time. So, yes, I think people who are merchant developers and do not have the financial wherewithal are acting in a somewhat distressed way sooner than I would have guessed. And we're happy about that. So that was the last question, Vince. So with that, I want to thank you for your interest. And this is part of a long story and we'll be there next quarter to tell you about the following chapters of it. Take care. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Tim Arndt",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining our call. We've had a good start to the year in terms of our operating and financial results in the first quarter. We delivered strong rent change, drove occupancy slightly ahead of our forecast, raised nearly $5 billion in capital, including $750 million in strategic capital, and made important headway in our Energy business. That said, as we evaluate the market, persistent inflation and high interest rates have kept more customers focused on controlling costs. The resulting delay in decision making, easily observed through the first quarter's below average net absorption, will translate to lower leasing volume within the year. Accordingly, we've opted to adjust our guidance early, getting ahead of what looks like a period of occupancy below our forecast in the near term and its effect on same store in a number of our higher rent markets. This is punctuated, of course, by a more pronounced period of correction still underway in Southern California. New starts, however, continues to be surprisingly disciplined, adding to the expectation for limited new supply in the back half of '24, but also extending deeper into '25. When considered alongside muted demand, we arrive at a view that the operating environment has only changed modestly in aggregate, and that demand is simply pushing out by a few quarters. The outcome of this may simply mean moving towards a long-term occupancy expectation more swiftly this year, which sets up for a better next year. Turning to our results for the quarter. Core FFO, excluding promotes, was $1.31 per share and including net promote expense was $1.28 per share, essentially in line with our forecast. Occupancy in the portfolio ended the quarter at 97%. For context, the US market declined 310 basis points since its peak in the summer of '22, while our portfolio's occupancy has only declined 80 basis points, resulting in vacancy today for Prologis that is less than half of that in our markets and reflective of our portfolio quality. Net effective rent change was 68% based on commencements and 70% based on new signings. Following this in-place increase and changes in market rents, our net effective lease mark-to-market stands at 50%, representing over $2.2 billion of rent to harvest without any additional market rent growth from here. Rent growth captured just for the single quarter was approximately $110 million on an annualized basis and at our share. Our same-store growth on a cash basis was 5.7% and on a net effective basis was 4.1%. The same-store from rent change alone was strong at approximately 9%, but is impacted by a 130 basis point change in year-over-year vacancy, as well as 150 basis points from fair value lease adjustments with the Duke portfolio's inclusion in our same-store pool. Additionally, there were approximately 175 basis points of items specific to the quarter, including one-time reconciling items from 2023, as well as unfavorable comps from low expenses last year. We started over $270 million of new developments in the quarter, bringing our portfolio to approximately $7.5 billion at our share, with estimated value creation of over $1.7 billion, a number we feel increasingly confident in with value stabilizing. In our Energy business, we've made meaningful progress on this year's deployment, including the signing of 405 megawatts of long-term storage-related contracts with investment-grade utilities. We also delivered the largest EV fleet charging project in the United States, less than 15 miles from both the ports of LA and Long beach. Finally, we raised $4.1 billion of debt across our balance sheet and funds at a weighted average rate of 4.7% and a term of 10 years. Our debt portfolio has an overall in-place rate of just 3.1%, with more than nine years of average remaining life and liquidity at the end of the quarter of over $5.8 billion. Turning to market conditions. Most broad economic data from unemployment to retail sales to the health of the consumer remain very strong. And while our tour proposal and other proprietary metrics are similarly positive, overall leasing activity and net absorption are running below expectations. Net absorption in the US, for example, was very low this quarter at just 27 million square feet. So while the macro landscape and supply chains continue to generate a need for space, we think it's prudent to expect continued headwinds on overall absorption over the next few quarters. The interest rate environment and its associated volatility have weighed on customer decision making, especially as the 10 year has increased 70 basis points from its level just 90 days ago and expectations for Fed rate cuts have moved from potentially six to now possibly zero. In parallel, sublease and space utilization rates highlight that some customers have available capacity, driven in part by the high rate of absorption through the pandemic. This dynamic of available space intersecting with the desire for cost containment is what leads to lower absorption and is playing out at different rates across submarkets and customers. For example, while slow leasing has persisted so far this year for less capitalized customers and 3PLs, we see a handful of large e-commerce and retail customers further along in this process, such as Amazon, who voiced caution two years ago, but is now active in several global markets and has openly discussed plans to commit to significant amounts of new space. The overall leasing slowdown is most felt in only a handful of markets. Southern California and the Inland Empire being the most acute. In fact, rents in most of our US markets are generally flat, several are up, and it is mainly elongated downtime affecting near-term occupancy and NOI. While Southern California leasing has been challenging, it has not slowed the tremendous uplift we realize every single quarter from rent change on rollover, which was 120% for the market in the first quarter, with the Inland Empire at 156%, nearly the highest in our portfolio. In Europe, rents grew overall during the quarter, which we believe will remain the case over the balance of the year. And of course, LATAM continues to impress with very high occupancy and market rent growth that has led the globe in recent quarters. Overall, global market rents declined slightly over 1% in the quarter, driven mostly by Southern California, and would have been slightly positive if excluded. I'd like to spend a moment on Baltimore, where we own over 18 million square feet and has been a dynamic market of ours for decades. Our employees, customers and properties are all safe following the bridge collapse last month and our customers expect to be able to withstand the disruption with little impact to their businesses. Shifting to capital markets. Valuations increased in all of our geographies, except for China, which saw a very small decline. Over the last 1.5 years, global values have decreased despite increases in cash flow due to cap rate expansion. As cap rates have stabilized, cash flow growth now has the ability to translate to value growth. Even though modest, the value uplift in the US and Europe are important as strategic capital investors have been looking for values to not only bottom, but actually turn upwards before committing new capital. With Europe a bit ahead of the US in this regard, it is indeed where we've seen stronger fund-raising interest in recent quarters. We also had a successful equity raise in FIBRA Prologis, raising over $500 million for deployment into both assets to be contributed from our balance sheet, as well as pursuits of third-party acquisitions. Transaction volumes and activity have ticked up in recent weeks and pricing has certainly improved. As always, we are actively looking at acquisition opportunities across all of our markets, but our focus remains on the development of our land bank, which provides an opportunity for over $38 billion of build out with a return on incremental capital of approximately 8.5%. In terms of guidance, in light of our views on demand and leasing pace in the coming quarters, we are reducing our average occupancy guidance to range between 95.75% and 96.75% of the 75 basis point adjustment from the midpoint. It's important to understand that approximately two-thirds of this change stems from our higher rent markets, meaning they create a disproportionate impact on same store in 2024. Same-store growth on a net effective basis will range between 5.5% and 6.5%, a reduction of 150 basis points, which accounts for the average occupancy decline, slightly lower rent change for the year as well as 30 basis points of annualized impact from the one-time items in the first quarter mentioned earlier. Our revised range on a cash basis is now 6.25% to 7.25%. We are maintaining our guidance for strategic capital revenue, excluding promotes, to a range of $530 million to $550 million and reducing our G&A guidance to a range of $415 million to $430 million. We are adjusting development start guidance for the year to a revised range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion at our share, reflecting our discipline in speculative starts and the timing impact this has in the calendar year. As we've always said, we don't consider our guidance to be a target internally and each deal ultimately needs to be rational and accretive on its own. In the end, we are forecasting GAAP earnings to range between $3.15 per share and $3.35 per share. Core FFO, including net promote expense, will range between $5.37 per share and $5.47 per share, while core FFO, excluding promotes, will range from $5.45 per share to $5.55 per share. Our updated guidance calls for core earnings growth of nearly 8% at the midpoint. As we close out, I'd like to underscore the message of the call, which is that while we have only a modest change of view in the intermediate term, our confidence in the long term is intact. And putting timing aside, we are encouraged by the outlook for supply in the back half of this year and '25, have tremendous lease mark-to-market to harvest in the interim, and are pleased to see valuations, fundraising and transaction activity all picking up. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Steve, let me take a stab at that. If you are sensing any acute change in our outlook, you're not reading our call correctly. We have picked a three-year window, I think, in our Analyst Day to give you our expectations. And the first year of that window has moved around. So our outlook for the back period of second and third year essentially the same and could be even better given how much deferred demand is building up. If our proposals were down, if our tours were down, I would be more concerned. But companies are out looking at this space. And if you think nothing has changed in the last 45 or 90 days with respect to the Fed outlook, you must be reading different newspapers than I am. So I would tell you that people are just scared of pulling the trigger until the Fed gives the all clear sign with the first rate cut. So, yes, we are not instantaneous in our data transmission to us and to you, but I can assure you that you will always hear our views immediately as we form them and as we get them from the marketplace. Yeah. The only thing I would add to that is that the effect is not uniform in all markets. And I think what's going on -- and this is a theory. This is not a fact. It's a theory, but it's based on 40 years of looking at this stuff. Southern California has over 30% share for 3PLs and the rest of the US market has a little under 20% share of 3PLs. 3PLs are serve two purposes. One, they provide outsourcing of for logistic activities, but they also create surge space. In other words, companies use 3PLs as a way of flexing up and down. So markets that have a bigger exposure to 3PLs are likely to feel the impacts of shifts in sentiment sooner than other markets on the way down and on the way up. Also, there are certain customers who have instantaneous access to sales data and activity. And I would say the e-commerce players, the big ones, have the best data on that, because they see the trends on a daily minute-by-minute basis. Those guys were early in terms of curtailing their demand. And I got to tell you, they're out there pretty aggressively and don't listen to what we say, listen to what they say in their own annual reports, in their own interviews with the press. And I think you'll see that they feel pretty confident about their business and they're a bit ahead of the curve. Now, all of this is subject to missiles not flying in the Middle East and the Fed not going crazy and God knows what else can happen in this world. So but as far as we see, the indications are really good. And this certainly does not feel like any of the other downturns that I've been part of. So again the word huge sounds a little bit of an overreaction to me. Okay. Let me start that, and then I'll turn it over to Chris and then to Dan to talk about development margins specifically. We like to be early and thoughtful in outlooks that we share with you, and we've always prided ourselves in doing that. And in some cases in the past, as you know, you've been following us for a long time, we've taken pretty bold statements on the way up and on the way down and actually been proven pretty right about it. So for us to be late on this stuff is not something that we look forward to. So we always try to be on the lookout for trends that may be interesting to our investors and to you, who are looking at our company on a real-time basis. So I'm not smart enough to assign percentages of how much of this is preemptive and how much of it is. But I can tell you there's nothing going on in the portfolio. There's not some news embedded deep in our customer behavior or some market that we're not sharing with you. This is just looking at the tone of the marketplace and sharing with you what we see playing out in the next two to three quarters, nothing beyond that. And the outlook for the long term is very much the same as it was before. Dan, do you want to talk about the margins? And Camille, it's Tim, I might build on your first -- the first part of your question as well, which is that at prevailing cap rates and the cost of debt and everything else, there's very little you could actually do in deployment in the year to affect earnings in year one or two. I find that deployment changes tend to have kind of a push effect on earnings. So you should probably have that in your thinking as you watch our guidance. Hey, Ki Bin, it's Tim. I'll take the front half of your question just on free rent. We have seen an increase in free rent. I think what's important to remember there is we've had exceedingly low amounts of free rent granted in the last few years. And I would say the current rates that we've seen in this last quarter, and what we're bracing forward this year, would still not really be on par with long-term averages. I would say that concession is not fully back to normal. But it is turning up logically in this environment. And John, I might just add, I guess, the way you're putting the equation together, it is what we see that, yes, the rate environment causes this consternation. But as Chris has been highlighting in a number of his answers, as we look at where utilization sits and some of the capacity that's available, it's just the first place that customers can look in terms of finding a way to continue to operate in the short term. That would ostensibly end, and we'll watch for that as utilization rises, and that's what would add to new demand. Hey, Vikram, it's Tim. We're not calling anything on '25 and '26. In my prepared remarks -- or maybe I should say, I think our view would be that our views are upheld. And what I tried to highlight in the opening remarks is that if we get to a little bit lower average occupancy this year, recognizing that our three-year forecast called for a more normalized level of occupancy in the end anyway, that's where this concept of, well, maybe the adjustment to same-store from an occupancy change is coming a bit more this year than it would otherwise next year. But right now, we would hold out our view for '25 and '26 in terms of aggregate NOI and same store. Now rent change in this very immediate term, I'm sorry, market rent growth is a little bit below expectations. That will have some effect, but that will be relatively muted through same-store over the period. Well, this is Tim. I'll give it to you in this way. And this might help some of the folks who have struggled looking at the supplemental and some of the stats there, and our messaging. Because what you don't see in the supplemental would be things like, well, how much lease signing occurred in the first quarter. And that was down. Even though you see strong occupancy, that's on commencements, signings were off about 12% in the first quarter. So that's down. You can see that when you look through our pages in our leasing versus occupied statistic where there's only about a 10 basis point difference in those versus a more historical norm of 40 to 50 basis points. So those are the pieces a little bit underneath the surface that are guiding our view that the pre-leasing that we're normally looking for at this point, which is ranging four to six months ahead of commencements is shy and why we think the average occupancy is ultimately going to be lower. Hey, Todd, it's Tim. Yes. On rent change, so as mentioned, we had 67% start in the quarter. The signings were 70. So you do get a sense that it can move up and down each quarter. You may also recall, we had very strong rent change on signings in Q4, which may leave you wondering why didn't that show up here in Q1 on the commencements? And that's speaking to just how long this pre-leasing period can be. It can be more than just three months. And for that reason, I expect we'll probably see rent change right now, my view would be it's going to be above Q1, in Q2, and then also higher on the full year, in the low to mid-70s, over 2024 is our current view."
