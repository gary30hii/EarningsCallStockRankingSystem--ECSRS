[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nMichael Steele: Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's fourth quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least 1 year. \n Slide 2 conveys that the forward-looking statements we make today are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our SEC filings. \n During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year, on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition.  \n This presentation will include prepared remarks from Anders Gustafsson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Anders will begin with our fourth quarter results. Then Nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our 2021 outlook. Anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Senior Vice President of Global Sales, will join us as we take your questions.  \n Now let's flip to Slide 4 as I turn the call over to Anders. \nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am proud of our employees' resiliency and focus on serving our customers critical needs during the pandemic. Through their efforts, we were able to deliver exceptional results to close out a challenging 2020. \n For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of more than 10% or more than 8% on an organic basis; an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.5%, a 210 basis point year-over-year improvement; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.46, a 25% increase from the prior year; and strong free cash flow. Each of these measures significantly exceeded our outlook.  \n We generated more business in Q4 than any other quarter in our history. Our teams executed well to satisfy a faster-than-expected recovery in demand from smaller customers through our distribution channel, particularly for our printing solutions. Demand from our large customers also continued to be strong due to their need to digitize and automate workflows in an increasingly on-demand economy. \n We also drove improved profitability and cash flow, while investing in research and development projects to drive sustainable, profitable growth. Our record Q4 results capped a challenging full year 2020, in which we realized slight declines in sales and earnings per share. However, we did achieve record free cash flow of $895 million for the year. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q4 financial results in more detail and discuss our 2021 outlook. \nNathan Winters: Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q4, we returned to profitable growth after a particularly challenging first 9 months of the year. Net sales increased 8.3% before the impact of currency and acquisitions. Our sales mix of large and small orders normalized to pre-pandemic levels, driven by a recovery of our run-rate business, which was driven in part by pent-up demand. \n Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment, including printing and supplies, significantly benefited from the recovery in smaller business demand, with segment sales increasing 14% from the prior year. Our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 5.6%, driven by solid growth in enterprise mobile computing solutions. We also realized strong growth in services and software, driven by our managed and support services and Zebra retail solutions. \n From a regional perspective, we realized solid year-over-year growth in North America and significant growth in EMEA, while Asia Pac and Latin America were slower to recover. In North America, sales increased 6%. Printing, supplies, data capture and services were bright spots. In EMEA, sales increased 20%. Printing, supplies, mobile computing and services grew double-digits as we saw strong demand through our partner distribution channel. \n APAC sales were down 4% year-over-year, yet increased sequentially. Printing and mobile computing were bright spots, and we saw modest growth in China. Latin America sales declined 15%, with all major product and service categories declining in a challenging macro environment. \n Adjusted gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 47.8%, driven primarily by a $12 million recovery of China import tariffs paid in prior periods and improved services and software margin. Business mix had a negligible impact on year-on-year margin comparisons. Additionally, this quarter's results were impacted by $10 million of premium freight costs. \n Adjusted operating expenses increased $28 million from the prior year period and improved 20 basis points as a percentage of sales. We continue to diligently manage costs, while accelerating high-return investments in the business. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.5%, a 210 basis point increase from the prior year period, primarily driven by higher gross margin. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.46, a $0.90 or 25.3% year-over-year increase.  \n Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $895 million of free cash flow in full year 2020. This was $271 million higher than the prior year. Free cash flow conversion of 130% was significantly higher than our target of 100%, primarily due to timing of customer collections and vendor payments. \n Lower 2020 payments of incentive compensation, taxes and interest also contributed to the improvement. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended 2020 at 1.2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is comfortably below our target maximum of 2.5x.  \n Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered the new year with a strong order backlog and healthy channel inventory levels. We are encouraged by the pickup in demand, primarily from our smaller customers, which includes pent-up demand from those who had paused spending during the peak of the pandemic. This momentum, along with our sales pipeline, positions us well for double-digit sales growth for the first quarter and full year 2021. \n In Q1, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 25% and 29%. This outlook assumes a 300 to 350 basis point additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes. We anticipate Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin of slightly higher than 23%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.50. \n For the full year 2021, we anticipate adjusted net sales growth between 10% and 14%, with growth moderating through the year as we cycle more challenging comparisons and navigate a continued uncertain global economic recovery. This outlook assumes approximately 3 percentage points additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes. We anticipate full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin between 21% and 22%, which assumes gross margin expansion from the prior year.  \n We expect free cash flow to be at least $700 million for the year. We do not expect to repeat the exceptionally high level of free cash flow conversion that we achieved in 2020. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. \n With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we're advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision in our end markets. \nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Nathan. Our team has done a fantastic job executing in a challenging environment. We have strong momentum entering 2021, supported by our order backlog and pipeline of business. We continue to build on our industry-leading offerings by investing in our people, operations and innovation to drive sustainable growth. In 2020, we acquired Reflexis and launched a record number of new products and solutions to ensure that we continue to advance our industry leadership position. \n Slide 10 highlights how we are building on our foundational capabilities to elevate our value proposition. We are uniquely positioned to solve our customers' complex operational challenges. Our unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast installed base of products and solutions can be harnessed to gain real-time actionable insights. The result is a more intelligent enterprise, with optimized workflows.  \n Through the pandemic, there has been a dramatic increase in the adoption of omnichannel and online shopping. Retailers need proven solutions to overcome the significant fulfillment challenges posed by this profound behavioral shift. If goods are not delivered or made available for pickup, as promised, the retailer risks losing its shopper to a competitor. To address this issue, retailers have been prioritizing their capital spend in our broad portfolio of solutions with a sense of urgency. \n We are enabling retailers to generate an unprecedented amount of valuable data captured through mobile computers, point-of-sale systems, RFID and other intelligent automation solutions, all of which are critical to digitizing their operations. Key benefits to the retailer include: better operational visibility and insights; increased employee collaboration and labor productivity, improved inventory accuracy, well-equipped associates with real-time actionable information, and more satisfied customers. \n Last month, we participated in the National Retail Federation's virtual sessions, where we showcased how Zebra's solutions help retailers deliver a superior omnichannel shopping experience. At one of the sessions, AutoZone explained how our Reflexis workforce and task management solution equipped their associates with highly flexible mobile technology that enables enhanced customer responsiveness and provides insightful data for analytics and reporting. We are proud to enable AutoZone to go the extra mile to delight its shoppers.  \n Now turning to Slide 12. We continue to be excited about our opportunity to help our customers meet their mission-critical needs in an increasingly on-demand economy. As a trusted strategic partner, we orchestrate end-to-end workflows for customers in a variety of end markets. As I mentioned, retailers continue to prioritize investment in our products and solutions to address their omnichannel fulfillment strategies and related warehouse automation needs. \n In Q4, we secured multi-million dollar orders from a range of e-tailers, mass merchants, grocers, department stores and auto parts retailers. In transportation and logistics, strong e-commerce growth continues to drive parcel volumes, while last-mile on-demand fulfillment has become increasingly important. \n The Italian Post recently selected our printing and scanning solutions for their 13,000 post offices. Separately, the deployment of our TC7 Series mobile computers to United States Postal Service carriers is on track to resume as expected in late Q1, with a goal of completion in Q3. In health care, the need for increased real-time visibility into the entire patient journey as well as the demand for innovative solutions to provide safe and efficient care continue to make health care, our highest-growth end market opportunity. \n In Q4, we grew our relationship with one of America's leading health care providers. New acute care applications have made it increasingly important for this customer to equip more of their clinicians with mobile computers. The most recent use case we addressed was COVID drive-through testing with our health care-purposed TC5 Series mobile computers, which seamlessly interfaces with their electronic medical record system.  \n Although the manufacturing sector has been hardest hit in 2020, we are optimistic regarding our prospects of returning to growth soon. We see vibrant opportunity to increase automation in workflows, and we are viewed as a visionary in this market. \n In Q4, we also secured notable wins beyond our traditional end markets. This included a competitive takeaway win with a leading waste hauler in North America. This customer initiated a multiyear rollout of our ET5 Series tablets, accessories and related services for its dispatch application, which is improving training and productivity among its drivers, dispatchers and supervisors. \n Another important win was with one of the largest metropolitan police departments in the United States. Using our TC7 Series mobile computers, along with ZQ5 Series mobile printers, they implemented an automated parking citation application that generated enough revenue to cover their technology investment in a matter of months.  \n In closing, we continue to find substantial opportunities in our primary end markets, and we are excited about the emerging prospects we see in newer markets. We are well-positioned for ongoing success as the need to digitize and automate workflows continues to accelerate.  \n Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike. \nMichael Steele: Thanks, Anders. We'll now open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrew Buscaglia from Berenberg. \nAndrew Buscaglia: So your guidance -- such a strong Q1 guidance, yet for the full year, it seems conservative. And can you talk about what you're expecting towards -- more towards the back half of the year? Because your guidance implies, maybe for EVM, more low single-digit growth, AIT probably going negative in Q4. What's built into that back half? Any color would be great. \nAnders Gustafsson: First, our industry leadership and our steadfast investments in the -- in our broad solutions is what's enabling us to rebound stronger and, I think, faster than our competitors. So we do expect double-digit growth for Q1, but also for the full year 2021. And obviously, this is a strong rebound from a more challenging 2020. We do feel as confident as ever about our business. \n We do expect growth across all our regions, verticals and business lines as we look at 2021. But we are a bit more cautious about our -- the assumptions we put into our second half forecast, given the global macro uncertainty that we're facing. And we're also starting to cycle so much tougher comps in Q4. We should also mention that we're not assuming any growth in large deals or large accounts in the second half of 2021. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. And how much of USPS is in the Q1 guide? Because that's such a big guide. And then maybe any other color you can give us on USPS into Q2 and Q3, maybe the percentage that's accounted for per quarter or something? \nNathan Winters: Yes. So on USPS, the rollout is progressing as we expected. The teams are continuing to be highly engaged. As we noted, the current rollouts around our EMC, the 300,000 TC77s. \n And the 300,000 rollout, we've paused that since October going into the election and holiday season, and we do expect that to resume in late Q1. And really, a modest impact in our Q1 guide. And then for the full year, we expect USPS about 1 point of our sales growth -- or the USPS growth to account for about 1 point of our full year growth, primarily in the first half of the year. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. So not much -- so that Q1 guide, not much -- that's all pure organic. Very little related to USPS. That's just pure like end market demand. Is it primarily in EVM? Or is it -- or is there sort of a bulky order in AIT, or one or the other? \nNathan Winters: Yes. So that's correct on USPS, and I'd say broad-based across both segments in Q1. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Both? Okay. All right. \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, it's been nice to see the business have performed very nicely in Q4 and the outlook for Q1 across all our products and verticals. \nOperator: The next question is from Tommy Moll of Stephens. \nThomas Moll: Anders, I wanted to start with a follow-up on your retail and e-commerce end markets. And in the second half of last year, maybe most of last year, once the pandemic took hold, it sounded like within those end markets, it was larger customers who were leaning in quicker into some of the omnichannel capabilities that you offer. \n Then in today's commentary, you indicated that some small customer activity has resumed and looking positive. Maybe some of that's on the printer side, but I'm curious what you could give us on the mid- or smaller-sized customers within those retail and e-comms end markets? Anything changing for the better there? Or any context would be helpful. \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. First, I'd say that across all the verticals that we play in, we are uniquely positioned to empower front-line workers to perform their duties better and more effectively and with higher customer service, particularly where COVID-19 has helped accelerate some of those secular trends around digitization and automation. So each of our 4 primary verticals had a positive growth trajectory as we entered into 2021, and we're making good progress also in some newer expansion verticals that we talked about in our prepared remarks.  \n Now specifically for retail and e-commerce, I said we saw a step change in consumer adoptions of omnichannel and e-commerce as part of the early phase of COVID. If you look at in-the-store, buy-online, pick-up-at-store and other delivery use-cases, we're growing very rapidly. And in the warehouse, a lot of investments in technology to help automate them are also necessary for retailers to transform their business models. \n And we're starting to see pilots for our Enterprise Asset Intelligence solutions starting to resume. Another trend that we see in retail is around equipping all associates with a device. That's also very synergistic with our Reflexis workforce and task management solutions, where they work very much hand-in-hand. \n And the strength we saw around more small and medium-sized businesses was broad-based. It includes retail. Also, e-commerce is probably a little less of smaller companies, there's more large businesses. But the small and medium-sized business strength that we saw especially expand across the 4 verticals that we work in. \nJoachim Heel: Perhaps in addition from my side, Joe Heel speaking, the -- in the depth of the pandemic, in the Q2, Q3 time frame, we saw that the large retail and e-commerce customers have the wherewithal to continue investing and, in fact, charged headlong, if you will, into transforming their businesses. Whereas small and medium-sized customers paused their spending and were a bit cautious. In particular, outside of the U.S., we saw this phenomenon. \n But we also learned that the solutions that we have, in particular on the printing and scanning side, are essential to these customers. And they ultimately need to come back and refresh those. And that is driving a lot of the pent-up demand that we were seeing in Q4 as they returned to make those essential purchases. \nThomas Moll: That's very helpful. And Anders, you referenced something I wanted to ask as a follow-up, relating to the proof-of-concept-type pilots that you have with some retailers, where, potentially, all associates in the store have some kind of device. What additional color could you give us there just in terms of what inning we're in, in terms of those pilots, when there might be an opportunity for some larger scale commercialization of that concept? \n And then I noted, let's see, last month, end of January, you introduced a new mobile computer series at EC5x and the description there sounded like it might be tied to this pilot concept. So I wonder if you could comment on that product innovation as well to the extent it's related. \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. For our customers to introduce a device for every worker, that's a great opportunity for Zebra, great expansion for us. Our estimate is, today, that in retail, about 1/3 of all store associates are equipped with a device. And I'd say, today, the -- it varies greatly between retailers, how deeply they are penetrated into their associate base with devices. Some are much further along than others. \n We are -- we have worked to basically expand our portfolio of mobile computing devices to ensure that we have kind of appropriate form factors and price points to enable our customers to take this more deeper into their associate base, and we expect that this will be a continued trend. I'm not sure I expect it to be kind of big step-function changes in behaviors, but more looking to continually add to -- add devices to the store associate base to be able to ensure that they are all connected and able to take advantage of all the other digital tools and solutions that the retailers offer. \n I don't know, Joe, if you have any? \nJoachim Heel: Yes, I wanted to just point out 2 other things that I think address this question. One, you're right about the release of the EC5, it's EC50 and EC55, which are devices that combine a consumer-like form factor with all of the advantages that we bring to the enterprise Android ecosystem. And so we expect that, that device, in particular, will play a role in this trend of a device [ for all ]. \n But I also wanted to point out another synergistic part of our strategy, which is the acquisition of Reflexis. Well, Reflexis, as you know, does task and workforce management and, therefore, needs to reach every worker within the enterprise, in particular, of course, retail, which is their dominant vertical. And so, therefore, having a device in the hand of every worker now all of a sudden becomes essential again, and now we're in a great position to meet that demand. \nOperator: The next question is from Jim Ricchiuti of Needham & Company. \nJames Ricchiuti: Anders, I wanted to just follow-up on the comment about the second half and the assumptions around large deals. How does that -- you say you're not assuming large deals. How does that compare with prior years because, typically, some of that large deal activity does materialize, I would assume, as you're going through the year? \nAnders Gustafsson: That's correct. We -- I'd say this is more a matter of limited visibility into the second half than it is, that there's a certainty that there won't be growth in larger deals. I think this is similar to how we generally, I think, forecast our years. So yes. \nJames Ricchiuti: Okay. And I wonder if you could -- my follow-up question is just regarding component constraints. We're hearing throughout the supply chain tightness in semiconductor components. And I'm wondering to what extent that's impacting you guys as you think about your supply chain? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. We've definitely seen the lead times extending. And -- but our team is working diligently, and I think we are on top of it. We have incorporated whatever visibility we have to extended lead times for our semiconductors and other components into our outlook also, particularly for the second half. \nOperator: The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. \nMeta Marshall: Great. I guess I just wanted to dig into how you guys are thinking about gross margins into Q1 and into 2021. Clearly, you guys saw a pickup in kind of your smaller customers, which would have helped gross margins in Q4. You clearly have some large deals and still some kind of overhang from freight as you head through 2021. \n So just how we should be thinking of the progression of gross margins through 2021? And then maybe just as a second question, just given the kind of very healthy cash flow that you guys saw in 2020 and kind of the continuation of that into 2021, how do you guys kind of think about balance sheet prioritization currently? \nNathan Winters: Yes. So if you look at our full year guide, EBITDA of 21% to 22%. We expect gross margin to improve year-on-year, primarily due to the order size mix normalizing, which we saw in Q4 and implied in our Q1 guide. We do expect premium freight costs to persist around $30 million to $40 million, yet declining in the second half as air travel returns. \n And within the full year guide, we do expect OpEx to increase as a percent of sales once you include a full year of Reflexis as well as the majority of our spend returning post-COVID, including incentive compensation and travel, particularly in the second half. I also think it's worth noting when you look at the full year EBITDA guide, Reflexis, as we stated, is going to be a dollar-neutral year, yet slightly dilutive given the investments in go-to-market and the platform. Then we do expect that to scale over time. \n On your second question, if you look at free cash flow, $895 million, a strong finish to the year, really around improved core working capital performance, particularly in AR. We saw very strong collection activity and some early timing at the end of the year as well as our Q4 sales were front-loaded, driving some of the benefit. As well as small incremental AR factoring, lower taxes, interest expense and incentive comp kind of driving the year-on-year beat. So when we look at -- for 2021, we do expect it to decline, but primarily due to just the exceptional 2020 performance and really more normalizing the free cash flow conversion rate over the 2-year period. \nOperator: The next question is from Paul Coster of JPMorgan. \nPaul Coster: I'm just wondering if we are at the sort of inflection point for the company in terms of the sort of mix shift and margin outlook. As the AIT business sort of comes back a bit, will be a bit driven by the smaller accounts here, obviously, has higher margins. But you've also got the software and services business growing faster. \n As far as I can figure it out here, you're probably seeing in excess of 50% growth for the Reflexis business, which has, what, 20 percentage points higher gross margins than the rest of the business. So it sort of feels to me like we're heading towards a new margin structure over the next 3 or 4 years. Can you comment on that? \nAnders Gustafsson: The margin structure or more on the business inflection, generally? \nPaul Coster: Well, not -- yes, the margin, I guess it's related, obviously, Anders. But are gross margins going to be expanding from here on out? And is the business mix, I suppose, going to be permanently changing here? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. Okay. I think Nate is best positioned to answer that. \nNathan Winters: Yes, Paul. So if we look at margin and margin expansion over time, we do believe we can go higher, and we have many levers to achieve that. I think, as you mentioned, scaling some of the newer markets with richer gross margin, Reflexis being one of those proof points. \n We always continue to focus on driving higher gross margin and productivity through all of our operational efficiencies across the business. And we've had a track record of doing that and driving profitable growth. And we do expect EBITDA margins to get back to the pre-pandemic levels in '21, and we really don't see any reason that, that should be constrained as we move forward in terms of continued expansion. \nPaul Coster: I guess I'm not asking my question very well. But with the -- is there going to be a mix shift towards AIT and service and software? And will that drive up the margins structurally over the long-term, not just to pre-pandemic levels, but to sort of almost pre-MSI acquisition levels? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. I'd say, first, maybe think about the business around our core near adjacencies and around the Enterprise Asset Intelligence or Intelligent Edge Solutions, so more the newer stuff. I do believe that our core business, AIT printing and scanning side, including services, are very healthy, good shape, and I expect them to continue to grow at a nice rate over the longer term. \n I don't expect printing to kind of break out from the pack here. Printing has been a bit more up and down over the last year. So we have probably a little bit more of a pent-up demand in printing solutions than we had in some of the other solutions. \n But if you look into our -- the Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision that we have in the Intelligent Edge Solutions, I do expect our software assets and some of our more intelligent automation solutions to grow faster than the company average from a gross margin perspective and, obviously, scale will help us here. But also as we invest in some of the newer solutions, we will -- there will be a kind of investment phase first, and then we will see margins expanding, we believe, quite nicely once revenue is starting to grow. Does that answer your question? \nPaul Coster: Yes. Yes, it does. So just one in passing, on the -- with respect to Reflexis, am I right that it's posting more than 50% compound growth at the moment? And can you just comment on the growth rate for Temptime as well? \nAnders Gustafsson: So we aren't commenting on the specific growth rates that they have. But Reflexis has been growing at a nice double-digit growth rates for the last several years, and we have high expectations that will continue to do that and that it will also help accelerate some of our other -- growth of some of our other software assets that will be benefiting from being associated with and incorporated into the Reflexis platform. And Temptime has had a nice growth over the last few years. And we do see this year the opportunity to accelerate growth as we support COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, also distribution. So we do expect a double-digit growth for our Temptime business as well. \nOperator: The next question is from Joe Aiken of William Blair. \nJoseph Aiken: This is Joe on for Brian today. I want to start -- you mentioned in the prepared remarks some wins beyond your traditional end markets. I think you mentioned a waste hauler in particular. I was wondering if you can maybe just provide a little more color. Any context around what brought you into that win? And maybe what the opportunity is in some different nontraditional end markets that you're seeing and how meaningful that could be going forward? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. I can start with this, and then Joe can also provide some extra color here. But as we have made -- maybe -- so first of all, on the product side, we've invested in addressing some of the use cases that we see in some of these new emerging verticals, government, utilities and so forth. But also, we made meaningful go-to-market investments. \n And we can say they probably started with our acquisition of Xplore. But then we've tweaked our other products to also address these use cases more. So it's been a big focus of ours and investment of ours over the last several years to make sure we position ourselves for this. And we now have a portfolio of solutions and partners that can help us get into these opportunities and win them. Joe? \nJoachim Heel: Yes. I would only add that the end markets that have shown some particular promise  are government, both federal and state and local as well as the broader -- so service industry, where the waste hauling example fits in. The Xplore acquisition, where Xplore has a strong market, the rugged tablets are a strong product offering into those markets, has been instrumental in leading us there. \n But it also has been something we've been pursuing for some time, but it does take some time to build up the channel infrastructure as well as fine-tune the product offering and hire the appropriate type of dedicated and expert sales reps who can operate in those verticals. And we feel we now have that in place, and it's beginning to pay off. \nJoseph Aiken: Great. That's really helpful. And I know, on some past calls, you've talked about the transition to Android on the mobile devices in the past and the benefit you're seeing from that. Is that transition largely over at this point? And maybe just to put a finer point on that, what percentage of devices do you estimate that you're shipping today are running Microsoft operating system? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. First, around our mobile computing platform, overall, we saw solid growth in Q4. We did benefit from a recovery in the small and medium-sized business segment there also. There's 3 trends that I think are worth highlighting. The Android transition is one of those, but I'll start with new use cases. \n We talked earlier about the second trend, which was around -- worth putting a device in the hand of every worker. But the use cases that's probably been the biggest driver, think about the omnichannel and retail. Health care is a newer vertical, which largely is new use cases. And then the third trend around the Android transition. We still have lots of momentum around the Android transition and a lot of opportunity left in that. \n We have -- our market share in Android is still around 60%, but Android now makes up about 80% of our mobile computing sales. We've often talked about the transition from -- transitioning older legacy Windows devices to Android. But today, I think the opportunity to refresh existing installed older Android devices is actually bigger. \n Our estimate is that they're now low double-digit millions of Android devices in the market with a somewhat shorter refresh cycle than the old Windows devices used to have, and which we expect that there's about a high single-digit million Windows devices out there. So it's more of a balanced perspective, and we certainly like to get both of those. And -- but Android has been a great catalyst for growth for us. \nOperator: Next question is from Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird. \nRichard Eastman: Just a quick question. Could you tell us -- the China tariff rebate impacted gross profit margin, did that impact the EVM margin? Was that solely confined to EVM? \nNathan Winters: It was -- thanks for the question. So out of the $12 million, $8 million was associated with EVM, and then $4 million was for AIT in the fourth quarter. \nRichard Eastman: Okay, okay. Yes, in Q4? Okay. And then just a question around maybe the balance that you saw in your go-to-market. So for all of '20, can you just kind of tell us how the direct business did relative to the channel? I'm just thinking sales growth or decline? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. I can start, and then Joe can provide some additional color also. Our direct business obviously did very well because we had a strong large deal activity, but also a lot of the larger customers that we worked with, we have been supporting through channel partners. \n So our channel centricity, so that's how much of our revenues go through channel partners, was actually, I think, at an all-time high in Q3 or Q4. So we have maintained a high degree of channel centricity in the business. Joe? \nJoachim Heel: Yes, exactly. I mean our strategy has been and will be to be a channel-first go-to-market approach. And I think that's paid off very well for us here in the pandemic because the strong relationships with our partners have been instrumental in helping us recover faster, and we're seeing that in particular in the run rate. \n But as Anders said, a large -- if you recall, the contribution of large deals made to our second half, in particular, it's remarkable that the channel centricity, percentage of business going through the channel, has expanded in light of that, right? And that is part of our strategy. \nRichard Eastman: When you speak to some of the smaller and medium customers, is that visibility coming through from the VARs? I mean, again, we speak about the channel, but we obviously put distribution in there versus the VARs. \n And I guess my question is, what's the visibility on the VARs in the smaller and medium-sized customers rebounding in '21? Do you have that visibility either in orders? Or is it kind of frontlog and conversation with VARs or... \nJoachim Heel: Well, so we rarely have visibility to the specific individualized orders on small and medium businesses, right? We have the distribution and channel in between. But what we know is that our distributors have a very strong outlook for the upcoming quarters, at least, and are ordering strongly with us. \n As we indicated, our order volumes have been strong. And that's, I think, a reflection of that optimism that our distributors are feeling, in particular, also from SMB customers. \nRichard Eastman: I see. So when you look into '21 -- I'm really, really trying to get at is, obviously, the gross profit margin assumption, as Nate pointed out, is higher in '21. And is the mix of end-customers there from small to medium? Obviously, you mentioned large orders in the back half of the year, you're a little cautious there. But is that mix supporting that upward migration in the gross margin when you think about '21? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. We expect to have a more traditional mix of business in 2021 than we had in 2020, where, for Q2 and Q3, particularly, large deals were kind of overrepresented. And we do -- as Joe said, we -- our visibility around individual smaller deals are not great, but we are -- our channel account managers do meet with our channel partners and work on forecasts and looking at specific deals and what support they need from us and so forth. So we do have some level of visibility. But obviously, the further out in time you go, the less clear that visibility is. \nRichard Eastman: Yes, I understand. And just staying on this gross margin for 1 more second. From a pricing perspective, what's the assumption going into '21? Do we -- are we able to capture enough price to recover some of the COGS inflation that we're seeing in the business? I mean it would appear so, but is there any price increase, a net price increase that you might expect? Or is it mainly kind of net pricing? \nAnders Gustafsson: So maybe, first, I think, when you talk about COGS increase, is that the freight charges you're referring to? Or... \nRichard Eastman: Yes, so there's freight charges and just any other cost inflation in the supply chain, in your supply chain. \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. I think we -- we don't modify our pricing based on what we believe to be a temporary cost inflation for freight. But we do have a lot of analytics and thoughts around our overall price points and where the market is. And we do always strive to get a premium for our brand. \n So pricing and margin is obviously a very strong focus that we have across the company. But we haven't necessarily gone and changed our price list because of this. Joe, if you want to add anything to that? \nJoachim Heel: Well, yes, maybe another way to think about this is, if you looked back at 2020, the mix of our business, in terms of small versus large, was skewed towards the large, right? Because as I said, the small -- yes, so there was a pause in purchasing from the small that resumed towards the end. \n But in the long-term analysis, small was down relative to the long-term average. In 2021, we expect that, that mix will return closer to normal and, therefore, simply because of the mix effects, we think that the average price points would normalize as well as a result of that, right? That is an effect. \nOperator: The next question is from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. \nKeith Housum: Congratulations on a good quarter and good guidance. Just trying to unpack the printer growth a little bit more. Can you help me understand that, in terms of that growth, is a substantial part of that growth being driven by not only the SMBs, but also growth in the supplies business as well? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. We had, obviously, great growth in both printing and supplies. Both printing and supplies were up double-digits in the quarter. Our printing business is up across the portfolio. We did, I think, benefit from some pent-up demand, particularly in EMEA. Remember, EMEA also was hit harder early on in the pandemic. So there was probably a little bit more of a rebound to be had there. \n I'd also say, though, that we have, early in 2020, we took a number of actions to strengthen our go-to-market and strengthen our channel ecosystem, particularly around printing. And I think that is now bearing fruit for us also. So we are more competitive, and that's helping to accelerate our share gains in printing, specifically. \n But we did see our business through -- or our smaller business -- small and mid-sized business recover quite nicely. We recovered faster than we had expected. I think it's fair to say, in Q4, manufacturing has been a relatively light vertical. We have a much -- strong vertical for printing, generally, but lighter over the last year, but that was also coming back and strengthening. And RFID was actually a very strong quarter for printing. I think it was a record quarter for print RFID.  \n And then on supplies, we did see a strong performance in supplies, particularly in North America. And Temptime also had a strong fourth quarter. But overall, though, I'd say that we have a very strong portfolio of smart and connected printers that have an unrivaled manageability through our Link-OS operating system, and that is a true differentiator in the market. \nKeith Housum: Okay, appreciate it. And then just a follow-up, I think a comment made earlier during the Q&A, and I think the commentary was that the U.S. Postal Service will contribute about 1% growth for the year, with most of that coming in the first half, but I also heard you guys say that it's going to be only very modest for the first quarter. \n So that could imply, if my -- if my math is right, that you guys could have a $400 million contribution in the second quarter from the U.S. Postal Service? Is that right, and does that include, I guess, ancillary projects as well as the main 300,000 devices being fulfilled? \nNathan Winters: Yes. So if you look at the USPS for the year, regarding the size of the rollout, I think if you look at the 300,000 printers and what we expect to deliver in the -- throughout 2021, I think you can -- you really do the implication of we're selling about 2 million mobile computers annually. And that can help you infer in terms of an average price range. I think the number you have for Q2 is a little bit higher than what we'd anticipate in terms of the full year implied guide. \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. Remember, we've talked about earlier, the total volume of mobile computers for USPS, this contract is about 300,000 over 2 years. \nKeith Housum: Understood. Understood. Yes. Just doing the math there, I guess, that $400 million, roughly, I understand it might be a little bit high. It seems a little bit more than a lot of us were assuming for the entire value of the contract. And we realize you guys fulfilled some last year as well as what you'll fulfill this year. So it seems, again, perhaps higher than what a lot of us were assuming. \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. As I said, I think the best way for you to think about USPS this year is the 1% of our growth in 2021 is coming from growth of our USPS business. And I wouldn't say Q2 is the only quarter, but Q1 will start ramping up towards the end of Q1, but Q2, Q3 will certainly be part of it. \nKeith Housum: Oh, it's 1% of your growth, not 1% of your business? Okay. Got it. \nJoachim Heel: Correct. Yes. \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, yes. 1% of our growth, yes. \nOperator: The next question is from Blake Gendron of Wolfe Research. \nBlake Gendron: I want to follow-up there with some of the growth commentary. So \n [Audio Gap]\n Dollar impact from what you would consider pent-up demand to be greater or less than 4Q? And do you expect some pent-up demand follow-through into the second quarter? And I guess, longer term, I mean, are we going to see this pent-up demand idiosyncrasy show up in subsequent years just based on the replacement cycle? Or is it going to normalize fairly quickly as we recover here on the pandemic? \nAnders Gustafsson: Well, yes, the pent-up demand concept is a little hard to get -- be overly specific about the impact of it. But I'd say that, starting with our products and solutions, are now mission-critical for our enterprise customers, and they need that to compete effectively in their on-demand economy. The sales to our larger companies, larger customers that we talked about in an earlier question, remained strong. \n And they have prioritized spend with us to better position themselves to address the newer automation and digitization trends like omnichannel, as an example. And I'd say our larger customers who are better positioned to pivot their businesses early in the pandemic, to align with how consumers wanted to behave how the economy was working at that point, while smaller customers had to kind of pause spending or certainly cut back on it.  \n But I think, now, we see the smaller companies coming back and other customers are also realizing that they need to invest in order to compete. Competing in the same way they did prior to COVID is not necessarily going to be a successful formula. And I think that part of this is also that we have been able to execute very well during the pandemic, and we've been able to gain share. Our supply chain has shown great agility to be able to respond to customers that quickly want to ramp up their order volumes, and I think we were able to do that well and seize some opportunities that way. \n So we have been realizing some good demand from this pent-up demand, you can say, which helped us in Q4, and I expect it to help us in Q1 here also. But more broadly, though, as we look forward, we are very excited about the business overall and the growth prospects that we have not just in Q4, Q1, but the longer term, based on our ability to help our customers digitize and automate their businesses. \nNathan Winters: Yes. And Blake, just to add, this is Nathan. It's obviously, as Anders mentioned, a tough one to quantify. If you look at our Q1 guide, we kind of think of the pent-up demand is likely contributing low double-digit growth on top of mid-teen growth from what you can say is our normal growth rates the impact of acquisitions, FX, as well as cycling from a comp perspective versus last year, where we had -- we started to feel the impacts of COVID late in Q1 last year. \nBlake Gendron: Yes, that's helpful. I understand it's tough to quantify and disaggregate everything. But the longer-term growth outlook is kind of what I was getting at, and that's constructive. \n My follow-up is on EVM. I'm just wondering, over the last, call it, 12 months or through the pandemic, what the growth of existing customers is with EVM versus new customer wins? How you see that evolving, I guess, here over 2021 and beyond? And is there any major margin difference between one or the other? Or should we think about EVM kind of along the same lines and delineate large versus small customers in terms of margin difference? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. I'd start by saying, new customers -- if you're looking for kind of brand-new customers that haven't done any business with us, it's rare that we have those because most companies are doing some level of business with us. So it's probably more that we have new awards or new use cases with those customers. Again, it's -- we can only -- we really only have visibility into that for our larger customers. And I think we've had a good healthy clip of new customers, and I expect that we will continue to add new use cases, new applications. \n If you look at our portfolio of solutions, we've invested meaningfully to ensure we can expand the number of use cases that help address our customers' most pressing problems. So we feel good about our competitive positioning and our ability to win some of these new use cases. They may not necessarily be brand-new customers, but they're brand-new use-cases. \n Joe, I don't know if you have any comments? \nJoachim Heel: Yes. I mean I would add, I mean, to your point about is there a big margin difference between the 2, I would say, not noticeably. The new customers that we are able to acquire, so ones that were previously competitor customers, there have been meaningful ones, of course, right? \n I mean, USPS is one example of those that was in the last 12 months. But they do range from the small to the large and, therefore, I would expect, without having done the analysis, that there isn't a meaningful margin difference between the 2. \nBlake Gendron: That's very helpful. One more, if I can sneak it in here. Your balance sheet is in great shape. I wonder if you could just level set the capital allocation thoughts here, and maybe update us on the M&A pipeline? \nNathan Winters: Yes. I'll start. We ended the year at 1.2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, which is below our 2.5x target maximum. Our priority remains organic and inorganic investment in the business, and we're excited about the opportunities we see both of those -- in both of those areas. We do have our share repurchase, and we believe that's a flexible way to return capital. And we'll remain opportunistic in that approach, which is evidenced by our $200 million repurchased in 2020, and we'll continue that into this year. \nAnders Gustafsson: You know,  on M&A, we're certainly very excited about the outlook for our business. And M&A is a -- we think of it as a growth vector for the business. We think of M&A as a way for us to accelerate the execution on our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. So it's not a stand-alone growth driver. It is something that we think about how -- and a way for us to accelerate the execution on our vision. \n We're targeting, I'd say, select bolt-on acquisitions as well as higher-growth acquisitions that can truly help move our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision forward. We see good opportunities in digitizing and automating supply chains and different workflows. And we -- as Nate talked about, we have a strong balance sheet that can support that. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gustafsson for closing remarks. \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. To wrap up, I would like to thank our employees and partners for our exceptional Q4 results and a strong start to 2021. And as we continue to navigate the pandemic, our top priority continues to be protecting the health and well-being of our employees, partners and customers. So stay safe, everyone. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anders Gustafsson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am proud of our employees' resiliency and focus on serving our customers critical needs during the pandemic. Through their efforts, we were able to deliver exceptional results to close out a challenging 2020. \n For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of more than 10% or more than 8% on an organic basis; an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.5%, a 210 basis point year-over-year improvement; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.46, a 25% increase from the prior year; and strong free cash flow. Each of these measures significantly exceeded our outlook.  \n We generated more business in Q4 than any other quarter in our history. Our teams executed well to satisfy a faster-than-expected recovery in demand from smaller customers through our distribution channel, particularly for our printing solutions. Demand from our large customers also continued to be strong due to their need to digitize and automate workflows in an increasingly on-demand economy. \n We also drove improved profitability and cash flow, while investing in research and development projects to drive sustainable, profitable growth. Our record Q4 results capped a challenging full year 2020, in which we realized slight declines in sales and earnings per share. However, we did achieve record free cash flow of $895 million for the year. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q4 financial results in more detail and discuss our 2021 outlook. Thank you, Nathan. Our team has done a fantastic job executing in a challenging environment. We have strong momentum entering 2021, supported by our order backlog and pipeline of business. We continue to build on our industry-leading offerings by investing in our people, operations and innovation to drive sustainable growth. In 2020, we acquired Reflexis and launched a record number of new products and solutions to ensure that we continue to advance our industry leadership position. \n Slide 10 highlights how we are building on our foundational capabilities to elevate our value proposition. We are uniquely positioned to solve our customers' complex operational challenges. Our unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast installed base of products and solutions can be harnessed to gain real-time actionable insights. The result is a more intelligent enterprise, with optimized workflows.  \n Through the pandemic, there has been a dramatic increase in the adoption of omnichannel and online shopping. Retailers need proven solutions to overcome the significant fulfillment challenges posed by this profound behavioral shift. If goods are not delivered or made available for pickup, as promised, the retailer risks losing its shopper to a competitor. To address this issue, retailers have been prioritizing their capital spend in our broad portfolio of solutions with a sense of urgency. \n We are enabling retailers to generate an unprecedented amount of valuable data captured through mobile computers, point-of-sale systems, RFID and other intelligent automation solutions, all of which are critical to digitizing their operations. Key benefits to the retailer include: better operational visibility and insights; increased employee collaboration and labor productivity, improved inventory accuracy, well-equipped associates with real-time actionable information, and more satisfied customers. \n Last month, we participated in the National Retail Federation's virtual sessions, where we showcased how Zebra's solutions help retailers deliver a superior omnichannel shopping experience. At one of the sessions, AutoZone explained how our Reflexis workforce and task management solution equipped their associates with highly flexible mobile technology that enables enhanced customer responsiveness and provides insightful data for analytics and reporting. We are proud to enable AutoZone to go the extra mile to delight its shoppers.  \n Now turning to Slide 12. We continue to be excited about our opportunity to help our customers meet their mission-critical needs in an increasingly on-demand economy. As a trusted strategic partner, we orchestrate end-to-end workflows for customers in a variety of end markets. As I mentioned, retailers continue to prioritize investment in our products and solutions to address their omnichannel fulfillment strategies and related warehouse automation needs. \n In Q4, we secured multi-million dollar orders from a range of e-tailers, mass merchants, grocers, department stores and auto parts retailers. In transportation and logistics, strong e-commerce growth continues to drive parcel volumes, while last-mile on-demand fulfillment has become increasingly important. \n The Italian Post recently selected our printing and scanning solutions for their 13,000 post offices. Separately, the deployment of our TC7 Series mobile computers to United States Postal Service carriers is on track to resume as expected in late Q1, with a goal of completion in Q3. In health care, the need for increased real-time visibility into the entire patient journey as well as the demand for innovative solutions to provide safe and efficient care continue to make health care, our highest-growth end market opportunity. \n In Q4, we grew our relationship with one of America's leading health care providers. New acute care applications have made it increasingly important for this customer to equip more of their clinicians with mobile computers. The most recent use case we addressed was COVID drive-through testing with our health care-purposed TC5 Series mobile computers, which seamlessly interfaces with their electronic medical record system.  \n Although the manufacturing sector has been hardest hit in 2020, we are optimistic regarding our prospects of returning to growth soon. We see vibrant opportunity to increase automation in workflows, and we are viewed as a visionary in this market. \n In Q4, we also secured notable wins beyond our traditional end markets. This included a competitive takeaway win with a leading waste hauler in North America. This customer initiated a multiyear rollout of our ET5 Series tablets, accessories and related services for its dispatch application, which is improving training and productivity among its drivers, dispatchers and supervisors. \n Another important win was with one of the largest metropolitan police departments in the United States. Using our TC7 Series mobile computers, along with ZQ5 Series mobile printers, they implemented an automated parking citation application that generated enough revenue to cover their technology investment in a matter of months.  \n In closing, we continue to find substantial opportunities in our primary end markets, and we are excited about the emerging prospects we see in newer markets. We are well-positioned for ongoing success as the need to digitize and automate workflows continues to accelerate.  \n Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike. First, our industry leadership and our steadfast investments in the -- in our broad solutions is what's enabling us to rebound stronger and, I think, faster than our competitors. So we do expect double-digit growth for Q1, but also for the full year 2021. And obviously, this is a strong rebound from a more challenging 2020. We do feel as confident as ever about our business. \n We do expect growth across all our regions, verticals and business lines as we look at 2021. But we are a bit more cautious about our -- the assumptions we put into our second half forecast, given the global macro uncertainty that we're facing. And we're also starting to cycle so much tougher comps in Q4. We should also mention that we're not assuming any growth in large deals or large accounts in the second half of 2021. Yes, it's been nice to see the business have performed very nicely in Q4 and the outlook for Q1 across all our products and verticals. Yes. First, I'd say that across all the verticals that we play in, we are uniquely positioned to empower front-line workers to perform their duties better and more effectively and with higher customer service, particularly where COVID-19 has helped accelerate some of those secular trends around digitization and automation. So each of our 4 primary verticals had a positive growth trajectory as we entered into 2021, and we're making good progress also in some newer expansion verticals that we talked about in our prepared remarks.  \n Now specifically for retail and e-commerce, I said we saw a step change in consumer adoptions of omnichannel and e-commerce as part of the early phase of COVID. If you look at in-the-store, buy-online, pick-up-at-store and other delivery use-cases, we're growing very rapidly. And in the warehouse, a lot of investments in technology to help automate them are also necessary for retailers to transform their business models. \n And we're starting to see pilots for our Enterprise Asset Intelligence solutions starting to resume. Another trend that we see in retail is around equipping all associates with a device. That's also very synergistic with our Reflexis workforce and task management solutions, where they work very much hand-in-hand. \n And the strength we saw around more small and medium-sized businesses was broad-based. It includes retail. Also, e-commerce is probably a little less of smaller companies, there's more large businesses. But the small and medium-sized business strength that we saw especially expand across the 4 verticals that we work in. Yes. For our customers to introduce a device for every worker, that's a great opportunity for Zebra, great expansion for us. Our estimate is, today, that in retail, about 1/3 of all store associates are equipped with a device. And I'd say, today, the -- it varies greatly between retailers, how deeply they are penetrated into their associate base with devices. Some are much further along than others. \n We are -- we have worked to basically expand our portfolio of mobile computing devices to ensure that we have kind of appropriate form factors and price points to enable our customers to take this more deeper into their associate base, and we expect that this will be a continued trend. I'm not sure I expect it to be kind of big step-function changes in behaviors, but more looking to continually add to -- add devices to the store associate base to be able to ensure that they are all connected and able to take advantage of all the other digital tools and solutions that the retailers offer. \n I don't know, Joe, if you have any? That's correct. We -- I'd say this is more a matter of limited visibility into the second half than it is, that there's a certainty that there won't be growth in larger deals. I think this is similar to how we generally, I think, forecast our years. So yes. Yes. We've definitely seen the lead times extending. And -- but our team is working diligently, and I think we are on top of it. We have incorporated whatever visibility we have to extended lead times for our semiconductors and other components into our outlook also, particularly for the second half. The margin structure or more on the business inflection, generally? Yes. Okay. I think Nate is best positioned to answer that. Yes. I'd say, first, maybe think about the business around our core near adjacencies and around the Enterprise Asset Intelligence or Intelligent Edge Solutions, so more the newer stuff. I do believe that our core business, AIT printing and scanning side, including services, are very healthy, good shape, and I expect them to continue to grow at a nice rate over the longer term. \n I don't expect printing to kind of break out from the pack here. Printing has been a bit more up and down over the last year. So we have probably a little bit more of a pent-up demand in printing solutions than we had in some of the other solutions. \n But if you look into our -- the Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision that we have in the Intelligent Edge Solutions, I do expect our software assets and some of our more intelligent automation solutions to grow faster than the company average from a gross margin perspective and, obviously, scale will help us here. But also as we invest in some of the newer solutions, we will -- there will be a kind of investment phase first, and then we will see margins expanding, we believe, quite nicely once revenue is starting to grow. Does that answer your question? So we aren't commenting on the specific growth rates that they have. But Reflexis has been growing at a nice double-digit growth rates for the last several years, and we have high expectations that will continue to do that and that it will also help accelerate some of our other -- growth of some of our other software assets that will be benefiting from being associated with and incorporated into the Reflexis platform. And Temptime has had a nice growth over the last few years. And we do see this year the opportunity to accelerate growth as we support COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, also distribution. So we do expect a double-digit growth for our Temptime business as well. Yes. I can start with this, and then Joe can also provide some extra color here. But as we have made -- maybe -- so first of all, on the product side, we've invested in addressing some of the use cases that we see in some of these new emerging verticals, government, utilities and so forth. But also, we made meaningful go-to-market investments. \n And we can say they probably started with our acquisition of Xplore. But then we've tweaked our other products to also address these use cases more. So it's been a big focus of ours and investment of ours over the last several years to make sure we position ourselves for this. And we now have a portfolio of solutions and partners that can help us get into these opportunities and win them. Joe? Yes. First, around our mobile computing platform, overall, we saw solid growth in Q4. We did benefit from a recovery in the small and medium-sized business segment there also. There's 3 trends that I think are worth highlighting. The Android transition is one of those, but I'll start with new use cases. \n We talked earlier about the second trend, which was around -- worth putting a device in the hand of every worker. But the use cases that's probably been the biggest driver, think about the omnichannel and retail. Health care is a newer vertical, which largely is new use cases. And then the third trend around the Android transition. We still have lots of momentum around the Android transition and a lot of opportunity left in that. \n We have -- our market share in Android is still around 60%, but Android now makes up about 80% of our mobile computing sales. We've often talked about the transition from -- transitioning older legacy Windows devices to Android. But today, I think the opportunity to refresh existing installed older Android devices is actually bigger. \n Our estimate is that they're now low double-digit millions of Android devices in the market with a somewhat shorter refresh cycle than the old Windows devices used to have, and which we expect that there's about a high single-digit million Windows devices out there. So it's more of a balanced perspective, and we certainly like to get both of those. And -- but Android has been a great catalyst for growth for us. Yes. I can start, and then Joe can provide some additional color also. Our direct business obviously did very well because we had a strong large deal activity, but also a lot of the larger customers that we worked with, we have been supporting through channel partners. \n So our channel centricity, so that's how much of our revenues go through channel partners, was actually, I think, at an all-time high in Q3 or Q4. So we have maintained a high degree of channel centricity in the business. Joe? Yes. We expect to have a more traditional mix of business in 2021 than we had in 2020, where, for Q2 and Q3, particularly, large deals were kind of overrepresented. And we do -- as Joe said, we -- our visibility around individual smaller deals are not great, but we are -- our channel account managers do meet with our channel partners and work on forecasts and looking at specific deals and what support they need from us and so forth. So we do have some level of visibility. But obviously, the further out in time you go, the less clear that visibility is. So maybe, first, I think, when you talk about COGS increase, is that the freight charges you're referring to? Or... Yes. I think we -- we don't modify our pricing based on what we believe to be a temporary cost inflation for freight. But we do have a lot of analytics and thoughts around our overall price points and where the market is. And we do always strive to get a premium for our brand. \n So pricing and margin is obviously a very strong focus that we have across the company. But we haven't necessarily gone and changed our price list because of this. Joe, if you want to add anything to that? Yes. We had, obviously, great growth in both printing and supplies. Both printing and supplies were up double-digits in the quarter. Our printing business is up across the portfolio. We did, I think, benefit from some pent-up demand, particularly in EMEA. Remember, EMEA also was hit harder early on in the pandemic. So there was probably a little bit more of a rebound to be had there. \n I'd also say, though, that we have, early in 2020, we took a number of actions to strengthen our go-to-market and strengthen our channel ecosystem, particularly around printing. And I think that is now bearing fruit for us also. So we are more competitive, and that's helping to accelerate our share gains in printing, specifically. \n But we did see our business through -- or our smaller business -- small and mid-sized business recover quite nicely. We recovered faster than we had expected. I think it's fair to say, in Q4, manufacturing has been a relatively light vertical. We have a much -- strong vertical for printing, generally, but lighter over the last year, but that was also coming back and strengthening. And RFID was actually a very strong quarter for printing. I think it was a record quarter for print RFID.  \n And then on supplies, we did see a strong performance in supplies, particularly in North America. And Temptime also had a strong fourth quarter. But overall, though, I'd say that we have a very strong portfolio of smart and connected printers that have an unrivaled manageability through our Link-OS operating system, and that is a true differentiator in the market. Yes. Remember, we've talked about earlier, the total volume of mobile computers for USPS, this contract is about 300,000 over 2 years. Yes. As I said, I think the best way for you to think about USPS this year is the 1% of our growth in 2021 is coming from growth of our USPS business. And I wouldn't say Q2 is the only quarter, but Q1 will start ramping up towards the end of Q1, but Q2, Q3 will certainly be part of it. Yes, yes. 1% of our growth, yes. Well, yes, the pent-up demand concept is a little hard to get -- be overly specific about the impact of it. But I'd say that, starting with our products and solutions, are now mission-critical for our enterprise customers, and they need that to compete effectively in their on-demand economy. The sales to our larger companies, larger customers that we talked about in an earlier question, remained strong. \n And they have prioritized spend with us to better position themselves to address the newer automation and digitization trends like omnichannel, as an example. And I'd say our larger customers who are better positioned to pivot their businesses early in the pandemic, to align with how consumers wanted to behave how the economy was working at that point, while smaller customers had to kind of pause spending or certainly cut back on it.  \n But I think, now, we see the smaller companies coming back and other customers are also realizing that they need to invest in order to compete. Competing in the same way they did prior to COVID is not necessarily going to be a successful formula. And I think that part of this is also that we have been able to execute very well during the pandemic, and we've been able to gain share. Our supply chain has shown great agility to be able to respond to customers that quickly want to ramp up their order volumes, and I think we were able to do that well and seize some opportunities that way. \n So we have been realizing some good demand from this pent-up demand, you can say, which helped us in Q4, and I expect it to help us in Q1 here also. But more broadly, though, as we look forward, we are very excited about the business overall and the growth prospects that we have not just in Q4, Q1, but the longer term, based on our ability to help our customers digitize and automate their businesses. Yes. I'd start by saying, new customers -- if you're looking for kind of brand-new customers that haven't done any business with us, it's rare that we have those because most companies are doing some level of business with us. So it's probably more that we have new awards or new use cases with those customers. Again, it's -- we can only -- we really only have visibility into that for our larger customers. And I think we've had a good healthy clip of new customers, and I expect that we will continue to add new use cases, new applications. \n If you look at our portfolio of solutions, we've invested meaningfully to ensure we can expand the number of use cases that help address our customers' most pressing problems. So we feel good about our competitive positioning and our ability to win some of these new use cases. They may not necessarily be brand-new customers, but they're brand-new use-cases. \n Joe, I don't know if you have any comments? You know,  on M&A, we're certainly very excited about the outlook for our business. And M&A is a -- we think of it as a growth vector for the business. We think of M&A as a way for us to accelerate the execution on our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. So it's not a stand-alone growth driver. It is something that we think about how -- and a way for us to accelerate the execution on our vision. \n We're targeting, I'd say, select bolt-on acquisitions as well as higher-growth acquisitions that can truly help move our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision forward. We see good opportunities in digitizing and automating supply chains and different workflows. And we -- as Nate talked about, we have a strong balance sheet that can support that. Yes. To wrap up, I would like to thank our employees and partners for our exceptional Q4 results and a strong start to 2021. And as we continue to navigate the pandemic, our top priority continues to be protecting the health and well-being of our employees, partners and customers. So stay safe, everyone."

            "name": "Nathan Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q4, we returned to profitable growth after a particularly challenging first 9 months of the year. Net sales increased 8.3% before the impact of currency and acquisitions. Our sales mix of large and small orders normalized to pre-pandemic levels, driven by a recovery of our run-rate business, which was driven in part by pent-up demand. \n Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment, including printing and supplies, significantly benefited from the recovery in smaller business demand, with segment sales increasing 14% from the prior year. Our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 5.6%, driven by solid growth in enterprise mobile computing solutions. We also realized strong growth in services and software, driven by our managed and support services and Zebra retail solutions. \n From a regional perspective, we realized solid year-over-year growth in North America and significant growth in EMEA, while Asia Pac and Latin America were slower to recover. In North America, sales increased 6%. Printing, supplies, data capture and services were bright spots. In EMEA, sales increased 20%. Printing, supplies, mobile computing and services grew double-digits as we saw strong demand through our partner distribution channel. \n APAC sales were down 4% year-over-year, yet increased sequentially. Printing and mobile computing were bright spots, and we saw modest growth in China. Latin America sales declined 15%, with all major product and service categories declining in a challenging macro environment. \n Adjusted gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 47.8%, driven primarily by a $12 million recovery of China import tariffs paid in prior periods and improved services and software margin. Business mix had a negligible impact on year-on-year margin comparisons. Additionally, this quarter's results were impacted by $10 million of premium freight costs. \n Adjusted operating expenses increased $28 million from the prior year period and improved 20 basis points as a percentage of sales. We continue to diligently manage costs, while accelerating high-return investments in the business. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.5%, a 210 basis point increase from the prior year period, primarily driven by higher gross margin. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.46, a $0.90 or 25.3% year-over-year increase.  \n Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $895 million of free cash flow in full year 2020. This was $271 million higher than the prior year. Free cash flow conversion of 130% was significantly higher than our target of 100%, primarily due to timing of customer collections and vendor payments. \n Lower 2020 payments of incentive compensation, taxes and interest also contributed to the improvement. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended 2020 at 1.2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is comfortably below our target maximum of 2.5x.  \n Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered the new year with a strong order backlog and healthy channel inventory levels. We are encouraged by the pickup in demand, primarily from our smaller customers, which includes pent-up demand from those who had paused spending during the peak of the pandemic. This momentum, along with our sales pipeline, positions us well for double-digit sales growth for the first quarter and full year 2021. \n In Q1, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 25% and 29%. This outlook assumes a 300 to 350 basis point additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes. We anticipate Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin of slightly higher than 23%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.50. \n For the full year 2021, we anticipate adjusted net sales growth between 10% and 14%, with growth moderating through the year as we cycle more challenging comparisons and navigate a continued uncertain global economic recovery. This outlook assumes approximately 3 percentage points additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and foreign currency changes. We anticipate full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin between 21% and 22%, which assumes gross margin expansion from the prior year.  \n We expect free cash flow to be at least $700 million for the year. We do not expect to repeat the exceptionally high level of free cash flow conversion that we achieved in 2020. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. \n With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we're advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision in our end markets. Yes. So on USPS, the rollout is progressing as we expected. The teams are continuing to be highly engaged. As we noted, the current rollouts around our EMC, the 300,000 TC77s. \n And the 300,000 rollout, we've paused that since October going into the election and holiday season, and we do expect that to resume in late Q1. And really, a modest impact in our Q1 guide. And then for the full year, we expect USPS about 1 point of our sales growth -- or the USPS growth to account for about 1 point of our full year growth, primarily in the first half of the year. Yes. So that's correct on USPS, and I'd say broad-based across both segments in Q1. Yes. So if you look at our full year guide, EBITDA of 21% to 22%. We expect gross margin to improve year-on-year, primarily due to the order size mix normalizing, which we saw in Q4 and implied in our Q1 guide. We do expect premium freight costs to persist around $30 million to $40 million, yet declining in the second half as air travel returns. \n And within the full year guide, we do expect OpEx to increase as a percent of sales once you include a full year of Reflexis as well as the majority of our spend returning post-COVID, including incentive compensation and travel, particularly in the second half. I also think it's worth noting when you look at the full year EBITDA guide, Reflexis, as we stated, is going to be a dollar-neutral year, yet slightly dilutive given the investments in go-to-market and the platform. Then we do expect that to scale over time. \n On your second question, if you look at free cash flow, $895 million, a strong finish to the year, really around improved core working capital performance, particularly in AR. We saw very strong collection activity and some early timing at the end of the year as well as our Q4 sales were front-loaded, driving some of the benefit. As well as small incremental AR factoring, lower taxes, interest expense and incentive comp kind of driving the year-on-year beat. So when we look at -- for 2021, we do expect it to decline, but primarily due to just the exceptional 2020 performance and really more normalizing the free cash flow conversion rate over the 2-year period. Yes, Paul. So if we look at margin and margin expansion over time, we do believe we can go higher, and we have many levers to achieve that. I think, as you mentioned, scaling some of the newer markets with richer gross margin, Reflexis being one of those proof points. \n We always continue to focus on driving higher gross margin and productivity through all of our operational efficiencies across the business. And we've had a track record of doing that and driving profitable growth. And we do expect EBITDA margins to get back to the pre-pandemic levels in '21, and we really don't see any reason that, that should be constrained as we move forward in terms of continued expansion. It was -- thanks for the question. So out of the $12 million, $8 million was associated with EVM, and then $4 million was for AIT in the fourth quarter. Yes. So if you look at the USPS for the year, regarding the size of the rollout, I think if you look at the 300,000 printers and what we expect to deliver in the -- throughout 2021, I think you can -- you really do the implication of we're selling about 2 million mobile computers annually. And that can help you infer in terms of an average price range. I think the number you have for Q2 is a little bit higher than what we'd anticipate in terms of the full year implied guide. Yes. And Blake, just to add, this is Nathan. It's obviously, as Anders mentioned, a tough one to quantify. If you look at our Q1 guide, we kind of think of the pent-up demand is likely contributing low double-digit growth on top of mid-teen growth from what you can say is our normal growth rates the impact of acquisitions, FX, as well as cycling from a comp perspective versus last year, where we had -- we started to feel the impacts of COVID late in Q1 last year. Yes. I'll start. We ended the year at 1.2x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, which is below our 2.5x target maximum. Our priority remains organic and inorganic investment in the business, and we're excited about the opportunities we see both of those -- in both of those areas. We do have our share repurchase, and we believe that's a flexible way to return capital. And we'll remain opportunistic in that approach, which is evidenced by our $200 million repurchased in 2020, and we'll continue that into this year."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Joachim Heel",
            "content": "Perhaps in addition from my side, Joe Heel speaking, the -- in the depth of the pandemic, in the Q2, Q3 time frame, we saw that the large retail and e-commerce customers have the wherewithal to continue investing and, in fact, charged headlong, if you will, into transforming their businesses. Whereas small and medium-sized customers paused their spending and were a bit cautious. In particular, outside of the U.S., we saw this phenomenon. \n But we also learned that the solutions that we have, in particular on the printing and scanning side, are essential to these customers. And they ultimately need to come back and refresh those. And that is driving a lot of the pent-up demand that we were seeing in Q4 as they returned to make those essential purchases. Yes, I wanted to just point out 2 other things that I think address this question. One, you're right about the release of the EC5, it's EC50 and EC55, which are devices that combine a consumer-like form factor with all of the advantages that we bring to the enterprise Android ecosystem. And so we expect that, that device, in particular, will play a role in this trend of a device [ for all ]. \n But I also wanted to point out another synergistic part of our strategy, which is the acquisition of Reflexis. Well, Reflexis, as you know, does task and workforce management and, therefore, needs to reach every worker within the enterprise, in particular, of course, retail, which is their dominant vertical. And so, therefore, having a device in the hand of every worker now all of a sudden becomes essential again, and now we're in a great position to meet that demand. Yes. I would only add that the end markets that have shown some particular promise  are government, both federal and state and local as well as the broader -- so service industry, where the waste hauling example fits in. The Xplore acquisition, where Xplore has a strong market, the rugged tablets are a strong product offering into those markets, has been instrumental in leading us there. \n But it also has been something we've been pursuing for some time, but it does take some time to build up the channel infrastructure as well as fine-tune the product offering and hire the appropriate type of dedicated and expert sales reps who can operate in those verticals. And we feel we now have that in place, and it's beginning to pay off. Yes, exactly. I mean our strategy has been and will be to be a channel-first go-to-market approach. And I think that's paid off very well for us here in the pandemic because the strong relationships with our partners have been instrumental in helping us recover faster, and we're seeing that in particular in the run rate. \n But as Anders said, a large -- if you recall, the contribution of large deals made to our second half, in particular, it's remarkable that the channel centricity, percentage of business going through the channel, has expanded in light of that, right? And that is part of our strategy. Well, so we rarely have visibility to the specific individualized orders on small and medium businesses, right? We have the distribution and channel in between. But what we know is that our distributors have a very strong outlook for the upcoming quarters, at least, and are ordering strongly with us. \n As we indicated, our order volumes have been strong. And that's, I think, a reflection of that optimism that our distributors are feeling, in particular, also from SMB customers. Well, yes, maybe another way to think about this is, if you looked back at 2020, the mix of our business, in terms of small versus large, was skewed towards the large, right? Because as I said, the small -- yes, so there was a pause in purchasing from the small that resumed towards the end. \n But in the long-term analysis, small was down relative to the long-term average. In 2021, we expect that, that mix will return closer to normal and, therefore, simply because of the mix effects, we think that the average price points would normalize as well as a result of that, right? That is an effect. Correct. Yes. Yes. I mean I would add, I mean, to your point about is there a big margin difference between the 2, I would say, not noticeably. The new customers that we are able to acquire, so ones that were previously competitor customers, there have been meaningful ones, of course, right? \n I mean, USPS is one example of those that was in the last 12 months. But they do range from the small to the large and, therefore, I would expect, without having done the analysis, that there isn't a meaningful margin difference between the 2."

I now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nMichael Steele: Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's Third Quarter Conference Call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least 1 year.\n Slide 2 conveys that the forward-looking statements we make today are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our SEC filings.  \n During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release.  \n Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition.  \n This presentation will include prepared remarks from Anders Gustafsson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our acting Chief Financial Officer. Anders will begin with our third quarter results, then Nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our fourth quarter outlook. Anders will conclude with progress on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision and trends in our end markets. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Senior Vice President of Global Sales, will join us as we take your questions.  \n Now let's flip to Slide 4 as I turn the call over to Anders. \nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are honored that our solutions are empowering frontline workers in the battle against COVID-19. I am proud of our employees' resiliency and focus on serving our customers' critical needs during these challenging times. Our top priority continues to be protecting the health and well-being of our employees, customers and partners as businesses continue to progress with their reopening plans.  \n In Q3, our results continued to be pressured by the global macro environment. For the quarter, we realized net sales growth of 30 basis points; adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.3%, which contracted by 240 basis points; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.27, a 5% decrease from the prior year.  \n As a result of excellent execution by our teams and a faster than expected recovery in demand, each of these measures exceeded our outlook. Demand from our large strategic customers has been at record levels, driven by accelerated trends to digitize and automate workflows. Not surprisingly, the pandemic has disproportionately impacted our smaller customers in certain end markets, which has resulted in a significant shift in business mix. Together with premium shipping costs, this has weighed on gross margin. In light of this pressure, we have continued to diligently manage discretionary costs to preserve profitability and cash flow.  \n Despite the challenging environment, our enterprise customers have been prioritizing spend with Zebra, and I would like to highlight some notable Q3 success stories. We expanded our relationship with a leading e-commerce retailer experiencing significantly increased order volumes. They require trusted technology solutions that enable improved supply chain and order fulfillment execution to empower their labor force. We are deploying our mobile computing, scanning and printing solutions across their growing global footprint. Innovation, quality and value are critical partner attributes cited by this customer, and we are proud that our team is delivering to their high standards.  \n The hospital system in Denmark has chosen to replace a competitor with our clinical point-of-care solution. In Q3, they began a multi-quarter deployment of our health care-purposed TC5 Series mobile computers and accessories, which will interface seamlessly with their electronic medical health record system. We have continued to deploy TC7 Series mobile computers to USPS postal carriers as planned and are now pausing through their peak holiday season, expecting to resume in late Q1 with the goal of completion by mid-Q3.  \n We are proud that we are able to help our customers meet their mission-critical needs in an increasingly on-demand economy. We continue to view acquisitions as a vector of profitable growth for Zebra and a way to elevate our role as a solutions provider. In early September, we closed on the Reflexis acquisition. In a few minutes, I'll elaborate on how this acquisition is synergistic to our offering. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q3 financial results and discuss our Q4 outlook. \nNathan Winters: Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. Net sales increased 30 basis points before the modest net impact of currencies and acquisitions. As Anders mentioned, large order volume was much stronger than the prior year. This was offset by a decline in small and midsized business through the channel, which disproportionately impacted printing and data capture. Our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 4%, driven by solid growth in mobile computing and services. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking, including printing and supplies, continue to be most impacted by the global recessionary environment with sales decreasing 7% from the prior year. This was a notable 18-point sequential improvement from the Q2 decline. \n We realized solid growth in our managed and professional services and Zebra retail solutions. Location solutions declined from last year due to lower project activity during the pandemic. We realized significant sequential improvement in each of our regions from Q2 as we continue to recover from the peak of the pandemic. In North America, sales increased 6%. Mobile computing and data capture returned to solid growth, and services continued to perform well. \n EMEA sales were flat. Services and mobile computing were bright spots. We also continued to see strength in Central and Northern Europe. Sales in our Asia Pacific region declined 13%. China was a bright spot, returning to modest growth. Latin America sales declined 20% with all major product and service categories declining.  \n Adjusted gross margin contracted 390 basis points to 43.8% driven primarily by more than 3 points from unfavorable business mix and nearly 1 point from premium freight cost, which was partially offset by improved services margin. Underlying margin trends across the business, excluding mix dynamics, remain healthy. Adjusted operating expenses declined $17 million from the prior year period and improved 150 basis points as a percentage of sales. This improvement was primarily due to disciplined cost management and lower compensation expense while preserving our planned investments in the business.  \n Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.3%, a 240 basis points decrease from the prior year period, driven entirely by lower gross margin. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.27, a $0.16 or 5% year-over-year decrease.  \n Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $482 million of free cash flow in the first 9 months of 2020. This was $106 million higher than the prior year period, primarily due to a lower use of working capital as well as our expanded accounts receivable factoring program.  \n Our balance sheet is strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended Q3 at a comfortable 1.8x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, 0.5x higher than last quarter, due to financing the acquisition of Reflexis.  \n Now turning to Slide 8. We have demonstrated that we can deliver solid results in a challenging economic environment while continuing to invest in our future. Our consistently strong free cash flow generation is driven by our capital-light business model, flexible cost structure, diversified end markets, strong execution and disciplined cost management.  \n Let's now turn to our outlook. We are encouraged by the faster-than-expected recovery with small and midsized businesses and are beginning to realize the benefit of pent-up demand from many customers who have paused their spending earlier in the year. Based on these trends and our healthy channel inventory levels, we expect Q4 adjusted net sales to increase between 3% and 7%. This outlook assumes an approximately 150 basis point additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and a neutral impact from foreign currency changes. \n We believe Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin will be between 21% and 22%, which assumes modest operating expense leverage from the prior year. Gross margin is expected to be slightly lower than last year, reflecting higher large order mix in a soft but improving macro environment as well as an offsetting year-on-year impacts of premium freight and tariff expense. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.90.  \n You can see other modeling assumptions on Slide 9. Note that we now expect free cash flow to be at least $650 million for the year, which is higher than 2019.  \n With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how Reflexis is synergistic with our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision as well as trends in our end markets. \nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Nathan. Slide 11 highlights how we are building on our foundational capabilities to elevate our value proposition with customers as a solutions provider. Our unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast installed base of products uniquely positions us to solve our customers' complex challenges at the edge. \n We are investing in emerging technologies that help our customers better orchestrate their workflows by leveraging real-time data to gain actionable insights. We are excited to have Reflexis onboard, which further helps Zebra bring our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision to life for retailers and other end markets.  \n Reflexis is a demonstrated leader in intelligent workforce management and task execution. Their platform is utilized by hundreds of retailers around the globe to drive employee productivity and retention while also improving customer engagement. Reflexis is synergistic with our existing suite of solutions as a service. \n As you can see on Slide 12, these include: SmartCount, which is an innovative self scan and physical inventory management solution; our SmartSite robotic solution, which uses automated intelligence to help identify issues on the store shelf in real time; our Workforce Connect data and voice communication and collaboration application for mobile workers; and Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, which provides data-driven insights and a prioritized list of prescriptive actions that help maximize efficiency and reduce shrinkage. \n Zebra's suite of solutions work in unison with our product portfolio to provide real-time contextual tasking. This capability is critical for successfully addressing the inevitable unplanned events that occur throughout the workday. Over the next few quarters, we will continue to invest in the seamless integration of Reflexis' market-leading platform with our complementary software offerings to optimize the experience for frontline workers. We are also investing in our go-to-market efforts to drive accelerated traction with our unmatched suite of solutions. We believe that our enterprise customers will realize a compelling ROI by empowering all of their associates with these solutions.  \n On Slide 13, we provide an update regarding the mixed impacts we are currently seeing in the primary vertical markets that we serve. We also highlight the exciting longer-term opportunities in our end markets as customers invest in our technology in an increasingly on-demand economy. Trends are improving since our last quarterly update, although it is still a mixed picture depending on the sector.  \n In health care, our solutions helped hospitals intelligently flex their capacity to serve patients. There was a pause in noncritical care during the peak of the pandemic, straining the budgets of health service providers, which is changing now that elective procedures are assuming. Longer term, the need for increased real-time visibility into the entire patient journey and the demand for innovative solutions to provide safe and efficient care continue to make health care a high-growth end market opportunity.  \n Retailers are prioritizing investment in our technology for their complex omnichannel fulfillment strategies and related warehouse automation needs. Demand from large retailers is at record levels as e-commerce and buy online-initiated transactions have increased dramatically through the pandemic. We have also begun to resume business with many department stores and specialty retailers that have been reopening their doors.  \n In the transportation and logistics space, strong e-commerce growth continues to drive parcel volumes and last-mile delivery, which is favorable to Zebra. Passenger airlines, rental car providers and other related businesses remained challenged. The manufacturing sector continues to be most impacted with COVID-19 and global trade tensions. Key segments within process manufacturing, such as food and pharmaceutical companies, have held up relatively well, continuing to operate through the pandemic. We've seen mixed trends in discrete manufacturing with those in aviation and discretionary specialty goods, particularly challenged, a bright spot is our solid recovery in Chinese manufacturing.  \n In closing, we are successfully navigating through this challenging environment while we continue to invest in advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. This is enabling Zebra to emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position. We also believe that our longer-term prospects are strengthening as secular trends to digitize and automate workflows have accelerated.  \n Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike. \nMichael Steele: Thanks, Anders. We'll now open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tommy Moll with Stephens. \nThomas Moll: Anders, I wanted to start on the Reflexis deal. Could you articulate for us how important integrating software as part of your revenue mix will be going forward? And what are some of the strategic rationales? In other words, what does that allow you to do in terms of increasing stickiness with the customer relationship? What are the other advantages it brings to Zebra? \n And then as a related point, as you do head into more software-driven sales, should we think about that market as one that's more competitive than where you've traditionally competed? Or how do you want to frame up the competitive dynamics there? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. That's good. I'll start, and then I'll ask Joe Heel to help out also. First, just -- Reflexis is a great company. We're very excited that it's part of our portfolio, part of the Zebra family here now. I mean it's been a demonstrated leader in intelligent workforce management and task execution for many years, and it's been deployed by hundreds of retailers around the globe to help drive employee productivity and retention. \n And many, many of those customers are common to Zebra and to -- also to our Zebra Prescriptive Analytics solution. So when we look at Reflexis and Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and other software solutions we have, we see them as being very synergistic with our overall solution. \n If you think of our framework around Sense, Analyze and Act, I think that's probably the easiest way maybe to show how we think about creating more complete solutions for our product customers. But we have had historically a great strength around the sense and some in the analyze part, but being able to sense what's happening in the physical world has been kind of our foundation. \n But over the last few years, we have expanded our capabilities around the analyze and the act side quite a bit, and both Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Reflexis are examples of that. And now when we -- prior to actually the acquisition of Reflexis, we had a number of customers ask us to do more tight integration between Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Reflexis. They felt that, that would be something that would help get more value out of those investments. \n Zebra Prescriptive Analytics is going to continue to feed actions into Reflexis' action engine to help combine all the different actions that the retailer might do in a prioritized way. And then we look and leverage our other software assets like Workforce Connect to be able to let it all tie it back into our mobile computers. So our store associates can either scan items in the store or enter other data that can be fed into ZPA or into Reflexis but also then be receiving updates or actions from that so that the Reflexis system can deliver even greater value by being able to do that.  \n And for Zebra as a whole, with our suite of solutions as a service, we can become more strategic to our customers. We can start enabling them to address more complete workflows. And by that, we can increase the ROI of our overall solutions and be a more strategic thought partner as they think about how they develop their business. So we definitely feel that this is a very compelling path for us and very excited about what we can do with this. Joe, you want to add something? \nJoachim Heel: Yes. Perhaps I'll underline two things that you touched on. One is the fact that we're synergistic, not just on the product level, as Anders described, how we think we can bring together the different product capabilities we have, but certainly also on a go-to-market and sales level, where we have a very strong share in the retail market already, and bringing Reflexis to those retail customers is immediate cross-sell opportunity that we have. \n We're actually discovering that it also works the other way around. That Reflexis has some customers that they can bring us into and cross-sell that way. And that leads into the strategic opportunity that Anders described, right, which is -- Reflexis generally has a strong presence in the operations side of retailers. And this now gives us an opportunity to solve their problem strategically. And this perhaps also addresses the second part of your question around do we see this as a more competitive space. \n Certainly, there are different competitors in the pure workflow software area. However, none of them have the capability that we have to bring together the Sense-Analyze-Act part of the EAI vision and to solve the problem holistically. So we look at this as a space where we can now differentiate ourselves actually from both the traditional competitors that we had and the competitors that Reflexis currently has. \nAnders Gustafsson: Just to round out, say, I've been on the phone with many of the largest customers of Reflexis over the last month or 2, and I'd say that, formally, they are very excited about the combination. They are passionate about the Reflexis solution, but they also see the value that a combination with Zebra and the extra resources we can have and how -- our vision for how we can continue to add value to their operations. So I think so far, it's been a great feedback from the market and from our customers. \nThomas Moll: That's all very helpful. As a follow-up, I wanted to shift to some of the end market commentary you offered, Anders, specifically within retail and e-comm. It just sounds like some of the larger customers have accelerated their plans for the omnichannel integration or leaning into their e-commerce platforms. So 2 related questions. \n How durable do you see that trend being -- or maybe you could frame up qualitatively, if not quantitatively, how far ahead you think your current backlog gives you visibility into maintaining a robust pace of sales? \n And then moving to the smaller customers or potential new smaller customers, are you seeing anything -- not even in terms of order trends, just interest level that suggests that maybe the playing field here has expanded? If you just look around the retail landscape, they're a lot more engaged in omnichannel or talking about it at least now than there were a year ago. So I just wonder if maybe there's a TAM aspect to this dynamic as well where it's shifted in your favor? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. I'll start, and then I'll ask Joe to add a little bit of color to it also. First, I think in this environment, our solutions have become even more critical for our customers. We are, I'd say, uniquely positioned to empower frontline workers across all our vertical end markets. And COVID-19 has been accelerating a number of secular trends around digitization and automation, and it's probably most apparent in retail around e-commerce, around omnichannel and buy online pick up at store. \n Here, we've seen, particularly around mass merchants, grocers and e-tailers, that they have been the most -- the quickest, I guess, to pick up on this, and that's about 2/3 of our business. But I'd say, the largest retailers have been the -- mostly been the most aggressive or the earliest to start adopting and investing in solutions around omnichannel and e-commerce. \n They have seen a great growth in their omnichannel and buy online, pick up at store businesses. And they have -- still believe that there's lots of market share that they can continue to grow and take. So they are continuing to invest heavily in building out their capabilities and scaling their capabilities compared to where it was, say, just 6 months back. \n For smaller retailers, they -- I'd say generalizing a bit now, they were maybe not quite as quick to invest in omnichannel capabilities. It's a big investment and a complicated one at times. But I think the COVID-19 and the changes in customer buying behaviors and the step-up in change in how comfortable consumers are with omnichannel and buy online, pick up at store, as an example, has made it, I think, abundantly clear for smaller retailers, too, that if they want to compete, they need to build these types of capabilities. \n So we see the pipeline of business around these larger trends around digitization, automation and particularly in retail as quite robust. And we think that this is a trend that will be going on for quite some time. And we're just saying that, I think for now, we see then the pipelines of these types of opportunities as we look into 2021 as being as robust as we would have expected them to be in prior years at this time. Joe? \nJoachim Heel: Yes. I'll add perhaps 2 thoughts. I do think there is a TAM expansion that's going on, but I see it a little differently than you were perhaps suggesting. One big area of -- it has to do with the fact that in order to enable all of these omnichannel capabilities, you need a deep capability in the company more broadly than just at the front where the items are being picked up. \n And 2 things in particular that you need to do that, I think, favor us in this case is, number one, you need to enable your associates in your store because that's where most of the instant omnichannel capabilities is being created. And that means you need to digitize and give every worker a device in some form, and we're far from that today. So that's a TAM expansion. \n And the second piece is you need to extend that modernization into your supply chain, and we're seeing a lot of activity in terms of digitizing and automating the supply chain, and that's clearly related to this acceleration of e-commerce. \nOperator: Next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. \nJames Ricchiuti: Follow-up on that some of the last commentary that you were making, Anders. And it sounds like you're still anticipating a fairly robust environment with your larger customers. So it's not as, potentially, there's some digestion from the investments that they have been making. And then as it relates to the small medium segment of, it wasn't if -- to what extent you are seeing a recovery there? I mean, is there the potential over the next 1 to 2 quarters that you could have both areas of the business, both large accounts and the SMB, actually moving in a consistent fashion toward stronger growth? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. First, I think we're seeing a faster-than-expected improvement in our end markets, and we're cautiously optimistic about how the economy will recover into 2021. I think here, our industry leadership and our investments in our business will also enable us to rebound stronger than our competitors. And to that point, that's why we feel confident to guide for a both top and bottom line growth in Q4. When we looked at our Q3 performance here, our run rate was improving. It's not back to pre-COVID-19 levels, but it is definitely improving and strengthening. And I think that was something we saw globally. And our large deals were obviously very strong in Q3, but we still have a good pipeline into our larger customers and how they're looking to invest in Q4 and beyond. Joe, do you want to add anything to this also? \nJoachim Heel: Yes, perhaps just 2 things. If you look at our pipeline as an indicator, it's as strong as it was on a relative basis a year ago. So we have a strong pipeline that gives us good confidence, and our run rate has been recovering. We didn't say that clearly enough, but it's clearly a driver of the growth that we've been seeing, and we expect that to continue as well. \nJames Ricchiuti: Got it. And just as a follow-up question. This relates more to some reports that we've begun to see, including one by a large retailer that had been considering deploying in-store robots for inventory analysis and has now pulled back apparently on that initiative. And I know you guys have looked at that market. But I guess my question is, if you look at the opportunities there, does it appear that it looks like some of the major retailers may opt for simply putting more devices in the hands of store personnel as opposed to maybe looking at some of in-store automation with robots and things like that? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. First, I'd say that -- I don't think that our customers see one solution as being able to solve all problems for them. Deploying more devices or putting more devices in the hands of more associates is clearly a trend and something that our customers see as being able to drive a high ROI and enabling all of them to be connected to their applications and systems and be able to be fully utilized in that respect. \n With respect to the robot solutions, you mentioned also, we believe that there is a good market opportunity for those types of solution, in addition to using handheld computers. We have our Smart Sight solution for this, and I think that's progressed very nicely since we announced it in -- at NRF this year. We've seen an increase in demand and pilots from any customers, particularly, I would say here now in the last few months from grocers. \n I think so far, our pilots have proven the technology, and we've been able to prove the ROI around -- just based on labor savings alone, and the accuracy of our reads have been very strong. And we -- here is an area where we leveraged our Cortexica acquisition. So we've employed a lot of the computer vision technologies from that into Smart Site, into some of our other solutions to accelerate our ability to extract useful information from digital images. \n So we see a good, healthy pipeline of customers who are interested in piloting this solution with us. And we have pilots in North America and Europe at this stage. Although it's also fair to say that we -- COVID-19 has made it harder for us to engage on customer sites, which is making it a little slower to ramp these pilots up. But the interest is as high as it was pre-COVID, I would say. Joe, any further comments from you? \nJoachim Heel: I'd like to add maybe one thing here. Let's remember what were the retailers trying to solve with this robotics automation solution. What they're trying to solve is the accuracy of inventory in the store, and there are many different capabilities and solutions that solve the inventory accuracy problem in the store, and they are suited differently to different types of store formats as well as merchandise assortments. \n And while we do believe that there is a place for the robotic inventory accuracy improvement, other solutions like RFID or simply using the data from associates' devices like you can do with Zebra Prescriptive Analytics are capable solutions for certain store formats and merchandise assortment. \n So the key, in our mind, will be having the capability to look at all of these different solutions and bring them to a customer. And that's what we're going to be in a position to do, including the robotic automation. \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, I think that's a good point just on -- to emphasize, again, from -- going back to the first question we had. This is where the breadth of our portfolio enables us to go in and talk to our customers about what is the problem you're trying to solve and then look at how can we bring our solutions, our technology to bear to best solve the problem they're trying to solve versus coming in and saying, \"Okay, I have a -- whatever your problem is, my hammer is what's going to solve it.\" So I think this is a great example of how the breadth of our solution plays to our advantage. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. \nMeta Marshall: Great. Maybe a couple of questions for me. One on the Denmark Healthcare win. Just any context as to -- was that your traditional kind of partner ecosystem that brought you into that deal? Was that a more health care-focused partner that brought you in? And then just maybe on the improvement that you're seeing in SMB. Are there any particular geographies or particular type of customer that you're seeing more movement from? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. Again, I'll start and then I'll ask Joe to provide some extra color. So first, on Denmark. The Denmark health care win we had, and it's a very exciting win for us. And I would say, almost uniformly, our health care partners are uniquely focused on health care. It's very rare that we have partners that are strong in, say, retail or manufacturing and also in health care. \n Those are very different end markets. The solutions are very different. The problems are very different. So it tends to lead to a much more vertically oriented entire value chain for us. Then around SMB, we did see improvements in our run rate across all geographies on a sequential basis. I think that this is something we expect to -- that we'll continue to see as the economy recovers into Q4. We've certainly seen a good progression of the run rate in the SMB business here as we get into Q4 but also as we look further into 2021. Joe, any more comments from you?  Are you muted, Joe? \nJoachim Heel: I am. I do apologize. 2 comments. On the health care partners, one particular type of partner that is very important for us in the health care space are the electronic medical records companies. We have excellent relationships with them, both from an ISV and a resale perspective, and that has been a good source of growth for us in the health care market. \n In the SMB segment, the one -- other one I would call out, in particular, is China. So in China, we've seen a resurgence, I think, of the -- in particular, manufacturing customers that are so essential for our printing business, and they have certainly contributed to the return of that business. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Richard Eastman with Baird. \nRichard Eastman: Yes. I just wanted to explore the gross margin for a minute here, the adjusted gross margin by segment here. Both segments were down 300 to 400 basis points. Maybe a little bit surprised around AIT segment being down. So my question maybe is two-fold. \n I mean, first of all, around the freight expenses, we're using the term in a premium freight. Is the freight expense up structurally, given the realignment around our subcontract manufacturing base? Or is that specifically to the urgency around some of these e-commerce large orders and getting to here? What does that impact? \nNathan Winters: Yes, Rich, so I'll take this. I want to start by -- I think our teams have been executing well on what we can control around gross margin. And if you look at the drivers, it's pretty consistent across both of our segments both from an unfavorable business mix as well as the premium freight costs. And if you look at the -- one of the 3 points, and again, spread between both segments from both large deal mix as well as unfavorable business mix. And just an example, in Q3, the mix of large deals was actually greater than what we saw in Q2. Another example, which speaks to the AIT point, if you look at our printer business, it has a larger proportion within run rate and exposure to the manufacturing vertical, along with generally higher gross margin. And then another point on premium freight costs. And to answer your question, really, it's from capacity constraints not so much from the change in our manufacturing footprint. And we're seeing our cost per kilo up 2 to 3x from what we saw pre pandemic, so again, just as some of the capacities come offline with reduction in air travel internationally. \n And I think what's important, if you look at the underlying gross margin trends, excluding the mix dynamics, they do remain healthy. And as the economy recovers and our run rate business improves, so will gross margin, which you'll begin to see here in Q4. \nRichard Eastman: And AIT has the same, again, large order impact on AIT on the printer side of the business as it does on the MC and scanning? \nNathan Winters: What I'd say it's less reliant on large deals, but it has a higher proportion within the run rate -- a higher proportion of run rate business. \nRichard Eastman: Okay. And when you look at -- let's move out when things normalize here around the mix of business between the channel and large orders and then this -- kind of this freight, this premium freight starts to dissipate, are we still kind of at this normalized gross margin level for Zebra, that's, let's call it, 47% with modest upside? Is that still a normalized gross margin here? \nNathan Winters: Yes. So as we get past the pandemic, we do expect to get back to pre pandemic levels for both EBITDA rate and gross margin rate. And like I said, the like-for-like margins remain healthy. We also would expect the vast majority of our OpEx to return as the environment normalizes. We have, I'd say, some bit of that will be permanent savings that we'll look to reinvest around the OpEx side. But again, we do get -- we do expect to get back to the pre-pandemic levels, both in EBITDA and gross margin rate. \nAnders Gustafsson: Maybe just to add one thing to that. We continue to also develop our portfolio. So as you think of our -- the software solutions we talked about here earlier, they tend to come with a higher gross margin certainly, and scale, we would expect them to have a very attractive EBITDA margin, too. \nRichard Eastman: Understood. Yes. And then just my second follow-up question, just around the sales and sales channel. Just a quick question. When we look at the fourth quarter revenue guide of plus 3 to plus 9, is the assumption in there that the channel, both North America as well as Europe, is up year-over-year? Is that assumption in your guide -- revenue guide for the fourth quarter? \nAnders Gustafsson: So your question was if the channel is expected to be up year-over-year?  Yes. \nRichard Eastman: So channel and run rate. I'm sorry. \nAnders Gustafsson: As in run rate, yes. Okay. So yes. So I'll start here again, and I'll have Joe provide some extra color again. But first, we're quite pleased to be able to guide for both top and bottom line growth year-over-year in Q4 here, but the 3% -- 3% to 7% expectation in growth, and that includes 150 basis points of positive impact from Reflexis. \n First, the large deal activity remains very strong, but the underlying business is recovering faster than we expected, and we are also benefiting from some pent-up demand in Q4. As we entered Q4, though, we also had a strong backlog that helped us in this area. The higher large order mix that we've seen compared to prior year will continue but not the same degree as in Q3. So we do expect the run rate and the channel business to continue to sequentially grow. And Joe, any more color for you? \nJoachim Heel: I don't think I have anything to add. You said it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. \nBrian Drab: At this point, I guess 2 quick follow-up questions to the recent questions that you were just addressing. So I appreciate that gross margin should get back to the pre-pandemic level. I'm wondering if you could put a finer point on that. Is that something that we could expect in 2021? Or does the large postal service order maybe weigh on that somewhat in the near term? Is that a longer-term expectation? Or is that a 2021 expectation? \nAnders Gustafsson: I think it's a little too early for us to give a detailed 2021 guidance at this stage, but we do expect that our gross margins will continue to sequentially improve, along with the economy and along with the improvement in our run rate business. \nBrian Drab: Okay. And then, Anders, you just highlighted also that the software business, of course, should be a tailwind for gross margin as that business grows and which Reflexis, it's obviously a bigger piece of the business. Can you give us any sense for it? How -- what percentage of revenue now we are at in terms of software? Is it -- can you even say if it's more or less than 5%? \n I know it's not something you've really said in the past, but it's becoming a more meaningful piece, and we don't really know how to model the impact on gross margin without some sense for that. \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. Obviously we're very excited about the software business, and our software and services business has been growing quite nicely. The software business as a whole, I think, is still in the single digits for us, but it's been, as I say, has been growing quite, quite nicely. And we would expect it to be a much bigger part of our business as we go forward. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Keith Housum with Northwest Research. \nKeith Housum: And Nathan, congratulations, and welcome to the call. Guys, want to dig in a little bit further into the U.S. postal service. Anders, I think I heard you say that the deal is on a pause until late first quarter, and then we will finish up in 3Q of next year. So is the plan still to end, I guess, late summer? I'm just trying to get a little bit more idea on the third quarter. And in terms of a pause, are we talking the end of the first quarter, so don't expect much in the first quarter of '21 from the U.S. Postal Service? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. First, the pause that we now have is a planned activity from USPS. This was always their intent to not deploy new devices during Canada peak season, and it will start ramping up again in the second half of the first quarter. So the Q1 would be certainly lower than Q2 and Q3, and we expect that late summer, we will be basically wrapping up. And then we'll continue obviously with other projects and expansions of this project with USPS. \nKeith Housum: Great. And then just as my follow-up. In terms of the Temptime business, can you just perhaps cover, is there an opportunity with that business to take advantage of perhaps COVID-19 vaccine that might be out there on the horizon? And how is that business doing? And how does that go to play here? \nAnders Gustafsson: Sorry. You said Temptime? \nKeith Housum: Correct. \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. So Temptime has been doing very well in Q2 and Q3 based on the traditional vaccines that they cover, all the vaccine vials that we cover there. We are working with WHO and a number of pharmaceutical companies, logistics companies, to ensure that we are well-positioned to provide solutions with respect to a COVID vaccine when that becomes available. \n We have received initial orders from people who are kind of proactively looking to build up the -- an inventory and capabilities for this, but they have been quite small, but we expect that, that can be a nice addition to the business in 2021. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Blake Gendron with Wolfe Research. \nBlake Gendron: I do want to circle back on the deal size evolution here. I know we've been talking about it this morning. But if you were to quantify the year-over-year impact of deal mix in terms of bps or whatever, that would be super helpful. \n And then on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being pre-pandemic normalized mix versus 1 being sort of the trough where large deals dominated in the second and third quarter, I would imagine, where do you expect the fourth quarter to be just because you do anticipate some of the smaller deal size coming back? \n And then as an offshoot to that on working capital, you offset some of the receivables friction with payables and things like that. Are the receivables, AR, is that impacted by deal size as well, where we should expect maybe a little bit of friction just given the mix? \nNathan Winters: Yes. So to answer your first question around the growth we're seeing in both respect to the large and nonlarge deals. So again, just to clarify, when we say large deals, those are greater than $1 million. In the third quarter, the large deals grew over 35%, and our nonlarge deals were down over 15%. And that -- hard to put a 1 through 10 classification on it. I would say, as we get into Q4, it is going to be slightly higher large order mix than the prior year, but definitely not to the same degree as Q3, and we'd expect that to continue to maybe go back to pre-pandemic levels as we head into 2021, as we see a gradual recovery in the economy. \n And on your last question around AR factoring. I wouldn't say that we've seen any additional friction relative to deal size. It had a modest impact on our year-to-date cash flow, and we'd expect to see a relatively modest impact on our full year guide. \nAnders Gustafsson: Maybe just one more -- add to this and the prior question. So we've had a lot of focus on investors on USPS and the impact of USPS had on our business. And U.S. is obviously a large deal, but it was not what drove our Q3 overachievement. USPS came in very much as per our expectations. \nBlake Gendron: Understood. I appreciate that additional color. And then a follow-up, if I could, on the regional growth, you broke it out in the slide deck. Looks like North America, Europe, Latin America, kind of trending actually a little bit better than maybe some of your indicators would suggest. \n APAC was down pretty heavily, maybe more so than other companies have disclosed, at least directionally. So on Asia Pacific, is the issue there, just -- first of all, is it a discrepancy? And then is it due to China versus non-China? \n Is it health of specific end markets or customers? Is there something going on with the channel inventory levels there? I'm just trying to get a better feel for, I guess, the weakness in APAC. \nAnders Gustafsson: Well, first, more globally, I'd say what you see globally and also in Asia Pac is some of the secular trends that are supporting our business have accelerated as part of COVID. So around omnichannel, the digitization and automation, those are all -- those are global trends. \n And in Asia Pac, that we have -- our business has been driven more by, say, a run rate business rather than large deals. So the run rate business in manufacturing has been larger parts of our Asia Pac business than in other areas. \n And specifically in Q3, I think the COVID-19 drove bigger declines in Southeast Asia and India, where good parts of those countries were more or less shut down. So that was more impactful for Asia Pac. But Asia Pac was up from -- sequentially from Q2, and China actually returned to growth. \n And as I said, we have new leadership in China, a new General Manager who's doing a great job there for us. We did also see some relative strength in Australia in Q3. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. \nAndrew Buscaglia: I just wanted to clarify something on the USPS award. So you said you're going to wrap up most of the deal -- or most of that award by end of Q3. I think the deal was -- the award was $570 million in total or upwards of. I guess, what portion of that will be fully wrapped up? Because I know there's follow-on stuff that is comprised within that $570 million. \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. I think the contract award was up to a maximum of $575 -- $570 million. I don't think at this stage, we can give you -- I won't break out and say specifically how large the volume for the USPS will be as part of this contract. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Okay. Also in your Q4 guide, it was a nice guide, and I think about 1/3 of your sales is EMEA, which didn't quite rebound as much as North America, and now we're starting to see lockdowns again. So I guess what have you contemplated in that guide? Is it conservative? And does it take into account, kind of what's going on in Europe? \nAnders Gustafsson: So we feel confident in our sales guide for Q4. It reflects the positive momentum we have in the business. We entered the quarter with a strong backlog. We had very healthy levels or lower levels of inventory in the channel. So the quarter is actually more front-end loaded than normal. So we do see that has -- as giving us great confidence in our guide. \n But there's obviously still continued pressures from COVID and some uncertainty around this. I'd say, though, with -- specifically to Europe and some of the lockdowns there that I think if you compare this to April when -- or end of March when the lockdown started, I think now companies -- most of the first -- most of the lockdowns are intended to be more on the aspect of the social life rather than enterprises and business life. \n And I think companies like ourselves we have learned, I think, how to operate much better in this environment. So I would expect that the impact of a lockdown would be less severe now, and the lockdown would, again, I think, drive some of the trends that we've talked about around omnichannel and buy online, pick up in-store and so forth, which would have some offsetting positive impact for us. \nOperator: Our last question today will come from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. \nJeffrey Kessler: What -- when you talk about providing a full, let's call it, recurring revenue SaaS-type of solution that you're developing going forward, which vertical markets have been -- which vertical markets do you think have been most interested in at least talking about how to get to a, if you want to call it, a full Zebra solution for them at this point? \nAnders Gustafsson: I'm not sure if I can say that any vertical has more -- been more excited about this than others. Maybe I can say, though, that our -- if you look at some of our more recent software acquisitions like Reflexis and Zebra Prescriptive Analytics or Profitect, as it was previously known, the primary vertical markets that they address have been retail. So we're probably further along in retail than we are in other markets. But I say I would highlight health care is certainly an industry or a vertical that has a lot of interest in broader solutions and acquiring them as a service. \nJeffrey Kessler: Okay. And a follow-up, in terms of what types of services and/or technologies might be add-on to USPS, once you've done the first part of the contract? Would that be instructive for other -- for other areas in which you might be able to expand your total available market? \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. I'm not sure if I want to get ahead of ourselves and talk about what possible business we might win from USPS in the future. USPS is a customer of many of our products already, so printing, scanning and mobile computing services, some software solutions. So I see opportunities for us to engage across a broad suite of solutions, but I don't know that I want to highlight any specific ones for you. \nJeffrey Kessler: Okay. And just quickly, in that line of thinking on new types of technology, with regard to your mobile scanners and with the other technologies that you're employing, have you been taking a look at the increase in other types of identifiers, such as BLE or NFC? Other types of technologies that may be complementary to what you're using right now? \nAnders Gustafsson: So I guess the broad answer will be yes. We're certainly looking at all sorts of data capture type of technologies. And our mobile computers, many of them have NFC already. So we're always looking to see how we can provide the right type of functionality to enable our customers to get the best ROI for those solutions. \nJoachim Heel: Yes. You might -- this is Joe Heel. You might remember that we introduced the proximity monitoring solution. That's based on Bluetooth low energy, which is built into our devices. And NFC technologies, for example, are used in solutions we have for railway ticketing. So those are all technologies we're already using, and we think have more potential in the future. \nOperator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gustafsson for any closing remarks. \nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. To wrap up, I would just like to thank our employees, customers and partners who are working in the frontline during this challenging time. Our team is executing well through the pandemic, and we are proud that our technology solutions are helping enterprises navigating through the challenges of COVID-19 as the world recovers. Stay safe, everyone. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I am proud of our employees' resiliency and focus on serving our customers' critical needs during these challenging times. Our top priority continues to be protecting the health and well-being of our employees, customers and partners as businesses continue to progress with their reopening plans.  \n In Q3, our results continued to be pressured by the global macro environment. For the quarter, we realized net sales growth of 30 basis points; adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.3%, which contracted by 240 basis points; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.27, a 5% decrease from the prior year.  \n As a result of excellent execution by our teams and a faster than expected recovery in demand, each of these measures exceeded our outlook. Demand from our large strategic customers has been at record levels, driven by accelerated trends to digitize and automate workflows. Not surprisingly, the pandemic has disproportionately impacted our smaller customers in certain end markets, which has resulted in a significant shift in business mix. Together with premium shipping costs, this has weighed on gross margin. In light of this pressure, we have continued to diligently manage discretionary costs to preserve profitability and cash flow.  \n Despite the challenging environment, our enterprise customers have been prioritizing spend with Zebra, and I would like to highlight some notable Q3 success stories. We expanded our relationship with a leading e-commerce retailer experiencing significantly increased order volumes. They require trusted technology solutions that enable improved supply chain and order fulfillment execution to empower their labor force. We are deploying our mobile computing, scanning and printing solutions across their growing global footprint. Innovation, quality and value are critical partner attributes cited by this customer, and we are proud that our team is delivering to their high standards.  \n The hospital system in Denmark has chosen to replace a competitor with our clinical point-of-care solution. In Q3, they began a multi-quarter deployment of our health care-purposed TC5 Series mobile computers and accessories, which will interface seamlessly with their electronic medical health record system. We have continued to deploy TC7 Series mobile computers to USPS postal carriers as planned and are now pausing through their peak holiday season, expecting to resume in late Q1 with the goal of completion by mid-Q3.  \n We are proud that we are able to help our customers meet their mission-critical needs in an increasingly on-demand economy. We continue to view acquisitions as a vector of profitable growth for Zebra and a way to elevate our role as a solutions provider. In early September, we closed on the Reflexis acquisition. In a few minutes, I'll elaborate on how this acquisition is synergistic to our offering. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q3 financial results and discuss our Q4 outlook. Thank you, Nathan. Slide 11 highlights how we are building on our foundational capabilities to elevate our value proposition with customers as a solutions provider. Our unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast installed base of products uniquely positions us to solve our customers' complex challenges at the edge. \n We are investing in emerging technologies that help our customers better orchestrate their workflows by leveraging real-time data to gain actionable insights. We are excited to have Reflexis onboard, which further helps Zebra bring our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision to life for retailers and other end markets.  \n Reflexis is a demonstrated leader in intelligent workforce management and task execution. Their platform is utilized by hundreds of retailers around the globe to drive employee productivity and retention while also improving customer engagement. Reflexis is synergistic with our existing suite of solutions as a service. \n As you can see on Slide 12, these include: SmartCount, which is an innovative self scan and physical inventory management solution; our SmartSite robotic solution, which uses automated intelligence to help identify issues on the store shelf in real time; our Workforce Connect data and voice communication and collaboration application for mobile workers; and Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, which provides data-driven insights and a prioritized list of prescriptive actions that help maximize efficiency and reduce shrinkage. \n Zebra's suite of solutions work in unison with our product portfolio to provide real-time contextual tasking. This capability is critical for successfully addressing the inevitable unplanned events that occur throughout the workday. Over the next few quarters, we will continue to invest in the seamless integration of Reflexis' market-leading platform with our complementary software offerings to optimize the experience for frontline workers. We are also investing in our go-to-market efforts to drive accelerated traction with our unmatched suite of solutions. We believe that our enterprise customers will realize a compelling ROI by empowering all of their associates with these solutions.  \n On Slide 13, we provide an update regarding the mixed impacts we are currently seeing in the primary vertical markets that we serve. We also highlight the exciting longer-term opportunities in our end markets as customers invest in our technology in an increasingly on-demand economy. Trends are improving since our last quarterly update, although it is still a mixed picture depending on the sector.  \n In health care, our solutions helped hospitals intelligently flex their capacity to serve patients. There was a pause in noncritical care during the peak of the pandemic, straining the budgets of health service providers, which is changing now that elective procedures are assuming. Longer term, the need for increased real-time visibility into the entire patient journey and the demand for innovative solutions to provide safe and efficient care continue to make health care a high-growth end market opportunity.  \n Retailers are prioritizing investment in our technology for their complex omnichannel fulfillment strategies and related warehouse automation needs. Demand from large retailers is at record levels as e-commerce and buy online-initiated transactions have increased dramatically through the pandemic. We have also begun to resume business with many department stores and specialty retailers that have been reopening their doors.  \n In the transportation and logistics space, strong e-commerce growth continues to drive parcel volumes and last-mile delivery, which is favorable to Zebra. Passenger airlines, rental car providers and other related businesses remained challenged. The manufacturing sector continues to be most impacted with COVID-19 and global trade tensions. Key segments within process manufacturing, such as food and pharmaceutical companies, have held up relatively well, continuing to operate through the pandemic. We've seen mixed trends in discrete manufacturing with those in aviation and discretionary specialty goods, particularly challenged, a bright spot is our solid recovery in Chinese manufacturing.  \n In closing, we are successfully navigating through this challenging environment while we continue to invest in advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. This is enabling Zebra to emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position. We also believe that our longer-term prospects are strengthening as secular trends to digitize and automate workflows have accelerated.  \n Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike. Yes. That's good. I'll start, and then I'll ask Joe Heel to help out also. First, just -- Reflexis is a great company. We're very excited that it's part of our portfolio, part of the Zebra family here now. I mean it's been a demonstrated leader in intelligent workforce management and task execution for many years, and it's been deployed by hundreds of retailers around the globe to help drive employee productivity and retention. \n And many, many of those customers are common to Zebra and to -- also to our Zebra Prescriptive Analytics solution. So when we look at Reflexis and Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and other software solutions we have, we see them as being very synergistic with our overall solution. \n If you think of our framework around Sense, Analyze and Act, I think that's probably the easiest way maybe to show how we think about creating more complete solutions for our product customers. But we have had historically a great strength around the sense and some in the analyze part, but being able to sense what's happening in the physical world has been kind of our foundation. \n But over the last few years, we have expanded our capabilities around the analyze and the act side quite a bit, and both Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Reflexis are examples of that. And now when we -- prior to actually the acquisition of Reflexis, we had a number of customers ask us to do more tight integration between Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Reflexis. They felt that, that would be something that would help get more value out of those investments. \n Zebra Prescriptive Analytics is going to continue to feed actions into Reflexis' action engine to help combine all the different actions that the retailer might do in a prioritized way. And then we look and leverage our other software assets like Workforce Connect to be able to let it all tie it back into our mobile computers. So our store associates can either scan items in the store or enter other data that can be fed into ZPA or into Reflexis but also then be receiving updates or actions from that so that the Reflexis system can deliver even greater value by being able to do that.  \n And for Zebra as a whole, with our suite of solutions as a service, we can become more strategic to our customers. We can start enabling them to address more complete workflows. And by that, we can increase the ROI of our overall solutions and be a more strategic thought partner as they think about how they develop their business. So we definitely feel that this is a very compelling path for us and very excited about what we can do with this. Joe, you want to add something? Just to round out, say, I've been on the phone with many of the largest customers of Reflexis over the last month or 2, and I'd say that, formally, they are very excited about the combination. They are passionate about the Reflexis solution, but they also see the value that a combination with Zebra and the extra resources we can have and how -- our vision for how we can continue to add value to their operations. So I think so far, it's been a great feedback from the market and from our customers. Yes. I'll start, and then I'll ask Joe to add a little bit of color to it also. First, I think in this environment, our solutions have become even more critical for our customers. We are, I'd say, uniquely positioned to empower frontline workers across all our vertical end markets. And COVID-19 has been accelerating a number of secular trends around digitization and automation, and it's probably most apparent in retail around e-commerce, around omnichannel and buy online pick up at store. \n Here, we've seen, particularly around mass merchants, grocers and e-tailers, that they have been the most -- the quickest, I guess, to pick up on this, and that's about 2/3 of our business. But I'd say, the largest retailers have been the -- mostly been the most aggressive or the earliest to start adopting and investing in solutions around omnichannel and e-commerce. \n They have seen a great growth in their omnichannel and buy online, pick up at store businesses. And they have -- still believe that there's lots of market share that they can continue to grow and take. So they are continuing to invest heavily in building out their capabilities and scaling their capabilities compared to where it was, say, just 6 months back. \n For smaller retailers, they -- I'd say generalizing a bit now, they were maybe not quite as quick to invest in omnichannel capabilities. It's a big investment and a complicated one at times. But I think the COVID-19 and the changes in customer buying behaviors and the step-up in change in how comfortable consumers are with omnichannel and buy online, pick up at store, as an example, has made it, I think, abundantly clear for smaller retailers, too, that if they want to compete, they need to build these types of capabilities. \n So we see the pipeline of business around these larger trends around digitization, automation and particularly in retail as quite robust. And we think that this is a trend that will be going on for quite some time. And we're just saying that, I think for now, we see then the pipelines of these types of opportunities as we look into 2021 as being as robust as we would have expected them to be in prior years at this time. Joe? Yes. First, I think we're seeing a faster-than-expected improvement in our end markets, and we're cautiously optimistic about how the economy will recover into 2021. I think here, our industry leadership and our investments in our business will also enable us to rebound stronger than our competitors. And to that point, that's why we feel confident to guide for a both top and bottom line growth in Q4. When we looked at our Q3 performance here, our run rate was improving. It's not back to pre-COVID-19 levels, but it is definitely improving and strengthening. And I think that was something we saw globally. And our large deals were obviously very strong in Q3, but we still have a good pipeline into our larger customers and how they're looking to invest in Q4 and beyond. Joe, do you want to add anything to this also? Yes. First, I'd say that -- I don't think that our customers see one solution as being able to solve all problems for them. Deploying more devices or putting more devices in the hands of more associates is clearly a trend and something that our customers see as being able to drive a high ROI and enabling all of them to be connected to their applications and systems and be able to be fully utilized in that respect. \n With respect to the robot solutions, you mentioned also, we believe that there is a good market opportunity for those types of solution, in addition to using handheld computers. We have our Smart Sight solution for this, and I think that's progressed very nicely since we announced it in -- at NRF this year. We've seen an increase in demand and pilots from any customers, particularly, I would say here now in the last few months from grocers. \n I think so far, our pilots have proven the technology, and we've been able to prove the ROI around -- just based on labor savings alone, and the accuracy of our reads have been very strong. And we -- here is an area where we leveraged our Cortexica acquisition. So we've employed a lot of the computer vision technologies from that into Smart Site, into some of our other solutions to accelerate our ability to extract useful information from digital images. \n So we see a good, healthy pipeline of customers who are interested in piloting this solution with us. And we have pilots in North America and Europe at this stage. Although it's also fair to say that we -- COVID-19 has made it harder for us to engage on customer sites, which is making it a little slower to ramp these pilots up. But the interest is as high as it was pre-COVID, I would say. Joe, any further comments from you? Yes, I think that's a good point just on -- to emphasize, again, from -- going back to the first question we had. This is where the breadth of our portfolio enables us to go in and talk to our customers about what is the problem you're trying to solve and then look at how can we bring our solutions, our technology to bear to best solve the problem they're trying to solve versus coming in and saying, \"Okay, I have a -- whatever your problem is, my hammer is what's going to solve it.\" So I think this is a great example of how the breadth of our solution plays to our advantage. Yes. Again, I'll start and then I'll ask Joe to provide some extra color. So first, on Denmark. The Denmark health care win we had, and it's a very exciting win for us. And I would say, almost uniformly, our health care partners are uniquely focused on health care. It's very rare that we have partners that are strong in, say, retail or manufacturing and also in health care. \n Those are very different end markets. The solutions are very different. The problems are very different. So it tends to lead to a much more vertically oriented entire value chain for us. Then around SMB, we did see improvements in our run rate across all geographies on a sequential basis. I think that this is something we expect to -- that we'll continue to see as the economy recovers into Q4. We've certainly seen a good progression of the run rate in the SMB business here as we get into Q4 but also as we look further into 2021. Joe, any more comments from you?  Are you muted, Joe? Maybe just to add one thing to that. We continue to also develop our portfolio. So as you think of our -- the software solutions we talked about here earlier, they tend to come with a higher gross margin certainly, and scale, we would expect them to have a very attractive EBITDA margin, too. So your question was if the channel is expected to be up year-over-year?  Yes. As in run rate, yes. Okay. So yes. So I'll start here again, and I'll have Joe provide some extra color again. But first, we're quite pleased to be able to guide for both top and bottom line growth year-over-year in Q4 here, but the 3% -- 3% to 7% expectation in growth, and that includes 150 basis points of positive impact from Reflexis. \n First, the large deal activity remains very strong, but the underlying business is recovering faster than we expected, and we are also benefiting from some pent-up demand in Q4. As we entered Q4, though, we also had a strong backlog that helped us in this area. The higher large order mix that we've seen compared to prior year will continue but not the same degree as in Q3. So we do expect the run rate and the channel business to continue to sequentially grow. And Joe, any more color for you? I think it's a little too early for us to give a detailed 2021 guidance at this stage, but we do expect that our gross margins will continue to sequentially improve, along with the economy and along with the improvement in our run rate business. Yes. Obviously we're very excited about the software business, and our software and services business has been growing quite nicely. The software business as a whole, I think, is still in the single digits for us, but it's been, as I say, has been growing quite, quite nicely. And we would expect it to be a much bigger part of our business as we go forward. Yes. First, the pause that we now have is a planned activity from USPS. This was always their intent to not deploy new devices during Canada peak season, and it will start ramping up again in the second half of the first quarter. So the Q1 would be certainly lower than Q2 and Q3, and we expect that late summer, we will be basically wrapping up. And then we'll continue obviously with other projects and expansions of this project with USPS. Sorry. You said Temptime? Yes. So Temptime has been doing very well in Q2 and Q3 based on the traditional vaccines that they cover, all the vaccine vials that we cover there. We are working with WHO and a number of pharmaceutical companies, logistics companies, to ensure that we are well-positioned to provide solutions with respect to a COVID vaccine when that becomes available. \n We have received initial orders from people who are kind of proactively looking to build up the -- an inventory and capabilities for this, but they have been quite small, but we expect that, that can be a nice addition to the business in 2021. Maybe just one more -- add to this and the prior question. So we've had a lot of focus on investors on USPS and the impact of USPS had on our business. And U.S. is obviously a large deal, but it was not what drove our Q3 overachievement. USPS came in very much as per our expectations. Well, first, more globally, I'd say what you see globally and also in Asia Pac is some of the secular trends that are supporting our business have accelerated as part of COVID. So around omnichannel, the digitization and automation, those are all -- those are global trends. \n And in Asia Pac, that we have -- our business has been driven more by, say, a run rate business rather than large deals. So the run rate business in manufacturing has been larger parts of our Asia Pac business than in other areas. \n And specifically in Q3, I think the COVID-19 drove bigger declines in Southeast Asia and India, where good parts of those countries were more or less shut down. So that was more impactful for Asia Pac. But Asia Pac was up from -- sequentially from Q2, and China actually returned to growth. \n And as I said, we have new leadership in China, a new General Manager who's doing a great job there for us. We did also see some relative strength in Australia in Q3. Yes. I think the contract award was up to a maximum of $575 -- $570 million. I don't think at this stage, we can give you -- I won't break out and say specifically how large the volume for the USPS will be as part of this contract. So we feel confident in our sales guide for Q4. It reflects the positive momentum we have in the business. We entered the quarter with a strong backlog. We had very healthy levels or lower levels of inventory in the channel. So the quarter is actually more front-end loaded than normal. So we do see that has -- as giving us great confidence in our guide. \n But there's obviously still continued pressures from COVID and some uncertainty around this. I'd say, though, with -- specifically to Europe and some of the lockdowns there that I think if you compare this to April when -- or end of March when the lockdown started, I think now companies -- most of the first -- most of the lockdowns are intended to be more on the aspect of the social life rather than enterprises and business life. \n And I think companies like ourselves we have learned, I think, how to operate much better in this environment. So I would expect that the impact of a lockdown would be less severe now, and the lockdown would, again, I think, drive some of the trends that we've talked about around omnichannel and buy online, pick up in-store and so forth, which would have some offsetting positive impact for us. I'm not sure if I can say that any vertical has more -- been more excited about this than others. Maybe I can say, though, that our -- if you look at some of our more recent software acquisitions like Reflexis and Zebra Prescriptive Analytics or Profitect, as it was previously known, the primary vertical markets that they address have been retail. So we're probably further along in retail than we are in other markets. But I say I would highlight health care is certainly an industry or a vertical that has a lot of interest in broader solutions and acquiring them as a service. Yes. I'm not sure if I want to get ahead of ourselves and talk about what possible business we might win from USPS in the future. USPS is a customer of many of our products already, so printing, scanning and mobile computing services, some software solutions. So I see opportunities for us to engage across a broad suite of solutions, but I don't know that I want to highlight any specific ones for you. So I guess the broad answer will be yes. We're certainly looking at all sorts of data capture type of technologies. And our mobile computers, many of them have NFC already. So we're always looking to see how we can provide the right type of functionality to enable our customers to get the best ROI for those solutions. Yes. To wrap up, I would just like to thank our employees, customers and partners who are working in the frontline during this challenging time. Our team is executing well through the pandemic, and we are proud that our technology solutions are helping enterprises navigating through the challenges of COVID-19 as the world recovers. Stay safe, everyone."

            "name": "Nathan Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. Net sales increased 30 basis points before the modest net impact of currencies and acquisitions. As Anders mentioned, large order volume was much stronger than the prior year. This was offset by a decline in small and midsized business through the channel, which disproportionately impacted printing and data capture. Our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 4%, driven by solid growth in mobile computing and services. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking, including printing and supplies, continue to be most impacted by the global recessionary environment with sales decreasing 7% from the prior year. This was a notable 18-point sequential improvement from the Q2 decline. \n We realized solid growth in our managed and professional services and Zebra retail solutions. Location solutions declined from last year due to lower project activity during the pandemic. We realized significant sequential improvement in each of our regions from Q2 as we continue to recover from the peak of the pandemic. In North America, sales increased 6%. Mobile computing and data capture returned to solid growth, and services continued to perform well. \n EMEA sales were flat. Services and mobile computing were bright spots. We also continued to see strength in Central and Northern Europe. Sales in our Asia Pacific region declined 13%. China was a bright spot, returning to modest growth. Latin America sales declined 20% with all major product and service categories declining.  \n Adjusted gross margin contracted 390 basis points to 43.8% driven primarily by more than 3 points from unfavorable business mix and nearly 1 point from premium freight cost, which was partially offset by improved services margin. Underlying margin trends across the business, excluding mix dynamics, remain healthy. Adjusted operating expenses declined $17 million from the prior year period and improved 150 basis points as a percentage of sales. This improvement was primarily due to disciplined cost management and lower compensation expense while preserving our planned investments in the business.  \n Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.3%, a 240 basis points decrease from the prior year period, driven entirely by lower gross margin. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.27, a $0.16 or 5% year-over-year decrease.  \n Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $482 million of free cash flow in the first 9 months of 2020. This was $106 million higher than the prior year period, primarily due to a lower use of working capital as well as our expanded accounts receivable factoring program.  \n Our balance sheet is strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended Q3 at a comfortable 1.8x net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, 0.5x higher than last quarter, due to financing the acquisition of Reflexis.  \n Now turning to Slide 8. We have demonstrated that we can deliver solid results in a challenging economic environment while continuing to invest in our future. Our consistently strong free cash flow generation is driven by our capital-light business model, flexible cost structure, diversified end markets, strong execution and disciplined cost management.  \n Let's now turn to our outlook. We are encouraged by the faster-than-expected recovery with small and midsized businesses and are beginning to realize the benefit of pent-up demand from many customers who have paused their spending earlier in the year. Based on these trends and our healthy channel inventory levels, we expect Q4 adjusted net sales to increase between 3% and 7%. This outlook assumes an approximately 150 basis point additive impact from the acquisition of Reflexis and a neutral impact from foreign currency changes. \n We believe Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin will be between 21% and 22%, which assumes modest operating expense leverage from the prior year. Gross margin is expected to be slightly lower than last year, reflecting higher large order mix in a soft but improving macro environment as well as an offsetting year-on-year impacts of premium freight and tariff expense. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.90.  \n You can see other modeling assumptions on Slide 9. Note that we now expect free cash flow to be at least $650 million for the year, which is higher than 2019.  \n With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how Reflexis is synergistic with our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision as well as trends in our end markets. Yes, Rich, so I'll take this. I want to start by -- I think our teams have been executing well on what we can control around gross margin. And if you look at the drivers, it's pretty consistent across both of our segments both from an unfavorable business mix as well as the premium freight costs. And if you look at the -- one of the 3 points, and again, spread between both segments from both large deal mix as well as unfavorable business mix. And just an example, in Q3, the mix of large deals was actually greater than what we saw in Q2. Another example, which speaks to the AIT point, if you look at our printer business, it has a larger proportion within run rate and exposure to the manufacturing vertical, along with generally higher gross margin. And then another point on premium freight costs. And to answer your question, really, it's from capacity constraints not so much from the change in our manufacturing footprint. And we're seeing our cost per kilo up 2 to 3x from what we saw pre pandemic, so again, just as some of the capacities come offline with reduction in air travel internationally. \n And I think what's important, if you look at the underlying gross margin trends, excluding the mix dynamics, they do remain healthy. And as the economy recovers and our run rate business improves, so will gross margin, which you'll begin to see here in Q4. What I'd say it's less reliant on large deals, but it has a higher proportion within the run rate -- a higher proportion of run rate business. Yes. So as we get past the pandemic, we do expect to get back to pre pandemic levels for both EBITDA rate and gross margin rate. And like I said, the like-for-like margins remain healthy. We also would expect the vast majority of our OpEx to return as the environment normalizes. We have, I'd say, some bit of that will be permanent savings that we'll look to reinvest around the OpEx side. But again, we do get -- we do expect to get back to the pre-pandemic levels, both in EBITDA and gross margin rate. Yes. So to answer your first question around the growth we're seeing in both respect to the large and nonlarge deals. So again, just to clarify, when we say large deals, those are greater than $1 million. In the third quarter, the large deals grew over 35%, and our nonlarge deals were down over 15%. And that -- hard to put a 1 through 10 classification on it. I would say, as we get into Q4, it is going to be slightly higher large order mix than the prior year, but definitely not to the same degree as Q3, and we'd expect that to continue to maybe go back to pre-pandemic levels as we head into 2021, as we see a gradual recovery in the economy. \n And on your last question around AR factoring. I wouldn't say that we've seen any additional friction relative to deal size. It had a modest impact on our year-to-date cash flow, and we'd expect to see a relatively modest impact on our full year guide."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Joachim Heel",
            "content": "Yes. Perhaps I'll underline two things that you touched on. One is the fact that we're synergistic, not just on the product level, as Anders described, how we think we can bring together the different product capabilities we have, but certainly also on a go-to-market and sales level, where we have a very strong share in the retail market already, and bringing Reflexis to those retail customers is immediate cross-sell opportunity that we have. \n We're actually discovering that it also works the other way around. That Reflexis has some customers that they can bring us into and cross-sell that way. And that leads into the strategic opportunity that Anders described, right, which is -- Reflexis generally has a strong presence in the operations side of retailers. And this now gives us an opportunity to solve their problem strategically. And this perhaps also addresses the second part of your question around do we see this as a more competitive space. \n Certainly, there are different competitors in the pure workflow software area. However, none of them have the capability that we have to bring together the Sense-Analyze-Act part of the EAI vision and to solve the problem holistically. So we look at this as a space where we can now differentiate ourselves actually from both the traditional competitors that we had and the competitors that Reflexis currently has. Yes. I'll add perhaps 2 thoughts. I do think there is a TAM expansion that's going on, but I see it a little differently than you were perhaps suggesting. One big area of -- it has to do with the fact that in order to enable all of these omnichannel capabilities, you need a deep capability in the company more broadly than just at the front where the items are being picked up. \n And 2 things in particular that you need to do that, I think, favor us in this case is, number one, you need to enable your associates in your store because that's where most of the instant omnichannel capabilities is being created. And that means you need to digitize and give every worker a device in some form, and we're far from that today. So that's a TAM expansion. \n And the second piece is you need to extend that modernization into your supply chain, and we're seeing a lot of activity in terms of digitizing and automating the supply chain, and that's clearly related to this acceleration of e-commerce. Yes, perhaps just 2 things. If you look at our pipeline as an indicator, it's as strong as it was on a relative basis a year ago. So we have a strong pipeline that gives us good confidence, and our run rate has been recovering. We didn't say that clearly enough, but it's clearly a driver of the growth that we've been seeing, and we expect that to continue as well. I'd like to add maybe one thing here. Let's remember what were the retailers trying to solve with this robotics automation solution. What they're trying to solve is the accuracy of inventory in the store, and there are many different capabilities and solutions that solve the inventory accuracy problem in the store, and they are suited differently to different types of store formats as well as merchandise assortments. \n And while we do believe that there is a place for the robotic inventory accuracy improvement, other solutions like RFID or simply using the data from associates' devices like you can do with Zebra Prescriptive Analytics are capable solutions for certain store formats and merchandise assortment. \n So the key, in our mind, will be having the capability to look at all of these different solutions and bring them to a customer. And that's what we're going to be in a position to do, including the robotic automation. I am. I do apologize. 2 comments. On the health care partners, one particular type of partner that is very important for us in the health care space are the electronic medical records companies. We have excellent relationships with them, both from an ISV and a resale perspective, and that has been a good source of growth for us in the health care market. \n In the SMB segment, the one -- other one I would call out, in particular, is China. So in China, we've seen a resurgence, I think, of the -- in particular, manufacturing customers that are so essential for our printing business, and they have certainly contributed to the return of that business. I don't think I have anything to add. You said it. Yes. You might -- this is Joe Heel. You might remember that we introduced the proximity monitoring solution. That's based on Bluetooth low energy, which is built into our devices. And NFC technologies, for example, are used in solutions we have for railway ticketing. So those are all technologies we're already using, and we think have more potential in the future."

This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Anders.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I would like to emphasize that our top priority continues to be the health and wellbeing of our employees, customers and partners. I am particularly grateful for all of the frontline workers, including medical professionals who continue to serve our communities and keep us safe. Zebra and many of our many of our customers' workplaces have commenced reopening plans, and I am very proud of the ability of our teams to effectively serve our customers and partners, while working remotely through the peak of the pandemic. In Q2, our teams remained agile and executed very well through pandemic. It has been inspiring for me to see our employees rally to keep the business and each other moving forward. Although, the financial results we published this morning reflect a challenging second quarter environment as we navigated through the peak of the crisis. Zebra's longer term prospects have strengthened as secular trends to digitize and automate workflows have accelerated with the pandemic. In Q2, we realized a net sales decline of 12%. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.3%, which contracted by 290 basis points and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.41, a 20% decrease from the prior year. As the virus spread end market weakness affected all of our major geographies, particularly our Asia-PAC and Latin America regions. The impact was most pronounced in our run rate business, which required our distributors to reduce their inventory levels. However, sales growth in services was the bright spot and enterprise mobile computing relatively outperformed. Although, premium shipping costs due to the pandemic impacted gross margin more than we had anticipated. We diligently managed discretionary costs across the company to preserve profitability and cash flow. Despite the challenging environment, our enterprise customers have been prioritizing spend with Zebra. Our solutions are a key enabler of their strategy to digitize their operations, as well as supporting the central use cases during pandemic. Large order volume was strong across vertical markets increasing over the prior year. I would like to highlight some notable Q2 wins from large customers supporting critical use cases. A leading home improvement retailer expanded their relationship with us by purchasing 10,000 of our printers to address multiple front-of-store use cases, including curbside pickup and in aisle label printing. Their shift to mobile on demand printing is expected to significantly improve worker productivity and replaced a competitor's stationary printers. We also secured a competitive takeaway win with a federal retail commissary to deploy more than 7,000 mobile computers. Our solution enables this customer to satisfy multiple use cases, including curbside pickup. We were pleased to support a large healthcare organization by providing a wide range of mobile computers, scanners, and printers to quickly ramp their point-of-care and clinical communication needs as they added 4,000 hospital beds to treat COVID patients. Additionally, as expected, we began deploying TC7 Series mobile computers to USPS postal carriers in late Q2. We expect the majority of the deployment to occur in 2021. We continue to collaborate with these customers to support their essential needs and drive it further improvement in their workflows. I am pleased that we have substantially completed our global product sourcing diversification initiative, despite modest delays due to the pandemic. Replicating production lines outside of China into broader Asia mitigates supply chain risk, and enables us to avoid tariffs on our U.S. imports. With that, I will now turn the call over to Olivier to review our Q2 financial results and discuss our outlook.\nOlivier Leonetti: Thank you, Anders. Let us walk through the P&L on slide six. Net sales declined 12.9% in the second quarter, which is 12% before the impact of currencies and acquisitions. Despite our sales decline, we believe that we continue to outperform the market in these challenging environment. As Anders mentioned, large order volume was stronger than the prior period. Our performance was untimely due to a sharp decline in small and midsize business to the channel, which disproportionately impacted printing and data capture. We are encouraged that distributor inventory levels are healthy and sales out trends have been improving. Our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales decreased 5.4%. We grew services revenue and mobile computing relatively outperformed. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment has been most impacted by the global recessionary environment, with sales decreasing 24.9%. Printing and supplies each declined double-digits. Services was a relative outperformer. Managed and professional services performed particularly well with growth driven by strong product attach rates over the past 12 months. Our location solutions and Zebra Retail Solutions offerings were extremely soft due to pause in project activity due to the pandemic. Turning to our regions. In North America sales declined 7%. Services grew and mobile computing was relative outperformer. EMEA sales declined 13%. We achieved solid growth in services and slight growth in mobile computing. We saw strength in Central and Northern Europe. Sales in our Asia-Pacific region declined 21%, driven by COVID-19 impacts. China improved sequentially from Q1, but was the largest contributor to the original sales decline. Japan and Korea were bright spots in the quarter where our go-to-market investments are delivering results. Latina America sales have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and macroeconomic factors and declined 33%. All geographies declined double-digits with the exception of Mexico. Adjusted gross margin contracted 360 basis points to 44.1%, driven primarily by two points of impact from unfavorable business mix, two points of impact from premium freight cost, other COVID mitigation and China import tariffs, partially offset by improved services margin. Adjusted operating expenses declined $44 million from the prior year period and improved 50 basis points as a percentage of sales. This improvement was primarily due to prudent cost management and lower incentive compensation. We were able to encompass -- to accomplish this while preserving our research and development projects. Second quarter EBITDA margin was 18.3%, a 290 basis point decrease from the prior period, driven entirely by lower gross margin. We drove non-GAAP earnings per deleted shares of $2.41, a $0.61 or 20% year-over-year decrease, which is inclusive of $0.27 negative impact from the transitory effects of premium freight expense and tariffs. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide seven. We generated $322 million of free cash flow in the first half of 2020. This was more than double the prior period, primarily due to a lower use of working capital and our expanded accounts receivable factoring program. Additionally, in Q2, we made a $31 million incremental investment in Locus Robotics, the market leader in autonomous mobile robots for fulfillment warehouses. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter at the modest 1.3 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which provides us ample financial flexibility. Turning to slide eight. We have been successfully navigating this unprecedented global environment. As I just mentioned, our balance sheet is in excellent shape with lower debt levels and $915 million of availability under our revolver, allowing ample capacity for business investment. Our capital light business model, flexible cost structure and strong free cash flow profile allows us to preserve profitability and cash flow in challenging times. The reliable cash flow generation gives us a competitive advantage as we prioritize investment in the business through any environment. Let us turn to our outlook. We believe Q2 was the peak impact to Zebra from the pandemic. We remain in the recovery phase and expect sales trends and profitability to improve in the second half of the year. We entered the third quarter with a solid backlog. We have seen an increase in business activity and our deal pipeline is building nicely. Based on these factors, we expect Q3 net sales to decline between 3% and 7%, which is a meaningful sequential improvement from Q2 trend. This outlook assumes an approximately 50 basis point negative impact from foreign currency changes. We would continue to preserve profitability while doing no harm to the business. This enabled us to prioritize strategic investment so that we emerge stronger as the market rebounds. We believe Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin would be approximately 19%, which assumes lower operating expenses and the lower gross margin, reflecting higher larger order mix and approximately $9 million of transitory premium freight expense. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.95. The premium freight cost expectation equates to $0.14 EPS impact. You can see other modeling assumptions on slide nine. Note that our outlook does not include any projected reserves from the pending acquisition of Reflexis. Anders will discuss the strategic acquisition in a few moments. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision and end market trends.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Olivier. We are excited to announce the acquisition Reflexis this morning, which we expect to close by early Q4. Reflexis is a leading provider of intelligent workforce management, task execution and communication solutions for the retail, food service, hospitality and banking industries. Combining Reflexis market leading platform with Zebra's complementary software offerings, including Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Workforce Connect provides us the unique opportunity to unify the store associate experience. We also expect that Zebra's scale vertical market expertise and go-to-market footprint will drive substantial synergies, not only in retail, but in other key vertical markets, such as healthcare. Reflexis is a high growth recurring revenue business with sales of $66 million in 2019, which doubled over a three-year period and the gross margin profile approximately 20 points higher than Zebra's corporate average. The next slide illustrates how this acquisition fits into our broader vision. Slide 12 highlights how we are building our capabilities as a solutions provider. Our deep understanding of workflows and unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast install base uniquely positions us to solve complex challenges at the edge. It is our top priority to invest in software solutions and services that help our customers leverage real-time data to better orchestrate their workflows and gain a performance advantage. Methods for sensing, analyzing and acting on operational data from the frontline of business are transforming with emerging technologies, such as computer vision and machine learning. Increasingly large volumes of data are generated and captured from our products. Enterprises are asking us to help them put that data to work by amassing disparate points of information to drive actions to their frontline workers in near real-time. Our intelligent edge solutions, including our SmartX and MotionWorks offerings demonstrate how we are enhancing the value proposition for our customers by addressing a wide variety of use cases across their business. This evolving suite of solutions enables Zebra to fuel our customer's workflows we did so they can be fully optimized. Reflexis' capabilities will be enhanced when they are combined with Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, worker collaboration and physical inventory software solutions. For example, Reflexis can provide dynamic prioritization of tasks extending across a broader set of data driven activities, such as stocking shelves, receiving a truck while delivering an order curbside when integrated with our Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Workforce Connect applications. Ultimately, through this acquisition, we expect customers to find even greater value in equipping all of their associates with mobile computers. On slide 13 we highlight the primary vertical markets that we serve. We are excited about our longer term opportunities in our end markets, as customers are driven to improve their technological capabilities in an increasingly on demand economy. Since our last quarterly update, we are seeing improvement in this challenging global environment, although it is still a mixed picture depending on the sector. In healthcare, our fastest growing vertical, clinical care remains critical and is the primary area Zebra serves. Our healthcare solutions help hospitals flex their capacity needs as the pandemic evolves. Our solutions are being used in labs and drive through testing facilities to provide safe and efficient care. Non-critical care and elective procedures are resuming. Longer term, we believe the need for increased visibility into the entire patient journey will drive increased demand for our solutions. Approximately two-thirds of our business in retail is to mass merchants, grocers, and e-tailers who have been prioritizing investment in our technology for their omni-channel fulfillment. E-commerce and buy online pickup at store transactions have increased dramatically through the pandemic. Department stores and apparel retailers have been reopening their doors, which has been critical to those heavily reliant on brick and mortar sales. In the transportation and logistics space, strong e-commerce growth continues to drive parcel volumes and last mile delivery, which is favorable to Zebra. Conversely, passenger airlines, rental car providers, and parts of the distribution industry are resuming activity yet far from capacity. The manufacturing sector continues to be the most impacted in the current environment with COVID-19 and global trade tensions. Discrete manufacturers in aviation, auto and discretionary specialty goods have been particularly challenged during the heart of the crisis. Many segments within process manufacturing, such as food and pharmaceutical companies, have been less impacted. In closing, we are successfully navigating through this challenging environment and are confident that our business fundamentals and strategy are sound. By continuing to focus on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision and addressing our customer's needs, we expect to emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position. We continue to be very optimistic regarding our longer term prospects as secular trends to digitize and automate workflows accelerate with the pandemic. Now, I'll hand the call back over to Mike.\nMike Steele: Thanks, Anders. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey, guys. If I dig into your guidance a little bit. So, I'm having a hard time with your guidance for Q3 getting to that, 19% EBITDA margin. In that I feel like it could be higher. So, I'm wondering, you're with your top line sales kind of guide where it was or where it is, much better than expected. It really implies not much expansion on gross margins. It's if that's what I -- if I'm correct there, can you confirm that? And talk a little bit about why you can't do or why you wouldn't expect it to a little bit better there in margin. Premium freight costs and stuff in there.\nOlivier Leonetti: Yeah. Good morning, Andrew. So, you're right. We expect in the quarter EBITDA margin to be around 19%. So, OpEx as a proportion of revenue will decline year-on-year and gross margin should -- rate should decline due to two factors. First, plenum freight, that would be about the point of impact in the quarter, but also mainly higher level of large deals in the quarter. We had mentioned that now for two quarters. Our business, large deal business is doing very well, actually growing year-on-year and expected to grow in Q3 and in Q2 and our run rate business has been impacted mainly by the pandemic. We believe that this trend will not last, that's point number one. We believe that run rate is starting to increase and will keep increasing. And an important point on the like-for-like basis, margin has been improving.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Okay. So, the gross margins sequentially will be up.\nOlivier Leonetti: Correct.\nAndrew Buscaglia: And then, if you could just talk about your backlog, it sounds like you have a strong backlog. Anyway you can quantify that? Like, what is your visibility beyond Q3 there? You mentioned some large orders or -- yeah, you talked to some potentially larger orders. Can you just provide some additional commentary on that?\nOlivier Leonetti: Yeah. We entered Q3 with a solid backlog position. It was quite strong considering the overall environment, but that was driven by the high proportion of larger deals. So, we've seen a lot of our larger customers, particularly in retail and T&L accelerate their investments. And they also then -- in this case gave us the orders prior to the start of the quarter. And that gives us, obviously, a great deal of confidence in the outlook we give for Q3. Joe, I don't know if you have any further comments here.\nJoe Heel: Well, we have a strong backlog position, as Anders and Olivier said. Some of the projects are multi-quarter, so we do have some backlog already building for future quarters, but it's too early to determine how strong relatively our future quarter backlog will be.\nOlivier Leonetti: But it's correct to say -- the pipeline for Q4 is good. So we feel encouraged about kind of the way that the market seems to be recovering. And the final comment, Andrew, we're not giving, of course, a guide for Q4. Too many uncertainties at the moment for obvious reasons. But we believe that Q4 from a revenue standpoint and profitability standpoint will be an improvement relative to Q3.\nAndrew Buscaglia: All right. Thank you, Olivier.\nOperator: The next question is from Jim Ricchiuti of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi, good morning. A question I have is just -- as we've gone through the pandemic and seeing the impact on brick and mortar retail, e-commerce, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the changes in customer behavior. I mean, your -- if you could talk in terms of things that you see changing in the market, as we start coming out of this. What do you see it doing to the business? And I assume you've seen some early indications out of this, things like ship from store and whatnot.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. I'd say in this environment, our solutions have become even more critical for our customers than they were before. And we are uniquely positioned to empower frontline workers across all our end markets. So I'd say the crisis has been accelerating a number of secular trends around digitization and automation. And I think that probably spans all our vertical markets, all four key vertical markets. If you dig in a little bit deeper on retail, I'd say grocers, which were certainly on a large part of our customer base before, e-tailers, grocers, mass merchants are about two-thirds of our business, but the growth in just grocery revenues, but particularly buy online pickup-in-store has been quite significant. And we've seen grocers across the -- particularly in the U.S. but across -- certainly Europe and the U.S. invest materially in enabling, scaling up their ability to do omni-channel in particularly buy online pickup at store. So that has been a big change. I think buy online pickup at store has gone from being more of a niche application before to now mainstream. And I'd say across the board in retail that customers who say we're in segments that were struggling a bit more before or during the downturn, I think everybody recognizes now that they can't be a 100% reliant on in-store purchases that omni-channel and the e-commerce side of their businesses needs to grow or expand. So, we see people spending more and more -- giving more attention to kind of omni-channel part of their business and how to be able to respond to situations like the one we had in Q2.\nJoe Heel: Maybe I can add one or two things. This is Joe Hill speaking. Generally speaking, besides, the buy online pickup-in-store, productivity and resiliency are at a premium for our retailers and think not only at the store, but also the warehouses. And so, the types of solutions that we have in improving productivity warehouses, where there's less reliance on workers to do tasks, including things like the investments that we made in Locus Robotics, are going to be an increasing trend in retail, which also helps improve their resiliency when there are incidents, for example, in a warehouse. And this also extends to contact free solutions. One of the features of BOPIS is that it's contact free. And there are other contact free elements of the retail interaction that we think will be here to stay, for example, payment transactions or contracts free kiosks as opposed to interaction with workers. So, those are a few other trends that we're seeing that generally benefit us in retail.\nJim Ricchiuti: And my follow-up question is on Reflexis. How long have you known them? And is this acquisition -- does it fill in some areas of your solution set that maybe where you had some holes? And is the -- is there any customer concentration within Reflexis that you can talk to? Thank you.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. So are very excited about the addition of the Reflexis team to Zebra and that business. We've known each other for quite a long time. Reflexis has been a premier IC partner of Zebra. And we've been in dialogue with them about this transaction for some time. The transaction very much helps to augment our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision of empowering every worker at the edge with insights that drive real-time action. So, this is entirely consistent with our broader vision. And it leverages our existing software assets and some of our hardware. So, if you think of Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, which looks at all sorts of data sources to glean insights and drive actions that can now fuel Reflexis' engine of driving actions, too. And our Workforce Connect can be one of the ways that we augment the Reflexis platform to have a more efficient way of communicating between employees and workers to ensure the right person get the right action at the right time.\nOlivier Leonetti: And in terms of customer concentration, Jim, the asset has a low level of concentration of sales towards a few customers, and Reflexis has been performing extremely well during the pandemic.\nAnders Gustafsson: It's -- obviously, we serve most retail customers. So, there's a lot of overlap. And we think there's great opportunity for us to do some cross-selling and up-selling across the portfolio. If you look specifically at how the customer base of Reflexis has performed during the lockdown, two-thirds of their customers were open and operated like normal. About one-sixth had some partial shutdowns or slowdowns, and one-sixth were fully shutdown, but are now open.\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPaul Chung: Hi. Good morning. This is Paul Chung on for Coster. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just a follow-up on Reflexis. It's kind of somewhat of a departure from your typical acquisition as it's mostly software. Should we kind of expect a shift to the software to continue? And if so -- if we think about gross margins longer term, should we expect kind of a structural step-up to your current gross margins of 47% as your strategy evolves? And I have a follow-up.\nAnders Gustafsson: So, first, I think, the acquisition of Reflexis is very consistent with our broader approach that we've talked about for some time to align with our strategy of either driving growth in our core -- identifying, acquiring companies that expand our leadership in the core or rapidly grow in near adjacencies or accelerate our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. And Reflexis fits into the accelerating the Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. I don't think -- we don't think of it as a big departure from how we have thought about the business, or how we have executed over the last few years. Software has become a bigger and bigger part of it. The last three acquisitions now including Reflexis have been pure software acquisitions. Although, I'm not saying that, that by any means, it's going to be -- that's the only thing we're focusing on for the future, but we are building more and more software assets and software capabilities. And even internally, more than two-thirds of our engineers are software engineers. So, software is clearly a very important part of how we deliver value to our customers, even if that is as a standalone software offering or as a more integrated solution between hardware and software.\nOlivier Leonetti: We believe that the asset will indeed increase the overall margin of the business, I mean, not only because it's software, but also because of the impact it will have on the hardware part of the business as well. So, very synergic from a revenue and margin standpoint.\nPaul Chung: Okay. Great. And then just on your SMB channels, are you starting to see demand pick up in July as business start to reopen? Have you also kind of seen some consolidation in the channels, maybe some of the smaller players kind of given some liquidity concerns we've been hearing about? And how does that kind of impact your pricing over time in your view? Thank you.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. I'll let Joe comment here also afterwards. But we have seen -- I guess, first, stabilization and signs of improvement in our run rate business and -- which we tend to kind of talk about them as run rate and SMB as being the same, but they're not necessarily the same, but it's not. Now, I think the SMB segment was harder hit by the shutdown. Most SMB companies were not deemed essential and therefore, were shutdown harder. And we have also more manufacturers that's part of our SMB or run rate business, but we are seeing them return to more healthy outlook and sequential growth. We also say that our -- we work hard to make sure that we maintained healthy inventory levels within our channel. So, when sales out numbers went down a little bit in Q2, sales in went down more. So, the end markets were somewhat healthier than our sales numbers would indicate. But now we're in a position to start growing with them as the economy expands.\nJoe Heel: Two additional comments. Remember that nearly half of our business is outside of the U.S. And in regions, including Asia, as well as in Europe, we are seeing the run rate business improve. Whereas in the U.S., it's still a bit too early to say that we have a sustained improvement. But, for example, in several countries in Asia, we are seeing growth in our run rate. Second, in terms of the channels themselves, it is fair to say that our channel business among our larger partners has been stronger than it has been among our smaller partners. It may be too early to speak of a consolidation, but it would be -- but at least that is what we are seeing.\nPaul Chung: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, gentlemen. Glad to hear that the large deals are holding up strong. I guess, Anders, are you seeing any large deals being pushed off because of the current environment? Or are you finding that the prioritization of these projects hold better than I guess what they might see for other products or projects?\nAnders Gustafsson: We have seen larger deals push into future quarters more dependent than on the type of customer. So, some would be retailers that had to shutdown altogether in Q2. They tended to push if they had bigger orders on the books into future quarters. Another example will be around, say, RFID, which often requires more in-store activities and also focus more on apparel or fashion retailers. So, anything that had to do with -- where we had to go into our customers' facilities to setup and implement the solutions would get pushed. But that's been offset by other customers that were operating and had to really scale up their operations to deal with the increased business that we're getting as part of the shutdown.\nKeith Housum: Great. Great to see that. And then as you look at I guess the intelligent edge solutions, can you discuss the progress you had with those solutions during the quarter versus the services growth? I think, if I heard right the managed services were grew during the quarter. But how did intelligent edge solutions do like Savanna most importantly?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. I think, our -- many of our software solutions did very well. If you look at, say, Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, as an example, we were able to win several new customers in Q2, and we were able to win and implement those customers without actually having to go on site. So that was one of the benefits of having a software solution like that. But other intelligent edge solutions that require onsite proof-of-concepts, pilots and so forth, they tended to be pushed out, and we're not growing the way we had expected.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Lapinski: Hi, team. This is Erik on for Meta. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe we could just go back to the retail side quickly. I mean, given some of the drivers you had noted, do you expect any sort of digestion period with some of the e-commerce or grocery customers following the investments that they have been making? Or do you think that kind of those investments just continue to scale as kind of the economy recovers?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. The -- I'd say the larger orders that we've seen in retail in the last quarter or plus are really to help our existing customers scale their operations. So, it's not -- they're not necessarily building ahead or anything like that. So, I don't see a need for them to, say, pause or catch or deploy and catch up on the operations side with what they have deployed. But obviously there's many customers and somehow different profiles than others. But generally, they are just basically trying to deploy devices into existing use cases where they scale in line with the number of headcount they have or the revenues they have for those applications.\nErik Lapinski: Got it. That's very helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up and kind of returning to some of the gross margin impacts from the larger deals. Was the initial shipments to kind of USPS also a factor in there? And should we maybe be expecting a similar impact to gross margins just as those shipments really ramp up into the first half of next year?\nOlivier Leonetti: So, Q2 had an USPS order. This order was shipped at the end of the quarter, so relatively material to the quarter. USPS is ramping in Q3. But as we have said before, the large majority of the USPS order will be shipped next year, probably in the first half of next year. And we're not going to talk about margin, of course, of USPS today. But usually large deals have a lower margin and run rate, so it would impact the company rate.\nErik Lapinski: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Drab of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrian Drab: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll just ask one question at the moment. And I apologize if you've discussed this to some extent. There's simultaneous calls going on. But I know you're expecting about $20 million in costs associated with the move of manufacturing out of China that are adjusted out of the adjusted EPS figure. But you have other costs that you're incurring this year. I guess, there's about $19 million of premium freight and other costs in the second quarter, $9 million in premium freight in the -- or coming in the third quarter. And just as we're trying to assess costs this year that likely won't be present next year. What is the estimate for total premium freight in 2020 and other costs in 2020 that likely won't be present in 2021, for example, incentive comp, maybe down this year that comes back next year? And what -- I can't remember what was the situation in the first quarter. Was there premium freight in the first quarter as well?\nOlivier Leonetti: So, it's -- let me try to cover the key points on this. So, if you look at, going forward, in terms of transitory cost, we are now done and our supply chain did an amazing job in diversifying our supply chain out of China. So, this work is done. And we're not going to have any impact due to tariff going forward. So that's not part of Q3 and obviously, forward P&L. So that's point number one. Point number two. We're going to have some impact due to premium freight in Q3. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that about $9 million -- about 80 basis points worth of margin rate, that will decrease towards the end of the year. And we believe that this trend should now stop going forward. So that would be a second item. When it comes to OpEx. We have been able to manage OpEx and adjust OpEx as revenue was declining. We'll keep doing that in the year. Now you are asking, do we have some of those OpEx reductions, which are going to be permanent? We believe so. It would be premature to mention a number today, because we want to keep investing in the business as well.\nBrian Drab: Okay. But Olivier, if I can just follow-up. What I'm driving at is the transitory costs, what's the total estimate for 2020? And then -- so we can model 2021. You're not -- you called out $19 million in the second quarter, you called out $9 million in the third quarter.\nOlivier Leonetti: Yeah.\nBrian Drab: What -- those costs and also including tariff costs, it seems like there's going to be like $50 million, like 5, 0 or something, in that range of costs this year that we shouldn't expect and we shouldn't model for next year in that -- in total.\nOlivier Leonetti: Yeah. Your number is about right. I mean, if I was to give you the phasing and maybe we can take that after the call of today. Tariff impact in Q1 was about one point. That is transitory. In Q2, the impact of tariff and premium freight was about two points. Premium freight impact in Q3 will be about one point. And we believe that all those transitory costs to a large extent will be gone by Q4 onwards. And we take the details after this call as well.\nBrian Drab: Sounds good. Okay. I'll talk to you later. Thank you.\nBrian Drab: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.\nRichard Eastman: Yeah. Just I'm looking kind of at the decrementals, kind of similar line of thought here. But the decremental here in the second quarter at the adjusted EBIT line was about 40%. And that's obviously absorbing some of the tariff costs, the freight cost, probably offset by some OpEx reductions. Is that -- is the 40% decremental kind of run into the third quarter? And then, presumably -- and maybe fingers crossed here, decline in the fourth quarter with some of these transitory costs out of the number?\nOlivier Leonetti: You're right, Rich. If you look at today, in terms if you look at Q2 and Q3, we believe we're going to be able to scale OpEx as a proportion of revenue in about the same level. And then in terms of margin, we're going to have over those two quarters the same impact of large bid mix, which would impact gross margin. But we believe that largely those trends will stop as we enter into the fourth quarter. That's why I indicated during an earlier question that profitability in Q4 will certainly increase relative to Q3 and Q2.\nRichard Eastman: Okay. Okay. I got you. And then just maybe a quick thoughts around what appears to be maybe more cyclicality in the printer business in general, AIT. Thought being that, is that business impacted much more as run rate business through the channel? Or is it just simply easier to defer purchases of a printer, given the payback on the printer just defer it for a couple of quarters. I mean, how do you kind of view that on the printer side of the business?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. The printer business is more -- has a much higher proportion of run rate as part of its revenue stream. It supports more SMB and manufacturing customers. So, the profile of the customer base is -- was more exposed to COVID-19 shutdowns or slowdowns. I'd say if we dig into the printing portfolio a little deeper, our card printing business was particularly hard hit. Card printing, they do -- they support events. Obviously, there weren't a lot of events in Q2. Badges for employees, drivers' licenses, all sorts of things that were hit more harder. But we did start to see -- particularly manufacturing opportunities to resurface in Asia-PAC later in Q2. And if you look at our supplies business, Temptime had a very strong Q2 and grew its vial monitoring solutions for existing vaccines. And we were doing things in emerging markets for COVID-19 test kits. And once we get a proper vaccine, we see opportunities for that to continue to do well. We also worked here on making sure that the channel had appropriate inventory positions. So, we did reduce inventory in the channel, but kept the days on hand just stable. So, we're coming out of this with a healthy inventory position where we can grow the business now in line with how the economy grows. But we do believe that we actually gained share in printing in the first half of this year. So, based on all our data points, we believe that we actually gained some share.\nRichard Eastman: Okay.\nJoe Heel: And one further data point just on that. In China, our printing business is rebounding faster than our other businesses. So that gives you an indication that there is a positive trend that will likely come back at the end of this cycle.\nRichard Eastman: I see. Okay. All right. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: The last question comes from Jeff Kessler of Imperial Capital.\nJeff Kessler: Thank you. Thank you for taking my question. Firstly, with regard to your TAM. It appears -- a couple of years ago, you gave a number with regard to $9 billion or $10 billion out of the total market in the AIDC area. Clearly, with some of the new software that you've developed internally, but also with some of these acquisitions, you've expanded the total available market that you can play in and also the niche -- if you want to call it that niche, that you are actually directly affecting. Can you speak to how -- particularly this last acquisition that you've just announced, can you just discuss the size of the marketplace that you are now affecting relative to where you were just a couple of years ago?\nAnders Gustafsson: So, we've talked about our core markets being around $10 billion in size and that we have we've had an incremental $15 billion market size in our adjacent markets, right? The -- and some of those adjacent markets that took us from $10 billion to $25 billion in total size will include tablets, supplies, RFID. Our -- many of our software solutions are new. And there is no -- it's a little difficult to say what the TAM is because they -- you could calculate it by, say, if every retailer on the planet were to deploy it, the TAM would be very, very large. It's not quite that today, but it is a substantial TAM and it's a higher -- faster growing market than our core markets. So, clearly, this expands our addressable markets and positions us to participate in additional high growth markets where we also get attractive synergies by being able to cross-sell and up-sell.\nJeff Kessler: Okay. And follow-up is, you've talked about the recovery in your business. But the fact remains is that at least in the United States, maybe not in Asia or in parts of Europe where they seem to be recovering from the virus faster, we seem to be still in somewhat of a state of a mess here. And it maybe some time before the virus allows business to operate at a more normal pace. Is the improvement that you're talking about in the third and fourth quarter? How much of it is basically based in the fact that Asia -- parts of Asia and parts of Europe are actually recovering and helping you and relative to the U.S.? And is the percent -- is your geographic pie going to shift at all in the second half of this year and perhaps into the first half of this year until there's some type of vaccine to -- and more importantly, the U.S. kind of gets its COVID-19 act together, if you want to call that?\nOlivier Leonetti: I think you summarized it well. We see all the regions improving in Q3 and Q4 relative to Q2. But the main recovery is outside North America. You're absolutely right.\nJeff Kessler: Okay.\nJoe Heel: Although, I think, in the second half, we have a substantial number of large deals that are North America centric, with North American customers having increased demand for the products that they have been buying from us previously. And so, I think, our overall deal mix will not shift that much, even though the recovery in particular on the run rate will be stronger outside of the U.S.\nJeff Kessler: Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gustafsson for any closing remarks.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. Thank you. So, to wrap up, I would like to thank our employees, customers and partners who are working in the frontline during this challenging time. And we're also looking forward to welcoming the Reflexis team once we close the transaction. Stay safe everyone.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joe Heel",
            "content": "Well, we have a strong backlog position, as Anders and Olivier said. Some of the projects are multi-quarter, so we do have some backlog already building for future quarters, but it's too early to determine how strong relatively our future quarter backlog will be. Maybe I can add one or two things. This is Joe Hill speaking. Generally speaking, besides, the buy online pickup-in-store, productivity and resiliency are at a premium for our retailers and think not only at the store, but also the warehouses. And so, the types of solutions that we have in improving productivity warehouses, where there's less reliance on workers to do tasks, including things like the investments that we made in Locus Robotics, are going to be an increasing trend in retail, which also helps improve their resiliency when there are incidents, for example, in a warehouse. And this also extends to contact free solutions. One of the features of BOPIS is that it's contact free. And there are other contact free elements of the retail interaction that we think will be here to stay, for example, payment transactions or contracts free kiosks as opposed to interaction with workers. So, those are a few other trends that we're seeing that generally benefit us in retail. Two additional comments. Remember that nearly half of our business is outside of the U.S. And in regions, including Asia, as well as in Europe, we are seeing the run rate business improve. Whereas in the U.S., it's still a bit too early to say that we have a sustained improvement. But, for example, in several countries in Asia, we are seeing growth in our run rate. Second, in terms of the channels themselves, it is fair to say that our channel business among our larger partners has been stronger than it has been among our smaller partners. It may be too early to speak of a consolidation, but it would be -- but at least that is what we are seeing. And one further data point just on that. In China, our printing business is rebounding faster than our other businesses. So that gives you an indication that there is a positive trend that will likely come back at the end of this cycle. Although, I think, in the second half, we have a substantial number of large deals that are North America centric, with North American customers having increased demand for the products that they have been buying from us previously.

            "name": "Anders Gustafsson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I would like to emphasize that our top priority continues to be the health and wellbeing of our employees, customers and partners. I am particularly grateful for all of the frontline workers, including medical professionals who continue to serve our communities and keep us safe. Zebra and many of our many of our customers' workplaces have commenced reopening plans, and I am very proud of the ability of our teams to effectively serve our customers and partners, while working remotely through the peak of the pandemic. In Q2, our teams remained agile and executed very well through pandemic. It has been inspiring for me to see our employees rally to keep the business and each other moving forward. Although, the financial results we published this morning reflect a challenging second quarter environment as we navigated through the peak of the crisis. Zebra's longer term prospects have strengthened as secular trends to digitize and automate workflows have accelerated with the pandemic. In Q2, we realized a net sales decline of 12%. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.3%, which contracted by 290 basis points and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.41, a 20% decrease from the prior year. As the virus spread end market weakness affected all of our major geographies, particularly our Asia-PAC and Latin America regions. The impact was most pronounced in our run rate business, which required our distributors to reduce their inventory levels. However, sales growth in services was the bright spot and enterprise mobile computing relatively outperformed. Although, premium shipping costs due to the pandemic impacted gross margin more than we had anticipated. We diligently managed discretionary costs across the company to preserve profitability and cash flow. Despite the challenging environment, our enterprise customers have been prioritizing spend with Zebra. Our solutions are a key enabler of their strategy to digitize their operations, as well as supporting the central use cases during pandemic. Large order volume was strong across vertical markets increasing over the prior year. I would like to highlight some notable Q2 wins from large customers supporting critical use cases. A leading home improvement retailer expanded their relationship with us by purchasing 10,000 of our printers to address multiple front-of-store use cases, including curbside pickup and in aisle label printing. Their shift to mobile on demand printing is expected to significantly improve worker productivity and replaced a competitor's stationary printers. We also secured a competitive takeaway win with a federal retail commissary to deploy more than 7,000 mobile computers. Our solution enables this customer to satisfy multiple use cases, including curbside pickup. We were pleased to support a large healthcare organization by providing a wide range of mobile computers, scanners, and printers to quickly ramp their point-of-care and clinical communication needs as they added 4,000 hospital beds to treat COVID patients. Additionally, as expected, we began deploying TC7 Series mobile computers to USPS postal carriers in late Q2. We expect the majority of the deployment to occur in 2021. We continue to collaborate with these customers to support their essential needs and drive it further improvement in their workflows. I am pleased that we have substantially completed our global product sourcing diversification initiative, despite modest delays due to the pandemic. Replicating production lines outside of China into broader Asia mitigates supply chain risk, and enables us to avoid tariffs on our U.S. imports. With that, I will now turn the call over to Olivier to review our Q2 financial results and discuss our outlook. Thank you, Olivier. We are excited to announce the acquisition Reflexis this morning, which we expect to close by early Q4. Reflexis is a leading provider of intelligent workforce management, task execution and communication solutions for the retail, food service, hospitality and banking industries. Combining Reflexis market leading platform with Zebra's complementary software offerings, including Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Workforce Connect provides us the unique opportunity to unify the store associate experience. We also expect that Zebra's scale vertical market expertise and go-to-market footprint will drive substantial synergies, not only in retail, but in other key vertical markets, such as healthcare. Reflexis is a high growth recurring revenue business with sales of $66 million in 2019, which doubled over a three-year period and the gross margin profile approximately 20 points higher than Zebra's corporate average. The next slide illustrates how this acquisition fits into our broader vision. Slide 12 highlights how we are building our capabilities as a solutions provider. Our deep understanding of workflows and unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast install base uniquely positions us to solve complex challenges at the edge. It is our top priority to invest in software solutions and services that help our customers leverage real-time data to better orchestrate their workflows and gain a performance advantage. Methods for sensing, analyzing and acting on operational data from the frontline of business are transforming with emerging technologies, such as computer vision and machine learning. Increasingly large volumes of data are generated and captured from our products. Enterprises are asking us to help them put that data to work by amassing disparate points of information to drive actions to their frontline workers in near real-time. Our intelligent edge solutions, including our SmartX and MotionWorks offerings demonstrate how we are enhancing the value proposition for our customers by addressing a wide variety of use cases across their business. This evolving suite of solutions enables Zebra to fuel our customer's workflows we did so they can be fully optimized. Reflexis' capabilities will be enhanced when they are combined with Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, worker collaboration and physical inventory software solutions. For example, Reflexis can provide dynamic prioritization of tasks extending across a broader set of data driven activities, such as stocking shelves, receiving a truck while delivering an order curbside when integrated with our Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Workforce Connect applications. Ultimately, through this acquisition, we expect customers to find even greater value in equipping all of their associates with mobile computers. On slide 13 we highlight the primary vertical markets that we serve. We are excited about our longer term opportunities in our end markets, as customers are driven to improve their technological capabilities in an increasingly on demand economy. Since our last quarterly update, we are seeing improvement in this challenging global environment, although it is still a mixed picture depending on the sector. In healthcare, our fastest growing vertical, clinical care remains critical and is the primary area Zebra serves. Our healthcare solutions help hospitals flex their capacity needs as the pandemic evolves. Our solutions are being used in labs and drive through testing facilities to provide safe and efficient care. Non-critical care and elective procedures are resuming. Longer term, we believe the need for increased visibility into the entire patient journey will drive increased demand for our solutions. Approximately two-thirds of our business in retail is to mass merchants, grocers, and e-tailers who have been prioritizing investment in our technology for their omni-channel fulfillment. E-commerce and buy online pickup at store transactions have increased dramatically through the pandemic. Department stores and apparel retailers have been reopening their doors, which has been critical to those heavily reliant on brick and mortar sales. In the transportation and logistics space, strong e-commerce growth continues to drive parcel volumes and last mile delivery, which is favorable to Zebra. Conversely, passenger airlines, rental car providers, and parts of the distribution industry are resuming activity yet far from capacity. The manufacturing sector continues to be the most impacted in the current environment with COVID-19 and global trade tensions. Discrete manufacturers in aviation, auto and discretionary specialty goods have been particularly challenged during the heart of the crisis. Many segments within process manufacturing, such as food and pharmaceutical companies, have been less impacted. In closing, we are successfully navigating through this challenging environment and are confident that our business fundamentals and strategy are sound. By continuing to focus on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision and addressing our customer's needs, we expect to emerge from this crisis in a stronger competitive position. We continue to be very optimistic regarding our longer term prospects as secular trends to digitize and automate workflows accelerate with the pandemic. Now, I'll hand the call back over to Mike. Yeah. I'd say in this environment, our solutions have become even more critical for our customers than they were before. And we are uniquely positioned to empower frontline workers across all our end markets. So I'd say the crisis has been accelerating a number of secular trends around digitization and automation. And I think that probably spans all our vertical markets, all four key vertical markets. If you dig in a little bit deeper on retail, I'd say grocers, which were certainly on a large part of our customer base before, e-tailers, grocers, mass merchants are about two-thirds of our business, but the growth in just grocery revenues, but particularly buy online pickup-in-store has been quite significant. And we've seen grocers across the -- particularly in the U.S. but across -- certainly Europe and the U.S. invest materially in enabling, scaling up their ability to do omni-channel in particularly buy online pickup at store. So that has been a big change. I think buy online pickup at store has gone from being more of a niche application before to now mainstream. And I'd say across the board in retail that customers who say we're in segments that were struggling a bit more before or during the downturn, I think everybody recognizes now that they can't be a 100% reliant on in-store purchases that omni-channel and the e-commerce side of their businesses needs to grow or expand. So, we see people spending more and more -- giving more attention to kind of omni-channel part of their business and how to be able to respond to situations like the one we had in Q2. Yeah. So are very excited about the addition of the Reflexis team to Zebra and that business. We've known each other for quite a long time. Reflexis has been a premier IC partner of Zebra. And we've been in dialogue with them about this transaction for some time. The transaction very much helps to augment our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision of empowering every worker at the edge with insights that drive real-time action. So, this is entirely consistent with our broader vision. And it leverages our existing software assets and some of our hardware. So, if you think of Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, which looks at all sorts of data sources to glean insights and drive actions that can now fuel Reflexis' engine of driving actions, too. And our Workforce Connect can be one of the ways that we augment the Reflexis platform to have a more efficient way of communicating between employees and workers to ensure the right person get the right action at the right time. It's -- obviously, we serve most retail customers. So, there's a lot of overlap. And we think there's great opportunity for us to do some cross-selling and up-selling across the portfolio. If you look specifically at how the customer base of Reflexis has performed during the lockdown, two-thirds of their customers were open and operated like normal. About one-sixth had some partial shutdowns or slowdowns, and one-sixth were fully shutdown, but are now open. So, first, I think, the acquisition of Reflexis is very consistent with our broader approach that we've talked about for some time to align with our strategy of either driving growth in our core -- identifying, acquiring companies that expand our leadership in the core or rapidly grow in near adjacencies or accelerate our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. And Reflexis fits into the accelerating the Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. I don't think -- we don't think of it as a big departure from how we have thought about the business, or how we have executed over the last few years. Software has become a bigger and bigger part of it. The last three acquisitions now including Reflexis have been pure software acquisitions. Although, I'm not saying that, that by any means, it's going to be -- that's the only thing we're focusing on for the future, but we are building more and more software assets and software capabilities. And even internally, more than two-thirds of our engineers are software engineers. So, software is clearly a very important part of how we deliver value to our customers, even if that is as a standalone software offering or as a more integrated solution between hardware and software. Yeah. I'll let Joe comment here also afterwards. But we have seen -- I guess, first, stabilization and signs of improvement in our run rate business and -- which we tend to kind of talk about them as run rate and SMB as being the same, but they're not necessarily the same, but it's not. Now, I think the SMB segment was harder hit by the shutdown. Most SMB companies were not deemed essential and therefore, were shutdown harder. And we have also more manufacturers that's part of our SMB or run rate business, but we are seeing them return to more healthy outlook and sequential growth. We also say that our -- we work hard to make sure that we maintained healthy inventory levels within our channel. So, when sales out numbers went down a little bit in Q2, sales in went down more. So, the end markets were somewhat healthier than our sales numbers would indicate. But now we're in a position to start growing with them as the economy expands. We have seen larger deals push into future quarters more dependent than on the type of customer. So, some would be retailers that had to shutdown altogether in Q2. They tended to push if they had bigger orders on the books into future quarters. Another example will be around, say, RFID, which often requires more in-store activities and also focus more on apparel or fashion retailers. So, anything that had to do with -- where we had to go into our customers' facilities to setup and implement the solutions would get pushed. But that's been offset by other customers that were operating and had to really scale up their operations to deal with the increased business that we're getting as part of the shutdown. Yeah. I think, our -- many of our software solutions did very well. If you look at, say, Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, as an example, we were able to win several new customers in Q2, and we were able to win and implement those customers without actually having to go on site. So that was one of the benefits of having a software solution like that. But other intelligent edge solutions that require onsite proof-of-concepts, pilots and so forth, they tended to be pushed out, and we're not growing the way we had expected. Yeah. The -- I'd say the larger orders that we've seen in retail in the last quarter or plus are really to help our existing customers scale their operations. So, it's not -- they're not necessarily building ahead or anything like that. So, I don't see a need for them to, say, pause or catch or deploy and catch up on the operations side with what they have deployed. But obviously there's many customers and somehow different profiles than others. But generally, they are just basically trying to deploy devices into existing use cases where they scale in line with the number of headcount they have or the revenues they have for those applications. Yeah. The printer business is more -- has a much higher proportion of run rate as part of its revenue stream. It supports more SMB and manufacturing customers. So, the profile of the customer base is -- was more exposed to COVID-19 shutdowns or slowdowns. I'd say if we dig into the printing portfolio a little deeper, our card printing business was particularly hard hit. Card printing, they do -- they support events. Obviously, there weren't a lot of events in Q2. Badges for employees, drivers' licenses, all sorts of things that were hit more harder. But we did start to see -- particularly manufacturing opportunities to resurface in Asia-PAC later in Q2. And if you look at our supplies business, Temptime had a very strong Q2 and grew its vial monitoring solutions for existing vaccines. And we were doing things in emerging markets for COVID-19 test kits. And once we get a proper vaccine, we see opportunities for that to continue to do well. We also worked here on making sure that the channel had appropriate inventory positions. So, we did reduce inventory in the channel, but kept the days on hand just stable. So, we're coming out of this with a healthy inventory position where we can grow the business now in line with how the economy grows. But we do believe that we actually gained share in printing in the first half of this year. So, based on all our data points, we believe that we actually gained some share. So, we've talked about our core markets being around $10 billion in size and that we have we've had an incremental $15 billion market size in our adjacent markets, right? The -- and some of those adjacent markets that took us from $10 billion to $25 billion in total size will include tablets, supplies, RFID. Our -- many of our software solutions are new. And there is no -- it's a little difficult to say what the TAM is because they -- you could calculate it by, say, if every retailer on the planet were to deploy it, the TAM would be very, very large. It's not quite that today, but it is a substantial TAM and it's a higher -- faster growing market than our core markets. So, clearly, this expands our addressable markets and positions us to participate in additional high growth markets where we also get attractive synergies by being able to cross-sell and up-sell. Yeah. Thank you. So, to wrap up, I would like to thank our employees, customers and partners who are working in the frontline during this challenging time. And we're also looking forward to welcoming the Reflexis team once we close the transaction. Stay safe everyone."

            "name": "Olivier Leonetti",
            "content": "Thank you, Anders. Let us walk through the P&L on slide six. Net sales declined 12.9% in the second quarter, which is 12% before the impact of currencies and acquisitions. Despite our sales decline, we believe that we continue to outperform the market in these challenging environment. As Anders mentioned, large order volume was stronger than the prior period. Our performance was untimely due to a sharp decline in small and midsize business to the channel, which disproportionately impacted printing and data capture. We are encouraged that distributor inventory levels are healthy and sales out trends have been improving. Our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales decreased 5.4%. We grew services revenue and mobile computing relatively outperformed. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment has been most impacted by the global recessionary environment, with sales decreasing 24.9%. Printing and supplies each declined double-digits. Services was a relative outperformer. Managed and professional services performed particularly well with growth driven by strong product attach rates over the past 12 months. Our location solutions and Zebra Retail Solutions offerings were extremely soft due to pause in project activity due to the pandemic. Turning to our regions. In North America sales declined 7%. Services grew and mobile computing was relative outperformer. EMEA sales declined 13%. We achieved solid growth in services and slight growth in mobile computing. We saw strength in Central and Northern Europe. Sales in our Asia-Pacific region declined 21%, driven by COVID-19 impacts. China improved sequentially from Q1, but was the largest contributor to the original sales decline. Japan and Korea were bright spots in the quarter where our go-to-market investments are delivering results. Latina America sales have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and macroeconomic factors and declined 33%. All geographies declined double-digits with the exception of Mexico. Adjusted gross margin contracted 360 basis points to 44.1%, driven primarily by two points of impact from unfavorable business mix, two points of impact from premium freight cost, other COVID mitigation and China import tariffs, partially offset by improved services margin. Adjusted operating expenses declined $44 million from the prior year period and improved 50 basis points as a percentage of sales. This improvement was primarily due to prudent cost management and lower incentive compensation. We were able to encompass -- to accomplish this while preserving our research and development projects. Second quarter EBITDA margin was 18.3%, a 290 basis point decrease from the prior period, driven entirely by lower gross margin. We drove non-GAAP earnings per deleted shares of $2.41, a $0.61 or 20% year-over-year decrease, which is inclusive of $0.27 negative impact from the transitory effects of premium freight expense and tariffs. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide seven. We generated $322 million of free cash flow in the first half of 2020. This was more than double the prior period, primarily due to a lower use of working capital and our expanded accounts receivable factoring program. Additionally, in Q2, we made a $31 million incremental investment in Locus Robotics, the market leader in autonomous mobile robots for fulfillment warehouses. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter at the modest 1.3 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which provides us ample financial flexibility. Turning to slide eight. We have been successfully navigating this unprecedented global environment. As I just mentioned, our balance sheet is in excellent shape with lower debt levels and $915 million of availability under our revolver, allowing ample capacity for business investment. Our capital light business model, flexible cost structure and strong free cash flow profile allows us to preserve profitability and cash flow in challenging times. The reliable cash flow generation gives us a competitive advantage as we prioritize investment in the business through any environment. Let us turn to our outlook. We believe Q2 was the peak impact to Zebra from the pandemic. We remain in the recovery phase and expect sales trends and profitability to improve in the second half of the year. We entered the third quarter with a solid backlog. We have seen an increase in business activity and our deal pipeline is building nicely. Based on these factors, we expect Q3 net sales to decline between 3% and 7%, which is a meaningful sequential improvement from Q2 trend. This outlook assumes an approximately 50 basis point negative impact from foreign currency changes. We would continue to preserve profitability while doing no harm to the business. This enabled us to prioritize strategic investment so that we emerge stronger as the market rebounds. We believe Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin would be approximately 19%, which assumes lower operating expenses and the lower gross margin, reflecting higher larger order mix and approximately $9 million of transitory premium freight expense. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.95. The premium freight cost expectation equates to $0.14 EPS impact. You can see other modeling assumptions on slide nine. Note that our outlook does not include any projected reserves from the pending acquisition of Reflexis. Anders will discuss the strategic acquisition in a few moments. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision and end market trends. Yeah. Good morning, Andrew. So, you're right. We expect in the quarter EBITDA margin to be around 19%. So, OpEx as a proportion of revenue will decline year-on-year and gross margin should -- rate should decline due to two factors. First, plenum freight, that would be about the point of impact in the quarter, but also mainly higher level of large deals in the quarter. We had mentioned that now for two quarters. Our business, large deal business is doing very well, actually growing year-on-year and expected to grow in Q3 and in Q2 and our run rate business has been impacted mainly by the pandemic. We believe that this trend will not last, that's point number one. We believe that run rate is starting to increase and will keep increasing. And an important point on the like-for-like basis, margin has been improving. Correct. Yeah. We entered Q3 with a solid backlog position. It was quite strong considering the overall environment, but that was driven by the high proportion of larger deals. So, we've seen a lot of our larger customers, particularly in retail and T&L accelerate their investments. And they also then -- in this case gave us the orders prior to the start of the quarter. And that gives us, obviously, a great deal of confidence in the outlook we give for Q3. Joe, I don't know if you have any further comments here. But it's correct to say -- the pipeline for Q4 is good. So we feel encouraged about kind of the way that the market seems to be recovering. And the final comment, Andrew, we're not giving, of course, a guide for Q4. Too many uncertainties at the moment for obvious reasons. But we believe that Q4 from a revenue standpoint and profitability standpoint will be an improvement relative to Q3. And in terms of customer concentration, Jim, the asset has a low level of concentration of sales towards a few customers, and Reflexis has been performing extremely well during the pandemic. We believe that the asset will indeed increase the overall margin of the business, I mean, not only because it's software, but also because of the impact it will have on the hardware part of the business as well. So, very synergic from a revenue and margin standpoint. So, Q2 had an USPS order. This order was shipped at the end of the quarter, so relatively material to the quarter. USPS is ramping in Q3. But as we have said before, the large majority of the USPS order will be shipped next year, probably in the first half of next year. And we're not going to talk about margin, of course, of USPS today. But usually large deals have a lower margin and run rate, so it would impact the company rate. So, it's -- let me try to cover the key points on this. So, if you look at, going forward, in terms of transitory cost, we are now done and our supply chain did an amazing job in diversifying our supply chain out of China. So, this work is done. And we're not going to have any impact due to tariff going forward. So that's not part of Q3 and obviously, forward P&L. So that's point number one. Point number two. We're going to have some impact due to premium freight in Q3. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that about $9 million -- about 80 basis points worth of margin rate, that will decrease towards the end of the year. And we believe that this trend should now stop going forward. So that would be a second item. When it comes to OpEx. We have been able to manage OpEx and adjust OpEx as revenue was declining. We'll keep doing that in the year. Now you are asking, do we have some of those OpEx reductions, which are going to be permanent? We believe so. It would be premature to mention a number today, because we want to keep investing in the business as well. Yeah. Yeah. Your number is about right. I mean, if I was to give you the phasing and maybe we can take that after the call of today. Tariff impact in Q1 was about one point. That is transitory. In Q2, the impact of tariff and premium freight was about two points. Premium freight impact in Q3 will be about one point. And we believe that all those transitory costs to a large extent will be gone by Q4 onwards. And we take the details after this call as well. You're right, Rich. If you look at today, in terms if you look at Q2 and Q3, we believe we're going to be able to scale OpEx as a proportion of revenue in about the same level. And then in terms of margin, we're going to have over those two quarters the same impact of large bid mix, which would impact gross margin. But we believe that largely those trends will stop as we enter into the fourth quarter. That's why I indicated during an earlier question that profitability in Q4 will certainly increase relative to Q3 and Q2. I think you summarized it well. We see all the regions improving in Q3 and Q4 relative to Q2. But the main recovery is outside North America. You're absolutely right."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Steele: Before we begin, I need to inform you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking and subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations of our GAAP to non-GAAP results in today\u2019s earnings press release and at the end of this slide presentation. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Anders Gustafsson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Olivier Leonetti, our Chief Financial Officer. Anders will begin with our first quarter results. Then Olivier will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our outlook. Anders will conclude with opportunities to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision and trends we are seeing in our end markets. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Senior Vice President of Global Sales, will join us as we take your questions. Also, throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from the recently acquired Cortexica, Temptime and Profitect businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Anders.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I would like to say that our top priority at this time is to health and wellbeing of our employees, customers and partners. We are grateful to all of the frontline workers, especially those sacrificing their personal safety, so that all of us can continue to live and work safely through this challenging time. Those on our customers\u2019 front lines are heroes serving in hospitals, grocery stores, delivery vehicles, warehouses and other parts of the central supply chains that help keep our lives as normal as possible. Many Zebra employees are also on the frontline supporting the build and repair of products and solutions that are essential to our customers, doing their jobs safely and efficiently. To all of those heroes, we say thank you. The financial results we published this morning reflect a challenging first quarter environment. We realized a net sales decline of 1%. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.1%, which contracted by 200 basis points and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.67, a 9% decrease from the prior year. We had a strong start to the year and January and February generally played out to our expectations; however, late in the quarter as COVID-19 evolved into a global pandemic. We experienced significant supply chain disruption including product manufacturing delays, restrictions on transportation of goods, and a temporary closure in late March of a key distribution center supplying the Americas. We took extraordinary steps to produce and supply our mission critical products to customers around the world. Our team was agile, pivoting our resources quickly to closely monitor the situation and take bold action. For example, we chartered plans to expedite product delivery from China to North America and Europe to meet customer commitments. Despite best efforts, we were unable to completely fulfill our order book in the quarter, resulting in a high backlog as we entered Q2. Production in China is now returning to normal and we have stabilized our global supply chain through mitigating actions. In addition to the supply chain challenges, we saw softer demand through the channel globally and China sales were very weak with COVID-19 exasperating trends that had already been soft due to trade tensions. However, in any environment, enterprises worldwide utilized our solutions to address the evolving needs of their customers. In this changing environment, our solutions have become even more necessary for our customers. I would like to highlight a few notable Q1 wins supporting critical used cases in omni-channel, e-commerce and healthcare. One of the world\u2019s largest mass merchants purchased 40,000 of our ZQ6 series mobile printers to address a number of front of store use cases, including online store pickup, pharmacy fulfillment, and shelf tagging. Additionally, we deployed several thousand TC5 series mobile computers to a large e-commerce player in Asia. This follows our competitive takeaway win last year of their printing and scanning business. With COVID-19, this e-tailers demand is growing exponentially. They have been hiring staff and we are working with them on additional solutions. In healthcare, we supported the NHS Nightingale temporary hospital in the UK. We provided an installed solutions supporting the identification and flow of COVID-19 patients. Nurses at NHS have also been using our TC5 series healthcare mobile computers to arrange virtual visits between patients and their loved ones. As expected, transitory effects of tariffs and expedited shipping expenses weighed heavily on Q1 gross margin and EPS. We have taken decisive actions to mitigate this impact which drove operating expense leverage, despite lower sales volume. We continue to remain agile and take appropriate action as results are pressured due to these challenging macroenvironment. With that, I will now turn the call over to Olivier to review our Q1 financial results and discuss our outlook.\nOlivier Leonetti: Thank you, Anders. Let us walk through the P&L on Slide 6. Net sales declined 1.3% in the first quarter, less than 1% on an organic basis before the impacts of currencies and acquisition. The COVID-19 pandemic caused supply and demand impacts to our consolidated sales growth of approximately seven percentage points. Despite our sales decline, we believe that we generally are performed in the market globally. Our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales was most impacted by the COVID-19 disruption and sales decreased 2.9%. The largest supply chain impact was the temporary closure in North American distribution center that Anders referenced, which delayed shipments of mobile computers into the channel. Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment sales increased 3.2% with relative strength in printing and Zebra retail solutions. We saw a solid growth in managed and professional services across both segments of the business, primarily driven by solid attach rates on increased product sales over the last 12 months.  Our Locations solutions business was lower due to a pause in project spending. Turning to our regions, in North America, sales were flat, declining mobile computing due to COVID-19 supply chain challenges was offset by growth in all other major categories. EMEA sales increased 7%, with relative strength in mobile computing, printing and services. We saw particular strength in Central Europe. Sales in our Asia Pacific region declined 21%, driven by COVID-19 impacts on top of continued softness in China due to trade tensions. China was down 35%, driving most of the original sales decline. Latin America sales declined 11% led by lower mobile computing sales, largely impacted by supply chain disruption. Adjusted gross margin contracted 200 basis point to 45.2%, driven primarily by List 4 tariffs and expedited freight as well as unfavorable large order mix. Adjusted operating expenses declined $5 million from the prior year period and improved 10 basis points as a percentage of sales. This improvement was primarily due to prudent cost management and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by the inclusion of expenses from recently acquired businesses. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.1%, a 200 basis point decrease from the prior period driven entirely by lower gross margin. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.67, a 9% year-over-year decrease inclusive of $0.17 negative impact from the transitory effects of tariffs and expedited freight expense. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $95 million of free cash flow in Q1. This was higher than the prior period, primarily due to lower use of working capital. We repurchased $200 million of shares in Q1, leaving $753 million of remaining capacity under the authorization. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter at the modest 1.5 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio. Turning to Slide 8. We are well equipped to navigate the unprecedented global environment that we are facing. As I just mentioned, our balance sheet is in excellent shape with low debt levels and $740 million of capacity under our revolver. We deliver mission-critical solutions, increasingly diverse end-markets. Our capital-light business model has a highly variable cost structure due to all outsourcing of product manufacturing and driving the vast majority of our sales volume to third party distribution. We also have a strong free cash flow profile with a flexible cost structure and capital expenditures typically less than 1.5% of sales. We also have a track record of preserving profitability and cash flow in challenging times. We use a playbook to take appropriate actions in various scenarios, preserving capacity for investments in the business that improve our competitive position. Let us turn to our outlook. Given the low visibility due to COVID-19, we are withdrawing our outlook for full year net sales, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. We now expect these three metrics to be lower than last year, which would we address to cost actions we announced our profitability and cash flow. Q2 and Q3 expected to be particularly challenging quarters based on macroeconomic forecast, independent market research and feedback from our partners and customers. In this freed environment, we have done extensive scenario planning and identified many operational and financial levers that we can pull. It is imperative that we stick to our principles of acting swiftly to preserve profitability while doing no harm to the business to reinforcement of our culture. This enabled us to prioritize strategic investments, so that we are much stronger than the competition as the market rebounds. As Anders mentioned, we entered the second quarter with a strong backlog driven by temporary supply chain disruptions from the pandemic. As the virus has spread, end market weakness is affecting all of our major geographies across the globe. The impact is more pronounced in our run rate business through the channel as third party distributors are calibrating inventory levels. Given these pressures and elevated uncertainty, we expect net sales to decline in Q2 between 11% and 17%. These outlook assumes an approximately 50 basis point positive impact from recent acquisitions and an approximately one percentage point negative impact from foreign currency changes. We believe Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin would be between 18% and 19%, which assumes lower operating expenses and the lower gross margin reflecting a $5 million impact from List 4 tariffs and approximately $9 million of cost to mitigate supply chain disruption from COVID-19. Collectively, these transitory items, I expect it to impact margin by approximately 150 basis points and EPS by $0.22. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.50. Please reference other 2020 modeling assumptions on Slide 9. On Slide 10, we provide an update on the anticipated impacts to Zebra from the Section 301 tariffs on products imported to the U.S. We are generally on track to diversify our global sourcing footprint by mid-2020, despite some modest delays due to COVID-19, particularly in our Malaysian facility. In Vietnam, we have been ramping our expectations. This initiative is expected to mitigate our geographic concentration risk. It also adds the immediate benefit of substantially mitigating List 4 tariffs that became effective last September, impacting our mobile computers and printers. We continue to work with our contract manufacturing partners to replicate production lines in order to move most of our U.S. volumes to broader Asia. These actions are currently expected to result in approximately $20 million of onetime pretax charges in the first half of 2020, plus approximately $10 million of capital expenditures. In the first quarter, tariffs negatively impacted gross profit by $7 million. We expect this impact to decline to $5 million in Q2 as we launch alternate sources of supply outside of China. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision and market trends.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Olivier. Slide 12 highlights how we are enhancing the value proposition for our customers. Our solutions are even more critical today than ever as we give the frontline and edge by empowering them with technology to do their job most effectively. Industry-leading companies trust Zebra to equip their workers and facilities with the solutions that bring their mission-critical operations to the next level. We are uniquely positioned to address this challenge because we have a deep understanding of workflows and unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast installed base. We can address big global problems such as ensuring food safety across the supply chain or a broad range of more localized issues like increasing bed turns in the hospital, modernizing distribution centers to satisfy e-commerce demands or ensuring that retail associates and store inventory are optimized to maintain product availability. We have been bringing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision to life for our customers. We are doing this by enabling them to identify their assets through barcode, RFID and computer vision. Locate their assets with our vertical-specific solutions and understand their condition, such as temperature, trailer capacity and device security, so that their frontline workers can take the best next action in real-time. Methods for sensing, analyzing and acting on operational data from the frontline of business have undergone massive transformation in past years as the on-demand economy has taken hold. Inefficient manual processes have evolved into workflows that are augmented and enriched by purpose-built technologies, including hardware, software and intelligent edge solutions that bring it all together. Businesses are now demanding information about what is happening at the edge of their operations so that they can run their entire operation smoother, safer and smarter. They generate large volumes of data and are uncertain how to take all those disparate points of information and effectively put it to work in near real-time. We have been investing in software solutions and services that help our customers leverage real-time data to better orchestrate their workflows and gain a performance advantage. Investments in advancing our capabilities in this area remain a top priority. On Slide 13, we highlight the primary vertical markets that we serve. Exciting longer-term growth remain and new ones are evolving as customers in these markets are pressured to improve their technological capabilities in an increasingly on demand economy. That said, we are seeing mixed trends in this challenging environment, depending on the subsector. Many of our customers are deemed essential businesses, while various others may be temporarily closed for business. In health care, the pandemic dramatically increases the need for additional acute care capacity, which is the primary area that we serve. Our suite of purpose-built health care solutions are enabling pop-up hospitals, drive-through testing facilities and labs to scale quickly and provide safe and efficient care. Other parts of health care have seen a slowdown as government mandates in many locations have paused noncritical care and elective procedures until further notice. Approximately 2/3 of our business in retail is the mass merchants, grocers and e-tailers who are serving essential customer needs. Many retailers rely on our technology to execute their omnichannel fulfillment effectively. E-commerce and Buy Online Pick Up In Store transactions have increased as more consumers navigate purchasing from their homes. However, social distancing and stay-at-home orders are further impacting department stores and certain apparel retailers who are heavily reliant on in-store purchases. In the transportation and logistics space, increased online purchasing from households is driving incremental parcel volume and delivery, which drives increased demand for our solutions. Conversely, government-mandated restrictions are severely pressuring passenger airlines, rental car providers and certain segments of the distribution industry. The manufacturing sector has been challenged with global trade tensions and is facing additional challenges today as stay-at-home orders have deemed many discrete manufacturers, such as auto, aviation and specialty goods, nonessential. That said, some of these customers have been created with their idle operations by producing medical equipment like ventilators, utilizing our solutions. Many segments within process manufacturing, such as food and pharmaceutical companies, remain essential and are less impacted. In closing, we are confident that our business fundamentals and strategy are sound and that this crisis will not last. By focusing on serving our customers\u2019 needs and continued investment in innovation, we expect to extend our market leadership position as the market rebounds. Now I\u2019ll hand the call back over to Mike.\nMike Steele: Thanks, Anders. We will now open the call for Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today\u2019s first question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on your Q2 sales guide. You had a good backlog into the quarter, and it seemed as though you Asia \u2013 your North America sales seemed to be okay this quarter. So I\u2019m wondering, is this just a function of your backlog? And beyond that, is there a concern you just haven\u2019t quite seen the effect of this hit other regions outside of Asia?\nAnders Gustafsson: Andrew, good morning. We have today a lower visibility of the business due to the impact of COVID-19. And we are basically pegged as a business to the economy. And a lot of what we see in Q2 is a question mark on the length of the stay at home and also the impact of the various stimulus packages, either current or to come. And if you study the company over the recent past, we have an history of rebounding quickly when the economy restarts. Now when it comes to Q2, specifically, what we see today is obviously the impact only due to COVID, we believe we are in a strong competitive position. We believe that, for example, in Q1, we have gained shares. We had a strong backlog entering the quarter. And we see today from a top line standpoint mainly an impact being more pronounced on run rate, which is part of the business going through distribution. And we have seen our distributors, partners adjusting the level inventory. So this is what we see today going on. But we believe we have a strong value proposition, which works well in good and bad times, and we\u2019re going to be ready to manage this downturn, Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. And then your guidance for EBITDA margin. I think it was a bit ahead of where some people were expecting. Directionally, is this a function of your gross margins being up sequentially? What\u2019s really \u2013 what\u2019s behind that margin guidance? That\u2019s \u2013 sort of ballpark.\nAnders Gustafsson: So if you look at \u2013 of course, so if you look at EBITDA, at the midpoint, the EBITDA margin will decline year-on-year by about 270 basis points, so 270 basis points. 1.5%, so 150 basis points is due to one-off items, either associated with tariffs or associated with the management of the pandemic, mainly impacting our freight expense. And then the balance is a point of margin being lost due to run rate mix. So if you look at today, if we disaggregate the revenue between bid and run rate, run rate margin is much higher than bids, and we have seen the run rate of revenue declining. However, the margin profile for run rate and bid have been increasing sequentially now for a few quarters. So what you see at play in the profitability is a margin impact and largely \u2013 large proportion of the margin impact being due to tariff and C19. From an OpEx standpoint, we believe we\u2019re going to be able to retain the OpEx as a proportion of revenue constant or relative to last year.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Paul Coster at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPaul Coster: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I\u2019ve got two. The first one is, can you give us your latest thoughts on the USPS projects? And I know as we throw the second question in now and that is, it sounds like you expect the channel to destock. Is that a 2Q phenomenon in the guidance? Or do you think it will take more than one quarter for them to do that? And can you quantify that in any way?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. Good morning, Paul. I will take both of these ones. First, on USPS. USPS contract continues as per our expectations. As we\u2019ve talked about before, this is a multiyear contract. We certainly feel very proud of it, biggest in our history. I think highlights the strength of our value proposition and the strength of our relationships. Our teams \u2013 our respective teams, the Zebra team and the USPS team, they continue to work very closely together. Both sides are very engaged. So there\u2019s no expectations or signs from our side that this will be pushed out in any way.  As we said in our last quarter call, we do expect to begin ramping up in Q2, or ramping deliveries in Q2. And we do assume or expect that the majority of all the orders will be deployed by the end of 2021 as the backend is kind of gated by \u2013 when the U.S. carriers stop 3G service. And at that point, USPS will need to have moved off to new devices. We have received new orders beyond the current orders, so some new use cases, but within same framework for an additional 30,000 units. So, the business with USPS for us continues to be good. And we certainly look forward to starting to deploy in earnest. And then the other one on destocking the channel, at the moment I would say on a global basis, our distribution partners who are the ones who hold inventory are holding a normal days on hand inventory. We don\u2019t see it being high or low, particularly, it\u2019s going to be within the band considered to be normal. What we tend to see early in the downturn is that when sales out goes down, from a disti perspective, they adjust their days on hand, which means they don\u2019t have to buy as much in the short term. And then that tends to be more of a one quarter type of activity. So here we are assuming that there will be a reduction in the run rate for our distis and partners, which will cause some level of lesser inventory or maintain \u2013 you have maintain the same level of days on hand inventory. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning guys. Anders you are one of the few guys that\u2019s been around since the great recession back in 2008, 2009. Can you give me some of your thoughts in terms of how, I guess, your customers are responding now? And is there that same level of fear now that you had back then? I think we understand how your business has changed. But what was your interpretation of how the customers are reacting?\nAnders Gustafsson: I think the \u2013 obviously, there\u2019s a very different drivers for this crisis versus the 2009 crisis. So I\u2019d say our customers today are probably not as \u2013 well, back up and say, it very much now depends on which kind of vertical or sub segment of the business you are in. I think in 2009 every customer has concerns about liquidity, and so forth. Here we have a bit of a have and have not. So if you\u2019re a mass merchant, a grocer, e-tailer, or in healthcare, some of the delivery businesses, you are doing very well. They are super, super busy. And if you are more of a brick-and-mortar retailer selling apparel, you might be having shut down all your stores. I think from a customer behavior perspective, I\u2019d say when the orders around work-from-home started to be enacted it probably took two, three weeks for our customers to kind of scramble and get themselves organized to adapt to the new kind of working environments. They were very focused on just making sure their operations were \u2013 continue to run. But in the last \u2013 the last month I\u2019d say they started to come back and start engaging with us on both current and more future oriented projects. And we are trying to be \u2013 make sure we make good use of video conferencing to continue to engage and have the sessions with our customers. And I don\u2019t perceive that our customers overall or maybe as concerned with how long, or how are they going to come out of this recession. Maybe it feels like they have a bit more confidence.\nKeith Housum: Got it, thank you. And then, I think, I heard some of this in your script, but can you clarify again, like what percentage of your business do you think has done to essential customers?\nAnders Gustafsson: We didn\u2019t talk about it from the entire business, but if you look at retail specifically, which is our largest vertical, two thirds of our business there goes to mass merchants, grocers and e-tailers. And those are all deemed essential. Yes, we\u2019ve seen some interesting trends there that as people are adjusted to buying from home, not necessarily visiting the store as much. So Buy Online Pick Up In Store has become much more popular. Grocery volumes have gone up materially, but Buy Online Pick Up In Store has gone up exponentially. And I think that\u2019s a consumer behavior that is unlikely to work back to what it was. I think consumers have now learned a new way of shopping that they like. Then if you move, look to healthcare there we have, I would say, the majority of our business is tied to essential activities, acute care, specifically. And we have been part of pop-up hospitals, drive-through test facilities and just scaling existing the care facilities to be able to take care of the number of Covid-19 patients that come in. But obviously there\u2019s parts of healthcare that has been deemed non-essential, but that\u2019s a smaller part of our business that do elective care and so forth. Within transportation logistics, that\u2019s a \u2013 I can\u2019t really have \u2013 I don\u2019t have a good percentage number, but a good part of that business is obviously also a part of the essential economy, making sure that the essential supply chains work all the way from pharmaceuticals, to food, to e-commerce. I\u2019d say here for us the last mile of delivery so many more deliveries to households today and the last mile delivery drivers tend to have our type of devices. And so that\u2019s been helpful. But on the other hand, we see other transportation logistics businesses like aviation, auto, rental car companies and so forth that are under a lot of pressure. And lastly, manufacturing, there, I\u2019d say a lot of the discrete manufacturers, such as auto, aviation and specialty goods, nonessential. They make up less than 5% of our total revenues. While most, I would say, process manufacturing companies like food and pharma are deemed essential for us.\nJoe Heel: An additional point, Keith, as well, which we think is important, we think that the current situation would actually accelerate the secular trends we are serving. E-commerce, tracking, digitization of workflow, we believe that those trends are going to be even more important going forward.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, I think, to that point we see that our solutions have become more necessary for our customers as we really do empower the frontline workers across all the end markets. So, these are the people who cannot perform their duties from home. They have to be in hospital, a grocery store or a delivery truck. So I think the crisis is helping to accelerate trends around digitization, automation across the industries.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi thank you. Good morning. I had a question on \u2013 Anders, maybe I just wanted to go back to your comment about the haves and have nots, and that Slide 13 where you talk about some of the essential parts of the business in terms of vertical channels. Is it fair to say that the essential components, whether it\u2019s retail, e-commerce, healthcare, that that\u2019s been \u2013 you are anticipating that as a net benefit in the first half of the year? Or put it another way, would you expect that that potentially if we\u2019ve seen increasing investments in those areas that falls off in the second half in addition to the recessionary pressures that you are seeing in the traditional markets? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as \u2013 I think you can\u2019t give guidance for the full year, but I\u2019m just trying to get some feel for how that essential business might change from Q2 to Q3. I think you alluded to Q3, Olivier, being a particularly challenging quarter.\nOlivier Leonetti: Yes. So we\u2019re going to stop short of trying to give real color or guidance on the full year here. But I would say for us we do \u2013 our expectations is that this is a not a long-term change in how we operate and the world operates, but more of a several quarter activity. So we certainly expect it to impact Q2 and Q3. And then depending on how quickly the world rebounds we will follow. I\u2019d say for us one of the benefits we have is that we have a very robust business, a very diversified business across product lines, vertical markets and geographies. And our value propositions tend to work in good times and bad times, right. Good times, our customers are expanding, they are investing in the business and they use our equipment to help them do that. In tougher times, they tend to trade OpEx for CapEx. So they try to use us to get more efficiencies. Say, right now at the eye of the hurricane here, we are seeing, obviously, the \u2013 many of the essential businesses are being very busy this year than they had been before. I think how they are behaving today is that they are generally very focused on just making sure they can scale up their operations and, scale up the use of technology, but not necessarily having the bandwidth to think very creatively about how to leverage new solutions. I think that will come when the world settles down a little bit more. Customers that are not operating today, say, people who have had to shut down their operations, we are talking to them, still to make sure that we stay engaged and figure out how can we help them drive more of the digitization and automation of their businesses as they come back. So we feel that we are \u2013 we want to engage with all the customers that we have. But the \u2013 obviously, the ones that are essential are much more active in both running their businesses and in looking to figure out how to scale them.\nJoe Heel: Let me add something it is Joe Heel speaking. The concept Jim, that you mentioned about the haves and the have nots that Anders described earlier, also applies to a certain extent within the central customers. So, for example, in healthcare customers, you have of course COVID-related activity which is at the moment receiving a lot of attention, and funding, and therefore also activity from us. But you also have elective procedures which are being put off and corresponding investments that hospitals are making are being postponed. Within retailers, you see a lot of things around Buy Online Pick Up In Store, but for example, automation activities like we showcased with robot solution that we introduced earlier, those are being paused. Now the good news is that we\u2019re not yet seeing a drop off in confidence among those customers. The customers are still engaging with us remotely on those longer term solutions. And so we expect that that have not part will continue even in those essential sectors in the future.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nErik Lapinski: Hi, this is Eric on for Meta. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe just staying on the question of kind of conversations with customers, it sounds like for the most part you\u2019ve seen maybe a pushing off of projects. But can you help us, I guess, contextualize, like how much could the reason potential just scaling down of maybe the size of some orders? Or have you seen any potential cancellations from may be customers most impacted?\nAnders Gustafsson: So today we\u2019ve only seen a limited number of push outs. We have not seen any cancellations or any scaling down of orders, as you put it. I think \u2013 and the customers that have pushed out tends to be the ones that are not operating today at all. \nErik Lapinski: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just changing gears a bit. On share repurchases, understanding you kind of capitalize on the lower share price in the quarter. Like how should we think about the pace moving forward? Would you continue to be opportunistic? Or should we kind of expect may be more focused on cash flow preservation just looking at the uptick there?\nOlivier Leonetti: So we feel strong about the cash flow generation of the company as we said, as I said, we believe we can protect the majority of the free cash flow of the company, even during this downturn. Now the priority for cash allocation is going to be to invest in the business either organically or inorganically. We bought $200 million worth of shares, so it\u2019s about 2% of our shares outstanding. So at this stage, we are going to be mainly investing in the business and buyback would not be a priority. Now it\u2019s not going to be totally off the table, but not a priority.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Richard Eastman at Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.\nRichard Eastman: Yes, good morning and thank you. Could you perhaps \u2013 Olivier could you perhaps just expand a little bit on the supply chain issues that you had in the quarter? And maybe just speak to this Malaysian facility, which I\u2019m assuming was a subcontractor facility had some closure and some downtime. Is it up? And do you \u2013 could you just kind of give us a sense of how much revenue that may have impacted the first quarter?\nAnders Gustafsson: I think I\u2019ll start with this and then Olivier can help fill out some details. So if you go back until our Q4 call, we highlighted that COVID-19 would have an impact on our supply chain, but it was on the supply side of things. Since then the China has largely returned to normal. It took a little longer than expected, I would say. And there was dependent partly on where our contract manufacturing partners were located. So they had to return workers through a two-week quarantine periods, and so forth. But by the end of the quarter, our Chinese contract manufacturing partners were all working at over 90% capacity. So I think they became back a little bit slower, but it came back. We also then in the quarter tried to ramp up both our Vietnam and Malaysia facilities. And timing was a little more challenged as we were supposed to do that the Monday after the lunar New Year. And obviously no Chinese people were allowed to travel there to help set it up and to teach people. But we were, I think, quite agile and creative. So we set up video facilities so that we have people in China sitting and watching via video, what people in Vietnam and Malaysia were doing, to teach them as well as we could. And Vietnam facility has come up very nicely. It manufactured the same number of printers that we had expected, while the Malaysia facility started off a little slow, but then it got shutdown based on the Marshall Law that Malaysia implemented. But we\u2019re using the same techniques to get that facility up and running. The impact on Q1, I think, was very modest from that perspective. We\u2019ve diverted and try to make get as much out of China as we could. It had similar impact on tariffs as we now have to manufacture everything in China, or the vast majority of our products in China instead. And going forward, we expect that supply chain issues are going to be largely behind us. And what you see reflected in our guide for Q2 is many, some demand precious.\nJoe Heel: Yes, actually I think call out to our supply chain is in order. They\u2019ve done an excellent job of being agile and working in a very dynamic situation to make sure that the \u2013 all these issues had minimal impact on Q1 and Q2.\nRichard Eastman: And then just as a follow-up question, are there any receivables or credit issues that you are watching within \u2013 the virus don\u2019t hold a lot of inventory, but are there any credit issues so we \u2013 that you are watching carefully?\nJoe Heel: So we are spending a lot of time on working capital, obviously DSO, most particularly. So far, the answer is no. And the way \u2013 again, we feel strong about our balance sheet, we feel strong about our free cash flow and we feel strong about our working capital. And we want to use, in selected cases, the strength of our balance sheet to increase the competitive position of the company. So from a credit standpoint so far no particular issues, and we want to help our partners to navigate through this difficult time using our balance sheet.\nOlivier Leonetti: And one more thing maybe just to add some color on this. One thing that, I think, benefits us here is that our partners, their business is to resell our products. So if they are cut off from supply  of our products, if they can\u2019t get access to our products, their business goes away. So there is a strong incentive from our partners to pay us to make sure that they can stay current and continue to do business.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrian Drab: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering first if there\u2019s any way that you could help us make, trying to quantify the backlog that you\u2019re entering the second quarter with and maybe compare that to a typical quarter. Do you typically enter a quarter with, say, two or three weeks of backlog? And you have doubled that. Can you talk in some terms like that to give us a stance?\nOlivier Leonetti: So the size of the backlog entering the quarter was not out of the ordinary. And this size was slightly higher due to some of the dispatch center issues we mentioned. So we had to shut down for about a day at the end of the quarter, one of our dispatch center and that was about $20 million below. So that would be part also of the opening backlog. Nothing out of the ordinary.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, you can think of it as, the business continued to do well through the first quarter. So order flow was normal. And the one additional thing was that the $20 million that we couldn\u2019t ship out of the North America or the Americas distribution center that flipped into Q2.\nBrian Drab: Okay, that seems smaller than I would have thought. So that\u2019s on, I mean like 2% of revenue so that\u2019s enough for you to call that out. There is no other source of additional backlog entering 2Q?\nAnders Gustafsson: Nothing of significance out of the ordinary.\nBrian Drab: Okay. And then I was just curious, it was \u2013 why did that facility, if you can talk about this, why did that distribution center have to shut down? Was that a state-driven decision or was there an illness there? And do you think that this is potentially a risk in the going forward with other distribution centers and facilities? Thanks.\nAnders Gustafsson: So this was an outsourced facility, and there was a case of COVID-19. So they shut down for 36 hours and came back and ran a little slower. But even before then, we had started to take some pretty dramatic, drastic actions in making sure that we had team A, B, C, and so forth that we had put out more spacing between people taking a lot of actions to make sure that if anybody worked to get infected, it would impact as only a small team and not the entire facility. So if something like that were to happen again, I would expect it to have much less impact than it had in the first quarter. Another one, which is of size also, the quarter was very backend loaded for obvious reasons, right. The supply chain started slowly at the start and ended up strong. So we had to ship a lot in the last few days of the quarter, and a day of shipment was worth much more than ever before. But we are confident that today largely the risk from a distribution center standpoint is going to be mitigated going forward. We have very good plans to mitigate those risks now.\nOperator: And our final question today comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.\nJeff Kessler: Thank you. You have mentioned briefly the three acquisitions that you\u2019ve made that were not part of the original discussion. Could you just update us on whether or not investment in them is going forward? And if so, what role have they played or could they play later on in the year and into 2021?\nOlivier Leonetti: So I assume you talked about Temptime, Profitect and Cortexica. \nJeff Kessler: Yes.\nOlivier Leonetti: Yes. So I\u2019d say all three are performing well. Temptime was the first one we made in the beginning of the 2019. They designed and manufactured visual time-temperature monitoring solutions. It goes on \u2013 a lot of them goes on vials of vaccines in the developing world. Obviously, great \u2013 it\u2019s very topical today, although we don\u2019t have a vaccine yet for COVID-19.\nJeff Kessler: Kind of why I\u2019m asking the question.\nOlivier Leonetti: Yes. So we are obviously in contact with WHO and others to make sure that when that happens that we can offer our solutions to ensure that the transportation of that vaccine can be temperature controlled and quality controlled. Profitect was the second acquisition we did in June of last year. They do the prescriptive analytics taking lots of different data inputs from a variety of sources, primarily in retail, and using machine learning, AI to detect anomalies. And I\u2019d say that\u2019s even more critical today as retailers are trying to figure out what they have on the stores, what errors they have and how to quickly be able to assess and rectify that with \u2013 and being less dependent on having a physical presence in the store to be able to do this. And lastly, Cortexica, which was the computer vision company we acquired at the end of last year, this is a smaller business, mostly focused \u2013 our intent with that is to really leverage the competency of that team less so the kind of the product or the revenue stream. So they are very \u2013 been very active in engaging with building out our computer vision capabilities around our EMA robot, particularly, but also solutions. And they\u2019ve been a great addition to our team, they have great skill sets.\nJeff Kessler: Okay. Thank you. My follow-up is will be quick. It has to do with your partner program. You mentioned that some of your partners are essentially, if you don\u2019t provide them product they have nothing to sell. The question is about have you made any tweaks in that program during this period of time as you\u2019ve seen ebbs and flows in \u2013 ebbs and flows in your supply chain and going into through the channel that increases for some folks and have been decreasing for others?  And what have you been doing with your partner program too, if you want to call it, to make it more efficient for both them and you?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, I think this is an excellent question for Joe Heel.\nJoe Heel: So in our partner program, we\u2019ve had a lot of requests from partners that we help them both technically with training, but also financially and with the program terms, in particular, like many of the programs, we have some elements in the program that are \u2013 or you can think of it like a frequent flyer program, where you have to reach certain levels. And we have already announced that we are adjusting those program terms, we\u2019re essentially extending it for an additional year. We are also adjusting some of the thresholds that partners need to reach in order to earn their rebates. These are the typical things that you would do in response to a changing business environment when the partners can earn their targets. And I think so far it\u2019s been quite well received because it means that the partners will be able to operate their businesses at the different levels and still achieve their targets.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gustafsson for any final remarks.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you. Yes. I would like to thank our employees, customers and partners who are working the frontline. We remain committed to supporting you through this challenging time. Be safe, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. And have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Anders Gustafsson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I would like to say that our top priority at this time is to health and wellbeing of our employees, customers and partners. We are grateful to all of the frontline workers, especially those sacrificing their personal safety, so that all of us can continue to live and work safely through this challenging time. Those on our customers' front lines are heroes serving in hospitals, grocery stores, delivery vehicles, warehouses and other parts of the central supply chains that help keep our lives as normal as possible. Many Zebra employees are also on the frontline supporting the build and repair of products and solutions that are essential to our customers, doing their jobs safely and efficiently. To all of those heroes, we say thank you. The financial results we published this morning reflect a challenging first quarter environment. We realized a net sales decline of 1%. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.1%, which contracted by 200 basis points and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.67, a 9% decrease from the prior year. We had a strong start to the year and January and February generally played out to our expectations; however, late in the quarter as COVID-19 evolved into a global pandemic. We experienced significant supply chain disruption including product manufacturing delays, restrictions on transportation of goods, and a temporary closure in late March of a key distribution center supplying the Americas. We took extraordinary steps to produce and supply our mission critical products to customers around the world. Our team was agile, pivoting our resources quickly to closely monitor the situation and take bold action. For example, we chartered plans to expedite product delivery from China to North America and Europe to meet customer commitments. Despite best efforts, we were unable to completely fulfill our order book in the quarter, resulting in a high backlog as we entered Q2. Production in China is now returning to normal and we have stabilized our global supply chain through mitigating actions. In addition to the supply chain challenges, we saw softer demand through the channel globally and China sales were very weak with COVID-19 exasperating trends that had already been soft due to trade tensions. However, in any environment, enterprises worldwide utilized our solutions to address the evolving needs of their customers. In this changing environment, our solutions have become even more necessary for our customers. I would like to highlight a few notable Q1 wins supporting critical used cases in omni-channel, e-commerce and healthcare. One of the world's largest mass merchants purchased 40,000 of our ZQ6 series mobile printers to address a number of front of store use cases, including online store pickup, pharmacy fulfillment, and shelf tagging. Additionally, we deployed several thousand TC5 series mobile computers to a large e-commerce player in Asia. This follows our competitive takeaway win last year of their printing and scanning business. With COVID-19, this e-tailers demand is growing exponentially. They have been hiring staff and we are working with them on additional solutions. In healthcare, we supported the NHS Nightingale temporary hospital in the UK. We provided an installed solutions supporting the identification and flow of COVID-19 patients. Nurses at NHS have also been using our TC5 series healthcare mobile computers to arrange virtual visits between patients and their loved ones. As expected, transitory effects of tariffs and expedited shipping expenses weighed heavily on Q1 gross margin and EPS. We have taken decisive actions to mitigate this impact which drove operating expense leverage, despite lower sales volume. We continue to remain agile and take appropriate action as results are pressured due to these challenging macroenvironment. With that, I will now turn the call over to Olivier to review our Q1 financial results and discuss our outlook. Thank you, Olivier. Slide 12 highlights how we are enhancing the value proposition for our customers. Our solutions are even more critical today than ever as we give the frontline and edge by empowering them with technology to do their job most effectively. Industry-leading companies trust Zebra to equip their workers and facilities with the solutions that bring their mission-critical operations to the next level. We are uniquely positioned to address this challenge because we have a deep understanding of workflows and unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast installed base. We can address big global problems such as ensuring food safety across the supply chain or a broad range of more localized issues like increasing bed turns in the hospital, modernizing distribution centers to satisfy e-commerce demands or ensuring that retail associates and store inventory are optimized to maintain product availability. We have been bringing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision to life for our customers. We are doing this by enabling them to identify their assets through barcode, RFID and computer vision. Locate their assets with our vertical-specific solutions and understand their condition, such as temperature, trailer capacity and device security, so that their frontline workers can take the best next action in real-time. Methods for sensing, analyzing and acting on operational data from the frontline of business have undergone massive transformation in past years as the on-demand economy has taken hold. Inefficient manual processes have evolved into workflows that are augmented and enriched by purpose-built technologies, including hardware, software and intelligent edge solutions that bring it all together. Businesses are now demanding information about what is happening at the edge of their operations so that they can run their entire operation smoother, safer and smarter. They generate large volumes of data and are uncertain how to take all those disparate points of information and effectively put it to work in near real-time. We have been investing in software solutions and services that help our customers leverage real-time data to better orchestrate their workflows and gain a performance advantage. Investments in advancing our capabilities in this area remain a top priority. On Slide 13, we highlight the primary vertical markets that we serve. Exciting longer-term growth remain and new ones are evolving as customers in these markets are pressured to improve their technological capabilities in an increasingly on demand economy. That said, we are seeing mixed trends in this challenging environment, depending on the subsector. Many of our customers are deemed essential businesses, while various others may be temporarily closed for business. In health care, the pandemic dramatically increases the need for additional acute care capacity, which is the primary area that we serve. Our suite of purpose-built health care solutions are enabling pop-up hospitals, drive-through testing facilities and labs to scale quickly and provide safe and efficient care. Other parts of health care have seen a slowdown as government mandates in many locations have paused noncritical care and elective procedures until further notice. Approximately 2/3 of our business in retail is the mass merchants, grocers and e-tailers who are serving essential customer needs. Many retailers rely on our technology to execute their omnichannel fulfillment effectively. E-commerce and Buy Online Pick Up In Store transactions have increased as more consumers navigate purchasing from their homes. However, social distancing and stay-at-home orders are further impacting department stores and certain apparel retailers who are heavily reliant on in-store purchases. In the transportation and logistics space, increased online purchasing from households is driving incremental parcel volume and delivery, which drives increased demand for our solutions. Conversely, government-mandated restrictions are severely pressuring passenger airlines, rental car providers and certain segments of the distribution industry. The manufacturing sector has been challenged with global trade tensions and is facing additional challenges today as stay-at-home orders have deemed many discrete manufacturers, such as auto, aviation and specialty goods, nonessential. That said, some of these customers have been created with their idle operations by producing medical equipment like ventilators, utilizing our solutions. Many segments within process manufacturing, such as food and pharmaceutical companies, remain essential and are less impacted. In closing, we are confident that our business fundamentals and strategy are sound and that this crisis will not last. By focusing on serving our customers' needs and continued investment in innovation, we expect to extend our market leadership position as the market rebounds. Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike. Andrew, good morning. We have today a lower visibility of the business due to the impact of COVID-19. And we are basically pegged as a business to the economy. And a lot of what we see in Q2 is a question mark on the length of the stay at home and also the impact of the various stimulus packages, either current or to come. And if you study the company over the recent past, we have an history of rebounding quickly when the economy restarts. Now when it comes to Q2, specifically, what we see today is obviously the impact only due to COVID, we believe we are in a strong competitive position. We believe that, for example, in Q1, we have gained shares. We had a strong backlog entering the quarter. And we see today from a top line standpoint mainly an impact being more pronounced on run rate, which is part of the business going through distribution. And we have seen our distributors, partners adjusting the level inventory. So this is what we see today going on. But we believe we have a strong value proposition, which works well in good and bad times, and we're going to be ready to manage this downturn, Andrew. So if you look at \u2013 of course, so if you look at EBITDA, at the midpoint, the EBITDA margin will decline year-on-year by about 270 basis points, so 270 basis points. 1.5%, so 150 basis points is due to one-off items, either associated with tariffs or associated with the management of the pandemic, mainly impacting our freight expense. And then the balance is a point of margin being lost due to run rate mix. So if you look at today, if we disaggregate the revenue between bid and run rate, run rate margin is much higher than bids, and we have seen the run rate of revenue declining. However, the margin profile for run rate and bid have been increasing sequentially now for a few quarters. So what you see at play in the profitability is a margin impact and largely \u2013 large proportion of the margin impact being due to tariff and C19. From an OpEx standpoint, we believe we're going to be able to retain the OpEx as a proportion of revenue constant or relative to last year. Yes. Good morning, Paul. I will take both of these ones. First, on USPS. USPS contract continues as per our expectations. As we've talked about before, this is a multiyear contract. We certainly feel very proud of it, biggest in our history. I think highlights the strength of our value proposition and the strength of our relationships. Our teams \u2013 our respective teams, the Zebra team and the USPS team, they continue to work very closely together. Both sides are very engaged. So there's no expectations or signs from our side that this will be pushed out in any way.  As we said in our last quarter call, we do expect to begin ramping up in Q2, or ramping deliveries in Q2. And we do assume or expect that the majority of all the orders will be deployed by the end of 2021 as the backend is kind of gated by \u2013 when the U.S. carriers stop 3G service. And at that point, USPS will need to have moved off to new devices. We have received new orders beyond the current orders, so some new use cases, but within same framework for an additional 30,000 units. So, the business with USPS for us continues to be good. And we certainly look forward to starting to deploy in earnest. And then the other one on destocking the channel, at the moment I would say on a global basis, our distribution partners who are the ones who hold inventory are holding a normal days on hand inventory. We don't see it being high or low, particularly, it's going to be within the band considered to be normal. What we tend to see early in the downturn is that when sales out goes down, from a disti perspective, they adjust their days on hand, which means they don't have to buy as much in the short term. And then that tends to be more of a one quarter type of activity. So here we are assuming that there will be a reduction in the run rate for our distis and partners, which will cause some level of lesser inventory or maintain \u2013 you have maintain the same level of days on hand inventory. Thank you. I think the \u2013 obviously, there's a very different drivers for this crisis versus the 2009 crisis. So I'd say our customers today are probably not as \u2013 well, back up and say, it very much now depends on which kind of vertical or sub segment of the business you are in. I think in 2009 every customer has concerns about liquidity, and so forth. Here we have a bit of a have and have not. So if you're a mass merchant, a grocer, e-tailer, or in healthcare, some of the delivery businesses, you are doing very well. They are super, super busy. And if you are more of a brick-and-mortar retailer selling apparel, you might be having shut down all your stores. I think from a customer behavior perspective, I'd say when the orders around work-from-home started to be enacted it probably took two, three weeks for our customers to kind of scramble and get themselves organized to adapt to the new kind of working environments. They were very focused on just making sure their operations were \u2013 continue to run. But in the last \u2013 the last month I'd say they started to come back and start engaging with us on both current and more future oriented projects. And we are trying to be \u2013 make sure we make good use of video conferencing to continue to engage and have the sessions with our customers. And I don't perceive that our customers overall or maybe as concerned with how long, or how are they going to come out of this recession. Maybe it feels like they have a bit more confidence. We didn't talk about it from the entire business, but if you look at retail specifically, which is our largest vertical, two thirds of our business there goes to mass merchants, grocers and e-tailers. And those are all deemed essential. Yes, we've seen some interesting trends there that as people are adjusted to buying from home, not necessarily visiting the store as much. So Buy Online Pick Up In Store has become much more popular. Grocery volumes have gone up materially, but Buy Online Pick Up In Store has gone up exponentially. And I think that's a consumer behavior that is unlikely to work back to what it was. I think consumers have now learned a new way of shopping that they like. Then if you move, look to healthcare there we have, I would say, the majority of our business is tied to essential activities, acute care, specifically. And we have been part of pop-up hospitals, drive-through test facilities and just scaling existing the care facilities to be able to take care of the number of Covid-19 patients that come in. But obviously there's parts of healthcare that has been deemed non-essential, but that's a smaller part of our business that do elective care and so forth. Within transportation logistics, that's a \u2013 I can't really have \u2013 I don't have a good percentage number, but a good part of that business is obviously also a part of the essential economy, making sure that the essential supply chains work all the way from pharmaceuticals, to food, to e-commerce. I'd say here for us the last mile of delivery so many more deliveries to households today and the last mile delivery drivers tend to have our type of devices. And so that's been helpful. But on the other hand, we see other transportation logistics businesses like aviation, auto, rental car companies and so forth that are under a lot of pressure. And lastly, manufacturing, there, I'd say a lot of the discrete manufacturers, such as auto, aviation and specialty goods, nonessential. They make up less than 5% of our total revenues. While most, I would say, process manufacturing companies like food and pharma are deemed essential for us. Yes, I think, to that point we see that our solutions have become more necessary for our customers as we really do empower the frontline workers across all the end markets. So, these are the people who cannot perform their duties from home. They have to be in hospital, a grocery store or a delivery truck. So I think the crisis is helping to accelerate trends around digitization, automation across the industries. So today we've only seen a limited number of push outs. We have not seen any cancellations or any scaling down of orders, as you put it. I think \u2013 and the customers that have pushed out tends to be the ones that are not operating today at all. I think I'll start with this and then Olivier can help fill out some details. So if you go back until our Q4 call, we highlighted that COVID-19 would have an impact on our supply chain, but it was on the supply side of things. Since then the China has largely returned to normal. It took a little longer than expected, I would say. And there was dependent partly on where our contract manufacturing partners were located. So they had to return workers through a two-week quarantine periods, and so forth. But by the end of the quarter, our Chinese contract manufacturing partners were all working at over 90% capacity. So I think they became back a little bit slower, but it came back. We also then in the quarter tried to ramp up both our Vietnam and Malaysia facilities. And timing was a little more challenged as we were supposed to do that the Monday after the lunar New Year. And obviously no Chinese people were allowed to travel there to help set it up and to teach people. But we were, I think, quite agile and creative. So we set up video facilities so that we have people in China sitting and watching via video, what people in Vietnam and Malaysia were doing, to teach them as well as we could. And Vietnam facility has come up very nicely. It manufactured the same number of printers that we had expected, while the Malaysia facility started off a little slow, but then it got shutdown based on the Marshall Law that Malaysia implemented. But we're using the same techniques to get that facility up and running. The impact on Q1, I think, was very modest from that perspective. We've diverted and try to make get as much out of China as we could. It had similar impact on tariffs as we now have to manufacture everything in China, or the vast majority of our products in China instead. And going forward, we expect that supply chain issues are going to be largely behind us. And what you see reflected in our guide for Q2 is many, some demand precious. Yes, you can think of it as, the business continued to do well through the first quarter. So order flow was normal. And the one additional thing was that the $20 million that we couldn't ship out of the North America or the Americas distribution center that flipped into Q2. Nothing of significance out of the ordinary. So this was an outsourced facility, and there was a case of COVID-19. So they shut down for 36 hours and came back and ran a little slower. But even before then, we had started to take some pretty dramatic, drastic actions in making sure that we had team A, B, C, and so forth that we had put out more spacing between people taking a lot of actions to make sure that if anybody worked to get infected, it would impact as only a small team and not the entire facility. So if something like that were to happen again, I would expect it to have much less impact than it had in the first quarter. Another one, which is of size also, the quarter was very backend loaded for obvious reasons, right. The supply chain started slowly at the start and ended up strong. So we had to ship a lot in the last few days of the quarter, and a day of shipment was worth much more than ever before. But we are confident that today largely the risk from a distribution center standpoint is going to be mitigated going forward. We have very good plans to mitigate those risks now. Yes, I think this is an excellent question for Joe Heel. Thank you. Yes. I would like to thank our employees, customers and partners who are working the frontline. We remain committed to supporting you through this challenging time. Be safe, everyone."

            "name": "Olivier Leonetti",
            "content": "Thank you, Anders. Let us walk through the P&L on Slide 6. Net sales declined 1.3% in the first quarter, less than 1% on an organic basis before the impacts of currencies and acquisition. The COVID-19 pandemic caused supply and demand impacts to our consolidated sales growth of approximately seven percentage points. Despite our sales decline, we believe that we generally are performed in the market globally. Our Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales was most impacted by the COVID-19 disruption and sales decreased 2.9%. The largest supply chain impact was the temporary closure in North American distribution center that Anders referenced, which delayed shipments of mobile computers into the channel. Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment sales increased 3.2% with relative strength in printing and Zebra retail solutions. We saw a solid growth in managed and professional services across both segments of the business, primarily driven by solid attach rates on increased product sales over the last 12 months.  Our Locations solutions business was lower due to a pause in project spending. Turning to our regions, in North America, sales were flat, declining mobile computing due to COVID-19 supply chain challenges was offset by growth in all other major categories. EMEA sales increased 7%, with relative strength in mobile computing, printing and services. We saw particular strength in Central Europe. Sales in our Asia Pacific region declined 21%, driven by COVID-19 impacts on top of continued softness in China due to trade tensions. China was down 35%, driving most of the original sales decline. Latin America sales declined 11% led by lower mobile computing sales, largely impacted by supply chain disruption. Adjusted gross margin contracted 200 basis point to 45.2%, driven primarily by List 4 tariffs and expedited freight as well as unfavorable large order mix. Adjusted operating expenses declined $5 million from the prior year period and improved 10 basis points as a percentage of sales. This improvement was primarily due to prudent cost management and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by the inclusion of expenses from recently acquired businesses. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.1%, a 200 basis point decrease from the prior period driven entirely by lower gross margin. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.67, a 9% year-over-year decrease inclusive of $0.17 negative impact from the transitory effects of tariffs and expedited freight expense. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $95 million of free cash flow in Q1. This was higher than the prior period, primarily due to lower use of working capital. We repurchased $200 million of shares in Q1, leaving $753 million of remaining capacity under the authorization. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter at the modest 1.5 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio. Turning to Slide 8. We are well equipped to navigate the unprecedented global environment that we are facing. As I just mentioned, our balance sheet is in excellent shape with low debt levels and $740 million of capacity under our revolver. We deliver mission-critical solutions, increasingly diverse end-markets. Our capital-light business model has a highly variable cost structure due to all outsourcing of product manufacturing and driving the vast majority of our sales volume to third party distribution. We also have a strong free cash flow profile with a flexible cost structure and capital expenditures typically less than 1.5% of sales. We also have a track record of preserving profitability and cash flow in challenging times. We use a playbook to take appropriate actions in various scenarios, preserving capacity for investments in the business that improve our competitive position. Let us turn to our outlook. Given the low visibility due to COVID-19, we are withdrawing our outlook for full year net sales, adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. We now expect these three metrics to be lower than last year, which would we address to cost actions we announced our profitability and cash flow. Q2 and Q3 expected to be particularly challenging quarters based on macroeconomic forecast, independent market research and feedback from our partners and customers. In this freed environment, we have done extensive scenario planning and identified many operational and financial levers that we can pull. It is imperative that we stick to our principles of acting swiftly to preserve profitability while doing no harm to the business to reinforcement of our culture. This enabled us to prioritize strategic investments, so that we are much stronger than the competition as the market rebounds. As Anders mentioned, we entered the second quarter with a strong backlog driven by temporary supply chain disruptions from the pandemic. As the virus has spread, end market weakness is affecting all of our major geographies across the globe. The impact is more pronounced in our run rate business through the channel as third party distributors are calibrating inventory levels. Given these pressures and elevated uncertainty, we expect net sales to decline in Q2 between 11% and 17%. These outlook assumes an approximately 50 basis point positive impact from recent acquisitions and an approximately one percentage point negative impact from foreign currency changes. We believe Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin would be between 18% and 19%, which assumes lower operating expenses and the lower gross margin reflecting a $5 million impact from List 4 tariffs and approximately $9 million of cost to mitigate supply chain disruption from COVID-19. Collectively, these transitory items, I expect it to impact margin by approximately 150 basis points and EPS by $0.22. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.50. Please reference other 2020 modeling assumptions on Slide 9. On Slide 10, we provide an update on the anticipated impacts to Zebra from the Section 301 tariffs on products imported to the U.S. We are generally on track to diversify our global sourcing footprint by mid-2020, despite some modest delays due to COVID-19, particularly in our Malaysian facility. In Vietnam, we have been ramping our expectations. This initiative is expected to mitigate our geographic concentration risk. It also adds the immediate benefit of substantially mitigating List 4 tariffs that became effective last September, impacting our mobile computers and printers. We continue to work with our contract manufacturing partners to replicate production lines in order to move most of our U.S. volumes to broader Asia. These actions are currently expected to result in approximately $20 million of onetime pretax charges in the first half of 2020, plus approximately $10 million of capital expenditures. In the first quarter, tariffs negatively impacted gross profit by $7 million. We expect this impact to decline to $5 million in Q2 as we launch alternate sources of supply outside of China. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision and market trends. Yes. So we're going to stop short of trying to give real color or guidance on the full year here. But I would say for us we do \u2013 our expectations is that this is a not a long-term change in how we operate and the world operates, but more of a several quarter activity. So we certainly expect it to impact Q2 and Q3. And then depending on how quickly the world rebounds we will follow. I'd say for us one of the benefits we have is that we have a very robust business, a very diversified business across product lines, vertical markets and geographies. And our value propositions tend to work in good times and bad times, right. Good times, our customers are expanding, they are investing in the business and they use our equipment to help them do that. In tougher times, they tend to trade OpEx for CapEx. So they try to use us to get more efficiencies. Say, right now at the eye of the hurricane here, we are seeing, obviously, the \u2013 many of the essential businesses are being very busy this year than they had been before. I think how they are behaving today is that they are generally very focused on just making sure they can scale up their operations and, scale up the use of technology, but not necessarily having the bandwidth to think very creatively about how to leverage new solutions. I think that will come when the world settles down a little bit more. Customers that are not operating today, say, people who have had to shut down their operations, we are talking to them, still to make sure that we stay engaged and figure out how can we help them drive more of the digitization and automation of their businesses as they come back. So we feel that we are \u2013 we want to engage with all the customers that we have. But the \u2013 obviously, the ones that are essential are much more active in both running their businesses and in looking to figure out how to scale them. So we feel strong about the cash flow generation of the company as we said, as I said, we believe we can protect the majority of the free cash flow of the company, even during this downturn. Now the priority for cash allocation is going to be to invest in the business either organically or inorganically. We bought $200 million worth of shares, so it's about 2% of our shares outstanding. So at this stage, we are going to be mainly investing in the business and buyback would not be a priority. Now it's not going to be totally off the table, but not a priority. And one more thing maybe just to add some color on this. One thing that, I think, benefits us here is that our partners, their business is to resell our products. So if they are cut off from supply  of our products, if they can't get access to our products, their business goes away. So there is a strong incentive from our partners to pay us to make sure that they can stay current and continue to do business. So the size of the backlog entering the quarter was not out of the ordinary. And this size was slightly higher due to some of the dispatch center issues we mentioned. So we had to shut down for about a day at the end of the quarter, one of our dispatch center and that was about $20 million below. So that would be part also of the opening backlog. Nothing out of the ordinary. So I assume you talked about Temptime, Profitect and Cortexica. Yes. So I'd say all three are performing well. Temptime was the first one we made in the beginning of the 2019. They designed and manufactured visual time-temperature monitoring solutions. It goes on \u2013 a lot of them goes on vials of vaccines in the developing world. Obviously, great \u2013 it's very topical today, although we don't have a vaccine yet for COVID-19. Yes. So we are obviously in contact with WHO and others to make sure that when that happens that we can offer our solutions to ensure that the transportation of that vaccine can be temperature controlled and quality controlled. Profitect was the second acquisition we did in June of last year. They do the prescriptive analytics taking lots of different data inputs from a variety of sources, primarily in retail, and using machine learning, AI to detect anomalies. And I'd say that's even more critical today as retailers are trying to figure out what they have on the stores, what errors they have and how to quickly be able to assess and rectify that with \u2013 and being less dependent on having a physical presence in the store to be able to do this. And lastly, Cortexica, which was the computer vision company we acquired at the end of last year, this is a smaller business, mostly focused \u2013 our intent with that is to really leverage the competency of that team less so the kind of the product or the revenue stream. So they are very \u2013 been very active in engaging with building out our computer vision capabilities around our EMA robot, particularly, but also solutions. And they've been a great addition to our team, they have great skill sets."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Mike Steele, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nMike Steele: Good morning and welcome to Zebra's fourth quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Anders Gustafsson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Anders will begin with our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. Then Nathan will provide additional detail on financials and discuss our 2022 outlook. Anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision along with an updated view of our served market opportunity and revised long-term sales outlook. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer, will join us as we take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Anders.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Our team delivered solid fourth quarter results in an exceptionally challenging supply chain environment. For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of 12% or 10% on an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA of $319 million, a 4% year-over-year increase and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.7%, a 180 basis point decrease. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.54, a 2% increase from the prior year and strong free cash flow. Customer demand is stronger than ever for our solutions that digitize and automate workflows. We realized sales growth across all four regions, supported by exceptional strength in mobile computing, with particularly strong growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Supply chain constraints limited us from fully satisfying our customer demand, particularly for certain data capture and printing offerings. Our teams have been aggressively working to mitigate the impact of the unprecedented industry-wide supply chain challenges by securing new sources of supply, utilizing alternative modalities of transportation and expediting customer shipments. Premium freight costs exceeded our expectations and significantly weighed on gross margin, which was partially offset by higher service and software margin. We also scaled operating expenses while continuing to invest in initiatives to drive sustainable, profitable growth. Our solid fourth quarter performance closed an outstanding full year 2021 in which we generated record sales, EBITDA margin, earnings per share and free cash flow. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q4 financial results in more detail and discuss our 2022 outlook.\nNathan Winters: Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q4, adjusted net sales increased 11.7%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and 10% on an organic basis reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 3.1% despite significant supply constraints on our printer products and cycling very strong prior year results. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 13.2%, driven by exceptional growth in mobile computing. We continue to drive solid growth across services and software with strong service attach rates and expansion of our software offerings. We recognized solid growth in all four regions. North America sales increased 4% with strength in mobile computing, supplies and services. EMEA sales increased 9%, driven by strong growth in mobile computing. Asia Pacific sales grew 29% with strength across all major geographies, including China. And in Latin America, sales increased 42%, continuing strong double-digit growth in all major offerings. Adjusted gross margin declined 210 basis points to 45.7% due to unprecedented premium freight costs partially offset by higher service and software margins. We will discuss transitory costs, including premium freight further in a moment. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 40 basis points as we scaled our cost structure while continuing to prioritize high-return investment opportunities in the business. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.7%, a 180 basis point decrease from the prior year period, entirely attributable to lower gross margin from transitory impacts, partially offset by operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.54 and $0.08 or 1.8% year-over-year increase, which also reflects lower interest expense and a slightly higher tax rate. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. In 2021, we generated more than $1 billion of free cash flow for the first time in our history. This was $115 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the year at a modest 0.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which provides us ample flexibility. In 2021, we invested $452 million to acquire Antuit, Fetch Robotics and Adaptive Vision to advance our solutions offerings in retail, manufacturing and the warehouse. In addition, we made $34 million of venture investments in five portfolio companies, $59 million of capital expenditures, $257 million of net debt repayments and $57 million of share repurchases. On Slide 8, we show the multi-year impact of transitory costs primarily related to expedited freight due to supply chain bottlenecks caused by the pandemic as well as tariffs on China imports. Our team is making heroic efforts to satisfy customer demand. This includes dedicating substantial engineering resources to product redesigns, negotiating long-term supply agreements with new and existing suppliers, shifting virtually all transport to air promotion and expediting component parts and finished goods to meet customer commitments. Global freight rates have reached record high cost per kilo for all modalities of delivery across our supply chain. In Q4 compared to pre-pandemic rates, we incurred incremental premium freight costs of $67 million, which is higher than we had anticipated in our prior outlook, and $58 million higher than the prior year. Partially offsetting this impact were $4 million of refunds of China import tariffs, which was $8 million less than we received in the fourth quarter of 2020. In total, these transitory items had a combined unfavorable gross margin impact of $66 million year-over-year. I will discuss our assumptions regarding the 2022 impact of transitory costs in a moment. Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered the year with a strong order backlog and healthy sales pipeline supported by broad-based demand for our solutions. Our expected sales growth of 1% to 3% for the first quarter has been capped by what we can deliver to our customers due to extended lead times and limited availability of component parts. Our outlook assumes an approximately 1 percentage point additive impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. We anticipate Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, which assumes gross margin contraction from the prior year due to unfavorable sales mix and expected premium freight costs of $60 million, which translates to 340 basis point unfavorable impact to the prior year period. We also expect increased operating expenses as a percent of sales primarily due to our entry into multiple expansion markets since last spring and resuming in-person events. We believe total supply chain impacts, including transitory costs and product availability, are peaking in Q1 with recent improvements in freight capacity and better visibility and supplier commitments to component supply into the second quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $4. For the full year 2022, we expect adjusted net sales to grow between 3% and 7% with the assumption that supply chain constraints steadily abate throughout the year. This outlook assumes a net neutral impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. We anticipate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin between 23% and 24%, which assumes total transitory cost impacts, including premium freight expenses of approximately $140 million to $160 million. This is slightly higher than the impact we realized in 2021. We expect our free cash flow to be at least $900 million for the year. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we are advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision and to provide an update on our served market opportunity and long-term growth expectations.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Nathan. I am encouraged by the strong demand across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to navigate the supply chain challenges. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the frontline of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions that generate an attractive return on investment, Zebra's customers can effectively address their operational challenges, which have become increasingly complex through the pandemic. Our innovative solutions empower the workforce to do their jobs more efficiently by navigating constant change in near real-time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as prescriptive analytics, intelligent automation and machine vision. We are raising our long-term organic sales growth expectations to 5% to 7% from our former expectation of 4% to 5%. On Slide 12, we provide a refreshed view of our served markets totaling approximately $30 billion, which are supported by mega trends, including the on-demand economy, asset visibility, mobility and cloud computing and automation. These trends have become increasingly important to our enterprise customers and we remain well positioned to meet their needs with our comprehensive solutions. Today, the vast majority of Zebra sales are in our core, which remains vibrant and is now expected to grow 4% to 5%. We have the broadest and deepest offering among the competition and believe that our continued focus and investment will advance our leadership position. Our near adjacencies provide ample opportunity to expand and have a generally higher growth profile than our core. The most promising categories include RFID solutions for use cases that demand the highest level of workforce productivity and inventory accuracy. Smart supplies, including dynamic temperature monitoring as well as the opportunity to equip a broader set of frontline workers with our expanded offering of mobile computers. Beyond our core and near adjacencies are rapid growth expansion opportunities that are transforming workflows across the supply chain. We have entered these areas through organic and inorganic investments over the past 18 months and they represent a low to mid-single-digit percentage of Zebra sales. In mid 2021, we launched several fixed industrial scanning and machine vision smart cameras. We also acquired Fetch Robotics to give us the broadest portfolio of autonomous mobile robots in the industry. We have also been building a compelling software suite that optimizes retail execution and demand planning, which includes Reflexis workforce and task management, Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, Workforce Connect, SmartCount and antuit.ai powered demand forecasting. Collectively, we are serving an approximately $6 billion market in these exciting expansion areas. We are early on our journey and have the opportunity to extend our capabilities deeper into the areas of machine vision, warehouse automation and workflow optimization software over time. Now turning to Slide 13. Businesses partner with Zebra to help optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet the increasing demands of consumers. I would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets. A global apparel retailer is deploying a Zebra solution of 32,000 TC52 mobile computers along with Workforce Connect voice collaboration software and our software solution that transforms mobile computers into workstations on demand. We are enabling this retailer to improve associate productivity and communication in both front of store and distribution center applications, eliminating the need for walkie-talkies and full desktop computer workstations. Our mobile computers will also provide the benefit of stable network connectivity, improved security features and battery management tools. This competitive takeaway win from a major consumer device provider demonstrates our superior value proposition versus the competition. In another recent win, Zebra's Reflexis workforce management solution has enabled a U.S.-based specialty retailer to optimize scheduling for more than 25,000 employees and provide enhanced self-service reporting and analytics to support accountability and performance. We have expanded our relationship with a leading international energy company to empower thousands of convenience store associates in the United Kingdom with Workforce Connect and Reflexis workforce management applications on their Zebra mobile computers and tablets. Our solution enables the store associates to automate their daily responsibilities, maximizing productivity and streamlining task management and administration. We have expanded our relationship with a European auto manufacturer, augmenting thousands of their Zebra mobile computers with RFID readers to enhance quality control in production lines and allow secure employee system access. We continue to collaborate with this customer to pilot promising new solutions to further optimize their operations. In health care, a large hospital system in the Southern United States purchased TC52 mobile computers and our Workforce Connect software application to enable mobile access to the medical record systems as well as facilitate instant communication between nurses and other clinicians. Zebra has selected over competing consumer device providers because of our reputation for comprehensive enterprise solutions. In closing, we are working diligently to navigate through industry-wide supply chain challenges, which limit our ability to fully satisfy strong customer demand in the near-term. That said, the pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving growth in Zebra's vibrant markets, including e-commerce adoption, the need for real-time track and trace across the supply chain and the shift to a more digital healthcare experience. We continue to be very excited about our growth prospects. Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike.\nMike Steele: Thanks, Anders. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we\u2019ll begin today\u2019s question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question this morning comes from Tommy Moll from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.\nTommy Moll: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.\nAnders Gustafsson: Good morning.\nNathan Winters: Good morning.\nTommy Moll: I wanted to start with your revenue outlook. So looking at your first quarter guidance in the full year, it looks like you're expecting a step down sequentially in the first quarter and then revenue builds through the quarters for the rest of 2022. Can you walk us through the assumptions in that cadence across the quarters? And specifically, if you could provide detail on what assumptions you have for the deal business. That would be helpful. Thank you.\nNathan Winters: Thanks, Tommy. So if you look \u2013 we entered the quarter, as we said in our prepared remarks, with a very strong backlog, good bookings momentum here early in the quarter. The guide of 1% to 3% really reflects constrained supply, not demand, driven by very specific and certain component shortages within our Printing and DCS business. Without that, we would expect to be at least as high as our full year guide unconstrained. But with that said, we do see improved visibility into those components later in the quarter and into the early part of the second. So we'd expect a solid rebound in Q2 and then gives us line of sight to our full year guide. And on the full year guide of 3% to 7%, and as we said in the prepared remarks that confident as ever about our business. We do anticipate improved supply chain constraints throughout the year. It's obviously a dynamic environment, but we've secured commitment and we do see improved visibility here over the next few months. And that would also assume increased growth in the last nine months of the year, again, due to the strong backlog demand, along with the recent targeted price increases that go into effect here at the end of the month. Let's say all that while being somewhat cautious in our overall growth assumptions given the supply chain challenges.\nTommy Moll: And Nathan, would you be able to share any embedded assumptions on the deal business? I know sometimes you have more or less visibility there. So I'm just curious what you've embedded in the outlook today?\nNathan Winters: Overall, it does, particularly if you look from an EBITDA rate, we do assume a favorable deal mix. So a slightly higher percentage of run rate versus deal mix compared to 2021. But obviously, that becomes a little bit harder to predict as we get into the second half of the year.\nJoe Heel: I could add some color as well. This is Joe Heel speaking. As you saw in Q4, we had strong large deal flow. And if we look at our backlogs and pipelines, we also have continued strong large deal flow. We have no shortage of demand.\nTommy Moll: Thank you, both. And if I could pivot to a higher level question here. Anders, I appreciate the update you provided on the long-term outlook around revenue. I'm curious for any additional context you could give us on the thought process there and what went into that revised outlook? And then specifically on the double-digit expansion opportunities that you provided, I noticed the ones on your slide are areas where you've already entered either organically or inorganically. Are there any other expansion opportunities that may not be on that slide where we could expect potential for continued M&A and/or organic investment? Thank you.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. First, we've \u2013 so we raised our longer term growth outlook to 5% to 7% over cycle versus the historical number we had of 4% to 5% that we had in place since 2014 when we did the Enterprise acquisition. Over the last seven or eight years, we have overachieved that target and we've been more in line with 7%, and we see our overall markets being very strong. We served by some very strong secular trends that are helping to drive demand and as we help to digitize and automate our customers' operations and their workflows and our competitive position remains very, very strong. And we think we have great opportunities in our core. The core continues to perform very well, but also in our adjacencies and in our expansion markets. So you asked specifically about the expansion markets, we include in there only things that we have identified so far where we have plans \u2013 or more than plans where we have solutions that are in the markets. So could it expand? Sure, absolutely. It can expand. But we looked at sizing the market to the solutions we have today and the type of applications that they address. So we're not going after \u2013 we're not including, say, the entire markets for these funds, but only the markets that we can address today. So as we continue to add functionality that will possibly add to solutions, that total market, served market can expand. We certainly see those as very attractive markets. We have a strong right to play. And we have a differentiated value proposition like in fixed industrial scanning or in robotics. And those markets, we expect to have a materially higher strong double-digit growth rates versus our core, and they will then augment the overall growth rates we have for the company.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia from Berenberg. Please go ahead with your question.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a little bit more on the margin outlook near and long-term. So on the price side, you said you raised prices, do you have capacity to potentially raise again? And then on the cost side, are you \u2013 if need be, that is obviously. And then on the cost side, are you assuming everything is being shipped by freight again for the most part of the year \u2013 sorry, by air, excuse me. Are you assuming freight to ship by air, not land?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So a few \u2013 maybe I'll start with the last question there. If you look from our assumptions, particularly in Q1, we are still assuming that we're almost shipping, particularly in printing, exclusively via air versus ocean. Although, we do expect that to shift as we move throughout the year. So getting back to more normalized levels in the second half. So that's assumed in the full year guide from a margin rate perspective. Now when you look at the price increases, particularly the one we did here this month, that ranged from 0% to 8%. Again, it was not a general increase similar to what we did in September. It was very specific to the product family region based on a competitive position as well as the cost increases we're seeing in those respective product families. And that represents a little less than point of sales growth contribution for the year. And it is something we'll always continue to assess and look at. And if we need to increase prices again based on the competitive positioning and/or the inflationary environment, we'll do so.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. Okay. And on that long-term guidance slide, I was surprised to see that core market, first off, can you update us on what do you think your market share is in that? I believe it's close to 50% last time you gave us that update. And then I'm surprised to see that, that's still 4% to 5% CAGR, just given the world sort of changed in the last couple of years. Yes, just wondering how you're thinking about that.\nAnders Gustafsson: So our market share is very strong. We peg overall market share at about mid-40% for our core, where mobile computer would be a little bit higher. Printing is thereabout so maybe a little higher and a little lower for scanning. But the overall market share, we peg around mid-40%. And the growth rate is based on independent market research for those markets as well as an expectation that with the focus in investments we're doing, we will be able to continue to gain some share, although not quite at the same pace as we have for the last several years.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay, all right. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Company. Please go ahead with your question.\nJim Ricchiuti: Question about RFID. There's been quite a bit of activity in that market fairly high profile use cases that have been publicized recently. And I'm wondering, does this represent an incremental growth opportunity? Or does it perhaps shift some revenues from some of the conventional business, your core business. And I'm wondering if you could, number one, talk about the opportunity? And could you \u2013 and I'm not sure you've ever really sized that portion of the business. Can you elaborate on that perhaps? Thank you.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. So we include RFID in the adjacent markets for us. It's \u2013 we've been in the RFID space for a long time. So it is very much a close adjacency to our core, where we have a strong right to play and our solutions are very much tied together. I would think of it as it's not either or type thing that customers either by RFID or the buyer regular solutions, our RFID solution go on top of our traditional products. So if you want to say, print and encode an RFID label, it is one of our traditional label printers with an RFID encoder attached to it. And similar, if you want to read the labels that is an attachment to sled or something like that on our mobile computers. So it is an incremental part of our core business, but it's not the supplement. Or it's a supplement, but not a substitute for our core. And the market continues to grow very nicely. We've seen apparel retail, probably the main driver so far. We're looking at in-store inventory accuracy as one of the big drivers. But it's been spreading across more different categories within retail but also we see now moving into other industries, so manufacturing being able to track components or subassemblies through a supply chain or in health care to be able to do a number of attractive use cases there also.\nJoe Heel: Maybe I\u2019ll add something, Jim. I would say that there\u2019s definitely an incremental piece to it, but there\u2019s also some substitution. I\u2019ll give you two quick examples. In apparel retail, most of the supply chain has replaced barcoding with RFID now, at least in the more advanced retailers, and that\u2019s probably a substitution. Because they\u2019re using that now throughout their operations as they would have before barcodes. On the other hand, we see a lot of applications, for example, pallets. Pallets have in the past, hardly ever been tracked. But with RFID, we can now track them. And so putting RFID labels on pallets is a great way to ensure much greater efficiency of pallet logistics, which is surprisingly a big problem. So that\u2019s an indication of the incremental nature that we do see.\nJim Ricchiuti: So if we take some comments recently from UPS, where they talk about working on some smart logistics centers where they\u2019re replacing, I think they said something like 20 million potentially using RFID to replace 20 million manual scans simply with traditional barcode. It sounds like you still see a lot of opportunity even if there\u2019s some impact on the core business?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. We see that as a nice addition to the business because, one, they would have to augment, say, either printing or mobile computers with RFID capabilities or they could also, of course, use overhead RFID readers, which will be a new business for us with UPS. So we see that as a very attractive adjacent growth opportunity for Zebra.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, team. This is Eric on for Meta. Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on navigating through another tough quarter and outperforming our expectations. I guess, just maybe to start off on the high-level growth target you put out, do you think every vertical has the potential to be a 5% to 7% growth vertical across your end markets? Or is that more skewed to certain customer bases?\nAnders Gustafsson: We expect the broad-based growth across based on the entire business of verticals, geographies and product lines. Specific to verticals, I\u2019d highlight health care and manufacturing as two high-growth opportunities for us. They have high need for \u2013 to digitize their operations and workflows, and say today, there\u2019s an underpenetration \u2013 relative underpenetration of our type of technologies within those verticals.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe if I could also ask on just some of the investments you\u2019re making and from kind of an operating leverage perspective. You\u2019ve been pretty consistent in delivering operating leverage. But if you were to more aggressively grow into some of your expansion areas that could there be a situation where your top line growth is higher, but earnings growth more mirrors top line growth? Or do you still think even through those investments, you would be able to kind of grow your profitability ahead of revenue?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So as you mentioned, we\u2019ve had a long track record of driving profitable growth. And at a EBITDA level and EBITDA margin, we believe that can go higher, and we have many levers to do that. Maybe if you look at our full year guide here of 23% to 24% in the midpoint, that\u2019s 2 points higher than we were in 2019, while expanding into these new expansion markets. And those expansion markets come with higher gross margin and the team has continued to focus on operational efficiency, by the way, growing at 2 points despite the transitory cost increases. So yes, it\u2019s definitely still an objective for the company and something we can continue to do over the long-term.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, guys. Joe, I\u2019m just trying to unpack the information on the price increases between what you guys in September here and in January and compare that to your annual growth rates. I mean, as you think about that 3% to 7% annual growth, how much of that is coming from, I guess, new unit growth versus just the pricing increase that you guys have been able to roll forward?\nJoe Heel: Yes, Nathan, I think you have a good summary of that. I can add some to it.\nNathan Winters: Yes. So Keith, so I said earlier, the price increases that went into effect here in the end of this quarter is a little less than 1 point of growth contribution for the year, and then the remainder of that would be driven by the strong backlog and the demand for the product. So it\u2019s a relatively meaningful, but a relatively small part of the overall growth for the year. Joe, anything you want to add?\nJoe Heel: Did that answer the question, Keith? Or did I miss something?\nKeith Housum: I\u2019m trying to combine the February increase you guys come through at the end of the month with the one that you passed through in September. If you take both of those combined, what does it do to you with that?\nNathan Winters: Yes. Maybe Keith, it might be a little over a point. The 1 here in February is larger in size. And you just have \u2013 both of those slightly impacted by timing in terms of they went into effect in terms of our full year impact on 2022.\nKeith Housum: Okay. And as a follow, a secondary question, in terms of like the supply chain, we\u2019re hearing different comments in terms of the supply chain because you got the raw materials issue and then you have logistics. It sounds like from your guidance here, you expect both of those to improve quite a bit before the end of the year, if not totally abate. And I appreciate the efforts you\u2019re doing in terms of the design and I guess, getting secondary sources. But is there one or two things you can point to that gives you the confidence that things will be improved before the end of the year for both these items?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. First, as context, I\u2019d say that we provided a record profitable results for the full year of 2021 and record Q4. And we were able to do that in a very challenging supply chain environment. The situation is clearly very volatile and Omicron as an example, has impacted the pace of recovery across all the verticals we serve and globally. But the demand environment is very strong and has ramped very fast over the past year or so. And we continue to put our customers first. So we prioritize making sure we can meet our customer delivery times and customer commitments to the extent we can. Now there are times when we have not been able to meet the traditional lead times the way we would like, but that\u2019s all been supply chain related. But we\u2019re working very hard with our partners and our customers to minimize any impact on our customers\u2019 business or our partners business in this area. And we do believe that the challenges are peaking, and we anticipate both freight and component availability to improve as we go through the year here. Specifically on the component side, I\u2019d say that the impacts on availability and pricing of components that we source there is. So it\u2019s \u2013 some are much more impacted than others. So it\u2019s certainly a very dynamic environment in that way. But we \u2013 as we said, we\u2019ve been working very \u2013 all angles to make sure that we secure as much of supply as we can. We have worked on building more resiliency overall into our supply chain. We have been negotiating long-term supply agreements with both new and existing suppliers. We are working with our suppliers to ensure we get our fair share of allocations. And we\u2019ve dedicated a substantial part of our engineering organization to product redesign to basically design out long lead time parts. As we look into kind of Q2 and the rest of the year though, we do have better visibility and better supply commitments to some of these critical components as we enter Q2. So that\u2019s part of what gives us the confidence for the full year. And so we do expect some gradual improvements as we go through the year.\nNathan Winters: Keith, I would say from a freight perspective, our air and ocean rates towards the end of the fourth quarter were 5x higher than what they were pre-pandemic. And as we\u2019ve said, expediting both component parts, finished goods and shipping almost exclusively all of our printing air versus ocean. But rates are beginning to recover from the peak in December, still significantly higher than even the first half last year and definitely from the beginning of the pre-pandemic. And we\u2019ll need some time to get print back on the ocean. And I think we still believe that these are largely transitory, but the world has changed, and we need to wait and see how the landscape settles to the extent that will go all the way back down to zero, that we\u2019ll have to wait and see how that plays out.\nAnders Gustafsson: And did you \u2013 Keith, did you ask about non-semiconductor shortages also?\nKeith Housum: I didn\u2019t, but you\u2019re welcomed to answer that one as well.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. So there\u2019s some inflationary environment across all the commodities, but we would not have been \u2013 not to the extent that we will make that a talking point in our earnings calls, if it weren\u2019t for the semiconductor side.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thanks. Good luck, guys.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Damian Karas from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nDamian Karas: Good morning, everyone.\nAnders Gustafsson: Good morning.\nDamian Karas: Good morning, Andres. I wanted to ask you guys, if you could maybe give us a sense on where you think you are for the core business in terms of the timing of the replacement cycle? I know that those devices are typically sort of recycled every five, six years or so. But just thinking about the really strong year you had last year, it looks like you\u2019re expecting another positive year of growth in 2022, how should we think about the 5% to 7% growth rate kind of when we get past this year, thinking about the demand you\u2019ve seen and whether you need to see a step down first or whether that 5% to 7% is kind of sustainable from here?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. So first, the 5% to 7% growth rate is meant to be through a cycle. So there will be some \u2013 some years will be stronger, some will be maybe a little weaker. We certainly have been in that case if you look at the past seven years since we had the 4% to 5% rate. But I don\u2019t see any reason why from a demand perspective, there will be any kind of step downs in the early part of the cycle here. We see a very strong demand environment and the refreshes of our product lines that we \u2013 that happens to mobile computing to scanning and printing all our products. We talked mostly about it from a mobile computing perspective, where Android has \u2013 first, I said, driven an acceleration of refresh rates because there\u2019s so much innovation going into the Android platform. So deployments or products that are deployed, say, five years back, have a hard time now to support the most recent Android versions or all the applications that our customers want to put on the devices. So we\u2019ve seen a shorter refresh cycle for Android versus the traditional Microsoft devices that we had earlier. And that\u2019s all baked into our assumptions for this year. But it\u2019s \u2013 we are certainly seeing many of our large deployments that happened in for 2015, 2016 or even 2017 that are now looking to refresh and/or have already refreshed in the process of refreshing. And I don\u2019t know, Joe, if you had any further color for this?\nJoe Heel: Yes. I was going to give you one example, Damian. So in 2015, we closed the largest deal at that time in Zebra\u2019s history in mobile computing, which was a postal service in Europe with the first purchase of TC70 at that time. And they have just refreshed their mobile computers last year. So it was about a six-year cycle for them. And you can see that others have followed suit. And as Andrew said, the replacement cycles have gotten shorter. So going from five to six years, closer to the three to four year period, in many cases.\nDamian Karas: Okay. Great. That\u2019s really helpful. And I appreciate all the detail around your addressable market and the long-term growth rates. I\u2019m just curious on the margin front, what that means for your profile? I think the software side, obviously, higher gross margin relative to your business today. But thinking about those expansion areas, what does it mean for your guys\u2019 margin kind of near-term as those businesses grow and longer-term as well? Thanks.\nNathan Winters: Yes, Damian, and I mentioned this a little bit earlier on the comments \u2013 the question from Eric, but we didn\u2019t have an explicit target on EBITDA margin, although we do believe it can continue to scale and grow over the cycle. And as you pointed out, many levers to do that, including the \u2013 all these expansion markets typically come with higher gross margin and that will come through an EBITDA as we scale those respective businesses as well as churn through some of the transitory costs that are currently within the P&L. And I think ultimately, our goal is to continue to drive double-digit EPS growth through all the levers we have available to us.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brian Drab from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrian Drab: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I'm bouncing between two calls at the moment, and I missed a little bit of the Q&A. So sorry if I repeat something, but the post office project, the larger post \u2013 I know there's a lot of post office projects, with the large one that was, I guess, completed here at the end of 2021. What sort of headwind is that to your overall sales growth rate in 2022? And I know you're replacing that with a lot of business, but I mean, it would be great if you could make any comment on the large project.\nNathan Winters: Yes. So the initial deployment for USPS, we did complete in the \u2013 late in the third quarter, early fourth quarter, but our teams have continued to remain highly engaged with the post office. We have a healthy pipeline of opportunities here for 2022. And our current assumption within our 2022 guide is that we will sell less to USPS. So we are cycling through that. But again, have many other opportunities, as Joe mentioned earlier around other large deals in the pipeline, just like we do any other year to offset that and continue to grow.\nBrian Drab: Okay. So it's not material enough that you would tell me that like without this difficult comparison that you would have forecasted growth of a couple of points higher for 2022 barring this one big project?\nNathan Winters: That's right. Again, every year, we have a large deployments and rollouts. And again, we have new and other opportunities to offset that to reach the \u2013 our full year guide for 2022.\nBrian Drab: Okay. Okay. And then I'm just curious in the core part of your business that you're forecasting long-term growth of 4% to 5% for, how does that break down these days between AIT and EVM?\nAnders Gustafsson: The growth between AIT and EVM is actually quite similar. It's not materially different. EVM would likely have a slightly higher growth rate, but not materially so.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Mason from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.\nRob Mason: Yes, good morning. A lot of grounds have been covered already. But my question, Anders, just to go to some of these expanded areas in your introduction this year, the fixed industrial scanning and machine vision. I'm just curious if you could point to any kind of key progress points on those products? I know only in the marketplace maybe half the year. But key progress points around channel development, customer receptivity and what should be the expectations for that those areas and specifically fixed industrial scanning and also the Fetch business. How should we think about those in 2022?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. No, happy to do that. And I'll ask Joe to also then provide some color after my comments here. But the expansion that we feel today that we can address about $6 billion of opportunity there. The fixed industrial scanning machine vision part is about $2 billion, warehouse autonomous mobile robots is approaching $1 billion and our software solutions are about $3 billion. So that gives you kind of the overall scope of that. We are very excited about all three of these. We have good traction, good customer receptivity on the fixed industrial scanning machine vision side, we have some very attractive wins already, and we continue to add functionality, so we can address more and more of the market. But one particularly attractive win, I think, for us last year or in \u2013 I think it was Q4 was in automotive, where we could read \u2013 there was a bake-off and we showed very well on our ability to read some DPM type of markings, was better than for the competition, and we were selected based on that. But I'd say here also the overall value proposition we have in fixed industrial scanning around the ease of use and the ease of upgrades using software to operate rather than having to change your cameras are very well received. And we are also working hard on \u2013 we have established a new fixed industrial scanning machine vision track in our PartnerConnect program. So we want to make sure we recruit partners to help us scale the business in a very cost-effective way and get better reach that we can do ourselves in that time frame. And we've always been very partner-centric. So we think this is a great way to both provide new opportunities for our existing partners as well as recruit new partners from that industry.\nJoe Heel: I can add a little bit. Maybe just to underline that PartnerConnect. We've made excellent progress in recruiting partners. We set ourselves a goal, both in the U.S. and Europe to recruit the premier partners that deploy these solutions. And that's very important because these are complex solutions set up in these manufacturing and warehouse environments. We've made excellent progress in doing that. And the reason that we've been able to do that is that Andres called ease of use. And that's particularly important for partners because they want to set up new solutions quickly and with few resources. And that's where our solutions are different from the rest of the market is that you can do that much faster with our solutions and that's what's attracting many partners. So we're very pleased with that. On the Fetch business, I think we have the big milestone that I hope you've taken note of is that we've expanded from conveyance robots. So robots that move things from point A to point B in the warehouse to fulfillment robots, which are ones that are used to support pickers in e-commerce fulfillment activities. That's a large and very fast-growing part of the market, as you can easily imagine. And we've had an outstanding win here with one of the big e-commerce players here in the fourth quarter already, which, of course, is going to be a very important reference for us. So we're very pleased with the progress in both machine vision and the autonomous mobile robots.\nRob Mason: Excellent. Go ahead, Anders.\nAnders Gustafsson: Joe, I just want to add on the AMR side. We have a very differentiated value proposition in the warehouse automation space, where our robot competitors, they work very hard on optimizing the movement and the use of the robot. And people who are more on the equipment side would try to optimize the movement of workers. Since we have both, we're trying to optimize the overall workflow and coordinate the movement of robots and frontline workers to drive the most productivity enhancements. And I think that value proposition resonates very well with customers.\nRob Mason: I see. I see. And just as a follow-up, Joe, to go back to the progress you've made recruiting partners, I'm just curious if you have a percentage that are existing Zebra partners that have added and expanded versus, I guess, entirely new partners?\nJoe Heel: We do. So we have a good number of our existing partners have already been active in the machine vision space. I would tell you though that the majority of partners that we expect to have will be new partners that are specialized and highly proficient in this area as their exclusive or dominant focus. But we do have a good number that we're starting with already.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Chung from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nPaul Chung: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So nice record free cash flow for the year. You have some nice flexibility to kind of continue M&A. You got some low net leverage levels. So should we expect kind of a similar pace of acquisitions, maybe more tilted towards on the software side? And then what kind of leverage levels are you comfortable with?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. I'll start and then Nathan can talk about the leverage levels here. But first on M&A, we view M&A as a top priority for us, and we're very excited about the outlook for the business, and we see M&A as a vector for growth. We're not looking to do M&A for the sake of M&A, say, but this is to help accelerate our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. So think of Fetch was a great example of how we could accelerate our reach and expand our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision here into the warehouse automation space. So you can expect that we can be looking at some targeted bolt-on acquisitions as well as high-growth acquisitions that truly advance our vision. And we do see opportunities in digitizing and automating workflows that is kind of the sweet sport for what we're looking for. And yes, as you noted, our balance sheet is strong, so we can support a certain number of acquisitions.\nNathan Winters: No, I think just add, we ended at 0.5x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. And again, comfortable with the overall debt levels. And that gives a lot of opportunity and flexibility to address the M&A market, as Anders has mentioned.\nPaul Chung: And then your views on share buybacks. Is this more kind of offset some comp levels or what's your view there?\nNathan Winters: That's right. Obviously, the first priority is investment in the business, both organically and inorganically. But we still believe share repurchase is a good way to return capital to shareholders. We were active in the fourth quarter, and we've been active to date here in the first quarter with share repurchases.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from Brian Lau from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrian Lau: Hey, good morning, everybody and thanks for squeezing in here. Anders, you gave a lot of good examples of some wins this quarter on both the hardware side and then the software offerings for Reflexis and Workforce Management. Just curious about the go-to-market strategy there, how you're bundling those when you're approaching customers? Are there two or three sets of kind of sales teams? Or is it a more kind of holistic sales approach? Thanks.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. I'll start and here since Joe \u2013 this is Joe's organizational, let Joe provide some color here also. But yes, we have \u2013 we put a lot of thought into how we go to market and how we ramp these new solutions because we have two objectives here. One, we want to leverage the broader relationships that we have with our existing customers, but we also need to have a real focus on these newer solutions. They are smaller today than our more established core solutions. So we want the team that are very dedicated, very focused on them and understand those use cases and those technologies very well. So if you take our software solutions as an example, we have a dedicated software sales team that are kind of owning the software opportunities, but they work very much through our traditional account managers to get introduced to the accounts to get help in navigating those and understanding what the issues are and so forth. So it is a sales overlay strategy for most of these opportunities, but very much leveraging the \u2013 our traditional account managers. And Joe, do you want to add anything to that?\nJoe Heel: Yes. I would add. I mean, if you \u2013 Anders described the objective well, right? We have a very strong presence, right? If you think about the fact that 94 of the Fortune 100 in the U.S. are now Zebra customers. We have account managers on those, and we want to leverage those. And then on the other hand, we have specialists that need to bring specialized expertise, but also a special understanding of the specific personas that are making the purchases, which would be, for example, human resources purchasers or store operations purchasers. These are \u2013 these overlay organizations Anders called them, we also refer to them as specialist sales organizations. These are meaningful organizations, which have both salespeople. They have application engineers or consultants. They have business development in them, and they have channel management in them. So these are becoming large organizations that are dedicated to driving that particular frame in concert with the account managers that are now maintaining the overall relationship for us across the multitude of offerings that we have.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Gustafsson for any closing remarks.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you. So just to wrap up, our primary focus continues to be the health and safety of those on the front line, and I would like to thank our employees and partners for their extraordinary efforts to serve customers and deliver record 2021 results in a challenging supply chain environment. We are optimistic that we are now seeing the peak of these challenges, and we are working hard to minimize these impacts. So thank you, and have a great day, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Heel",
            "content": "I could add some color as well. This is Joe Heel speaking. As you saw in Q4, we had strong large deal flow. And if we look at our backlogs and pipelines, we also have continued strong large deal flow. We have no shortage of demand. Maybe I'll add something, Jim. I would say that there's definitely an incremental piece to it, but there's also some substitution. I'll give you two quick examples. In apparel retail, most of the supply chain has replaced barcoding with RFID now, at least in the more advanced retailers, and that's probably a substitution. Because they're using that now throughout their operations as they would have before barcodes. On the other hand, we see a lot of applications, for example, pallets. Pallets have in the past, hardly ever been tracked. But with RFID, we can now track them. And so putting RFID labels on pallets is a great way to ensure much greater efficiency of pallet logistics, which is surprisingly a big problem. So that's an indication of the incremental nature that we do see. Yes, Nathan, I think you have a good summary of that. I can add some to it. Did that answer the question, Keith? Or did I miss something? Yes. I was going to give you one example, Damian. So in 2015, we closed the largest deal at that time in Zebra's history in mobile computing, which was a postal service in Europe with the first purchase of TC70 at that time. And they have just refreshed their mobile computers last year. So it was about a six-year cycle for them. And you can see that others have followed suit. And as Andrew said, the replacement cycles have gotten shorter. So going from five to six years, closer to the three to four year period, in many cases. I can add a little bit. Maybe just to underline that PartnerConnect. We've made excellent progress in recruiting partners. We set ourselves a goal, both in the U.S. and Europe to recruit the premier partners that deploy these solutions. And that's very important because these are complex solutions set up in these manufacturing and warehouse environments. We've made excellent progress in doing that. And the reason that we've been able to do that is that Andres called ease of use. And that's particularly important for partners because they want to set up new solutions quickly and with few resources. And that's where our solutions are different from the rest of the market is that you can do that much faster with our solutions and that's what's attracting many partners. So we're very pleased with that. On the Fetch business, I think we have the big milestone that I hope you've taken note of is that we've expanded from conveyance robots. So robots that move things from point A to point B in the warehouse to fulfillment robots, which are ones that are used to support pickers in e-commerce fulfillment activities. That's a large and very fast-growing part of the market, as you can easily imagine. And we've had an outstanding win here with one of the big e-commerce players here in the fourth quarter already, which, of course, is going to be a very important reference for us. So we're very pleased with the progress in both machine vision and the autonomous mobile robots. We do. So we have a good number of our existing partners have already been active in the machine vision space. I would tell you though that the majority of partners that we expect to have will be new partners that are specialized and highly proficient in this area as their exclusive or dominant focus. But we do have a good number that we're starting with already. Yes. I would add. I mean, if you \u2013 Anders described the objective well, right? We have a very strong presence, right? If you think about the fact that 94 of the Fortune 100 in the U.S. are now Zebra customers. We have account managers on those, and we want to leverage those. And then on the other hand, we have specialists that need to bring specialized expertise, but also a special understanding of the specific personas that are making the purchases, which would be, for example, human resources purchasers or store operations purchasers. These are \u2013 these overlay organizations Anders called them, we also refer to them as specialist sales organizations. These are meaningful organizations, which have both salespeople. They have application engineers or consultants. They have business development in them, and they have channel management in them. So these are becoming large organizations that are dedicated to driving that particular frame in concert with the account managers that are now maintaining the overall relationship for us across the multitude of offerings that we have."

            "name": "Anders Gustafsson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Our team delivered solid fourth quarter results in an exceptionally challenging supply chain environment. For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of 12% or 10% on an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA of $319 million, a 4% year-over-year increase and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.7%, a 180 basis point decrease. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.54, a 2% increase from the prior year and strong free cash flow. Customer demand is stronger than ever for our solutions that digitize and automate workflows. We realized sales growth across all four regions, supported by exceptional strength in mobile computing, with particularly strong growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America. Supply chain constraints limited us from fully satisfying our customer demand, particularly for certain data capture and printing offerings. Our teams have been aggressively working to mitigate the impact of the unprecedented industry-wide supply chain challenges by securing new sources of supply, utilizing alternative modalities of transportation and expediting customer shipments. Premium freight costs exceeded our expectations and significantly weighed on gross margin, which was partially offset by higher service and software margin. We also scaled operating expenses while continuing to invest in initiatives to drive sustainable, profitable growth. Our solid fourth quarter performance closed an outstanding full year 2021 in which we generated record sales, EBITDA margin, earnings per share and free cash flow. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q4 financial results in more detail and discuss our 2022 outlook. Thank you, Nathan. I am encouraged by the strong demand across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to navigate the supply chain challenges. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the frontline of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions that generate an attractive return on investment, Zebra's customers can effectively address their operational challenges, which have become increasingly complex through the pandemic. Our innovative solutions empower the workforce to do their jobs more efficiently by navigating constant change in near real-time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as prescriptive analytics, intelligent automation and machine vision. We are raising our long-term organic sales growth expectations to 5% to 7% from our former expectation of 4% to 5%. On Slide 12, we provide a refreshed view of our served markets totaling approximately $30 billion, which are supported by mega trends, including the on-demand economy, asset visibility, mobility and cloud computing and automation. These trends have become increasingly important to our enterprise customers and we remain well positioned to meet their needs with our comprehensive solutions. Today, the vast majority of Zebra sales are in our core, which remains vibrant and is now expected to grow 4% to 5%. We have the broadest and deepest offering among the competition and believe that our continued focus and investment will advance our leadership position. Our near adjacencies provide ample opportunity to expand and have a generally higher growth profile than our core. The most promising categories include RFID solutions for use cases that demand the highest level of workforce productivity and inventory accuracy. Smart supplies, including dynamic temperature monitoring as well as the opportunity to equip a broader set of frontline workers with our expanded offering of mobile computers. Beyond our core and near adjacencies are rapid growth expansion opportunities that are transforming workflows across the supply chain. We have entered these areas through organic and inorganic investments over the past 18 months and they represent a low to mid-single-digit percentage of Zebra sales. In mid 2021, we launched several fixed industrial scanning and machine vision smart cameras. We also acquired Fetch Robotics to give us the broadest portfolio of autonomous mobile robots in the industry. We have also been building a compelling software suite that optimizes retail execution and demand planning, which includes Reflexis workforce and task management, Zebra Prescriptive Analytics, Workforce Connect, SmartCount and antuit.ai powered demand forecasting. Collectively, we are serving an approximately $6 billion market in these exciting expansion areas. We are early on our journey and have the opportunity to extend our capabilities deeper into the areas of machine vision, warehouse automation and workflow optimization software over time. Now turning to Slide 13. Businesses partner with Zebra to help optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet the increasing demands of consumers. I would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets. A global apparel retailer is deploying a Zebra solution of 32,000 TC52 mobile computers along with Workforce Connect voice collaboration software and our software solution that transforms mobile computers into workstations on demand. We are enabling this retailer to improve associate productivity and communication in both front of store and distribution center applications, eliminating the need for walkie-talkies and full desktop computer workstations. Our mobile computers will also provide the benefit of stable network connectivity, improved security features and battery management tools. This competitive takeaway win from a major consumer device provider demonstrates our superior value proposition versus the competition. In another recent win, Zebra's Reflexis workforce management solution has enabled a U.S.-based specialty retailer to optimize scheduling for more than 25,000 employees and provide enhanced self-service reporting and analytics to support accountability and performance. We have expanded our relationship with a leading international energy company to empower thousands of convenience store associates in the United Kingdom with Workforce Connect and Reflexis workforce management applications on their Zebra mobile computers and tablets. Our solution enables the store associates to automate their daily responsibilities, maximizing productivity and streamlining task management and administration. We have expanded our relationship with a European auto manufacturer, augmenting thousands of their Zebra mobile computers with RFID readers to enhance quality control in production lines and allow secure employee system access. We continue to collaborate with this customer to pilot promising new solutions to further optimize their operations. In health care, a large hospital system in the Southern United States purchased TC52 mobile computers and our Workforce Connect software application to enable mobile access to the medical record systems as well as facilitate instant communication between nurses and other clinicians. Zebra has selected over competing consumer device providers because of our reputation for comprehensive enterprise solutions. In closing, we are working diligently to navigate through industry-wide supply chain challenges, which limit our ability to fully satisfy strong customer demand in the near-term. That said, the pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving growth in Zebra's vibrant markets, including e-commerce adoption, the need for real-time track and trace across the supply chain and the shift to a more digital healthcare experience. We continue to be very excited about our growth prospects. Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike. Good morning. Yes. First, we've \u2013 so we raised our longer term growth outlook to 5% to 7% over cycle versus the historical number we had of 4% to 5% that we had in place since 2014 when we did the Enterprise acquisition. Over the last seven or eight years, we have overachieved that target and we've been more in line with 7%, and we see our overall markets being very strong. We served by some very strong secular trends that are helping to drive demand and as we help to digitize and automate our customers' operations and their workflows and our competitive position remains very, very strong. And we think we have great opportunities in our core. The core continues to perform very well, but also in our adjacencies and in our expansion markets. So you asked specifically about the expansion markets, we include in there only things that we have identified so far where we have plans \u2013 or more than plans where we have solutions that are in the markets. So could it expand? Sure, absolutely. It can expand. But we looked at sizing the market to the solutions we have today and the type of applications that they address. So we're not going after \u2013 we're not including, say, the entire markets for these funds, but only the markets that we can address today. So as we continue to add functionality that will possibly add to solutions, that total market, served market can expand. We certainly see those as very attractive markets. We have a strong right to play. And we have a differentiated value proposition like in fixed industrial scanning or in robotics. And those markets, we expect to have a materially higher strong double-digit growth rates versus our core, and they will then augment the overall growth rates we have for the company. So our market share is very strong. We peg overall market share at about mid-40% for our core, where mobile computer would be a little bit higher. Printing is thereabout so maybe a little higher and a little lower for scanning. But the overall market share, we peg around mid-40%. And the growth rate is based on independent market research for those markets as well as an expectation that with the focus in investments we're doing, we will be able to continue to gain some share, although not quite at the same pace as we have for the last several years. Yes. So we include RFID in the adjacent markets for us. It's \u2013 we've been in the RFID space for a long time. So it is very much a close adjacency to our core, where we have a strong right to play and our solutions are very much tied together. I would think of it as it's not either or type thing that customers either by RFID or the buyer regular solutions, our RFID solution go on top of our traditional products. So if you want to say, print and encode an RFID label, it is one of our traditional label printers with an RFID encoder attached to it. And similar, if you want to read the labels that is an attachment to sled or something like that on our mobile computers. So it is an incremental part of our core business, but it's not the supplement. Or it's a supplement, but not a substitute for our core. And the market continues to grow very nicely. We've seen apparel retail, probably the main driver so far. We're looking at in-store inventory accuracy as one of the big drivers. But it's been spreading across more different categories within retail but also we see now moving into other industries, so manufacturing being able to track components or subassemblies through a supply chain or in health care to be able to do a number of attractive use cases there also. Yes. We see that as a nice addition to the business because, one, they would have to augment, say, either printing or mobile computers with RFID capabilities or they could also, of course, use overhead RFID readers, which will be a new business for us with UPS. So we see that as a very attractive adjacent growth opportunity for Zebra. We expect the broad-based growth across based on the entire business of verticals, geographies and product lines. Specific to verticals, I'd highlight health care and manufacturing as two high-growth opportunities for us. They have high need for \u2013 to digitize their operations and workflows, and say today, there's an underpenetration \u2013 relative underpenetration of our type of technologies within those verticals. Yes. First, as context, I'd say that we provided a record profitable results for the full year of 2021 and record Q4. And we were able to do that in a very challenging supply chain environment. The situation is clearly very volatile and Omicron as an example, has impacted the pace of recovery across all the verticals we serve and globally. But the demand environment is very strong and has ramped very fast over the past year or so. And we continue to put our customers first. So we prioritize making sure we can meet our customer delivery times and customer commitments to the extent we can. Now there are times when we have not been able to meet the traditional lead times the way we would like, but that's all been supply chain related. But we're working very hard with our partners and our customers to minimize any impact on our customers' business or our partners business in this area. And we do believe that the challenges are peaking, and we anticipate both freight and component availability to improve as we go through the year here. Specifically on the component side, I'd say that the impacts on availability and pricing of components that we source there is. So it's \u2013 some are much more impacted than others. So it's certainly a very dynamic environment in that way. But we \u2013 as we said, we've been working very \u2013 all angles to make sure that we secure as much of supply as we can. We have worked on building more resiliency overall into our supply chain. We have been negotiating long-term supply agreements with both new and existing suppliers. We are working with our suppliers to ensure we get our fair share of allocations. And we've dedicated a substantial part of our engineering organization to product redesign to basically design out long lead time parts. As we look into kind of Q2 and the rest of the year though, we do have better visibility and better supply commitments to some of these critical components as we enter Q2. So that's part of what gives us the confidence for the full year. And so we do expect some gradual improvements as we go through the year. And did you \u2013 Keith, did you ask about non-semiconductor shortages also? Yes. So there's some inflationary environment across all the commodities, but we would not have been \u2013 not to the extent that we will make that a talking point in our earnings calls, if it weren't for the semiconductor side. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. So first, the 5% to 7% growth rate is meant to be through a cycle. So there will be some \u2013 some years will be stronger, some will be maybe a little weaker. We certainly have been in that case if you look at the past seven years since we had the 4% to 5% rate. But I don't see any reason why from a demand perspective, there will be any kind of step downs in the early part of the cycle here. We see a very strong demand environment and the refreshes of our product lines that we \u2013 that happens to mobile computing to scanning and printing all our products. We talked mostly about it from a mobile computing perspective, where Android has \u2013 first, I said, driven an acceleration of refresh rates because there's so much innovation going into the Android platform. So deployments or products that are deployed, say, five years back, have a hard time now to support the most recent Android versions or all the applications that our customers want to put on the devices. So we've seen a shorter refresh cycle for Android versus the traditional Microsoft devices that we had earlier. And that's all baked into our assumptions for this year. But it's \u2013 we are certainly seeing many of our large deployments that happened in for 2015, 2016 or even 2017 that are now looking to refresh and/or have already refreshed in the process of refreshing. And I don't know, Joe, if you had any further color for this? The growth between AIT and EVM is actually quite similar. It's not materially different. EVM would likely have a slightly higher growth rate, but not materially so. Yes. No, happy to do that. And I'll ask Joe to also then provide some color after my comments here. But the expansion that we feel today that we can address about $6 billion of opportunity there. The fixed industrial scanning machine vision part is about $2 billion, warehouse autonomous mobile robots is approaching $1 billion and our software solutions are about $3 billion. So that gives you kind of the overall scope of that. We are very excited about all three of these. We have good traction, good customer receptivity on the fixed industrial scanning machine vision side, we have some very attractive wins already, and we continue to add functionality, so we can address more and more of the market. But one particularly attractive win, I think, for us last year or in \u2013 I think it was Q4 was in automotive, where we could read \u2013 there was a bake-off and we showed very well on our ability to read some DPM type of markings, was better than for the competition, and we were selected based on that. But I'd say here also the overall value proposition we have in fixed industrial scanning around the ease of use and the ease of upgrades using software to operate rather than having to change your cameras are very well received. And we are also working hard on \u2013 we have established a new fixed industrial scanning machine vision track in our PartnerConnect program. So we want to make sure we recruit partners to help us scale the business in a very cost-effective way and get better reach that we can do ourselves in that time frame. And we've always been very partner-centric. So we think this is a great way to both provide new opportunities for our existing partners as well as recruit new partners from that industry. Joe, I just want to add on the AMR side. We have a very differentiated value proposition in the warehouse automation space, where our robot competitors, they work very hard on optimizing the movement and the use of the robot. And people who are more on the equipment side would try to optimize the movement of workers. Since we have both, we're trying to optimize the overall workflow and coordinate the movement of robots and frontline workers to drive the most productivity enhancements. And I think that value proposition resonates very well with customers. Yes. I'll start and then Nathan can talk about the leverage levels here. But first on M&A, we view M&A as a top priority for us, and we're very excited about the outlook for the business, and we see M&A as a vector for growth. We're not looking to do M&A for the sake of M&A, say, but this is to help accelerate our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. So think of Fetch was a great example of how we could accelerate our reach and expand our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision here into the warehouse automation space. So you can expect that we can be looking at some targeted bolt-on acquisitions as well as high-growth acquisitions that truly advance our vision. And we do see opportunities in digitizing and automating workflows that is kind of the sweet sport for what we're looking for. And yes, as you noted, our balance sheet is strong, so we can support a certain number of acquisitions. Yes. I'll start and here since Joe \u2013 this is Joe's organizational, let Joe provide some color here also. But yes, we have \u2013 we put a lot of thought into how we go to market and how we ramp these new solutions because we have two objectives here. One, we want to leverage the broader relationships that we have with our existing customers, but we also need to have a real focus on these newer solutions. They are smaller today than our more established core solutions. So we want the team that are very dedicated, very focused on them and understand those use cases and those technologies very well. So if you take our software solutions as an example, we have a dedicated software sales team that are kind of owning the software opportunities, but they work very much through our traditional account managers to get introduced to the accounts to get help in navigating those and understanding what the issues are and so forth. So it is a sales overlay strategy for most of these opportunities, but very much leveraging the \u2013 our traditional account managers. And Joe, do you want to add anything to that? Thank you. So just to wrap up, our primary focus continues to be the health and safety of those on the front line, and I would like to thank our employees and partners for their extraordinary efforts to serve customers and deliver record 2021 results in a challenging supply chain environment. We are optimistic that we are now seeing the peak of these challenges, and we are working hard to minimize these impacts. So thank you, and have a great day, everyone."

            "name": "Nathan Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q4, adjusted net sales increased 11.7%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and 10% on an organic basis reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 3.1% despite significant supply constraints on our printer products and cycling very strong prior year results. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 13.2%, driven by exceptional growth in mobile computing. We continue to drive solid growth across services and software with strong service attach rates and expansion of our software offerings. We recognized solid growth in all four regions. North America sales increased 4% with strength in mobile computing, supplies and services. EMEA sales increased 9%, driven by strong growth in mobile computing. Asia Pacific sales grew 29% with strength across all major geographies, including China. And in Latin America, sales increased 42%, continuing strong double-digit growth in all major offerings. Adjusted gross margin declined 210 basis points to 45.7% due to unprecedented premium freight costs partially offset by higher service and software margins. We will discuss transitory costs, including premium freight further in a moment. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 40 basis points as we scaled our cost structure while continuing to prioritize high-return investment opportunities in the business. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.7%, a 180 basis point decrease from the prior year period, entirely attributable to lower gross margin from transitory impacts, partially offset by operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.54 and $0.08 or 1.8% year-over-year increase, which also reflects lower interest expense and a slightly higher tax rate. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. In 2021, we generated more than $1 billion of free cash flow for the first time in our history. This was $115 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the year at a modest 0.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which provides us ample flexibility. In 2021, we invested $452 million to acquire Antuit, Fetch Robotics and Adaptive Vision to advance our solutions offerings in retail, manufacturing and the warehouse. In addition, we made $34 million of venture investments in five portfolio companies, $59 million of capital expenditures, $257 million of net debt repayments and $57 million of share repurchases. On Slide 8, we show the multi-year impact of transitory costs primarily related to expedited freight due to supply chain bottlenecks caused by the pandemic as well as tariffs on China imports. Our team is making heroic efforts to satisfy customer demand. This includes dedicating substantial engineering resources to product redesigns, negotiating long-term supply agreements with new and existing suppliers, shifting virtually all transport to air promotion and expediting component parts and finished goods to meet customer commitments. Global freight rates have reached record high cost per kilo for all modalities of delivery across our supply chain. In Q4 compared to pre-pandemic rates, we incurred incremental premium freight costs of $67 million, which is higher than we had anticipated in our prior outlook, and $58 million higher than the prior year. Partially offsetting this impact were $4 million of refunds of China import tariffs, which was $8 million less than we received in the fourth quarter of 2020. In total, these transitory items had a combined unfavorable gross margin impact of $66 million year-over-year. I will discuss our assumptions regarding the 2022 impact of transitory costs in a moment. Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered the year with a strong order backlog and healthy sales pipeline supported by broad-based demand for our solutions. Our expected sales growth of 1% to 3% for the first quarter has been capped by what we can deliver to our customers due to extended lead times and limited availability of component parts. Our outlook assumes an approximately 1 percentage point additive impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. We anticipate Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, which assumes gross margin contraction from the prior year due to unfavorable sales mix and expected premium freight costs of $60 million, which translates to 340 basis point unfavorable impact to the prior year period. We also expect increased operating expenses as a percent of sales primarily due to our entry into multiple expansion markets since last spring and resuming in-person events. We believe total supply chain impacts, including transitory costs and product availability, are peaking in Q1 with recent improvements in freight capacity and better visibility and supplier commitments to component supply into the second quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $4. For the full year 2022, we expect adjusted net sales to grow between 3% and 7% with the assumption that supply chain constraints steadily abate throughout the year. This outlook assumes a net neutral impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. We anticipate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin between 23% and 24%, which assumes total transitory cost impacts, including premium freight expenses of approximately $140 million to $160 million. This is slightly higher than the impact we realized in 2021. We expect our free cash flow to be at least $900 million for the year. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we are advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision and to provide an update on our served market opportunity and long-term growth expectations. Good morning. Thanks, Tommy. So if you look \u2013 we entered the quarter, as we said in our prepared remarks, with a very strong backlog, good bookings momentum here early in the quarter. The guide of 1% to 3% really reflects constrained supply, not demand, driven by very specific and certain component shortages within our Printing and DCS business. Without that, we would expect to be at least as high as our full year guide unconstrained. But with that said, we do see improved visibility into those components later in the quarter and into the early part of the second. So we'd expect a solid rebound in Q2 and then gives us line of sight to our full year guide. And on the full year guide of 3% to 7%, and as we said in the prepared remarks that confident as ever about our business. We do anticipate improved supply chain constraints throughout the year. It's obviously a dynamic environment, but we've secured commitment and we do see improved visibility here over the next few months. And that would also assume increased growth in the last nine months of the year, again, due to the strong backlog demand, along with the recent targeted price increases that go into effect here at the end of the month. Let's say all that while being somewhat cautious in our overall growth assumptions given the supply chain challenges. Overall, it does, particularly if you look from an EBITDA rate, we do assume a favorable deal mix. So a slightly higher percentage of run rate versus deal mix compared to 2021. But obviously, that becomes a little bit harder to predict as we get into the second half of the year. Yes. So a few \u2013 maybe I'll start with the last question there. If you look from our assumptions, particularly in Q1, we are still assuming that we're almost shipping, particularly in printing, exclusively via air versus ocean. Although, we do expect that to shift as we move throughout the year. So getting back to more normalized levels in the second half. So that's assumed in the full year guide from a margin rate perspective. Now when you look at the price increases, particularly the one we did here this month, that ranged from 0% to 8%. Again, it was not a general increase similar to what we did in September. It was very specific to the product family region based on a competitive position as well as the cost increases we're seeing in those respective product families. And that represents a little less than point of sales growth contribution for the year. And it is something we'll always continue to assess and look at. And if we need to increase prices again based on the competitive positioning and/or the inflationary environment, we'll do so. Yes. So as you mentioned, we've had a long track record of driving profitable growth. And at a EBITDA level and EBITDA margin, we believe that can go higher, and we have many levers to do that. Maybe if you look at our full year guide here of 23% to 24% in the midpoint, that's 2 points higher than we were in 2019, while expanding into these new expansion markets. And those expansion markets come with higher gross margin and the team has continued to focus on operational efficiency, by the way, growing at 2 points despite the transitory cost increases. So yes, it's definitely still an objective for the company and something we can continue to do over the long-term. Yes. So Keith, so I said earlier, the price increases that went into effect here in the end of this quarter is a little less than 1 point of growth contribution for the year, and then the remainder of that would be driven by the strong backlog and the demand for the product. So it's a relatively meaningful, but a relatively small part of the overall growth for the year. Joe, anything you want to add? Yes. Maybe Keith, it might be a little over a point. The 1 here in February is larger in size. And you just have \u2013 both of those slightly impacted by timing in terms of they went into effect in terms of our full year impact on 2022. Keith, I would say from a freight perspective, our air and ocean rates towards the end of the fourth quarter were 5x higher than what they were pre-pandemic. And as we've said, expediting both component parts, finished goods and shipping almost exclusively all of our printing air versus ocean. But rates are beginning to recover from the peak in December, still significantly higher than even the first half last year and definitely from the beginning of the pre-pandemic. And we'll need some time to get print back on the ocean. And I think we still believe that these are largely transitory, but the world has changed, and we need to wait and see how the landscape settles to the extent that will go all the way back down to zero, that we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. Yes, Damian, and I mentioned this a little bit earlier on the comments \u2013 the question from Eric, but we didn't have an explicit target on EBITDA margin, although we do believe it can continue to scale and grow over the cycle. And as you pointed out, many levers to do that, including the \u2013 all these expansion markets typically come with higher gross margin and that will come through an EBITDA as we scale those respective businesses as well as churn through some of the transitory costs that are currently within the P&L. And I think ultimately, our goal is to continue to drive double-digit EPS growth through all the levers we have available to us. Yes. So the initial deployment for USPS, we did complete in the \u2013 late in the third quarter, early fourth quarter, but our teams have continued to remain highly engaged with the post office. We have a healthy pipeline of opportunities here for 2022. And our current assumption within our 2022 guide is that we will sell less to USPS. So we are cycling through that. But again, have many other opportunities, as Joe mentioned earlier around other large deals in the pipeline, just like we do any other year to offset that and continue to grow. That's right. Again, every year, we have a large deployments and rollouts. And again, we have new and other opportunities to offset that to reach the \u2013 our full year guide for 2022. No, I think just add, we ended at 0.5x net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. And again, comfortable with the overall debt levels. And that gives a lot of opportunity and flexibility to address the M&A market, as Anders has mentioned. That's right. Obviously, the first priority is investment in the business, both organically and inorganically. But we still believe share repurchase is a good way to return capital to shareholders. We were active in the fourth quarter, and we've been active to date here in the first quarter with share repurchases."

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Steele: Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's Third Quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors. zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our SEC filing. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation in today's earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Anders Gustafsson, our Chief Executive Officer, and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Anders will begin with our third quarter results then Nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our fourth quarter outlook. Anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer, will join us as we take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Anders.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our team delivered exceptional third quarter results that exceeded our outlook, supported by robust, broad-based demand for our solutions. For the quarter we realized adjusted net sales growth of 27% or 23% on an organic basis. An adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.7%, a 140% basis point year-over-year improvement. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.55, a 39% increase from the prior year and strong free cash flow. Our customers are prioritizing investment in our solutions to digitize and automate their workflows in an increasingly on-demand global economy. We realized double-digit sales growth across all 4 regions with particularly strong growth in EMEA. Favorable business mix, and higher service and software margins enabled us to expand our gross profit margin despite escalating freight costs. Our teams have been diligently leveraging alternative modalities of transport and expediting shipments to mitigate the impact of continued industry-wide supply chain challenges. We also scaled operating expenses while continuing to invest in initiatives to drive sustainable, profitable growth. For that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q3 financial results in more detail and discuss our Q4 outlook.\nNathan Winters: Thank you, Andres. Let's start with the P&L on slide 6. In Q3, adjusted net sales increased 26.6%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and 23.2% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions from customers of all sizes. Our asset intelligence in tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 12.1%, while enterprise visibility and mobility segment sales increased 27.9% driven by exceptional growth in mobile computing. Note that we also realized double-digit growth across services and software. All four regions grew double digits. North America sales increased 14% with particular strength in mobile computing, supplies, and services. EMEA sales increased 39% with strong growth across all major solutions offerings, particularly mobile computing. APAC sales grew 17% with strength across most geographies, including China. And in Latin America, sales increased 41% continuing its strong recovery with double-digit growth in all major offerings. Adjusted gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 45.1%, primarily driven by favorable business mix, and higher service and software margins. These benefits were partially offset by significant premium freight charges, which we will discuss further in a moment. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 30 basis points as we continue to prioritize high return investments in the business. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.7%, a 140% basis point increase from the prior year period reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.55. $1.28 or 39% year-over-year increase was benefited from lower interest expense and a favorable tax rate. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide 7. We generated $798 million of free cash flow through the first 9 months of 2021. This was $316 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended Q3 at a modest 0.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which provides us ample flexibility. In the first 9 months of 2021, we invested more than $300 million to acquire Fetch Robotics and adaptive vision to advance our intelligent automation solutions in manufacturing and the warehouse. We made $24 million of venture investments in 4 portfolio companies. In addition, we made $38 million of capital expenditures and $25 million of share repurchases. On slide 8, we show the multiyear impact of transitory costs primarily related to expedited freight due to supply chain bottlenecks caused by the pandemic, as well as tariffs on China imports. Our supply chain team continues to take extraordinary measures to satisfy customer demand in an exceptionally challenging environment. Global freight costs are elevated for all modalities of delivery across our supply chain. This includes higher shipping cost per kilo, a significant shift from ocean to air freight, as well as increased costs to expedite component parts to our Tier 1 manufacturers to meet customer commitments. In Q3, compared to pre -pandemic rates, we incurred incremental premium freight costs of $44 million, which were $36 million higher than the prior year. For Q4, we now expect approximately $55 million of premium freight costs based on the higher spot rates we are seeing in the market, which translates to a 4% point negative gross margin impact. We expect premium freight costs to abate as component supply and freight capacity improves. Let's now turn to our outlook. Our robust sales pipeline and strong order backlog is supported by a broad-based demand for our solutions as enterprises look to automate their operations to satisfy increasing consumer expectations. Despite extended lead times and uneven inventory availability, we expect fourth quarter adjusted net sales to increase between 8% and 12% year-over-year. This outlook assumes a 2% point additive impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. We anticipate Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin to be slightly higher than 21%, which assumes gross margin contraction from the prior year due to significantly higher premium freight expense, which I discussed earlier. We're also experiencing product component inflation, which we expect to largely offset with price increases that became effective in September. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.50. We have increased our free cash flow outlook to be at least $950 million for the year due to higher-than-expected profitability. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on slide 9. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence Vision in new and existing markets, with spotlights on our acquisition of Antuit and our healthcare vertical.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Nathan. I am encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to navigate supply chain challenges. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, solutions, software, and services. By transforming workflows, Zebra's customers can address complex operational challenges to achieve higher levels of performance. By closely collaborating with our partners and customers, we help businesses across a variety of end-markets to implement solutions that maximize their return on investment. Human labor is a scarce resource. Our innovative solutions empower their workforce to do their jobs more effectively by navigating constant change in near real-time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities, such as machine vision, prescriptive analytics, and artificial intelligence. In October, we acquired Antuit for approximately $145 million to further advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence Vision. This high-margin software-as-a-service business generated sales of approximately $27 million in 2020, nearly doubling over a 3 year period. Slide 12 illustrates how the AI powered demand forecasting solution ensures that its retail and consumer product customers have the right inventory, at the right time, at the optimal price, whether it's fulfilled through online ordering, or in-store shopping. Antuit's cutting-edge offering complements our suite, the workflow software solutions, including reflexes, Zebra prescriptive analytics, workforce connect, and smart count, which works together to increase the performance of labor and inventory across the integrated supply chain. Our growing software suite will help our customers break down silos between planning and execution, giving them a competitive advantage that can increase revenue and margins as they navigate the increased demands of omni-channel fulfillment. Now turning to slide 13. Businesses partner with Zebra to optimize their input and workflows. I would like to highlight a few recent key wins across our end markets that demonstrate how Zebra's solutions are improving productivity and service levels. In retail, Zebra is enabling improved execution of omni-channel fulfillment as more consumers shop online. We recently secured our largest win-to-date in India, providing TC21 mobile computers and printers to help a local retailer compete more effectively against its larger omni-channel and e-commerce global competitors. We're also enabling a Japanese supermarket chain to provide an improved customer experience with our EC55 personal shopping mobile computing solution. Over the next several quarters, a leading home improvement retailer will be deploying 90,000 TC52 mobile computers to a broader number of associates in their stores. Key use cases include item locationing, best-in-class long-range imaging, mobile point of sale, and ecommerce functionality. Competitive differentiators for this win included our seamless network connectivity, best-in-class noise cancellation, and enterprise leading durability. Our mobile computers will also have full desktop functionality when inserted into workstation cradles. This retailer is also deploying our Workforce Connect software as a service solution, which enables associate to associate instant collaboration as well as the associated to group and store to store communication. A leading North American transportation and logistics Company is deploying 9,000 TC-77 mobile computers to their truck drivers for loading and delivery used cases. This solution will increase productivity, improve inventory accuracy, log driving times, and track regulatory compliance. Turning to Slide 14, we highlight how healthcare providers are using as Zebra solutions to digitize and automate the patient journey and address labor challenges. Our recently published Vision Study highlights that 95% of decision-makers expects to increase spending in healthcare IT, and clinical mobility in the next year. We have some exciting recent strategic wins that demonstrate our value proposition. We recently secured a takeaway win of a leading U.S. healthcare provider with more than 150 hospitals and approximately 2,000 sites of care. This customer selected Zebra to provide a multi-year rollout of 85,000 scanners for a wide range of use cases, including bedside nursing, surgery, pharmacy, and inventory management. They also recognized our unique software tools that enable real-time event tracking to prioritize patient care. A large Eastern European public hospital system recently placed an order to provide 19,000 TC25 mobile computers to nurses across 100 hospitals. Hospitals are facing labor shortages made worse by the pandemic, which puts patient safety at risk. Zebra's solutions, including printers and wristbands, reduces the administrative burden on the nursing staff, and allows for more efficient patient care. Our value proposition to this customer also includes real-time tracking of costs of supplies, equipment, and medicine. Additionally, Zebra is growing our long-standing relationship with GE Healthcare who's solution encompass utilizes Zebra's Bluetooth beacon technology for medical equipment asset management. This solution improves asset utilization and prevents unnecessary equipment replacement purchases. Caregivers also benefit by reduced time searching for medical equipment, which can increase time dedicated to patient care. In closing, the pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving Zebra's business, including omni-channel shopping adoption, the desire for track and trace across the supply chain, and the need for a more digital healthcare experience. Our core markets are vibrant and our prospects to scale new expansion markets are bright. We are steadily navigating through significant transitory, industry-wide supply chain challenges. That said, we continue to be as excited as ever about our long-term profitable growth prospects. Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike.\nMike Steele: Thanks, Anders. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible.\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer.  At this time, we will pause momentarily to sample our roster. The first question today comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens, please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Morning, and thanks for taking my questions.\nAnders Gustafsson: Good morning.\nTommy Moll: Anders, I wanted to start on your Antuit acquisition, wondered if you could highlight a couple of ways in which it might be synergistic with your portfolio and I really -- I had two buckets in mind. First, just in terms of scale, you've got more robust go-to-market capabilities, more robust R&D dollars you can put against it. So what would you highlight for us there? But also just in terms of the portfolio and fit, so if I'm a customer what augmented capabilities will you be able to deliver with the software platform given you've got other software adjacencies and hardware opportunities to deliver a solution versus what the portfolio or rather what Antuit would have done as a stand -- pure standalone business?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. I'll try to go through and give you some insights to each of those points. But the first, this helps us in our -- to augment our solutions around improving retail store execution for our customers, as well as for consumer products companies. It is very synergistic with our Enterprise Asset Intelligence Vision. And we talked about our Sense-Analyze-Act framework here. And this is very much around the Analyze and Act part of this, enabling our customers to sense what's happening in the real-world, analyze this information, and act on it in their real-time. The solution that Antuit offers is a demand sensing solution this call. But they take in lots of different data feeds. anything from in-store sales to weather, social media. And you use that to determine basically what demand trends will be. And they can be very quick and do this much better than say traditional models. If you take an example like when COVID happened, Antuit's algorithms we're able to better and quicker adjust to this new environment. And it's very synergistic with our other offerings, particularly on the software side where --take Reflexis where Antuit's insights will generate actions for our Reflexis ' task management solution. So they can be to go and replenish something -- move inventory from the back of store to the front of store or other parts of the supply chain. So it is very much works synergistically with our broader software solution, as well as with our devices. So our mobile computers will generate insights that Antuit can analyze and put into its AI algorithms to derive better insights from. And with this broader set of solutions we position Zebra to be more of a strategic solutions partner to our customers, and we have access to more customers and more executive level people as our customers than Antuit will have individually. So therefore, we think that this fits very well with our broader strategy.\nTommy Moll: Thank you.\nJoachim Heel : One other addition, this is Joe Heel. If you think about the customer set, you mentioned go-to-market that Antuit targets. It is primarily merchandising executives in retail and in packaged goods. Of course, that retail is a very strong segment for us so that should give us the ability to leverage our scale to the benefit of Antuit's offering. And conversely, we have a position in packaged goods, but the Antuit will give us a stronger offering to further expand our offerings in general, not just Antuit but in the way Anders described into packaged goods.\nTommy Moll: Thank you both. That's very helpful. I wanted to pivot for my follow-up to the margin. And again, we appreciate the transparency you've offered around the premium freight headwinds and the trajectory there. So we're looking at $55 million for Q4. And My question really is the following. If you think about how the fourth quarter is progressing both in terms of the realization of some of the pricing actions you've taken, then also you've got on the cost side, it's dynamic and presumably changing on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis. If you think about where you'll likely end the quarter once all that rolls through versus the full quarter outlook you gave, I think it was above 21% for the quarter, does it feel like the exit rate is probably a little better than that average or how do you see things shaping up here in real-time?\nNathan Winters: Hi, Tommy. Maybe just to start with the fourth quarter. As you mentioned here, we'll be slightly above 21%. That is down from prior year, a little over 2 points so 4 points that's the premium freight but offset by favorable business mix as well as improved service margin as well as improvement just in the underlying product margin. And as you mentioned, we have raised prices to offset the component pricing -- so the unit price. I think -- So that's something we're continuing to monitor and assess as how the transitory impacts play out. I would say from a logistics and freight perspective, we do expect that to moderate through the first half of 2022. But I'd say it's something we're managing day-to-day, week-to-week. And we'll see how the quarters play out in terms of when we start to see a meaningful benefit from where we are at today.\nTommy Moll: And Nathan, just to make sure I'm tracking you here. It sounds like the pricing actions are really more targeting the product aspect of input inflation rather than the freight. Am I hearing you correct?\nNathan Winters: That's correct. We have not raise prices to offset the transitory premium freight expenses, but that's something we'll continue to assess as this plays out.\nTommy Moll: Great. Appreciate the insight and I'll turn it back.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg, please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Guys, just on that question around margins. How were you able to manage supply constraint issue in securing parts for your products. And it seems broadly across most of industrial customers and then companies in general, that is the constraints will continue into next year. So I guess what are you doing on that side of things is to manage -- you talked about the freight cost, but just wondering in terms of securitization of parts.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. I'll start the higher level here. And so if you look at the broader backdrop, demand has wrapped -- rammed very fast over the past year. And we have now prioritized meeting our customer needs and commitments. And while we are not always able to meet our traditional lead times due to these industry-wide supply chain challenges, we have been working with our partners and customers to make sure that we can deliver very strong double-digits year-over-year growth. And I'd say based on feedback from our customers and partners, we've been managing this better than our competition. Specifically to -- for how to secure parts, we're looking at the semiconductor industry shortages that has impacted the availability and pricing of some parts more than others, or some of our devices more than others. This is a highly dynamic environment than if we get, say, we sort out and get good news on some parts while the next day we get some more challenging news on other parts. So it is very much of a dynamic environment for us. But I'd say our teams have been working very well -- done exceptional job of working all angles to figure out how to mitigate these issues. Starting with -- we've been built more resiliency in our supply chain by putting a new assembly plants across Southeast Asia so we're less dependent on any particular plant. And in Q3 for instance, we had to move volume between plans based on COVID outbreaks. So that was a great way we trust to leverage us. We also worked really hard to engage with our semiconductor suppliers to make sure that we get our fair share, so we get appropriate allocations of parts and we 're having a large part of our engineering team working on redesigning our devices to qualify new alternative components that are not as exposed to or limited with supply. So we're doing all of these things to ensure that we can meet our customer needs as well as possible here. But as I said, it's a dynamic environment. It's difficult to predict how exactly it's going to play out. But based on our conversations with our suppliers, I'd say we expect the gradual improvement by mid-2022 on the component side.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. You do stand out as someone who has managed these constraints very well and you're right in the line of fire of that issue. So I thought it does sound like you have the capabilities in place to keep that going. And I think -- On the demand side, I thought that your AIT sales would be a little bit higher. How much of that is related to the -- that supply constraint issue, or are you seeing any sort of moderating in demand?\nAnders Gustafsson: First, I'll say we continue to drive innovation across the entire portfolio of products and solutions, and we're helping our customers digitize and automate their operations. And the core business is very vibrant, and we're very excited about the adjacent expansion opportunities that we have. Now specifically for printing, we had a very solid -- we delivered very solid growth across the regions in printing. Printing was up across most of its portfolio. We had particular strength in manufacturing, which tends to deploy mostly tabletop printers. We also saw strong run rate of smaller business through our channel. But it's fair to say the printing was disproportionately impacted by supply chain challenges and that was -- that includes both component issues, but also that our main assembly plant in Southeast Asia had to almost shutdown based on COVID and we had to shift a lot of the volume from Vietnam to China. So that took some capacity out of the quarter. But it was -- still it was very good quarter for printing. We could've done probably a little bit better, but we still believe that we continue to gain share. Certainly year-to-date we gained a lot of share in printing. And also in the AIT segments here we had very strong growth in supplies across all regions and that includes our Temptime portfolio and in Q2, we launched our new Soho printer, very excited about that. That's off to a good start.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Thanks, Anders.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham and Co, please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Good morning. I'm wondering if you could -- how you would characterize your large projects business. Anders, you highlighted a few nice wins and I'm also wondering to what extent that business is being impacted by the component constraints, the logistics challenges, whether customers are themselves being impacted by bottlenecks elsewhere and their supply chain that's affecting the timelines for when these projects are going to go forward.\nAnders Gustafsson: To start with, our large customers, our larger projects are -- continue to do well. We saw growth in that year-over-year. But the mix between our run-rate business and large customers has moderated, gone back to a bit more what we would see us historically normal rates versus what we saw a year ago. I don't think we can say we've seen any impact on our customers roll-out schedules based on supply chain issues. And we clearly worked really hard with our large customers as well as our channel partners to make sure that we understand what is true demand, what our customers truly need to have in order to run the business versus what they might want to have or think of as more risk buys so we can satisfy all our customers, but particularly our larger customers here. But the demand from them continues to be strong and as -- in line with what we've seen previously. And maybe Joe Heel, do you have any additional color here?\nJoachim Heel : Yeah, I would echo what you said. We have not seen any delay in large businesses due to bottlenecks on our customers parts elsewhere. And we have had some extraordinary wins even in this past quarter. As you know, the large projects are somewhat lumpy here and there, but we had double-digit growth nearly in the large projects business as well, including some extremely nice wins in multiple geographies. So we're very pleased with it.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. And a follow-up just I appreciate the colour on your expectations, looking out to the first half of next year as it relates to components and some of the unusual freight costs you're incurring. I'm wondering how we should be thinking about your operating expense levels over the next several quarters. Only because things are beginning to normalize. We have presumably trade shows starting to occur again, and I'm just wondering if we need to be mindful of some temporary cost savings you might have benefited from this year being layered back in over the next several quarters.\nAnders Gustafsson: Hi, Jim. I think it's fair to say that as we go into next year, we do expect some of the discretionary spend, particularly on travel and trade shows to peak up. But I'd say it's no different than any other variable we managed within the year in the pluses and minuses, and still expect to grow despite some of those incremental costs that we'll incur. And as usual, we'll find offsets in efficiencies to mitigate that impact as we go into next year.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. Thank you. I will jump back in the queue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. I wanted to maybe first ask a question just on seasonality. I know a lot of your retail customers still tend to be as active in Q4, but we're also dealing with a labor shortage. So just any kind of perceptions of what you're seeing as far as seasonality in the Q4. And then maybe a second question. Clearly, your highlighting success within healthcare. And this has been a continued area of success for you guys. Are you able to use your traditional go-to-market or the partnerships that you think you could explore that would further accelerate that opportunity? Thanks.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you. Meta, I'll start and then I'll ask Joe Heel to provide some extra color here also. But first on seasonality, I think seasonality this year has been similar to what we would normally have seen, but a slight increase this quarter-over-quarter in Q3 and into Q4. So not a huge difference from that perspective. Obviously, demand has been strong and very broad-based. That certainly helps on the overall demand profile. But I don't think that the seasonality has meaningfully changed and Joachim comment on that in a second. On the part on healthcare, yeah, healthcare has been our fastest-growing vertical if you look over the last several years and I would expect it to continue to be our fastest-growing vertical not necessary every quarter but over a longer period of time. And we have built up a -- we said first week, we're leveraging our traditional sales team but we have a dedicated healthcare sales team within our sales organization, and we have largely dedicated health care partners. If you take somebody who's expert in manufacturing and send them to hospital, that's -- the language is different, the solutions are different. So it really warrants to have more specialized partners, and we have a large number of specialized, both regular resellers, but also ISVs and other partners to help us make sure that we have as robust go-to-market organization and capability as we can. Joe? We lose Joe?\nJoachim Heel : I'm sorry, you're lucky that this is Joe Heel. I would add to each of those points respectively the following. On the seasonality, the one additional thing we have seen is that retailers have been ordering further in advance, right? They're seeing, of course, the shortages that exist in the supply chain and are working with us to anticipate those. So that means that we can plan how to comply to them further in advance and so on. Our reflection of their seasonality is pulled forward in that regard. In terms of healthcare and the go-to-market that we use there, as Andrew said, yes we have specialized partners in those areas that we have been building out over the last few years. Two other things that I think characterize our go-to-market and routes to market in particular, one is we have a higher than average investment of our own resources. We have learned and determine that being present in those hospitals, which is of course a more fragmented customer seat -- customers set is important. And therefore we have made more investments in our own resources in one those areas. And we are more present together with our partners, of course. And then the second is that we've also learned that we need to expand our partner set to more, let's say, non-traditional partners, which would include in particular ISVs. They're very important ISVs for electronic health records that we need to form partnerships with, and OEMs. There are important OEMs that participate in this -- in the healthcare segment, and we have formed some very strong alliances with those as well. And that's helped us with our growth in healthcare.\nAnders Gustafsson: There's 1 more point in this. We have -- as we've worked with our customers now, particularly Joe mentioned retailers, we have greater visibility. The supply chain constraints have enabled us to get greater visibility into their requirements. And our pipeline is more robust, and we enter the quarters with greater backlog than we normally would, but it's not like we are -- they've been pulling forward demand. But if I look at -- look into the future, the more robust pipeline and backlog gives us better visibility as we look into next year.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Chung with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPaul Chung : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So just a follow-up on margins. f we think about EBITDA margins, X freight costs, maybe you are in that mid 20s percent range, you mentioned maybe some temporary costs come back, but is this the more normalized margin profile we should expect maybe in second half of '22 when some of these costs fade a bit? And as your software product mix continues to accelerate can we see further expansion there, that have a follow-up?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah, Paul. I think if you look back at our track record of driving, we have a track record of driving profitable growth. We will exit the year around 23% and that's a 150 basis points improvement from where we exited 2019, despite the transitory cost increase. We do believe EBITDA margin can go higher. We have many levers to achieve that. We mentioned one, we're scaling new markets that have traditionally richer gross margin, whether that be software or the fixed industrial machine vision markets. We're entering along with the team continuing to driving higher margin and productivity through the operational efficiencies across the business, which we've always done. Again, we do expect margins -- EBITDA margins to improve beyond this year, particularly as the transitory freight abates.\nPaul Chung : Thanks. And then your free cash flow in the quarter pretty much paid for Fetch, so your flexibility continue. Inorganic expansion is really quite good. Debt level is in a good place. Where are you looking to expand the portfolio and what leverage levels are you comfortable with? Reflexis, Antuit, those driving higher-margin software mix, we continue to expect priority on software moving forward as well. And then you mentioned adaptive vision as well. If you could provide an update on how that business is going.\nAnders Gustafsson: I'll start on the M&A side of this. M&A continues to be a priority for us. We are certainly very excited about the outlook for the business and we do see M&A as vector for growth. We're quite pleased with the recent acquisitions of Fetch, Antuit, and Adaptive Vision as well. We look at M&A as a way for us to accelerate our strategy to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence Vision and we're targeting select bolt-on acquisitions as well as some high-growth acquisitions that would truly advance our EEI Vision. We see opportunities in digitizing and automating supply change and workflows more broadly. And as you said, we have a strong balance sheet that can support our M&A opportunities. Then on Adap-division, that's part of our machine vision fixed industrial scanning solution set. We acquired them it back in Q2 and they provide software solutions that help our customers to design in machine vision or fixed industrial scanning solutions in their workflows. And to be able to do -- more easily extract useful information from their digital images that they take. And so it's an integral part of our machine vision solution and helps to make sure that it is an ease -- our solutions are easier to implement than our competitors. So it's one of our value propositions. And so far we're very excited about the overall entry into that market.\nPaul Chung : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrian Drab: Hey, good morning. With such great momentum in a number of end markets, I'm wondering, Anders, are there any end markets where the impact of COVID related sales, and sales stimulated by the pandemic has been delayed and end markets where it's not going to be really a headwind for like a tough comp in 2022 where maybe it's the rental car market or healthcare market that took a while to get going, do you see any end markets that just have yet to really drive growth as it relates to the pandemic, where we'll see incremental growth in '22?\nAnders Gustafsson: The pandemic has really accelerated a number of secular trends that's supporting our business and helping to drive enterprises to implement our type of solutions. The themes around how to digitize and automate our customers' businesses is I'd say high priority cross all over to the markets, across all end markets and geographies. How to improve front line worker efficiency and reduced friction from those workflows. So I don't think there's any -- I can't think of any meaningful market that would be hampered by this environment or really lagging from this. This is a pretty broad-based picture. We did see early on during COVID say that healthcare was hit hard. Was it the -- they -- their traditional acute care business was, for healthcare provider, largely shutdown. And if it wasn't truly acute, they wouldn't admit patients and became only taking care of COVID, but that has rebounded and we're now surpassing 2019 levels.\nBrian Drab: I guess, Anders, can I interject and just say I don't think I asked the question as clearly as I wanted to. But do you see any end markets where you look at the end market right now and say, okay, that's starting to kick in, whereas it hasn't to-date where you're excited about incremental growth going forward.\nJoachim Heel : Anders, would you like me to say something?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah, I will take just a couple of comments on this and see -- there are certainly areas that -- and then Joe Heel, you can provide some extra color. I'll just highlight one market I think that we can see that is starting to kick in and that will be hospitality. Hospitality was largely shutdown for most part of COVID and that's coming back and we do see a number of our pipeline for opportunities within the hospitality segment is recovering nicely. And Joe, maybe you have some other other ideas.\nJoachim Heel : Yes. I was going to mention 3 of 1 perhaps that you might not expect. Hospitality is one. Another one that has a longer curve where we expect benefits to continue is manufacturing, which has been recovering really nicely. You saw that already this quarter, but we expect that to continue, there's much to be recovered there. And a third one that you might not think of would be Japan. Japan has been a market that has been on the sidelines for a bit, in particular, during the pandemic. But many of the Japanese customers have not yet migrated to Android. And now that they are seeing the recovery from the pandemic, they're doing that. So there is a market opportunity there that is extending strongly we believe into the next year.\nBrian Drab: And what percentage of revenue is in Japan roughly today?\nAnders Gustafsson: It's a small part of our revenue stream today, but it's a nice upside opportunity for us.\nJoachim Heel : Right.\nBrian Drab: Okay. And then just the last question on software. Are you able to give us an update since there's been so many acquisitions and growth in software and you're making the comments that the margins are being aided by higher -- the overall margin being aided by higher margin in software. Where are you in terms of the size of that software business? I know you don't shy away from saying percentage of total revenue historically from software, but just curious if you could give any comment on that or when do you envision software being 5% or 10% of sales down the road. Any quantification or clarity on that 'd be helpful.\nAnders Gustafsson: If you look at our software, the SaaS portfolio of the business, it's still small, mid single-digit as a percent of the Company and we haven't stated a target or an aspiration in terms of what's the right mix. Obviously it's area of the business we expect to grow organically faster than the core business over time, and it's a priority from an M&A perspective. But in terms of -- we haven't -- we don't have a set date in terms of what percentage of sales we want to get to by a particularly year except for again to continue to build out the suite of offerings we have and it turned into a driver of organic growth.\nBrian Drab: Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, guys, and congratulations on a good quarter. Just want to revisit the supply chain challenges once again. Is there a feeling that the supply chain challenges are peaking now and perhaps you're on a slow way to recovery or we're not quite sure if it peaked quite yet and you still have to work through it?\nAnders Gustafsson: There are different parts of supply chain challenges here. Now, we've talked a little bit about the semiconductor issues. We also have more logistics issues around ocean freight and airfreight. I would think that on the freight side, I would expect quicker recovery and that we -- I would expect that to moderate as we get into the first half of 2022. So I think we're probably at peak rates and capacity constraints, but not that there will be a binary improvement in this area that it goes from whatever it is today to what it was prior to COVID. It will be a gradual improvement, I think. On the component side, I think we wouldn't expect it to get any worse, but I think again, we -- as I mentioned earlier, we would expect a gradual improvements by mid-2022. Does that help?\nKeith Housum: Great. It does. And then the component side, is it primarily with chips or does it seem like the issues are popping up and is playing like whack-a-mole, and you got 1 issue here that you've maybe resolved, but you go to a different issue.\nAnders Gustafsson: I think it's largely on the semiconductor side, but it does move around. So we secure -- was a bit backing up on steps. So even before COVID, even before this, every quarter when we started, we would have certain parts that were on allocation or that we need to define more. But so that's a normal part. But the number of parts today is much higher. And one -- we work on in solving for one part, then next week some other part pops up. So the frequency and the number of parts so much that are on allocation or longer lead times is greater. But we try to make sure that we work very closely with our semiconductor suppliers to let them know what our true requirements are and we've signed a long-term supply agreements, price agreements, and so forth to make sure that we get proper consideration when they do allocate the parts and -- but it's a complex process but I think we've been managing it very well so far.\nKeith Housum: Great. I appreciate it. And then moving over to the software, you've got to flex now for at least a part for over a year. In terms of the approach to the sales, is it still a direct -- primarily as a direct deal and is it the same as your regular sales force or you have a different software sales force? And then how does Antuit go-to-market and how do you envision some of these things together going forward?\nAnders Gustafsson: I'll start and then Joe Heel can provide some -- exchange sides here also. But -- For Reflexis or our broader software portfolio, we have set up dedicated software sales teams within our broader set -- a go-to-market organization. So you can think of our traditional account management teams would be able to start the conversation, qualify and account to some degree, and then bring in our software experts to do a lot of the more technical part of the selling activities. So we -- but with that is -- and into a more dedicated part of the organization make sure we have the right level or depth of knowledge and insights. We are doing this largely direct today, but we are also working with expanding our portfolio of partner portfolio here. And there's a number of other type of resellers and system integrators who are interested in working with us to be able to represent us and participate in predict size, doing implementation services. And Antuit, we specifically, with Antuit here now, we are initially keeping the Antuit sales team somewhat separate because we want to make sure we keep the focus and dedication to that. But leveraging again, the account teams access to accounts as well as the broader expertise we have in our software go-to-market side. Joe.\nJoachim Heel : I think you said it well. I have nothing to add.\nAnders Gustafsson: Okay.\nKeith Housum: Great.\nAnders Gustafsson: It's good.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDamian Karas: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nAnders Gustafsson: Morning.\nNathan Winters: Morning.\nDamian Karas: I think you've covered a lot of ground. You did highlight particular strength in mobile computing, I think most notably in Europe. Maybe you could just elaborate on what you're seeing that's driving that. To some extent, is this a matter of Europe just catching up or are there any particular end markets, customers, or outside projects that are driving that mobile computing strength in Europe?\nAnders Gustafsson: I'll start again and then Joe can also add some extra colors on Europe. But first I'd say we're very pleased with Q3 as overall, we've seen great demand and we've just been able to drive our revenues to exceed the high end of our guidance range. And our customers are aggressively pursuing a digital enterprise transformation strategies, which is causing us to basically exceed our expectations as far as revenue growth this year. We talked about the supply chain issues as being a moderator on this, but we've still been able to deliver double-digit growth across all the regions in each of our product segments. And we continue to see strong growth from both our smaller customers as well as our large strategic accounts. And based on our performance, I clearly expect that we are continued to take share in the industry. And we entered Q4 with a strong backlog and we have a healthy pipeline which I think provides good visibility into 2022. Specifically for Europe, I think we say -- I think we saw -- Europe obviously add a fantastic quarter and saw strength in nearly all the sub regions of EMEA and growth was across all our verticals with particular strength in transportation logistics. And that was driven by some very attractive large postal services wins and retail was also very strong vertical for us. From a product perspective, mobile computing and services were particularly strong while the printing business was more impacted by supply chains. Joe, any further comments?\nJoachim Heel : Yes. I would say that the strength in Europe was perhaps a little bit of an artifact of us trying to get the optimal mix of supply that's available to the customers that we have. If you look over more than one quarter, you will see that the strength North America and Europe is pretty much exactly on par. So we're seeing equal strength in both over 2 or 3 quarters here. This was more of a one-quarter artifact I'd say.\nDamian Karas: Understood, that's really helpful. And I guess we've all seen the headlines since last quarter on Honeywell's actions taken against the IBRA (ph) -- investors. I do have some questions on this. And maybe you could just give us an update on the ITC case and that pending litigation. How would you expect these matters to play out?\nAnders Gustafsson: First, we have a policy of not commenting on ongoing litigation, so it's hard for me to provide a lot of color, as much color as I'd like here. But clearly we have a -- we plan to vigorously defend our positions here. And I'd like to also remind everybody that we have the broadest and deepest intellectual property portfolio of the industry. And we will remain laser-focused on extending our lead and taking share of the market and to beat our competitions in the marketplace.\nDamian Karas: Okay, great. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot guys.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from -- well, our last question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead.\nRob Mason: Good morning, and nice job on the quarter as well. A lot of ground has been covered. I was just -- I was curious though if you could delineate your growth by channel during the quarter. It sounds like both sides, both run rate business and large deal business, were both strong, but I was curious how each one might have waited out. And then maybe you -- if you could comment as well just on how the backlog -- strong backlog that you mentioned as well, how that might be weighted between those channels.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah, I'll have -- Joe, do you want to take the lead on this? Joe?\nJoachim Heel : Yeah, sure. I can take the lead if you like. So in the past quarter, our direct channel mix was slightly higher than in the past. So we had a little bit more in our direct business than -- rather than our channel business. But our channel centricity, so the percentage of our business that goes to channel remains extremely high as is our strategy in the over 80% range. And our backlog continues to be very strong. As we entered into the current quarter, we've had a very strong backlog again and we're already building backlog for future quarters, as you might not be surprised to hear.\nRob Mason: Does the backlog favor large deal versus the channel? Can you distinguish that or draw a distinction?\nJoachim Heel : Generally, yes.\nRob Mason: Same as last year.\nJoachim Heel : Generally, this backlog was more productive. Yes.\nRob Mason: Okay. And then a number of nice wins that you commented on during the quarter. One in particular, the U.S. home improvement win. I'm just curious, was that a -- were you the incumbent in that account or was that a competitive takeaway?\nJoachim Heel : In this case, we were the incumbent.\nAnders Gustafsson: We were the incumbent and there was a refresh of an earlier Android implementation.\nRob Mason: Yeah. That's -- maybe it's where I headed -- was headed with the question because I recall that was one of your maybe larger or I think you had a large early win in Android with home improvement retailer in the U.S. And I'm just curious, are you starting then now to see refreshes more broadly on your Android installs? And if so, I'm just curious if you can make a stronger determination around how the life -- I guess the lifespan of those devices is fairing versus legacy devices.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. So we are definitely seeing a number of our customers that were early adopters of Android now upgrading or refreshing to second-generation Android. And the refresh cycle for Android devices is a bit little faster than it was with Microsoft. The level of innovation on the platform is higher. So you can think of the number of new Android versions coming out is quite frequent and they tend to require more memory, faster processor speed to run properly. And that combined with our customers putting more and more applications on the devices, so that also drives more memory as an example. So there's a number of things that are causing our customers to want to upgrade and refresh the portfolio at a faster pace than what they -- what we saw with older Microsoft platforms.\nRob Mason: And you mentioned as well, that's going to a broader set of user and their customer. I'm just curious if you could -- is there an order of magnitude that you could speak to?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, definitely much deeper penetration of devices into our customers' operations. The value of having every worker be digitally connected and aware is a priority, I would say, for virtually all our vertical end markets, but particularly in retail and healthcare. And we talked about how today roughly our estimate is that 1/3 of retail store associates have access to a mobile device. And when we talk to our retail customers, they certainly have an aspiration to get that to be much, much higher. And similarly, in healthcare, we did a Vision Study, I think it's a couple of years back now where the expectation there was to bring it from about 60% up to 95% over next few years.\nRob Mason: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gustafsson for any closing remarks.\nAnders Gustafsson: And to wrap up, I would just like to thank our employees and partners for their extraordinary efforts to drive or to serve unprecedented customer demand in a supply constrained environment. And while we are focused on maximizing profit growth in the business, our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, partners, and customers as they recover from the pandemic. We would also like to wish a warm welcome to the Antuit team. Thank you and have a great day, everyone.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anders Gustafsson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our team delivered exceptional third quarter results that exceeded our outlook, supported by robust, broad-based demand for our solutions. For the quarter we realized adjusted net sales growth of 27% or 23% on an organic basis. An adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.7%, a 140% basis point year-over-year improvement. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.55, a 39% increase from the prior year and strong free cash flow. Our customers are prioritizing investment in our solutions to digitize and automate their workflows in an increasingly on-demand global economy. We realized double-digit sales growth across all 4 regions with particularly strong growth in EMEA. Favorable business mix, and higher service and software margins enabled us to expand our gross profit margin despite escalating freight costs. Our teams have been diligently leveraging alternative modalities of transport and expediting shipments to mitigate the impact of continued industry-wide supply chain challenges. We also scaled operating expenses while continuing to invest in initiatives to drive sustainable, profitable growth. For that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q3 financial results in more detail and discuss our Q4 outlook. Thank you, Nathan. I am encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to navigate supply chain challenges. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, solutions, software, and services. By transforming workflows, Zebra's customers can address complex operational challenges to achieve higher levels of performance. By closely collaborating with our partners and customers, we help businesses across a variety of end-markets to implement solutions that maximize their return on investment. Human labor is a scarce resource. Our innovative solutions empower their workforce to do their jobs more effectively by navigating constant change in near real-time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities, such as machine vision, prescriptive analytics, and artificial intelligence. In October, we acquired Antuit for approximately $145 million to further advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence Vision. This high-margin software-as-a-service business generated sales of approximately $27 million in 2020, nearly doubling over a 3 year period. Slide 12 illustrates how the AI powered demand forecasting solution ensures that its retail and consumer product customers have the right inventory, at the right time, at the optimal price, whether it's fulfilled through online ordering, or in-store shopping. Antuit's cutting-edge offering complements our suite, the workflow software solutions, including reflexes, Zebra prescriptive analytics, workforce connect, and smart count, which works together to increase the performance of labor and inventory across the integrated supply chain. Our growing software suite will help our customers break down silos between planning and execution, giving them a competitive advantage that can increase revenue and margins as they navigate the increased demands of omni-channel fulfillment. Now turning to slide 13. Businesses partner with Zebra to optimize their input and workflows. I would like to highlight a few recent key wins across our end markets that demonstrate how Zebra's solutions are improving productivity and service levels. In retail, Zebra is enabling improved execution of omni-channel fulfillment as more consumers shop online. We recently secured our largest win-to-date in India, providing TC21 mobile computers and printers to help a local retailer compete more effectively against its larger omni-channel and e-commerce global competitors. We're also enabling a Japanese supermarket chain to provide an improved customer experience with our EC55 personal shopping mobile computing solution. Over the next several quarters, a leading home improvement retailer will be deploying 90,000 TC52 mobile computers to a broader number of associates in their stores. Key use cases include item locationing, best-in-class long-range imaging, mobile point of sale, and ecommerce functionality. Competitive differentiators for this win included our seamless network connectivity, best-in-class noise cancellation, and enterprise leading durability. Our mobile computers will also have full desktop functionality when inserted into workstation cradles. This retailer is also deploying our Workforce Connect software as a service solution, which enables associate to associate instant collaboration as well as the associated to group and store to store communication. A leading North American transportation and logistics Company is deploying 9,000 TC-77 mobile computers to their truck drivers for loading and delivery used cases. This solution will increase productivity, improve inventory accuracy, log driving times, and track regulatory compliance. Turning to Slide 14, we highlight how healthcare providers are using as Zebra solutions to digitize and automate the patient journey and address labor challenges. Our recently published Vision Study highlights that 95% of decision-makers expects to increase spending in healthcare IT, and clinical mobility in the next year. We have some exciting recent strategic wins that demonstrate our value proposition. We recently secured a takeaway win of a leading U.S. healthcare provider with more than 150 hospitals and approximately 2,000 sites of care. This customer selected Zebra to provide a multi-year rollout of 85,000 scanners for a wide range of use cases, including bedside nursing, surgery, pharmacy, and inventory management. They also recognized our unique software tools that enable real-time event tracking to prioritize patient care. A large Eastern European public hospital system recently placed an order to provide 19,000 TC25 mobile computers to nurses across 100 hospitals. Hospitals are facing labor shortages made worse by the pandemic, which puts patient safety at risk. Zebra's solutions, including printers and wristbands, reduces the administrative burden on the nursing staff, and allows for more efficient patient care. Our value proposition to this customer also includes real-time tracking of costs of supplies, equipment, and medicine. Additionally, Zebra is growing our long-standing relationship with GE Healthcare who's solution encompass utilizes Zebra's Bluetooth beacon technology for medical equipment asset management. This solution improves asset utilization and prevents unnecessary equipment replacement purchases. Caregivers also benefit by reduced time searching for medical equipment, which can increase time dedicated to patient care. In closing, the pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving Zebra's business, including omni-channel shopping adoption, the desire for track and trace across the supply chain, and the need for a more digital healthcare experience. Our core markets are vibrant and our prospects to scale new expansion markets are bright. We are steadily navigating through significant transitory, industry-wide supply chain challenges. That said, we continue to be as excited as ever about our long-term profitable growth prospects. Now I'll hand the call back over to Mike. Good morning. Yeah. I'll try to go through and give you some insights to each of those points. But the first, this helps us in our -- to augment our solutions around improving retail store execution for our customers, as well as for consumer products companies. It is very synergistic with our Enterprise Asset Intelligence Vision. And we talked about our Sense-Analyze-Act framework here. And this is very much around the Analyze and Act part of this, enabling our customers to sense what's happening in the real-world, analyze this information, and act on it in their real-time. The solution that Antuit offers is a demand sensing solution this call. But they take in lots of different data feeds. anything from in-store sales to weather, social media. And you use that to determine basically what demand trends will be. And they can be very quick and do this much better than say traditional models. If you take an example like when COVID happened, Antuit's algorithms we're able to better and quicker adjust to this new environment. And it's very synergistic with our other offerings, particularly on the software side where --take Reflexis where Antuit's insights will generate actions for our Reflexis ' task management solution. So they can be to go and replenish something -- move inventory from the back of store to the front of store or other parts of the supply chain. So it is very much works synergistically with our broader software solution, as well as with our devices. So our mobile computers will generate insights that Antuit can analyze and put into its AI algorithms to derive better insights from. And with this broader set of solutions we position Zebra to be more of a strategic solutions partner to our customers, and we have access to more customers and more executive level people as our customers than Antuit will have individually. So therefore, we think that this fits very well with our broader strategy. Yeah. I'll start the higher level here. And so if you look at the broader backdrop, demand has wrapped -- rammed very fast over the past year. And we have now prioritized meeting our customer needs and commitments. And while we are not always able to meet our traditional lead times due to these industry-wide supply chain challenges, we have been working with our partners and customers to make sure that we can deliver very strong double-digits year-over-year growth. And I'd say based on feedback from our customers and partners, we've been managing this better than our competition. Specifically to -- for how to secure parts, we're looking at the semiconductor industry shortages that has impacted the availability and pricing of some parts more than others, or some of our devices more than others. This is a highly dynamic environment than if we get, say, we sort out and get good news on some parts while the next day we get some more challenging news on other parts. So it is very much of a dynamic environment for us. But I'd say our teams have been working very well -- done exceptional job of working all angles to figure out how to mitigate these issues. Starting with -- we've been built more resiliency in our supply chain by putting a new assembly plants across Southeast Asia so we're less dependent on any particular plant. And in Q3 for instance, we had to move volume between plans based on COVID outbreaks. So that was a great way we trust to leverage us. We also worked really hard to engage with our semiconductor suppliers to make sure that we get our fair share, so we get appropriate allocations of parts and we 're having a large part of our engineering team working on redesigning our devices to qualify new alternative components that are not as exposed to or limited with supply. So we're doing all of these things to ensure that we can meet our customer needs as well as possible here. But as I said, it's a dynamic environment. It's difficult to predict how exactly it's going to play out. But based on our conversations with our suppliers, I'd say we expect the gradual improvement by mid-2022 on the component side. First, I'll say we continue to drive innovation across the entire portfolio of products and solutions, and we're helping our customers digitize and automate their operations. And the core business is very vibrant, and we're very excited about the adjacent expansion opportunities that we have. Now specifically for printing, we had a very solid -- we delivered very solid growth across the regions in printing. Printing was up across most of its portfolio. We had particular strength in manufacturing, which tends to deploy mostly tabletop printers. We also saw strong run rate of smaller business through our channel. But it's fair to say the printing was disproportionately impacted by supply chain challenges and that was -- that includes both component issues, but also that our main assembly plant in Southeast Asia had to almost shutdown based on COVID and we had to shift a lot of the volume from Vietnam to China. So that took some capacity out of the quarter. But it was -- still it was very good quarter for printing. We could've done probably a little bit better, but we still believe that we continue to gain share. Certainly year-to-date we gained a lot of share in printing. And also in the AIT segments here we had very strong growth in supplies across all regions and that includes our Temptime portfolio and in Q2, we launched our new Soho printer, very excited about that. That's off to a good start. To start with, our large customers, our larger projects are -- continue to do well. We saw growth in that year-over-year. But the mix between our run-rate business and large customers has moderated, gone back to a bit more what we would see us historically normal rates versus what we saw a year ago. I don't think we can say we've seen any impact on our customers roll-out schedules based on supply chain issues. And we clearly worked really hard with our large customers as well as our channel partners to make sure that we understand what is true demand, what our customers truly need to have in order to run the business versus what they might want to have or think of as more risk buys so we can satisfy all our customers, but particularly our larger customers here. But the demand from them continues to be strong and as -- in line with what we've seen previously. And maybe Joe Heel, do you have any additional color here? Hi, Jim. I think it's fair to say that as we go into next year, we do expect some of the discretionary spend, particularly on travel and trade shows to peak up. But I'd say it's no different than any other variable we managed within the year in the pluses and minuses, and still expect to grow despite some of those incremental costs that we'll incur. And as usual, we'll find offsets in efficiencies to mitigate that impact as we go into next year. Thank you. Meta, I'll start and then I'll ask Joe Heel to provide some extra color here also. But first on seasonality, I think seasonality this year has been similar to what we would normally have seen, but a slight increase this quarter-over-quarter in Q3 and into Q4. So not a huge difference from that perspective. Obviously, demand has been strong and very broad-based. That certainly helps on the overall demand profile. But I don't think that the seasonality has meaningfully changed and Joachim comment on that in a second. On the part on healthcare, yeah, healthcare has been our fastest-growing vertical if you look over the last several years and I would expect it to continue to be our fastest-growing vertical not necessary every quarter but over a longer period of time. And we have built up a -- we said first week, we're leveraging our traditional sales team but we have a dedicated healthcare sales team within our sales organization, and we have largely dedicated health care partners. If you take somebody who's expert in manufacturing and send them to hospital, that's -- the language is different, the solutions are different. So it really warrants to have more specialized partners, and we have a large number of specialized, both regular resellers, but also ISVs and other partners to help us make sure that we have as robust go-to-market organization and capability as we can. Joe? We lose Joe? There's 1 more point in this. We have -- as we've worked with our customers now, particularly Joe mentioned retailers, we have greater visibility. The supply chain constraints have enabled us to get greater visibility into their requirements. And our pipeline is more robust, and we enter the quarters with greater backlog than we normally would, but it's not like we are -- they've been pulling forward demand. But if I look at -- look into the future, the more robust pipeline and backlog gives us better visibility as we look into next year. Yeah, Paul. I think if you look back at our track record of driving, we have a track record of driving profitable growth. We will exit the year around 23% and that's a 150 basis points improvement from where we exited 2019, despite the transitory cost increase. We do believe EBITDA margin can go higher. We have many levers to achieve that. We mentioned one, we're scaling new markets that have traditionally richer gross margin, whether that be software or the fixed industrial machine vision markets. We're entering along with the team continuing to driving higher margin and productivity through the operational efficiencies across the business, which we've always done. Again, we do expect margins -- EBITDA margins to improve beyond this year, particularly as the transitory freight abates. I'll start on the M&A side of this. M&A continues to be a priority for us. We are certainly very excited about the outlook for the business and we do see M&A as vector for growth. We're quite pleased with the recent acquisitions of Fetch, Antuit, and Adaptive Vision as well. We look at M&A as a way for us to accelerate our strategy to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence Vision and we're targeting select bolt-on acquisitions as well as some high-growth acquisitions that would truly advance our EEI Vision. We see opportunities in digitizing and automating supply change and workflows more broadly. And as you said, we have a strong balance sheet that can support our M&A opportunities. Then on Adap-division, that's part of our machine vision fixed industrial scanning solution set. We acquired them it back in Q2 and they provide software solutions that help our customers to design in machine vision or fixed industrial scanning solutions in their workflows. And to be able to do -- more easily extract useful information from their digital images that they take. And so it's an integral part of our machine vision solution and helps to make sure that it is an ease -- our solutions are easier to implement than our competitors. So it's one of our value propositions. And so far we're very excited about the overall entry into that market. The pandemic has really accelerated a number of secular trends that's supporting our business and helping to drive enterprises to implement our type of solutions. The themes around how to digitize and automate our customers' businesses is I'd say high priority cross all over to the markets, across all end markets and geographies. How to improve front line worker efficiency and reduced friction from those workflows. So I don't think there's any -- I can't think of any meaningful market that would be hampered by this environment or really lagging from this. This is a pretty broad-based picture. We did see early on during COVID say that healthcare was hit hard. Was it the -- they -- their traditional acute care business was, for healthcare provider, largely shutdown. And if it wasn't truly acute, they wouldn't admit patients and became only taking care of COVID, but that has rebounded and we're now surpassing 2019 levels. Yeah, I will take just a couple of comments on this and see -- there are certainly areas that -- and then Joe Heel, you can provide some extra color. I'll just highlight one market I think that we can see that is starting to kick in and that will be hospitality. Hospitality was largely shutdown for most part of COVID and that's coming back and we do see a number of our pipeline for opportunities within the hospitality segment is recovering nicely. And Joe, maybe you have some other other ideas. It's a small part of our revenue stream today, but it's a nice upside opportunity for us. If you look at our software, the SaaS portfolio of the business, it's still small, mid single-digit as a percent of the Company and we haven't stated a target or an aspiration in terms of what's the right mix. Obviously it's area of the business we expect to grow organically faster than the core business over time, and it's a priority from an M&A perspective. But in terms of -- we haven't -- we don't have a set date in terms of what percentage of sales we want to get to by a particularly year except for again to continue to build out the suite of offerings we have and it turned into a driver of organic growth. There are different parts of supply chain challenges here. Now, we've talked a little bit about the semiconductor issues. We also have more logistics issues around ocean freight and airfreight. I would think that on the freight side, I would expect quicker recovery and that we -- I would expect that to moderate as we get into the first half of 2022. So I think we're probably at peak rates and capacity constraints, but not that there will be a binary improvement in this area that it goes from whatever it is today to what it was prior to COVID. It will be a gradual improvement, I think. On the component side, I think we wouldn't expect it to get any worse, but I think again, we -- as I mentioned earlier, we would expect a gradual improvements by mid-2022. Does that help? I think it's largely on the semiconductor side, but it does move around. So we secure -- was a bit backing up on steps. So even before COVID, even before this, every quarter when we started, we would have certain parts that were on allocation or that we need to define more. But so that's a normal part. But the number of parts today is much higher. And one -- we work on in solving for one part, then next week some other part pops up. So the frequency and the number of parts so much that are on allocation or longer lead times is greater. But we try to make sure that we work very closely with our semiconductor suppliers to let them know what our true requirements are and we've signed a long-term supply agreements, price agreements, and so forth to make sure that we get proper consideration when they do allocate the parts and -- but it's a complex process but I think we've been managing it very well so far. I'll start and then Joe Heel can provide some -- exchange sides here also. But -- For Reflexis or our broader software portfolio, we have set up dedicated software sales teams within our broader set -- a go-to-market organization. So you can think of our traditional account management teams would be able to start the conversation, qualify and account to some degree, and then bring in our software experts to do a lot of the more technical part of the selling activities. So we -- but with that is -- and into a more dedicated part of the organization make sure we have the right level or depth of knowledge and insights. We are doing this largely direct today, but we are also working with expanding our portfolio of partner portfolio here. And there's a number of other type of resellers and system integrators who are interested in working with us to be able to represent us and participate in predict size, doing implementation services. And Antuit, we specifically, with Antuit here now, we are initially keeping the Antuit sales team somewhat separate because we want to make sure we keep the focus and dedication to that. But leveraging again, the account teams access to accounts as well as the broader expertise we have in our software go-to-market side. Joe. Okay. It's good. Morning. I'll start again and then Joe can also add some extra colors on Europe. But first I'd say we're very pleased with Q3 as overall, we've seen great demand and we've just been able to drive our revenues to exceed the high end of our guidance range. And our customers are aggressively pursuing a digital enterprise transformation strategies, which is causing us to basically exceed our expectations as far as revenue growth this year. We talked about the supply chain issues as being a moderator on this, but we've still been able to deliver double-digit growth across all the regions in each of our product segments. And we continue to see strong growth from both our smaller customers as well as our large strategic accounts. And based on our performance, I clearly expect that we are continued to take share in the industry. And we entered Q4 with a strong backlog and we have a healthy pipeline which I think provides good visibility into 2022. Specifically for Europe, I think we say -- I think we saw -- Europe obviously add a fantastic quarter and saw strength in nearly all the sub regions of EMEA and growth was across all our verticals with particular strength in transportation logistics. And that was driven by some very attractive large postal services wins and retail was also very strong vertical for us. From a product perspective, mobile computing and services were particularly strong while the printing business was more impacted by supply chains. Joe, any further comments? First, we have a policy of not commenting on ongoing litigation, so it's hard for me to provide a lot of color, as much color as I'd like here. But clearly we have a -- we plan to vigorously defend our positions here. And I'd like to also remind everybody that we have the broadest and deepest intellectual property portfolio of the industry. And we will remain laser-focused on extending our lead and taking share of the market and to beat our competitions in the marketplace. Thank you. Yeah, I'll have -- Joe, do you want to take the lead on this? Joe? We were the incumbent and there was a refresh of an earlier Android implementation. Yeah. So we are definitely seeing a number of our customers that were early adopters of Android now upgrading or refreshing to second-generation Android. And the refresh cycle for Android devices is a bit little faster than it was with Microsoft. The level of innovation on the platform is higher. So you can think of the number of new Android versions coming out is quite frequent and they tend to require more memory, faster processor speed to run properly. And that combined with our customers putting more and more applications on the devices, so that also drives more memory as an example. So there's a number of things that are causing our customers to want to upgrade and refresh the portfolio at a faster pace than what they -- what we saw with older Microsoft platforms. Yes, definitely much deeper penetration of devices into our customers' operations. The value of having every worker be digitally connected and aware is a priority, I would say, for virtually all our vertical end markets, but particularly in retail and healthcare. And we talked about how today roughly our estimate is that 1/3 of retail store associates have access to a mobile device. And when we talk to our retail customers, they certainly have an aspiration to get that to be much, much higher. And similarly, in healthcare, we did a Vision Study, I think it's a couple of years back now where the expectation there was to bring it from about 60% up to 95% over next few years. And to wrap up, I would just like to thank our employees and partners for their extraordinary efforts to drive or to serve unprecedented customer demand in a supply constrained environment. And while we are focused on maximizing profit growth in the business, our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, partners, and customers as they recover from the pandemic. We would also like to wish a warm welcome to the Antuit team. Thank you and have a great day, everyone."

            "content": "Thank you, Andres. Let's start with the P&L on slide 6. In Q3, adjusted net sales increased 26.6%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and 23.2% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions from customers of all sizes. Our asset intelligence in tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 12.1%, while enterprise visibility and mobility segment sales increased 27.9% driven by exceptional growth in mobile computing. Note that we also realized double-digit growth across services and software. All four regions grew double digits. North America sales increased 14% with particular strength in mobile computing, supplies, and services. EMEA sales increased 39% with strong growth across all major solutions offerings, particularly mobile computing. APAC sales grew 17% with strength across most geographies, including China. And in Latin America, sales increased 41% continuing its strong recovery with double-digit growth in all major offerings. Adjusted gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 45.1%, primarily driven by favorable business mix, and higher service and software margins. These benefits were partially offset by significant premium freight charges, which we will discuss further in a moment. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 30 basis points as we continue to prioritize high return investments in the business. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.7%, a 140% basis point increase from the prior year period reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.55. $1.28 or 39% year-over-year increase was benefited from lower interest expense and a favorable tax rate. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide 7. We generated $798 million of free cash flow through the first 9 months of 2021. This was $316 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended Q3 at a modest 0.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which provides us ample flexibility. In the first 9 months of 2021, we invested more than $300 million to acquire Fetch Robotics and adaptive vision to advance our intelligent automation solutions in manufacturing and the warehouse. We made $24 million of venture investments in 4 portfolio companies. In addition, we made $38 million of capital expenditures and $25 million of share repurchases. On slide 8, we show the multiyear impact of transitory costs primarily related to expedited freight due to supply chain bottlenecks caused by the pandemic, as well as tariffs on China imports. Our supply chain team continues to take extraordinary measures to satisfy customer demand in an exceptionally challenging environment. Global freight costs are elevated for all modalities of delivery across our supply chain. This includes higher shipping cost per kilo, a significant shift from ocean to air freight, as well as increased costs to expedite component parts to our Tier 1 manufacturers to meet customer commitments. In Q3, compared to pre -pandemic rates, we incurred incremental premium freight costs of $44 million, which were $36 million higher than the prior year. For Q4, we now expect approximately $55 million of premium freight costs based on the higher spot rates we are seeing in the market, which translates to a 4% point negative gross margin impact. We expect premium freight costs to abate as component supply and freight capacity improves. Let's now turn to our outlook. Our robust sales pipeline and strong order backlog is supported by a broad-based demand for our solutions as enterprises look to automate their operations to satisfy increasing consumer expectations. Despite extended lead times and uneven inventory availability, we expect fourth quarter adjusted net sales to increase between 8% and 12% year-over-year. This outlook assumes a 2% point additive impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. We anticipate Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin to be slightly higher than 21%, which assumes gross margin contraction from the prior year due to significantly higher premium freight expense, which I discussed earlier. We're also experiencing product component inflation, which we expect to largely offset with price increases that became effective in September. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.50. We have increased our free cash flow outlook to be at least $950 million for the year due to higher-than-expected profitability. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on slide 9. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence Vision in new and existing markets, with spotlights on our acquisition of Antuit and our healthcare vertical. Hi, Tommy. Maybe just to start with the fourth quarter. As you mentioned here, we'll be slightly above 21%. That is down from prior year, a little over 2 points so 4 points that's the premium freight but offset by favorable business mix as well as improved service margin as well as improvement just in the underlying product margin. And as you mentioned, we have raised prices to offset the component pricing -- so the unit price. I think -- So that's something we're continuing to monitor and assess as how the transitory impacts play out. I would say from a logistics and freight perspective, we do expect that to moderate through the first half of 2022. But I'd say it's something we're managing day-to-day, week-to-week. And we'll see how the quarters play out in terms of when we start to see a meaningful benefit from where we are at today. That's correct. We have not raise prices to offset the transitory premium freight expenses, but that's something we'll continue to assess as this plays out. Morning."

            "name": "Joachim Heel",
            "content": "One other addition, this is Joe Heel. If you think about the customer set, you mentioned go-to-market that Antuit targets. It is primarily merchandising executives in retail and in packaged goods. Of course, that retail is a very strong segment for us so that should give us the ability to leverage our scale to the benefit of Antuit's offering. And conversely, we have a position in packaged goods, but the Antuit will give us a stronger offering to further expand our offerings in general, not just Antuit but in the way Anders described into packaged goods. Yeah, I would echo what you said. We have not seen any delay in large businesses due to bottlenecks on our customers parts elsewhere. And we have had some extraordinary wins even in this past quarter. As you know, the large projects are somewhat lumpy here and there, but we had double-digit growth nearly in the large projects business as well, including some extremely nice wins in multiple geographies. So we're very pleased with it. I'm sorry, you're lucky that this is Joe Heel. I would add to each of those points respectively the following. On the seasonality, the one additional thing we have seen is that retailers have been ordering further in advance, right? They're seeing, of course, the shortages that exist in the supply chain and are working with us to anticipate those. So that means that we can plan how to comply to them further in advance and so on. Our reflection of their seasonality is pulled forward in that regard. In terms of healthcare and the go-to-market that we use there, as Andrew said, yes we have specialized partners in those areas that we have been building out over the last few years. Two other things that I think characterize our go-to-market and routes to market in particular, one is we have a higher than average investment of our own resources. We have learned and determine that being present in those hospitals, which is of course a more fragmented customer seat -- customers set is important. And therefore we have made more investments in our own resources in one those areas. And we are more present together with our partners, of course. And then the second is that we've also learned that we need to expand our partner set to more, let's say, non-traditional partners, which would include in particular ISVs. They're very important ISVs for electronic health records that we need to form partnerships with, and OEMs. There are important OEMs that participate in this -- in the healthcare segment, and we have formed some very strong alliances with those as well. And that's helped us with our growth in healthcare. Anders, would you like me to say something? Yes. I was going to mention 3 of 1 perhaps that you might not expect. Hospitality is one. Another one that has a longer curve where we expect benefits to continue is manufacturing, which has been recovering really nicely. You saw that already this quarter, but we expect that to continue, there's much to be recovered there. And a third one that you might not think of would be Japan. Japan has been a market that has been on the sidelines for a bit, in particular, during the pandemic. But many of the Japanese customers have not yet migrated to Android. And now that they are seeing the recovery from the pandemic, they're doing that. So there is a market opportunity there that is extending strongly we believe into the next year. Right. I think you said it well. I have nothing to add. Yes. I would say that the strength in Europe was perhaps a little bit of an artifact of us trying to get the optimal mix of supply that's available to the customers that we have. If you look over more than one quarter, you will see that the strength North America and Europe is pretty much exactly on par. So we're seeing equal strength in both over 2 or 3 quarters here. This was more of a one-quarter artifact I'd say. Yeah, sure. I can take the lead if you like. So in the past quarter, our direct channel mix was slightly higher than in the past. So we had a little bit more in our direct business than -- rather than our channel business. But our channel centricity, so the percentage of our business that goes to channel remains extremely high as is our strategy in the over 80% range. And our backlog continues to be very strong. As we entered into the current quarter, we've had a very strong backlog again and we're already building backlog for future quarters, as you might not be surprised to hear. Generally, yes. Generally, this backlog was more productive. Yes. In this case, we were the incumbent."

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. . Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Steele: Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's second quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Our team delivered exceptional second quarter results with strong performance across the business resulting in record sales and profits. For the quarter we realized adjusted net sales growth of 44% or 40% on an organic basis; an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.6%, a 530 basis points year-over-year improvement. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.57, a nearly 90% increase from the prior year and strong free cash flow. Despite ongoing industry wide supply chain challenges. Our teams successfully satisfied stronger-than-expected demand from customers both direct and through our distribution channel. Similar to Q1 we realized robust broad-based demand with double-digit sales growth across all four regions, each major product and solutions category, as well as in all of our vertical end markets. Our customers continue to digitize and automate their workflows with a sense of urgency in the increasingly on-demand global economy. We also significantly expanded profit margin across our business more than offsetting escalating global supply chain costs. We also continued our balanced approach to scaling operating expenses, while investing in initiatives to drive sustainable profitable growth.\nNathan Winters: Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q2, adjusted net sales increased 44.4%, including the impact of currency and acquisition, and 39.8% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions from customers of all sizes. We realized particularly high growth from our run rate business through the channel partially driven by pent-up demand, while continuing to see strong growth in direct sales to large customers. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment, including printing and supplies grew 51.2%, while Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 35.1% driven by exceptional growth across all major categories, including enterprise mobile computing and data capture. Note that we also realized double-digit growth in services and software along with very strong growth in our RFID solutions, for which deployment activity has snapped back as this customers recover from the pandemic. We recognized double-digit growth in all regions. In North America, sales increased 39% with all major categories growing double-digits. In EMEA, sales increased 44% with solid growth across sub regions and solutions offerings. APAC again realized strong growth with sales up 20% led by strength in China, Australia, India and Japan. Latin America also continue its recovery with exceptionally strong growth in all sub regions with sales increasing 79%. Adjusted gross margin expanded 390 basis points to 48%, primarily driven by favorable business mix, a $12 million recovery of Chinese import tariffs, higher support service margins, and contribution from our recent high margin acquisitions. These benefits were partially offset by higher premium freight charges, which we'll discuss further in a moment. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 180 basis points. We continue to scale OpEx, while prioritizing high return investments in the business. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.6% a 530 basis point improvement from the prior year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.57, a $2.16 or 89.6% year-over-year increase. EPS growth also benefited from lower interest expense, partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $514 million of free cash flow in the first half of 2021. This was a $192 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. In Q2, we acquired Adaptive Vision for $18 million to advance our Machine Vision solutions and made $4 million of venture investments.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Nathan. I'm encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business, which allows us to further increase our 2021 outlook. Slide 11 illustrates how we're working with our customers and partners to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision, by leveraging Zebra's industry leading portfolio of products, solutions, software and services, our customers can overcome some of their most complex operational challenges and transform their frontline workflows to achieve higher levels of performance. We help businesses across industries implement tailored solutions that digitize and automate their operations, enabling them to compete more effectively. With our innovative solutions, our customers associates can now anticipate and react in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, prescriptive analytics and Machine Vision. Now turning to Slide 12. As a trusted strategic partner, businesses in a variety of end-markets turn to Zebra to help optimize end-to-end workflows. I would like to highlight several recent wins across our end-markets, which demonstrate how Zebra Solutions are improving productivity, customer service and patient care. Large European Postal Service will be deploying approximately 80,000 TC27s to their carriers. Continuing a long standing relationship, they're upgrading to the latest mobile computing solution, which will enable them to more effectively handle increased parcel volumes and a broad range of use cases. It's another proof point of successful collaboration with post and parcel services around the globe, including our current business with the United States Postal Service. We're also helping a large North American steel manufacturer to optimize and digitize its operations. This customer is adding more than 1,000 of our ET56 tablets to their operations, which will allow them to eliminate manual paper processes by implementing electronic proof of delivery to automate and expedite the invoicing process.\nMichael Steele: Thanks, Anders. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible.\nOperator: We'll now begin the question-and-answer session.  Your first question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDamian Karas: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nAnders Gustafsson: Good morning.\nDamian Karas: So I just wanted to ask you a little bit about the component shortages, obviously still we're able to drive some pretty strong growth in the second quarter and expecting to see that in the third quarter as well. But would you be able to quantify how much of a drag if any of the component shortages are on your sales this year?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, I'll start and then I'll have Nathan to also help out here. So the first - I'll start on the kind of industry wide semiconductor shortages. They've been very well documented by the press, obviously over the last few months, and we're impacted. So the impact though is not uniform across all components, some components are impacted much more than others. But it's much larger number of components that we can have working that we would do in a normal quarter. But I'd say our team is doing a great job in working all angles to optimize our allocations. And there's been great collaboration between our sustaining engineering groups to ensure we can qualify new alternative components that have less lead time. So to ensure, we get as much available product to provide to our customers as we can. We did raise prices here recently to mitigate some of the impact of the increased component costs. And so despite these shortages, and the price increases that we have increased, we're quite confident in the increased full-year outlook that we announced today.\nNathan Winters: And Damian, just to answer the question on the Q3 and full-year guide, the risk associated with the shortages have been incorporated in our outlook, but it'd be really tough to quantify, I think it will be really constructive to speculate on what that number could be unconstrained.\nDamian Karas: Okay, that's really helpful. And then wanted to ask you a little bit about the frayed headwinds. I mean, second quarter despite having those I think you were able to outperform on the margin front. So just curious, why we shouldn't - but you're expecting a pretty abrupt drop here 300 basis points in the second half. Why would - shouldn't we expect you to kind of be able to manage those as we're in the second quarter. And I guess additionally in - should we be thinking that next year, you will be able to kind of completely reverse these premium freight expenses?\nAnders Gustafsson: So, maybe if you take us to back on just where we're seeing the bottlenecks, because there's really three different areas in terms of - and the incremental costs. One, which we've seen earlier in the year we've talked about in our previous calls around the lower international commercial air travel, container shortages, port congestions around the supply side of it, that's where we're seeing our air and ocean rates 2 to 3x since the start of the pandemic. And those really have not come down over the last several months. If anything's oceans gone up, air rates have stabilized. In addition, because of the global supply constraints along with increased global demand, we're now expediting component parts from our Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturing partners. Along with shipping a higher percentage of printing perspective - in particular via air versus ocean. And so those are also really driving the step change in terms of the transitory cost from Q2 into the second half. In addition, you have the manufacturing shutdowns in parts of Southeast Asia, and particularly for us, Vietnam and Malaysia due to COVID that have further constraint supply. So as we see today, you're expecting the impacts to persist at least through the end of the year. It's hard to say when those will abate into next year. But again, the team is doing a great job of managing the impacts with our customers really through extraordinary actions and communicating the lead times. So as you look at our second half guide, I think there's two things to think of. One is the step change increase in terms of the incremental cost. And in Q2, we also had $12 million of China tariff recovery that we don't expect to repeat in the second half that was an offset in the second quarter.\nDamian Karas: Understood. Thank you very much for the insight. Good luck.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes.\nTommy Moll: Anders you've talked about a robust backlog and pipeline. Any comments you could give to augment there would be helpful. Do you have any sense of whether the momentum is sustainable through the year-end and even in the next year? And any comments you could give us on channel inventory levels as best you understand them would be appreciated as well? Thanks.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. I will start here. And then I'll ask Joe, he'll also provide some color. And you're first may be we obviously very excited about and pleased with the performance we had in the second quarter. We exceeded the high end of the guidance range here. To the previous question, the extraordinary collaboration between our supply chain and sales teams to satisfy a very strong demand in a supply constrained environment. The strong secular trends that have been supporting our business for a long time, they have accelerated through COVID. And we don't see any abatement in those trends they're continuing to build. I'd say our customers across pretty much all our vertical markets are prioritizing how digitizing and automating their workflows. I think omnichannel is probably the best example. In retail of - the retail vertical or most retailers investing meaningfully in building out their omnichannel capabilities and digitizing their operations that way. We did see double-digit growth in all regions, as well as across all our product and solutions categories as well as across our main four main vertical markets. We did see our small and medium sized customers do particularly well. So the growth we saw here was definitely part - too large to be driven by our small, medium sized customers. And that was partly I think a result of pent up demand. But we see that largely being behind us at this stage. But even our large strategic accounts performed very well with strong growth. And based on this performance, I do expect that we will continue to take share in the market. Our inventories are healthy in the channel today, but it may be at the lower end of our expected ranges. Joe.\nJoachim Heel: I think that's fair. I mean on the inventory side, we're working hard with our distribution partners to keep our inventory at the levels that we need to sustain the demand. But at the same time to serve every possible demand, which is at the moment as you can tell very, very strong. And we're trying to serve all of the demand we can, and taking our inventory to the lower end of - what we consider our healthy range. When it comes to the backlog in the pipeline. It is very strong as you're seeing, and what I can underscore when Anders was saying this, pandemic has definitely triggered a wave of digitization and automation in our customers that is leading to projects and demand that we did not see before the pandemic. So that is a sustained driver of momentum that we see. And we also were enjoying because customers are aware of the supply shortages. We're enjoying good pipeline visibility, our customers are working with us to give us that visibility far in advance. And that gives us confidence for continued growth into the next year.\nTommy Moll: Thank you both. Those are helpful answers. Anders, I wanted to follow-up with a question on Adaptive Vision and your entry into the Fixed Industrial Scanning and Machine Vision markets. A couple part question here does it any context you could give us around any prior relationship you had with Adaptive Vision or how you came to know the asset. Anything you can do to frame the size of the market opportunity where you think you've got a good shot at competing? And then what advantages you bring in those markets they're adjacent to the markets where you currently play and have substantial share, but what advantages do you bring in these new markets? Thanks.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, I'll try to summarize this here. But firstly, we're excited about the - our entry into the Fixed Industrial Scanning and Machine Vision market. These are solutions that really accelerate our enterprise as an intelligence vision. This is more on the sense side of the sense analyze act framework, but it helps us to provide some new ways of capturing data that we can then analyze and enable our customers to act on. This is a very attractive market we see, but it's quite fragmented. It's a multi-billion dollar market that our new portfolio then can address. Although we're not addressing the entire market on day one, but we're continuing to invest in it to add functionality, to add capabilities so we can go after bigger and bigger part of the market and be ready for folks in initially mostly on the text industrial scanning market. Our value proposition we believe is very strong and their focus is on ease of use of these types of solutions as well as the ability to upgrade cameras and devices in the field. So those are we believe two strong differentiators that we have. The Adaptive Vision is a great way for us to augment the cameras that we had and the software we had developed. It's a way for our customers to more easily be able to develop and build and implement applications for how to basically engage in Machine Vision or Fixed Industrial Scanning or incorporating Machine Vision and Fixed Industrial Scanning into their workflows. And we've been familiar with Adaptive Vision for some time and we've been looking at ways to augment our own internal software development in that area to make sure we can come up with a really strong offering and we felt that Adaptive Vision had a very attractive solution, very strong solution and there was a nice fit with Zebra.\nTommy Moll: Thanks, Anders. I'll turn it back.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the additional color on some of the costs issue that you're incurring in terms of freight and components. I wonder if you could spend a few moments talking about OpEx, both sales and marketing. G&A up by a healthy amount sequentially, admittedly with those significantly higher sales, but I'm just wondering how we might be thinking about OpEx in the second half of the year. And I have a follow-up Anders, for you on some of the acquisitions?\nNathan Winters: So I think from an OpEx perspective, if you look year-on-year, there's a couple major drivers in terms of the overall increase that really impact every quarter. The first was last year, we took some actions mid-year around salary reductions in the peak of the pandemic to help offset the impact as well as lower incentive comp, as we're obviously below our plans and targets for the year. So those two alone drive a significant increase year-on-year along with a full-year of Reflexis in the P&L and starting to again, invest particularly in R&D and go-to-market with some of the discretionary costs increases. So if you look for the second half of the year, I'd say the ramp in the first half will continue. But I wouldn't expect to see a real step change increase from where we saw spending in the second quarter. But again, the year-on-year increases are all pretty consistent for each quarter.\nJim Ricchiuti: Thanks, Nathan. Anders, you talk about the acquisitions, both Adaptive and Fetch, you talked about I think is being a fragmented market. And I'm wondering to what extent might we see you in addition to internal development of these technologies look at potential additional M&A to expand your footprint?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, it's obviously hard for me to comment on specific opportunities here. But we're excited about both of these markets, the Fixed Industrial Scanning, and Autonomous Mobile Robot markets. And we have had long standing organic development activities that we now have augmented by the acquisitions of Fetch and Adaptive. But I'd say first, more generally about M&A first we're very excited about our business and the outlook for our business and we do see M&A as a vector for growth. I think the Adaptive Vision or the Fetch Robotics acquisitions are, we're excited about them, we think that we can deliver good growth and good returns on those. But we do look at all M&A opportunities as a way for us to accelerate and advance our EI Vision. We're targeting selective bolt-on acquisitions that also have high growth. Look at around, what I talked earlier about the customers need an interest in digitizing and automating a number of workflows across all of their supply chains. So that provides good opportunities for us to continue to add to our capabilities. And so we do look at M&A as a way for us to accelerate that growth. And we have a strong balance sheet that can support M&A activities also.\nJim Ricchiuti: And your pipeline for M&A?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, we obviously have a team that looks at the scans kind of the market broadly around our target areas where we have particular interest. There is a - we have a good healthy pipeline over opportunities. You never know what will work out, where we'll come to terms or not, but we do have a healthy pipeline of opportunities.\nJim Ricchiuti: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Chung with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPaul Chung: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So, just another follow-up on Machine Vision fixed industrial scanner. So, how large is this business today and will the solution eventually kind of be led with software similar to your peers kind of resulting in very accretive margins, what is the strategy to kind of take share from larger players in the industry, maybe competitive pricing and then another on M&A in general, very strong free cash flow, high quality earnings provides you kind of a nice cushion for broader opportunities. Should we expect kind of continued preference for software solutions over time and resulting kind of higher margins longer-term?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, I'll start and I will also ask Joe to comment on this here. But I think your first question was around the Fixed Industrial Scanning Machine Vision market. We believe it's a very attractive market, it's near adjacency to what we do. And it's a quite a fragmented market, if you looked at the market share table there, there's one or two players that have resource share, but then it's a long tail of smaller players, we're entering the market primarily through our or initially with our Fixed Industrial Scanning portfolio, which is the closest to our core competencies and the use cases where we have a very strong right to play. But we are adding both, say on the capabilities both on the hardware side, on the camera side, but primarily here on the software side to be able to then address a larger part of that market. Software is a big differentiator in all our devices, right, if you look at mobile computing, print and scan, the majority of our engineers, a huge part of the differentiation in the value add comes from the software. And we certainly expect that to be the case here also. So we're investing in building more of that software capability, that division was in inorganic way to accelerate some of that, but we also do that organically. We should also not underestimate or minimize the importance of the investments we're making in the go-to-market. I mentioned earlier, I think that we're putting in specialized to track in our PartnerConnect Reseller program to specifically address recruiting Fixed Industrial Scanning and Machine Vision partners to help accelerate that growth. Maybe Joe, you can expand on that a bit?\nJoachim Heel: Yes, exactly. I was going to comment specifically on your question about what's our strategy to take share. So you know that we have the Fixed Industrial Scanning and the Machine Vision parts of - Fixed Industrial Scanning is a natural extension of the leadership that we have in the scanning part of the market. And we're of course translating that technically, to succeed in the Machine Vision part, that's where the software piece is essential. And the acquisition of Adaptive now gives us industry leading software capability. So we fully expect to translate that into share gains. But there's more to it than that, we specifically want to use the software to enhance that ease of use value proposition that's critical to these customers, how easy is it to use and to deploy and that's also important for the second part of the strategy to win which is using partners as a way to compete in this market. All of these solutions are deployed through partners. For us, we're a very partner centric company, as you know. And that is also what we're going to use to compete and win in the Machine Vision space and making our software easy to use is a value proposition not just to the end-users, but to those partners specifically. So hopefully that's helpful.\nPaul Chung: Yes, very much and lastly on Fetch Robotics, I know it's early days, but if you could talk about how you see this business ramping, how material revenues can be over time, kind of from a small base, the margin outlook, competitive environment, all that good stuff, some key customers, you hope to get, some cross selling opportunities. And if you could expand on kind of use cases beyond warehouses and fulfillment centers? Thank you.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, that's a broad question, it can take a while to answer all of it. So I tried to give you a high level response here. But first, we haven't closed on the acquisition yet. But we are certainly excited about it. We have worked with Fetch as a venture investment for quite some time. So we believe we understand the market, we understand the team and we see great opportunities to leverage the Fetch's broad portfolio of AMRs. They have the broadest portfolio of Autonomous Mobile Robots in the industry. And they have a very, very strong, very capable Cloud based software platform for how to deploy and manage these robots, then you'll see that, we've been more focused on technology enabled the workers in warehouses and by combining those two to be able to control and optimize both the flow of robots and the workers. We think we can offer a superior ROI to customers in manufacturing, in warehouses and a number of these use cases. Fetch has, say, initially been mostly focused on the  markets. So more movement of goods. But we see there's a number of other use cases that are also growing fast where they have that solutions that are very well suited to pursue those also. And here's another area where I think our strength that we have in our go-to-market organization, I'll ask Joe to comment on this also, will augment as well, we know virtually all of these large customers in transportation logistics, in manufacturing, retail in whatever industry or vertical we're going after. And we can help I think with providing those introductions and position our broader automation workflow solutions with those customers.\nJoachim Heel: Yes, a particular attribute of the market that we're focusing on is that we're targeting those areas where humans and robots work together. And so the notion of a Cobot, right, that collaboration between the two is at the heart of the strategy. So that means we're targeting use cases like person to goods picking, and conveyance. And those use cases allow us to take advantage of a broad installed base we already have, or workers in warehouses have mobile computers, and they're now being augmented by robots. So this means that we can take advantage of the orchestration between the two. And there's really no one else in the market that can do that to the extent that we can. And as a result, we're taking this strong platform capability that that Fetch has with robots that can go across a broader range of use cases than anyone else, and can deliver products with safety and speed that no one else can, and combining it with the orchestration of humans to achieve overall productivity improvements that are unequaled and that's really the strategy.\nPaul Chung: Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. On the price increases, you guys noted, can you just give us a sense of the degree or how broad they were and how much like, are you expecting those prices increases to be transitory. So the channel may hold less inventory in the near-term, just how you see that interaction and just maybe a second question, just getting a sense of the Postal Service concentration this year, the USPS deal, so it's expected to be primarily Q2, Q3 of this year. Thanks.\nAnders Gustafsson: I'll start and then I'll ask Nathan to comment here also, but first on the price increases, pricing is obviously something that is very important to us and something we continue to assess and address. We do regular checks to make sure that our solutions are priced competitively to the end users as well as our partner community have the right profitability, part of our overall go-to-market activities here. The competitive actions or competitive positioning is obviously a key part of how we assess pricing here. And we believe that the price increases that we have now announced are appropriate, they respond to some of the competitors who have also announced price increases but everybody hasn't. So we believe that we have kind of assessed this based on a very granular based on products and geographies to make sure that we don't put ourselves any competitive risk with these. We see the cost as being transitory, and we want to play this kind of a long-term game here, though of making sure we maximize the value of the corporation longer-term, we don't want to cede market share in the short-term for that either.\nNathan Winters: And then from USPS perspective, the rollout is progressing as expected, and as we communicated earlier in the year, this is for the current rollout of the full EMC solution of 300,000 units to the carriers and with the goal of completing largely completing here at the end of the third quarter.\nMeta Marshall: Great. I mean just coming back to project, which is like is there just a range we should think of kind of on the - just on the top line of what that impact is across the portfolio or is that just too difficult to assess kind of at this point?\nNathan Winters: I'll take that, we just rolled the price increases out last week. I would say from a full-year perspective, it's within the margins from the full-year revenue.\nMeta Marshall: Okay, great.\nAnders Gustafsson: On the rollout price increases, there's a lag time between us announcing and being effective in the market. So you can see this will be impacting our Q4 business rather than Q3.\nMeta Marshall: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, guys and congratulations on a great quarter. Just looking at the cost of goods sold here and the transport costs at being the premium freight cost. Is there anything in the adjusted EBITDA margin guidance and thought process as suggested some of the impact will be perhaps longer-term, for example, increased labor costs or anything else in there that again will perhaps go on beyond the rest of this year?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, Keith the way into two buckets. If you look at the labor costs, or the raw material costs increases, that's what the price increases we've taken is meant to largely offset that. So if we think about from a mitigation of the inflationary prices, I think that's as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year, those would be largely mitigated with the price actions we've taken. And the logistical bottlenecks are the one that from the timing, I think, is still to be played out. Again, I think we expect but no changes between now and the end of the year. But really, we're taking kind of one quarter at a time and reacting accordingly to optimize and maximize profitability as best we can.\nKeith Housum: Okay, fair enough.\nNathan Winters: Maybe just build on that a little bit. So the logistics and the semiconductor component cost, we consider those to be transitory. On the labor side, there's always some upward movement in labor rates. But if you think of the amount of labor that goes into our cost of goods sold, it's very small. So that is not, it's single digits, I think high single digits, part of our value-add is from labor. So it's not something that meaningfully changes the P&L.\nKeith Housum: Got it, got it. And looking at your full-year guidance, Anders, historically you guys have always had a very strong fourth quarter sequentially big up tick from the second and third quarter, is the guidance you're providing here suggests perhaps even roughly a flat fourth quarter. So is there the thought process that the business has kind of pulled ahead during the year or how are you thinking about the fourth quarter, any potential upside to that?\nAnders Gustafsson: Well, I think the fourth quarter, the implied guide for the fourth quarter that we had in our full-year number here which certainly would indicate this growth, not as strong growth as we've had in the first half or - we guided for Q3. But Q4 was a very strong quarter last year. So there was - we saw great recovery in the fourth quarter. But we do see continued strong demand from our customers, the momentum is very strong, we don't see that abating. This is more of a tougher compare than anything, Nathan you want to go or add anything to that?\nNathan Winters: Yes, I think from a sequential standpoint, Keith the terms of the typical update from Q3 to Q4, I don't think it reflects anything from a weakness in the fourth quarter as much as just strength we're seeing here in the third quarter. And as we've noted earlier, when you look at our days on hand inventory and the strength, I wouldn't say sales pull-ins are not a major factor. It's really just that acceleration of investment from our customer base. And if anything, where we're getting the visibility is in the backlog and funnel, as Joe mentioned in terms of giving us confidence in the full-year, particularly the fourth quarter guidance.\nKeith Housum: Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning, guys.\nAnders Gustafsson: Good morning.\nAndrew Buscaglia: So I wanted to ask on R&D, your spending this year on track, spent about $560 million or so. And I'm wondering how much of this or last call 12 months is related to this Vision and AMR kind of push. And then secondly, at what point could you start to really leverage that R&D line Do you need to be spending flat cost $550 million a year going forward?\nNathan Winters: First, I'd say R&D investments is a key activity for us, that is what really drives our longer-term growth. And I would say if you look back over the last several years investments we've made in in-product development, and R&D has had a great return for us. So we want to make sure that we have a portfolio of fresh solutions that offer real value to our customers that we can compete and grow the business. We look at our R&D investments across number of horizons, we can say our investments in our core that would have a very short-term return kind of the near adjacencies, which would have a little bit longer returns a couple of years to three years. And then more innovative new solutions, more of the enterprise asset intelligence type of solutions here, which we have a little longer-term payback as they're more ground up innovations. In many areas, you mentioned Fetch specifically, we developed our own robots with SmartSight before, so there certainly been a way for us to both learn the industry. But there's also attractive ways for us to leverage those investments across. So when we do make acquisitions, we see that as a great way for us to augment our own internal programs and drive us into new high growth adjacencies where we can make a difference. So that answers your question.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes, that's helpful. And if I heard correctly, you got the nice healthcare award this quarter it's like that that area is taking kind of a backseat to all excitement going on retail and e-commerce and logistics. But kind of - can you update us on healthcare in terms of, are you still seeing that narrative play out post-COVID where people are accelerating investments in automation there.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, I think across all our verticals first. I mean COVID has accelerated the secular trends that we've talked about around our all our end-markets are driving solutions that help to digitize and automate their workflows and empower frontline workers to be connected and optimally kind of utilized. Each of our primary vertical markets grew double-digits in the second quarter. And we continue to invest in expanding into each of these ones. Specifically for healthcare I'd say, we saw healthcare - our healthcare markets, they started in more acute care, but it's been moving into other areas like outpatient, remote patient care, COVID testing, vaccine distribution. So our efforts in healthcare continues to expand into new areas. It's also expanding geographically. So the win we've talked about today was in Europe. And I think the paid healthcare patients are taking a book out of their e-commerce or kind of online shopping activities. Also, they're seeking a more digital experience, which is putting some extra pressure on healthcare providers to make sure they can offer similar type of experiences for the patients. And let's say here, our purpose built devices and solutions are critical for healthcare providers not only to improve the patient journey, but also to drive greater productivity for the healthcare providers.\nJoachim Heel: Yes, I might add that. In healthcare, there's two other phenomena that will drive continued growth. One is that we know that healthcare systems depending on where in the world you are, this is in a different stage. Have pulled back on some of their spending, because they didn't have income from the elective procedures that they usually enjoyed. And as we come out of the pandemic, we see more of that income returning to for profit hospitals, and then their ability to spend on these solutions returns as well. And we've seen that, and the international growth is another big dimension. Anders mentioned the European piece, but we also see significant interest in different parts of Asia that we hadn't seen to that extent before. So they were the two more growth factors that we expect.\nAnders Gustafsson: Just one more comment on this will be. I expect the healthcare to continue to be our fastest growing vertical over the longer-term. But it's great to see that, we have this diversity in the business across our main four verticals, and some other newer ones coming up. But in Q2 here, manufacturing, which was our fastest growing vertical. Manufacturing was the one that was the hardest hit by COVID-19. And the macro was a bit tougher going into that with tariffs and other things. But the opportunity to increase automation in workflows through wearables and heads up displays and the need to track and trace work are important sourcing components at sub suppliers through assembly all the way through distribution is putting - providing great opportunities for us. So all our vertical markets performed very well, but manufacturing was actually the strongest one for us in Q2.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Thanks Anders.\nOperator: Last question is from Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead.\nRob Mason: Yes, good morning. Thanks for the question. Anders or Joe wanted to get your thoughts on how quickly you thought you could pull together the channel. The partners to be able to sell the - your Fixed Industrial Scanning Machine Vision products. And I'm curious also if you envision those being two separate channels, or both products will go through the same channel. And then also relatedly, I guess maybe what percent of your existing channel is suitable to sell those products?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, I'll start and Joe can provide some extra color here also. So, the - we have worked on our go-to-market strategy and our channel engagements. This is since we started working on the product and to solutions. So this is not something we can doing serially, this has been something we've done in parallel to a large degree. So we - you can say there's a Venn diagram of partners out there, their partners who we currently have, who are also in the Fixed Industrial Scanning Machine Vision space that we're obviously having a great - already not have a relationship with. And with EC expansion to add our Fixed Industrial Scanning and Machine Vision capabilities to their portfolio, but also recruiting new partners that are not necessarily see if our partners today, but they're strong in that space. And we've seen good interest and response rates for them, from them. And I think they have been impressed with our solutions. And they see how we can add value to them. So this is obviously a big part of what we need to do now and for the next year to ensure that we deliver the revenue growth that we are intending or planning for. But so far, I'd say that the response from the channel has been very positive.\nJoachim Heel: Yes, I appreciate that. You're asking this question, because channel is central to our go-to-market strategy, right? We're very channel centric company. And, as we were designing this go-to-market approach, this we spent a lot of time on this. First week created a dedicated track in our PartnerConnect program, which is very important to serve the needs of these particular partners. A percentage of our current partners are also Machine Vision, distributors and sellers. I would estimate that that's a small percentage. The majority of Machine Vision partners, we do need to create, we no need to recruit - I'm sorry. And we have made great progress in recruiting these partners already. We have a very strong group of partners that have already signed up to sell this force. And that's because of what we were talking about earlier, that we've designed the product with a particular value proposition geared towards partners. We wanted it to make easy for those partners to deploy and sell the solutions. We think that's critical to success. And that's essential in how we've designed the product. And so we're very pleased with both the number of partners, we've already been able to recruit. And the pipeline of additional partners that we have that that is interested in selling our products.\nRob Mason: Very good. Just one follow-up. Nathan, the China tariff recovery, it was a nice contribution in the second quarter. What's assumed in the third quarter or second half for that or the potential for that to recur?\nNathan Winters: Yes, so we have no incremental amount assumed in the second half guide. Our total claim was just over $30 million, and we've recovered $27 million to-date. So I'd say that the large majority that's left is in reconciliation. So I would expect the amount that's left to go is fairly small. And we - the timing that's a little bit unknown, just as we reconcile of those last few batches of transactions.\nRob Mason: I see. And just to clarify as well in your guide. You've assumed nothing for fetch, because it hasn't closed. But just how we should we think about the profit impact that small business are now, but assume you're planning to invest fairly heavily or aggressively and it would that being material in the second half or fourth quarter.\nNathan Winters: So it is not assumed in the guide, since we haven't closed and that's about a $10 million run rate revenue business. And I'm profitable at this time as it scales. But I think that material within the within the margins of our overall guide.\nRob Mason: Okay, very good. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Anders Gustafsson for any closing remarks.\nAnders Gustafsson: So to just to wrap up, I would like to thank our employees and partners for going above and beyond to serve our customers as they stretch to meet heightened expectations in the increasingly on-demand economy. While we are focusing on maximizing profit or growth in the business, our top priority continues to be protecting the health and well-being of our employees, partners, and customers as we recover from the pandemic. We're also looking forward to welcoming the Fetch Robotics team once we close the transaction. Thank you and have a great day everyone.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anders Gustafsson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Our team delivered exceptional second quarter results with strong performance across the business resulting in record sales and profits. For the quarter we realized adjusted net sales growth of 44% or 40% on an organic basis; an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.6%, a 530 basis points year-over-year improvement. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.57, a nearly 90% increase from the prior year and strong free cash flow. Despite ongoing industry wide supply chain challenges. Our teams successfully satisfied stronger-than-expected demand from customers both direct and through our distribution channel. Similar to Q1 we realized robust broad-based demand with double-digit sales growth across all four regions, each major product and solutions category, as well as in all of our vertical end markets. Our customers continue to digitize and automate their workflows with a sense of urgency in the increasingly on-demand global economy. We also significantly expanded profit margin across our business more than offsetting escalating global supply chain costs. We also continued our balanced approach to scaling operating expenses, while investing in initiatives to drive sustainable profitable growth. Thank you, Nathan. I'm encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business, which allows us to further increase our 2021 outlook. Slide 11 illustrates how we're working with our customers and partners to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision, by leveraging Zebra's industry leading portfolio of products, solutions, software and services, our customers can overcome some of their most complex operational challenges and transform their frontline workflows to achieve higher levels of performance. We help businesses across industries implement tailored solutions that digitize and automate their operations, enabling them to compete more effectively. With our innovative solutions, our customers associates can now anticipate and react in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, prescriptive analytics and Machine Vision. Now turning to Slide 12. As a trusted strategic partner, businesses in a variety of end-markets turn to Zebra to help optimize end-to-end workflows. I would like to highlight several recent wins across our end-markets, which demonstrate how Zebra Solutions are improving productivity, customer service and patient care. Large European Postal Service will be deploying approximately 80,000 TC27s to their carriers. Continuing a long standing relationship, they're upgrading to the latest mobile computing solution, which will enable them to more effectively handle increased parcel volumes and a broad range of use cases. It's another proof point of successful collaboration with post and parcel services around the globe, including our current business with the United States Postal Service. We're also helping a large North American steel manufacturer to optimize and digitize its operations. This customer is adding more than 1,000 of our ET56 tablets to their operations, which will allow them to eliminate manual paper processes by implementing electronic proof of delivery to automate and expedite the invoicing process. Good morning. Yes, I'll start and then I'll have Nathan to also help out here. So the first - I'll start on the kind of industry wide semiconductor shortages. They've been very well documented by the press, obviously over the last few months, and we're impacted. So the impact though is not uniform across all components, some components are impacted much more than others. But it's much larger number of components that we can have working that we would do in a normal quarter. But I'd say our team is doing a great job in working all angles to optimize our allocations. And there's been great collaboration between our sustaining engineering groups to ensure we can qualify new alternative components that have less lead time. So to ensure, we get as much available product to provide to our customers as we can. We did raise prices here recently to mitigate some of the impact of the increased component costs. And so despite these shortages, and the price increases that we have increased, we're quite confident in the increased full-year outlook that we announced today. So, maybe if you take us to back on just where we're seeing the bottlenecks, because there's really three different areas in terms of - and the incremental costs. One, which we've seen earlier in the year we've talked about in our previous calls around the lower international commercial air travel, container shortages, port congestions around the supply side of it, that's where we're seeing our air and ocean rates 2 to 3x since the start of the pandemic. And those really have not come down over the last several months. If anything's oceans gone up, air rates have stabilized. In addition, because of the global supply constraints along with increased global demand, we're now expediting component parts from our Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturing partners. Along with shipping a higher percentage of printing perspective - in particular via air versus ocean. And so those are also really driving the step change in terms of the transitory cost from Q2 into the second half. In addition, you have the manufacturing shutdowns in parts of Southeast Asia, and particularly for us, Vietnam and Malaysia due to COVID that have further constraint supply. So as we see today, you're expecting the impacts to persist at least through the end of the year. It's hard to say when those will abate into next year. But again, the team is doing a great job of managing the impacts with our customers really through extraordinary actions and communicating the lead times. So as you look at our second half guide, I think there's two things to think of. One is the step change increase in terms of the incremental cost. And in Q2, we also had $12 million of China tariff recovery that we don't expect to repeat in the second half that was an offset in the second quarter. Thank you. Yes. Yes. I will start here. And then I'll ask Joe, he'll also provide some color. And you're first may be we obviously very excited about and pleased with the performance we had in the second quarter. We exceeded the high end of the guidance range here. To the previous question, the extraordinary collaboration between our supply chain and sales teams to satisfy a very strong demand in a supply constrained environment. The strong secular trends that have been supporting our business for a long time, they have accelerated through COVID. And we don't see any abatement in those trends they're continuing to build. I'd say our customers across pretty much all our vertical markets are prioritizing how digitizing and automating their workflows. I think omnichannel is probably the best example. In retail of - the retail vertical or most retailers investing meaningfully in building out their omnichannel capabilities and digitizing their operations that way. We did see double-digit growth in all regions, as well as across all our product and solutions categories as well as across our main four main vertical markets. We did see our small and medium sized customers do particularly well. So the growth we saw here was definitely part - too large to be driven by our small, medium sized customers. And that was partly I think a result of pent up demand. But we see that largely being behind us at this stage. But even our large strategic accounts performed very well with strong growth. And based on this performance, I do expect that we will continue to take share in the market. Our inventories are healthy in the channel today, but it may be at the lower end of our expected ranges. Joe. Yes, I'll try to summarize this here. But firstly, we're excited about the - our entry into the Fixed Industrial Scanning and Machine Vision market. These are solutions that really accelerate our enterprise as an intelligence vision. This is more on the sense side of the sense analyze act framework, but it helps us to provide some new ways of capturing data that we can then analyze and enable our customers to act on. This is a very attractive market we see, but it's quite fragmented. It's a multi-billion dollar market that our new portfolio then can address. Although we're not addressing the entire market on day one, but we're continuing to invest in it to add functionality, to add capabilities so we can go after bigger and bigger part of the market and be ready for folks in initially mostly on the text industrial scanning market. Our value proposition we believe is very strong and their focus is on ease of use of these types of solutions as well as the ability to upgrade cameras and devices in the field. So those are we believe two strong differentiators that we have. The Adaptive Vision is a great way for us to augment the cameras that we had and the software we had developed. It's a way for our customers to more easily be able to develop and build and implement applications for how to basically engage in Machine Vision or Fixed Industrial Scanning or incorporating Machine Vision and Fixed Industrial Scanning into their workflows. And we've been familiar with Adaptive Vision for some time and we've been looking at ways to augment our own internal software development in that area to make sure we can come up with a really strong offering and we felt that Adaptive Vision had a very attractive solution, very strong solution and there was a nice fit with Zebra. Yes, it's obviously hard for me to comment on specific opportunities here. But we're excited about both of these markets, the Fixed Industrial Scanning, and Autonomous Mobile Robot markets. And we have had long standing organic development activities that we now have augmented by the acquisitions of Fetch and Adaptive. But I'd say first, more generally about M&A first we're very excited about our business and the outlook for our business and we do see M&A as a vector for growth. I think the Adaptive Vision or the Fetch Robotics acquisitions are, we're excited about them, we think that we can deliver good growth and good returns on those. But we do look at all M&A opportunities as a way for us to accelerate and advance our EI Vision. We're targeting selective bolt-on acquisitions that also have high growth. Look at around, what I talked earlier about the customers need an interest in digitizing and automating a number of workflows across all of their supply chains. So that provides good opportunities for us to continue to add to our capabilities. And so we do look at M&A as a way for us to accelerate that growth. And we have a strong balance sheet that can support M&A activities also. Yes, we obviously have a team that looks at the scans kind of the market broadly around our target areas where we have particular interest. There is a - we have a good healthy pipeline over opportunities. You never know what will work out, where we'll come to terms or not, but we do have a healthy pipeline of opportunities. Yes, I'll start and I will also ask Joe to comment on this here. But I think your first question was around the Fixed Industrial Scanning Machine Vision market. We believe it's a very attractive market, it's near adjacency to what we do. And it's a quite a fragmented market, if you looked at the market share table there, there's one or two players that have resource share, but then it's a long tail of smaller players, we're entering the market primarily through our or initially with our Fixed Industrial Scanning portfolio, which is the closest to our core competencies and the use cases where we have a very strong right to play. But we are adding both, say on the capabilities both on the hardware side, on the camera side, but primarily here on the software side to be able to then address a larger part of that market. Software is a big differentiator in all our devices, right, if you look at mobile computing, print and scan, the majority of our engineers, a huge part of the differentiation in the value add comes from the software. And we certainly expect that to be the case here also. So we're investing in building more of that software capability, that division was in inorganic way to accelerate some of that, but we also do that organically. We should also not underestimate or minimize the importance of the investments we're making in the go-to-market. I mentioned earlier, I think that we're putting in specialized to track in our PartnerConnect Reseller program to specifically address recruiting Fixed Industrial Scanning and Machine Vision partners to help accelerate that growth. Maybe Joe, you can expand on that a bit? Yes, that's a broad question, it can take a while to answer all of it. So I tried to give you a high level response here. But first, we haven't closed on the acquisition yet. But we are certainly excited about it. We have worked with Fetch as a venture investment for quite some time. So we believe we understand the market, we understand the team and we see great opportunities to leverage the Fetch's broad portfolio of AMRs. They have the broadest portfolio of Autonomous Mobile Robots in the industry. And they have a very, very strong, very capable Cloud based software platform for how to deploy and manage these robots, then you'll see that, we've been more focused on technology enabled the workers in warehouses and by combining those two to be able to control and optimize both the flow of robots and the workers. We think we can offer a superior ROI to customers in manufacturing, in warehouses and a number of these use cases. Fetch has, say, initially been mostly focused on the  markets. So more movement of goods. But we see there's a number of other use cases that are also growing fast where they have that solutions that are very well suited to pursue those also. And here's another area where I think our strength that we have in our go-to-market organization, I'll ask Joe to comment on this also, will augment as well, we know virtually all of these large customers in transportation logistics, in manufacturing, retail in whatever industry or vertical we're going after. And we can help I think with providing those introductions and position our broader automation workflow solutions with those customers. I'll start and then I'll ask Nathan to comment here also, but first on the price increases, pricing is obviously something that is very important to us and something we continue to assess and address. We do regular checks to make sure that our solutions are priced competitively to the end users as well as our partner community have the right profitability, part of our overall go-to-market activities here. The competitive actions or competitive positioning is obviously a key part of how we assess pricing here. And we believe that the price increases that we have now announced are appropriate, they respond to some of the competitors who have also announced price increases but everybody hasn't. So we believe that we have kind of assessed this based on a very granular based on products and geographies to make sure that we don't put ourselves any competitive risk with these. We see the cost as being transitory, and we want to play this kind of a long-term game here, though of making sure we maximize the value of the corporation longer-term, we don't want to cede market share in the short-term for that either. On the rollout price increases, there's a lag time between us announcing and being effective in the market. So you can see this will be impacting our Q4 business rather than Q3. Yes, Keith the way into two buckets. If you look at the labor costs, or the raw material costs increases, that's what the price increases we've taken is meant to largely offset that. So if we think about from a mitigation of the inflationary prices, I think that's as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year, those would be largely mitigated with the price actions we've taken. And the logistical bottlenecks are the one that from the timing, I think, is still to be played out. Again, I think we expect but no changes between now and the end of the year. But really, we're taking kind of one quarter at a time and reacting accordingly to optimize and maximize profitability as best we can. Well, I think the fourth quarter, the implied guide for the fourth quarter that we had in our full-year number here which certainly would indicate this growth, not as strong growth as we've had in the first half or - we guided for Q3. But Q4 was a very strong quarter last year. So there was - we saw great recovery in the fourth quarter. But we do see continued strong demand from our customers, the momentum is very strong, we don't see that abating. This is more of a tougher compare than anything, Nathan you want to go or add anything to that? Good morning. Yes, I think across all our verticals first. I mean COVID has accelerated the secular trends that we've talked about around our all our end-markets are driving solutions that help to digitize and automate their workflows and empower frontline workers to be connected and optimally kind of utilized. Each of our primary vertical markets grew double-digits in the second quarter. And we continue to invest in expanding into each of these ones. Specifically for healthcare I'd say, we saw healthcare - our healthcare markets, they started in more acute care, but it's been moving into other areas like outpatient, remote patient care, COVID testing, vaccine distribution. So our efforts in healthcare continues to expand into new areas. It's also expanding geographically. So the win we've talked about today was in Europe. And I think the paid healthcare patients are taking a book out of their e-commerce or kind of online shopping activities. Also, they're seeking a more digital experience, which is putting some extra pressure on healthcare providers to make sure they can offer similar type of experiences for the patients. And let's say here, our purpose built devices and solutions are critical for healthcare providers not only to improve the patient journey, but also to drive greater productivity for the healthcare providers. Just one more comment on this will be. I expect the healthcare to continue to be our fastest growing vertical over the longer-term. But it's great to see that, we have this diversity in the business across our main four verticals, and some other newer ones coming up. But in Q2 here, manufacturing, which was our fastest growing vertical. Manufacturing was the one that was the hardest hit by COVID-19. And the macro was a bit tougher going into that with tariffs and other things. But the opportunity to increase automation in workflows through wearables and heads up displays and the need to track and trace work are important sourcing components at sub suppliers through assembly all the way through distribution is putting - providing great opportunities for us. So all our vertical markets performed very well, but manufacturing was actually the strongest one for us in Q2. Yes, I'll start and Joe can provide some extra color here also. So, the - we have worked on our go-to-market strategy and our channel engagements. This is since we started working on the product and to solutions. So this is not something we can doing serially, this has been something we've done in parallel to a large degree. So we - you can say there's a Venn diagram of partners out there, their partners who we currently have, who are also in the Fixed Industrial Scanning Machine Vision space that we're obviously having a great - already not have a relationship with. And with EC expansion to add our Fixed Industrial Scanning and Machine Vision capabilities to their portfolio, but also recruiting new partners that are not necessarily see if our partners today, but they're strong in that space. And we've seen good interest and response rates for them, from them. And I think they have been impressed with our solutions. And they see how we can add value to them. So this is obviously a big part of what we need to do now and for the next year to ensure that we deliver the revenue growth that we are intending or planning for. But so far, I'd say that the response from the channel has been very positive. So to just to wrap up, I would like to thank our employees and partners for going above and beyond to serve our customers as they stretch to meet heightened expectations in the increasingly on-demand economy. While we are focusing on maximizing profit or growth in the business, our top priority continues to be protecting the health and well-being of our employees, partners, and customers as we recover from the pandemic. We're also looking forward to welcoming the Fetch Robotics team once we close the transaction. Thank you and have a great day everyone."

            "name": "Nathan Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q2, adjusted net sales increased 44.4%, including the impact of currency and acquisition, and 39.8% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions from customers of all sizes. We realized particularly high growth from our run rate business through the channel partially driven by pent-up demand, while continuing to see strong growth in direct sales to large customers. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment, including printing and supplies grew 51.2%, while Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 35.1% driven by exceptional growth across all major categories, including enterprise mobile computing and data capture. Note that we also realized double-digit growth in services and software along with very strong growth in our RFID solutions, for which deployment activity has snapped back as this customers recover from the pandemic. We recognized double-digit growth in all regions. In North America, sales increased 39% with all major categories growing double-digits. In EMEA, sales increased 44% with solid growth across sub regions and solutions offerings. APAC again realized strong growth with sales up 20% led by strength in China, Australia, India and Japan. Latin America also continue its recovery with exceptionally strong growth in all sub regions with sales increasing 79%. Adjusted gross margin expanded 390 basis points to 48%, primarily driven by favorable business mix, a $12 million recovery of Chinese import tariffs, higher support service margins, and contribution from our recent high margin acquisitions. These benefits were partially offset by higher premium freight charges, which we'll discuss further in a moment. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 180 basis points. We continue to scale OpEx, while prioritizing high return investments in the business. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.6% a 530 basis point improvement from the prior year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.57, a $2.16 or 89.6% year-over-year increase. EPS growth also benefited from lower interest expense, partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $514 million of free cash flow in the first half of 2021. This was a $192 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. In Q2, we acquired Adaptive Vision for $18 million to advance our Machine Vision solutions and made $4 million of venture investments. And Damian, just to answer the question on the Q3 and full-year guide, the risk associated with the shortages have been incorporated in our outlook, but it'd be really tough to quantify, I think it will be really constructive to speculate on what that number could be unconstrained. So I think from an OpEx perspective, if you look year-on-year, there's a couple major drivers in terms of the overall increase that really impact every quarter. The first was last year, we took some actions mid-year around salary reductions in the peak of the pandemic to help offset the impact as well as lower incentive comp, as we're obviously below our plans and targets for the year. So those two alone drive a significant increase year-on-year along with a full-year of Reflexis in the P&L and starting to again, invest particularly in R&D and go-to-market with some of the discretionary costs increases. So if you look for the second half of the year, I'd say the ramp in the first half will continue. But I wouldn't expect to see a real step change increase from where we saw spending in the second quarter. But again, the year-on-year increases are all pretty consistent for each quarter. And then from USPS perspective, the rollout is progressing as expected, and as we communicated earlier in the year, this is for the current rollout of the full EMC solution of 300,000 units to the carriers and with the goal of completing largely completing here at the end of the third quarter. I'll take that, we just rolled the price increases out last week. I would say from a full-year perspective, it's within the margins from the full-year revenue. Maybe just build on that a little bit. So the logistics and the semiconductor component cost, we consider those to be transitory. On the labor side, there's always some upward movement in labor rates. But if you think of the amount of labor that goes into our cost of goods sold, it's very small. So that is not, it's single digits, I think high single digits, part of our value-add is from labor. So it's not something that meaningfully changes the P&L. Yes, I think from a sequential standpoint, Keith the terms of the typical update from Q3 to Q4, I don't think it reflects anything from a weakness in the fourth quarter as much as just strength we're seeing here in the third quarter. And as we've noted earlier, when you look at our days on hand inventory and the strength, I wouldn't say sales pull-ins are not a major factor. It's really just that acceleration of investment from our customer base. And if anything, where we're getting the visibility is in the backlog and funnel, as Joe mentioned in terms of giving us confidence in the full-year, particularly the fourth quarter guidance. First, I'd say R&D investments is a key activity for us, that is what really drives our longer-term growth. And I would say if you look back over the last several years investments we've made in in-product development, and R&D has had a great return for us. So we want to make sure that we have a portfolio of fresh solutions that offer real value to our customers that we can compete and grow the business. We look at our R&D investments across number of horizons, we can say our investments in our core that would have a very short-term return kind of the near adjacencies, which would have a little bit longer returns a couple of years to three years. And then more innovative new solutions, more of the enterprise asset intelligence type of solutions here, which we have a little longer-term payback as they're more ground up innovations. In many areas, you mentioned Fetch specifically, we developed our own robots with SmartSight before, so there certainly been a way for us to both learn the industry. But there's also attractive ways for us to leverage those investments across. So when we do make acquisitions, we see that as a great way for us to augment our own internal programs and drive us into new high growth adjacencies where we can make a difference. So that answers your question. Yes, so we have no incremental amount assumed in the second half guide. Our total claim was just over $30 million, and we've recovered $27 million to-date. So I'd say that the large majority that's left is in reconciliation. So I would expect the amount that's left to go is fairly small. And we - the timing that's a little bit unknown, just as we reconcile of those last few batches of transactions. So it is not assumed in the guide, since we haven't closed and that's about a $10 million run rate revenue business. And I'm profitable at this time as it scales. But I think that material within the within the margins of our overall guide."

            "name": "Joachim Heel",
            "content": "I think that's fair. I mean on the inventory side, we're working hard with our distribution partners to keep our inventory at the levels that we need to sustain the demand. But at the same time to serve every possible demand, which is at the moment as you can tell very, very strong. And we're trying to serve all of the demand we can, and taking our inventory to the lower end of - what we consider our healthy range. When it comes to the backlog in the pipeline. It is very strong as you're seeing, and what I can underscore when Anders was saying this, pandemic has definitely triggered a wave of digitization and automation in our customers that is leading to projects and demand that we did not see before the pandemic. So that is a sustained driver of momentum that we see. And we also were enjoying because customers are aware of the supply shortages. We're enjoying good pipeline visibility, our customers are working with us to give us that visibility far in advance. And that gives us confidence for continued growth into the next year. Yes, exactly. I was going to comment specifically on your question about what's our strategy to take share. So you know that we have the Fixed Industrial Scanning and the Machine Vision parts of - Fixed Industrial Scanning is a natural extension of the leadership that we have in the scanning part of the market. And we're of course translating that technically, to succeed in the Machine Vision part, that's where the software piece is essential. And the acquisition of Adaptive now gives us industry leading software capability. So we fully expect to translate that into share gains. But there's more to it than that, we specifically want to use the software to enhance that ease of use value proposition that's critical to these customers, how easy is it to use and to deploy and that's also important for the second part of the strategy to win which is using partners as a way to compete in this market. All of these solutions are deployed through partners. For us, we're a very partner centric company, as you know. And that is also what we're going to use to compete and win in the Machine Vision space and making our software easy to use is a value proposition not just to the end-users, but to those partners specifically. So hopefully that's helpful. Yes, a particular attribute of the market that we're focusing on is that we're targeting those areas where humans and robots work together. And so the notion of a Cobot, right, that collaboration between the two is at the heart of the strategy. So that means we're targeting use cases like person to goods picking, and conveyance. And those use cases allow us to take advantage of a broad installed base we already have, or workers in warehouses have mobile computers, and they're now being augmented by robots. So this means that we can take advantage of the orchestration between the two. And there's really no one else in the market that can do that to the extent that we can. And as a result, we're taking this strong platform capability that that Fetch has with robots that can go across a broader range of use cases than anyone else, and can deliver products with safety and speed that no one else can, and combining it with the orchestration of humans to achieve overall productivity improvements that are unequaled and that's really the strategy. Yes, I might add that. In healthcare, there's two other phenomena that will drive continued growth. One is that we know that healthcare systems depending on where in the world you are, this is in a different stage. Have pulled back on some of their spending, because they didn't have income from the elective procedures that they usually enjoyed. And as we come out of the pandemic, we see more of that income returning to for profit hospitals, and then their ability to spend on these solutions returns as well. And we've seen that, and the international growth is another big dimension. Anders mentioned the European piece, but we also see significant interest in different parts of Asia that we hadn't seen to that extent before. So they were the two more growth factors that we expect. Yes, I appreciate that. You're asking this question, because channel is central to our go-to-market strategy, right? We're very channel centric company. And, as we were designing this go-to-market approach, this we spent a lot of time on this. First week created a dedicated track in our PartnerConnect program, which is very important to serve the needs of these particular partners. A percentage of our current partners are also Machine Vision, distributors and sellers. I would estimate that that's a small percentage. The majority of Machine Vision partners, we do need to create, we no need to recruit - I'm sorry. And we have made great progress in recruiting these partners already. We have a very strong group of partners that have already signed up to sell this force. And that's because of what we were talking about earlier, that we've designed the product with a particular value proposition geared towards partners. We wanted it to make easy for those partners to deploy and sell the solutions. We think that's critical to success. And that's essential in how we've designed the product. And so we're very pleased with both the number of partners, we've already been able to recruit. And the pipeline of additional partners that we have that that is interested in selling our products."

Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Steele: Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's first quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our team delivered exceptional first quarter results, with strong performance across the business, resulting in record sales and profits. For the quarter, we realized; adjusted net sales growth of 28% or 25% on an organic basis; and adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.3%, a 620 basis point year-over-year improvement; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.79, a 79% increase from the prior year, and strong free cash flow. Our teams executed well to satisfy a stronger-than-expected recovery in demand from smaller customers through our distribution channel, and continued strong demand from large customers to digitize and automate their workflows in an increasingly on-demand economy. We realized strong broad-based demand with double-digit sales growth across our four regions, each major product and solutions category, as well as in all of our vertical end markets. We also significantly expanded profit margins, driven by favorable business mix and lower travel expenses, while at the same time, we continued to invest in initiatives to drive sustainable profitable growth. Given our momentum and pace of innovation, we are increasingly confident in our growth prospects.\nNathan Winters: Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q1, adjusted net sales increased 28.3%, including the impact of currency and the Reflexis acquisition, and 25% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions. Direct sales to large customers grew double-digits, and we saw even higher growth from smaller customers through the channel, partially driven by pent-up demand. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment, including printing and supplies grew 21.4%, while Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 26.8%, driven by exceptional growth in enterprise mobile computing. We realized strong double-digit growth in services and software. And also had strong growth in our RFID solutions, which is beginning to rebound from the depths of the pandemic. We recognized double-digit growth in all regions. In North America, sales increased 28%, with mobile computing, printing, services and supplies each growing double-digits. In EMEA, sales increased 22%, with solid growth across all sub regions and solutions offering. APAC returned to growth with sales up 19% led by strength in China, Australia, New Zealand and India. Latin America also returned to growth in all sub regions, with sales increasing 31%. Adjusted gross margin expanded 370 basis points to 48.9%, primarily driven by favorable business mix, and higher service and software margin. The favorable year-on-year impact from China tariffs was offset by $11 million of incremental premium freight charges. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 280 basis points. We have been accelerating high return investments in the business, while prudently managing discretionary costs. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.3%, a 620 basis point increase from the prior-year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.79, a $2.12 or 79.4% year-over-year increase. EPS growth also benefited from lower interest expense and a lower share count, partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $214 million of free cash flow in Q1. This was $119 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. In Q1, we had $13 million of venture investments in two companies that provide real-time asset visibility and artificial intelligence solutions. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended Q1 at a modest 0.9 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Nathan. I am encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business, which allows us to increase our 2021 outlook. Our team has done an outstanding job navigating us through the pandemic. Slide 10 illustrates how we are working with our customers and partners to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. By leveraging Zebra's leading portfolio of products, solutions, software, and services our customers can overcome some of their most complex operational challenges and transform their frontline workflows to achieve higher levels of performance.\nMike Steele: Thanks, Anders. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible.\nOperator:  And the first question today will come from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDamian Karas: So you had mentioned that some of the first quarter sales strength was on pent-up demand from your smaller customer base. But just thinking about the current order strength you're seeing as you progress through the second quarter, would you still characterize some of that as pent-up demand? Are we kind of past that at this point and it's really more reflective of your underlying run rate demand, if you will?\nAnders Gustafsson: Well, and first, we are very pleased with our first quarter results here and the outlook we could provide. We - the business is supported by some strong secular trends that have accelerated during the pandemic, like omnichannel and - so most companies today are very focused on automating and digitizing their businesses. And for us, that resulted in double-digit growth across all regions, across all products and solutions, as well as all verticals, so very broad-based demand for us. We did see particularly strong growth from small and medium-sized customers, and that was partly driven by pent-up demand, but it's only partly driven by pent-up demand. Yes, but - we also saw strong demand from our large customers, our larger strategic accounts. And I think another factor here was that based on our performance, I'm - I certainly expect that we continue to take share in the market. Nathan, do you want to add something?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So this time on the pent-up demand. I think one, it is an estimate, so this isn't a precise deal reconciliation. And we think it is recovering most of our 2020 miss to our original plan and guidance last year and recovering that here in the first half of the year, which is contributing low double digits, both in the first and second quarter.\nDamian Karas: Okay, that makes sense. And then, I think you spoke in the past that, sort of, later in the year is when you start seeing sort of the larger projects, if you will, larger orders. At this point, do you have some visibility there that you've kind of baked that into your guidance in the back half or should we still expect that there could be some larger projects that haven't taken hold yet?\nAnders Gustafsson: I think what we've said is, it tends to be that our visibility into the larger deals or into our pipeline overall increases with time. So the closer - the further we enter the year we get better visibility, we'll have to be through the second half and Q4. So part of what you see today is that we have gained some better visibility into both - how we expect the run rate to progress, but also on some of the larger deals. But we don't have perfect visibility, so clearly there is opportunities for deals that we don't necessarily have in our stored as high likelihood in our pipeline today. Joe, do you want to add something to this?\nJoe Heel: Yes. I would say that the large deal momentum has continued evenly throughout the year. And we have prospects for large deals in the second half, just as we did in the first half. One of the large deals that you're aware of is the USPS deal, which is of course contributing to our Q2 and Q3 as we have said.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Anders, it's sounds like compared to a quarter ago, when we talked both in terms of geography and market, it sounds like everything or nearly everything is better than expected, a quarter ago. But if you had to pinpoint maybe one geography or one end market that's improved the most, just as a driver for the raised revenue guidance, what would you point us to? And if I'm mistaken, and if there is any geography or end market that's gotten a little weaker over the last quarter that would be good to know. Although, maybe just based on your tone and comments today it sounds like there weren't any?\nAnders Gustafsson: This is a hard question today, because we have broad-based demand. I don't think we've ever had a quarter where we've had each of our four regions, each of our verticals and each of our main product categories all growing double-digits. So it's hard to pick who stand out as particularly strong or weaker. But I'll probably just highlight maybe North America as particularly strong, as being also our largest region here, we grew by 28%. So we saw very broad-based demand across basically all our portfolio, the entire portfolio. But printing supplies, mobile computing, RFID, services, software, they were all up double digits. And we had strong wins across all our vertical markets in North America. And our newest vertical, the government vertical also demonstrated good growth. And I think demonstrates the investments we've made in both product and the go-to-market for the government vertical paying off here now. On a - from a vertical perspective, maybe healthcare, just want to highlight. It's been our fastest growing vertical for some time and we expect it to continue to be the fastest growing one. It had a very nice performance in Q1. I think the transformation in healthcare is accelerating. It started off in acute care, but it's moving into other areas now, like ambulatory care, contact tracing, even remote patient care. And healthcare patients are now expecting or demanding a more digital experience and they prefer that also. And our purpose-built solutions are critical for healthcare providers to be able to improve the overall patient journey to drive - and to drive greater productivity for the healthcare providers across their operations. And some of our solutions in healthcare also used specifically, but for COVID response like drive-through testing and vaccinations, cold chain logistics and so forth.\nNathan Winters: Maybe I can add something too. If you look at the regions nominally, the one that's swung the most from last quarter was Latin America. Latin America was the one that was hardest hit in the pandemic and has rebounded the most, but it's also our smallest region. In terms of verticals, another one that is notable is manufacturing, which was hit very hard in the pandemic as well and we're seeing some good rebound in that area. I think the biggest swing that we haven't mentioned yet is one of deal size and customer size, right? So, notably our run rate and the purchases by small and medium businesses have accelerated and are catching up now to what was a big driver in past quarters of the larger customers, investing in e-commerce and digitization. We're now seeing that in the small and medium business, which of course manifest in our run rate.\nTommy Moll: Thank you, both. That's very helpful. If I could ask one follow-up. Anders, I wonder if you could update us on some of the pilots you have with retail customers, where all our or at least a lot more of the store associates are carrying one of your devices. What's the progress there? How are you making the ROI case to the potential customers? And to what extent does reflect this factor into the strategy there?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. The device for all is a big opportunity for us. We're very excited about how that's progressing. We see the theme around how most companies wants to automate and digitize their operations is playing a big role in driving this. Across every vertical, I would say, our customers are looking to put technology in the hands of more of their employees and be able to have them be connected and be able to both enter data, as well as react to data. We see the relationship with Reflexis as very synergistic. And that, if you have a mobile device you can now look at inventory stock-outs, or other information and upload that to the Reflexis task engine, which now can make smarter decisions, can prioritize the highest ROI action, and then mobilize that to the right worker at the right time by - through somebody who then is carrying a mobile device. So it's a very strong synergistic portfolio that adds basically - and the network effect it adds to the value of both device and both solutions by having both under one roof. The progression on deeper penetration is also progressing. So if you go back, 7 years, 8 years or something, our large supercenter in retail might have had seven or eight devices and today they routinely would have maybe 70 or 80, but they may have several hundred employees. And we think that having a shared device for those associates when they are in the store is big objective for, I would say, the vast majority of our customers. And that's progressing. We have some good examples of where we've provided - expanded our portfolio to provide that kind of full range of devices across the price and performance curve. And where we've combined software and devices to really enable much deeper penetration. And Joe, maybe you want to share some examples of this?\nJoe Heel: Yes. I'll give you one example of the connection of our device for all and our SaaS software. One of the largest retailers in Australia is using our EC30 devices together with Workforce Connect to enable their associates to do tasks in the store, but also communicate with one another. And that's one of the key use cases, which is - and by the way also enabled by Reflexis in the future is to have the associates be able to interact with each other, which requires that all of the associates have a device. So, I think that's a pretty good example of it.\nTommy Moll: Great. Thank you, both. We'll keep our eyes out for more progress on those fronts. But I'll turn it back for now. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will be from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: I was hoping you could talk a little bit more on gross margins in the quarter, which were obviously very strong. Can you break out what - you mentioned software and then that Reflexis or just acquisitions in general helping? Can you break out what that contributed in the quarter?\nNathan Winters: Yes, Andrew, this is Nathan. Firstly, our teams have been executing very well on what we can control. You see that through the gross margin improvement year-on-year up 370 basis points. About two-thirds of that is related to business mix, as well as volume leverage. We have especially high mix of large orders, due to the recovering small and medium business that Joe mentioned earlier. And about a third of that was from expansion of our service margins, as well as the Reflexis acquisition. And most of that coming from expansion within our service business. I think the one thing to also note, as we stated last year, we look at our underlying gross margin trends. They remained healthy throughout 2020. And we expected the overall margin and we're seeing that play out to improve as the mix has returned.\nAndrew Buscaglia: And EVM had particularly very strong gross margins, 49%, is that sort of the run rate we're looking at going forward? I know you have those freight expenses coming in. But yes, is this sort of, kind of the path you're taking? Are you - do - you think you can grow or expand margins even from that kind of elevated level, given some of this software and services integration?\nAnders Gustafsson: I think, over time, we do expect for our margins to improve. I'd say, Q1 was especially favorable due to the strong mix of small and medium-sized business. But I think as that normalizes to more of a normalized level as we move forward, we do expect EVM margins to improve over time, particularly as you mentioned with the growth and expansion of our software solutions.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. And maybe just last one. In Q2, stuff got into that guidance unless you - if you assume a pretty big ramp in SG&A? So, do we expect a step down in gross margins just in Q2, for some reason or given the freight expense?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So if you look at our Q2 EBITDA guide of 21% to 22%, it is up nearly 3 points year-on-year due to favorable business mix from 2020. Sequentially, it is down 4 points, most of that is due to lower gross margin. As we said, as deal size, I think, comes back from the exceptionally high level we are - we had here in Q1. And you also have CRS seasonality, a slight care for recovery in the first quarter all lowering gross margin sequentially. As well as we do expect higher OpEx, as we continue to accelerate investment in our new solutions both in R&D and go to market.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Just wondering if - what kind of headwinds you might be seeing or anticipating for the full year, just as it relates to what we've all been hearing about component constraints, higher raw material prices? And just along those lines, do you anticipate potentially having to take any pricing actions going forward just given the supply chain issues?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. I would first characterize the supply chain issues that we're working on in two categories. One is, logistical bottlenecks and the other one is around the industry-wide semiconductor shortages that has been in the press quite a bit lately. First on the logistical bottlenecks. That's really caused by an increase - a combination of increase in demand when combined with a reduction in commercial air traffic sort of fewer commercial airplanes, which used to cover or carry a lot of commercial freight also. Then you have - add on a little bit of container shortages and port congestion on top of that. But this has resulted in air and ocean rates on - pretty much on all our key routes, having increased by a factor of two, since the start of the pandemic. So, we are incurring premium freight cost as a result of this. And we are prioritizing customer - meeting customer expected delivery dates. So, we have been using - leveraging all modalities of freight to get our devices and products to our customers, including chartering flights from Europe - from China to Europe and the US. But this has had a negative - a negligible impact on revenues. And I'd say, our supply chain team has done an outstanding job of being able to manage this and minimize the impact on the business. They had issues around the semiconductor shortages and this impacts some of our products more than others. Our teams are - have been doing a great job of managing all angles of optimizing allocations for us. We have a history of thoughtful contingency planning, which I think is helping us here. We tend to qualify multiple components when we can and even have multiple suppliers when practical. We have seen, again, modest increases in surcharges related to sourcing these components. But despite the - both of these issues that I mentioned, we are confident in the full year sales outlook that we gave. The outlook incorporates both of these points. And lastly then on the price action you asked about. We continuously assess pricing based on the competitive environment. So, we always look at that, but there is - we have no imminent plan of addressing or having, let's say, a broader price increase to address these supply chain issues.\nJim Ricchiuti: And thank you. And the follow-up. Just on the AIT business. And I'm just wondering how - what you're seeing in the market - in the legacy - this legacy part of your business compares with previous recoveries and other economic cycles?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. We had an exceptional quarter for print. The growth rates were well above average - corporate average. We - as we saw growth across the portfolio and certainly pent-up demand had been an issue here. Smaller customers through the channel, it was recovering quite nicely. And we also over the last year or so, taking some steps to strengthen our go-to-market around our eco channel - channel ecosystem. And I think that's made us more competitive. And we've been able to accelerate some share gains. Our printing - RFID printing business was also particularly strong. And even the supplies business was doing very well. Tempt time was up double digits. So it was a very strong performance across the board. And maybe also highlight that, Joe mentioned earlier, the manufacturing was up very strongly in Q1 after having had a tougher go in 2020 and a little bit further - beyond that also it would further that out. And printing is the most exposed to manufacturing. So when manufacturing goes up that would have a disproportionate impact on our printing business.\nOperator: The next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: A quick question. Some of these smaller customers come back. What are they asking you for that may be different from - what they were asking you from before. Clearly, they still going to face some challenges in the competitive environment. Just wondering, what they're asking you for in particular? And then maybe on the healthcare opportunities. Just as you move past some of these kind of COVID boosted use cases, where are you seeing the most traction in these cases there? Thanks.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. I will start, and then, I will ask Joe to also provide some color here. So first on smaller customers and what we're seeing, what's different. I'd say two things, Meta. One is, irrespective of size, I would say, pretty much all customers across all verticals are looking to figure out how can they digitize and automate their businesses more. And they do look to our type of solutions to connect the physical world to the digital world, to really help them connect that physical workflow - those workflows into applications and automate them better. So that is a broad-based theme across basically all sizes of customers and verticals. The other point that would be - our larger customers who generally able to pivot to a COVID operating world better. They were generally seemed to be essential businesses - were deemed to be essential business, while many of our smaller customers, many of them are in manufacturing had to shut down. And now as they come back, I think they are looking to make investments that enables them to compete with some of their larger presence who have made more - who have invested earlier in those digitization and automation themes. Joe, do you want to add anything to this?\nJoe Heel: I think you said it well on the small-and-medium businesses. Clearly, the pent-up demand portion of - we're still most pronounced among the SMBs, I would say, and they're catching up more on their pent-up demand. But beyond that, it is really those small-and-medium businesses going to the next level of digital transformation, just as their larger resident have. And you get also asked about healthcare. And - on the healthcare beyond COVID 19 use cases, we're seeing an expansion, as Anders has mentioned in the prepared remarks into new areas of healthcare like ambulatory care, like remote patient care. So the use of tablets, for example, in order to enable remote patient care is a big use case. Communication, of course, is the big use case. And one that we're also seeing a lot of interest in is, asset and people tracking in hospitals, locating the right person, or locating the right asset for a particular procedure. Those are new use cases and are driving some of that accelerating demand .\nOperator: And the next question will come from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning guys, and congratulations on a great quarter, and the solid guidance. Just want to unpack the gross margin growth, again, just a little bit more? Software and services obviously had a great step up compared to in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter last year. And I understand last year's step up was due to European services improvement, something that's getting further improvement this time around. And this 47%, roughly, gross margins, is that sustainable going forward? Is this like a new normal for you?\nNathan Winters: Keith. So just - first part of your question, to the growth in both our service and software. Now again, seeing on both ends, right at the - the addition of Reflexis gross margin being higher than the company average is helping. But also from an organic basis, up nearly 7 points year-on-year from our core service business. And part of that is due to the actions we took over the last several years to improve efficiency and streamline the repair operations and the team is continuing to work that. And then the other is, now with double-digit revenue growth, I've seen that volume leverage flow through the P&L is the other big driver of the margin improvement. And we do expect that to continue to grow year-on-year as we grow the top line, as well as improve efficiency in the operations.\nKeith Housum: Great to hear it. And then, in terms of your overall growth, I understand there's multiple drivers of your revenue growth. But can you touch on perhaps the growth that's been contributed from the new products and perhaps expansion into new markets that you're perhaps, we're not doing as well in before? Just trying to dimensionalize some of the growth aspects there?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. So, when you say new products, you mean new types of solutions, or were just new products more generally?\nKeith Housum: I mean, more types of new solutions, looking for new customers, new use cases. And perhaps, your prior generation of products that did not have previously addressed.\nAnders Gustafsson: Okay. Yes. I'll start and Joe, you can provide some - year also. So I'd say, we did see RFID having a very strong quarter in Q1. RFID had a tough going last year, but that's really started in Q2. So there was - Q1 last year was more of mill, was pretty reasonable quarter. So this is a strong rebound for RFID. And we see these types of solutions which are more contactless is having a great - being in demand and see more deployment of them. I would say, also our software solutions are having great traction. The combination of the Reflexis, Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Workforce Connect provides a very differentiated value proposition for us. And each of those offerings by them - and of themselves are performing very well. But when you then combine it with as a suite and then look at the - how they interact with our mobile devices that provides a very compelling offering, which we see having great, great opportunities for us to continue to grow. And some of our other intelligent edge solutions are still probably a little slow in ramping as we've had - still have a hard - we don't have access to our customers' facilities to the extent we used to, to do pilots and proof of concepts and other types of engagements like that. But we expect that to ease up here as we get through COVID and get back into more normal way of operating with our customers. Joe?\nJoe Heel: Yes. I'll add - maybe add a couple of things that could be helpful. In terms of the mobile computing segment. We talked about the device for all. And as Andrew said, previously described, we are seeing an expansion of this. This isn't necessarily always a big game, where someone just rolls out devices to everyone. But an expansion to additional sets of people, right? That you can - now you use it for transport in a hospital, not just for nurses, for example. So that's been a big expansion. But we've also had some very innovative use cases. One of them, we recently published in the press release for a tire change, that is now using our devices to not only keep track of the tires in the inventory, but also measure the tread gap and offer a new service to a customer. That type of innovation, I think is, is going to be providing new use cases as well. And I'm also quite proud of our ability to grow the tablet segment, that we accelerated through the acquisition of Xplore some time ago and to combine with our own ET tablets, and we have some very good traction there. From a vertical perspective, two that I would call out is the government and healthcare segments. The healthcare segments have seen a good acceleration internationally. You know that we've always had a reasonably strong position in North America. But now we're seeing deals in Japan and Australia, in the U.K. that are sizable, right, where these institutions are modernizing their infrastructure globally. And government is, we've mentioned is an area, not just in the U.S., but also in other countries again, around the world that we've made substantial go-to-market investments, and we're now seeing accelerated growth. Most of the mobile computing, but also some printing opportunities with governments around the bar.\nOperator: The next question is from Richard Eastman with Baird. Please go ahead.\nRichard Eastman: Yes, good morning. Just very quickly on the gross margins. It - did the chair - the China tariff benefit, did that all fall into the EVM gross margin?\nAnders Gustafsson: It would have fallen between both EVM and printing. So we had both - I don't have the exact split off them, but it was...\nRichard Eastman: Okay.\nAnders Gustafsson: So equally - or proportionately weighted between EVM and AIT.\nRichard Eastman: Okay. And then just - is there any visibility on that? I mean, going forward, Q2 to Q4, is that benefit continue?\nNathan Winters: But, do you expect the benefit to continue? We have not included that into our guidance for the quarter or the year in terms of incremental benefit. As - quite frankly, it's very hard to predict when and how the claims we've processed will be approved and paid. But it's something we continually work and actively manage. But yes, it's pretty tough to predict the timing of when we expect to get the recovery from the government.\nRichard Eastman: I see. Okay. And then just, just maybe as a second question around the core growth in the quarter was 25%, I believe. Could you just speak to what the growth relative in the channel was versus direct? And does the U.S. Postal Service fall in the direct piece that you're going to hopefully define for me?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. I'll - I think, Joe can probably provide most colors. But the USPS will be in Channel customer, I think, Joe. And second, our Channel business had a fantastic quarter, with I believe stronger growth than what we had in our direct accounts. Joe?\nJoe Heel: Yes, I can confirm that. So our strategy has and remains to be Channel-centric, with the vast majority of our revenue going through the Channel. And I'm happy to report that our Channel has once again grown faster than our business overall, and has therefore expanded the portion of revenue that goes through the Channel.\nRichard Eastman: Is - and just lastly, and related to this. I've got a question on just the press release that came out a little bit ago here, kind of mid -April. But you talk about this PartnerConnect Alliance Track. And it's complementary to the independent software vendor track. But just talk about maybe this expansion of non-selling VAR partnerships. And just, what that brings to the table here? And is that, there is an investment made in these channels? But just, maybe just speak to that, how that expands the opportunity set for Zebra?\nJoe Heel: Do I need to take that, Anders?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, please.\nJoe Heel: Yes. Of course, VARs has been the core of our PartnerConnect program. We've added ISVs, especially in the Android transition because of the importance that the software that runs on our devices has and how the customer comprehends that as an integrated solution and wants to buy it that way. So we recognized ISVs as influencers of the customers, aligned ourselves closely with those and, and are proud to have some of the largest ISVs in our program. But we've also recognized that there are other important influencers. I'll give you an example to make this real, which is, if you think about network equipment providers. People that provide WiFi infrastructure, for example, for a customer. Almost similar to the ISVs. They are looking to provide solutions to customers, like for example, locationing capabilities, right, within the environments that they outfit. And by working with us, they can enable such solutions. And we recognize that and created this Alliance Track in order to allow us to work more effectively with those kinds of partners. And it's paying off very nicely for us.\nRichard Eastman: So it's basically lead generation. I mean, is that what you look to it? These other influencers around ID products?...\nJoe Heel: It is lead gene... I'm sorry, go ahead.\nRichard Eastman: No, that was my question.\nJoe Heel: Yes, it is lead generation, but it is perhaps even more effective in allowing us to close the opportunities, right? When a customer sees that we're aligned and that we're working together, we have a greater chance of winning.\nOperator: The next question will be from Brian Drab with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrian Drab: Just first on the EBITDA margins. I guess the full-year guidance implies that the - first of all, you gave us the 21.5% midpoint for the second quarter, but then the full-year guidance implies the same kind of 21.5% level for the third quarter and fourth quarter. I'm wondering if that's kind of fair to assume that, that will be the run rate for the balance of the year and no big swings between third and fourth quarter? And also, is the premium freight headwind something that will persist or is that - can that fall off maybe later in the year? And I'm just wondering, how much conservatism might be baked into that 21.5% after putting up 25.5% almost in the first quarter?\nNathan Winters: So if you look at our full-year guide of 22% to 23%, we do expect gross margin in that to improve year-on-year, and particularly our software solutions grow. And we do expect premium freight cost of $50 million to $60 million, which we've raised by $20 million and most of that coming in the second half. Because we really don't see any change in those expectations from what we're seeing here in the first half, or at least it's hard to predict when the - particularly the supply side will come back around commercial air travel. And that's also $20 million higher than all of our 2020 transitory costs, including tariffs. And we also expect to continue to invest in and grow OpEx as we accelerate investment in some of the high ROI opportunities and including the continued integration of our software offerings with Reflexis.\nBrian Drab: Okay, thanks. And then, can you provide some details on the competitive environment as you're seeing it? Anything you can share in terms of what your share of the mobile computer market is now from your perspective and what your share of the bar coding equipment market is? Just that so much has changed in the last year with the industry just exploding. And then also within mobile computing, can you talk about what percent was Android versus Windows-based in the quarter? Thanks.\nAnders Gustafsson: All right. I'll start and we'll see if I missed anything. But if - so competitive environment. First I'd say, we are very confident in our competitive positioning. I'd say as confident as we've ever been probably. We're coming out of COVID 19 with good momentum and it provide - we've actually gained share as we've gone through last 2020 here. We took the attack of continuing to invest in new solutions and staying as close as we could with customers. We actually launched more new products last year than we've done in the other year in history, and I think that's coming back to benefit us here now. Our markets are, we think very attractive. We have some strong secular growth trends. I mentioned kind of the trends around digitizing and automating workflows as a broad theme that I think that's something that's very broad-based and very - we believe will be something that companies will invest in for several years. The - we have some strong advantages also. We have our scale, our go-to-market network, the ecosystem we have there. So there is a number of things that will make us a formidable competitor from that perspective. And lastly, I'd say our vision. Our Enterprise Asset Intelligence something that differentiates us from our competitors. When our customers look, talk to us, they are not looking to just buy device for here and now, they are looking to see how they can partner with somebody who can help them drive that digitization and automation of their operations into the future. From a share perspective, we get share data from independent sources and they tend to lag. So we only have Q4 data. But we had a record share in mobile computing over, I think it was over 50% on print and we - the Number 2, I think is, I believe 12%, certainly directionally in that area. On print, we have a low 40%, 43% I think it is...\nNathan Winters: Yes.\nAnders Gustafsson: And our next second competitor is low double digits. I think also about 12%. And in scan, we have about 30%, where the second largest is more like 24%. So, we have strong position across our business. And your last question was about the mix of Android and - Windows. And we now have over 85% of our mobile computing sales are Android.\nOperator: Please proceed Mr. Anders, if you needed to answer the question further.\nAnders Gustafsson: Well, I just - our share in Android remains particularly strong. We probably have approximately 60% of the share of Android, so we're particularly strong in that Android element.\nBrian Drab: Yes. That's a good answer.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. And the final question will come from Blake Gendron with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nBlake Gendron: Thanks for squeezing me on here. I want to start with cash flow. So relative to the wording of at least $700 million in the prior guidance, the current guide is appreciably higher. So I'm wondering, how we can think about free cash conversion in the context of both, Number 1 growing software mix and Number 2, the healthy channel growth that you mentioned. I would imagine that hardware-led pent-up demand recapture would see some working capital drag in 2021. But as we look into 2022 and beyond, is there a way we can think about free cash conversion that's perhaps structurally different from what it's been in the past?\nNathan Winters: And so, the first part of your question is just in terms of the full-year guide of greater than $850 million really just aligns to the increased profitable growth outlook for the year. So no notable changes in - from a working capital perspective relative to our last guide. Our target year in and out - year-in and year-outs be at 100% free cash flow conversion. This year it'll be slightly lower than that just because of the strength we had in 2020. But we don't see that noticeably changing and something we can achieve over time as we look - as we move forward.\nBlake Gendron: Okay, that's helpful. And then one quick follow-up here. Interesting win with the tire customer. And that application seems like if all the machine vision - there is a large machine vision competitor, that is a small handheld scanner device. Business somewhere in Zebra's purview, there's a little bit of overlap. Do you think that this overlap increases, particularly in the manufacturing realm? Is there any M&A to do here? A lot of what we're hearing in terms of automation, AI deployment within the manufacturing facility is coming from the Machine Building customers, which seems like it's on the periphery of what Zebra does, but that would be helpful perspective.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. Machine vision is a very exciting, sensing and data acquisition technology for us that helps us enable intelligent automation solutions. We've already incorporated machine vision into a number of our solutions like SmartPack, SmartSight, our MP7000 flatbed scanners for the color camera. So, we just clearly see great opportunities to continue to leverage machine vision to create unique solutions for our customers. The tire tread depth sensor, that is an accessory that we put on our mobile computers to be able to do, but it's another example of how we're trying to find use cases where we feel that we have a strong right to play and where we can be competitive. I now expect that machine vision is going to be continued area for us to invest. We acquired a company called Cortexica about 18 months back, I think it is now, that was basically as an engineering team that has deep expertise into machine vision. Their focus was on figuring out how to extract useful information from digital images and video and we put - they put, they have been a great addition to our team and helping our other solutions - accelerate the deployment of our other solutions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gustafsson for any closing remarks.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. So to wrap up, I would like to thank our employees and partners for their focus, dedication and resiliency, leading to exceptional Q1 results and an improved outlook for 2021. Our top priority continues to be protecting the health and well-being of our employees, partners, and customers as we recover from the pandemic. Stay safe everyone.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Heel",
            "content": "Yes. I would say that the large deal momentum has continued evenly throughout the year. And we have prospects for large deals in the second half, just as we did in the first half. One of the large deals that you're aware of is the USPS deal, which is of course contributing to our Q2 and Q3 as we have said. Yes. I'll give you one example of the connection of our device for all and our SaaS software. One of the largest retailers in Australia is using our EC30 devices together with Workforce Connect to enable their associates to do tasks in the store, but also communicate with one another. And that's one of the key use cases, which is - and by the way also enabled by Reflexis in the future is to have the associates be able to interact with each other, which requires that all of the associates have a device. So, I think that's a pretty good example of it. I think you said it well on the small-and-medium businesses. Clearly, the pent-up demand portion of - we're still most pronounced among the SMBs, I would say, and they're catching up more on their pent-up demand. But beyond that, it is really those small-and-medium businesses going to the next level of digital transformation, just as their larger resident have. And you get also asked about healthcare. And - on the healthcare beyond COVID 19 use cases, we're seeing an expansion, as Anders has mentioned in the prepared remarks into new areas of healthcare like ambulatory care, like remote patient care.

So our strategy has and remains to be Channel-centric, with the vast majority of our revenue going through the Channel. And I'm happy to report that our Channel has once again grown faster than our business overall, and has therefore expanded the portion of revenue that goes through the Channel. Do I need to take that, Anders? Yes. Of course, VARs has been the core of our PartnerConnect program. We've added ISVs, especially in the Android transition because of the importance that the software that runs on our devices has and how the customer comprehends that as an integrated solution and wants to buy it that way. So we recognized ISVs as influencers of the customers, aligned ourselves closely with those and, and are proud to have some of the largest ISVs in our program. But we've also recognized that there are other important influencers. I'll give you an example to make this real, which is, if you think about network equipment providers. People that provide WiFi infrastructure, for example, for a customer. Almost similar to the ISVs. They are looking to provide solutions to customers, like for example, locationing capabilities, right, within the environments that they outfit. And by working with us, they can enable such solutions. And we recognize that and created this Alliance Track in order to allow us to work more effectively with those kinds of partners. And it's paying off very nicely for us. It is lead gene... I'm sorry, go ahead. Yes, it is lead generation, but it is perhaps even more effective in allowing us to close the opportunities, right? When a customer sees that we're aligned and that we're working together, we have a greater chance of winning."

            "name": "Anders Gustafsson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our team delivered exceptional first quarter results, with strong performance across the business, resulting in record sales and profits. For the quarter, we realized; adjusted net sales growth of 28% or 25% on an organic basis; and adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.3%, a 620 basis point year-over-year improvement; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.79, a 79% increase from the prior year, and strong free cash flow. Our teams executed well to satisfy a stronger-than-expected recovery in demand from smaller customers through our distribution channel, and continued strong demand from large customers to digitize and automate their workflows in an increasingly on-demand economy. We realized strong broad-based demand with double-digit sales growth across our four regions, each major product and solutions category, as well as in all of our vertical end markets. We also significantly expanded profit margins, driven by favorable business mix and lower travel expenses, while at the same time, we continued to invest in initiatives to drive sustainable profitable growth. Given our momentum and pace of innovation, we are increasingly confident in our growth prospects. Thank you, Nathan. I am encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business, which allows us to increase our 2021 outlook. Our team has done an outstanding job navigating us through the pandemic. Slide 10 illustrates how we are working with our customers and partners to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. By leveraging Zebra's leading portfolio of products, solutions, software, and services our customers can overcome some of their most complex operational challenges and transform their frontline workflows to achieve higher levels of performance. Well, and first, we are very pleased with our first quarter results here and the outlook we could provide. We - the business is supported by some strong secular trends that have accelerated during the pandemic, like omnichannel and - so most companies today are very focused on automating and digitizing their businesses. And for us, that resulted in double-digit growth across all regions, across all products and solutions, as well as all verticals, so very broad-based demand for us. We did see particularly strong growth from small and medium-sized customers, and that was partly driven by pent-up demand, but it's only partly driven by pent-up demand. Yes, but - we also saw strong demand from our large customers, our larger strategic accounts. And I think another factor here was that based on our performance, I'm - I certainly expect that we continue to take share in the market. Nathan, do you want to add something? I think what we've said is, it tends to be that our visibility into the larger deals or into our pipeline overall increases with time. So the closer - the further we enter the year we get better visibility, we'll have to be through the second half and Q4. So part of what you see today is that we have gained some better visibility into both - how we expect the run rate to progress, but also on some of the larger deals. But we don't have perfect visibility, so clearly there is opportunities for deals that we don't necessarily have in our stored as high likelihood in our pipeline today. Joe, do you want to add something to this? This is a hard question today, because we have broad-based demand. I don't think we've ever had a quarter where we've had each of our four regions, each of our verticals and each of our main product categories all growing double-digits. So it's hard to pick who stand out as particularly strong or weaker. But I'll probably just highlight maybe North America as particularly strong, as being also our largest region here, we grew by 28%. So we saw very broad-based demand across basically all our portfolio, the entire portfolio. But printing supplies, mobile computing, RFID, services, software, they were all up double digits. And we had strong wins across all our vertical markets in North America. And our newest vertical, the government vertical also demonstrated good growth. And I think demonstrates the investments we've made in both product and the go-to-market for the government vertical paying off here now. On a - from a vertical perspective, maybe healthcare, just want to highlight. It's been our fastest growing vertical for some time and we expect it to continue to be the fastest growing one. It had a very nice performance in Q1. I think the transformation in healthcare is accelerating. It started off in acute care, but it's moving into other areas now, like ambulatory care, contact tracing, even remote patient care. And healthcare patients are now expecting or demanding a more digital experience and they prefer that also. And our purpose-built solutions are critical for healthcare providers to be able to improve the overall patient journey to drive - and to drive greater productivity for the healthcare providers across their operations. And some of our solutions in healthcare also used specifically, but for COVID response like drive-through testing and vaccinations, cold chain logistics and so forth. Yes. The device for all is a big opportunity for us. We're very excited about how that's progressing. We see the theme around how most companies wants to automate and digitize their operations is playing a big role in driving this. Across every vertical, I would say, our customers are looking to put technology in the hands of more of their employees and be able to have them be connected and be able to both enter data, as well as react to data. We see the relationship with Reflexis as very synergistic. And that, if you have a mobile device you can now look at inventory stock-outs, or other information and upload that to the Reflexis task engine, which now can make smarter decisions, can prioritize the highest ROI action, and then mobilize that to the right worker at the right time by - through somebody who then is carrying a mobile device. So it's a very strong synergistic portfolio that adds basically - and the network effect it adds to the value of both device and both solutions by having both under one roof. The progression on deeper penetration is also progressing. So if you go back, 7 years, 8 years or something, our large supercenter in retail might have had seven or eight devices and today they routinely would have maybe 70 or 80, but they may have several hundred employees. And we think that having a shared device for those associates when they are in the store is big objective for, I would say, the vast majority of our customers. And that's progressing. We have some good examples of where we've provided - expanded our portfolio to provide that kind of full range of devices across the price and performance curve. And where we've combined software and devices to really enable much deeper penetration. And Joe, maybe you want to share some examples of this? I think, over time, we do expect for our margins to improve. I'd say, Q1 was especially favorable due to the strong mix of small and medium-sized business. But I think as that normalizes to more of a normalized level as we move forward, we do expect EVM margins to improve over time, particularly as you mentioned with the growth and expansion of our software solutions. Yes. I would first characterize the supply chain issues that we're working on in two categories. One is, logistical bottlenecks and the other one is around the industry-wide semiconductor shortages that has been in the press quite a bit lately. First on the logistical bottlenecks. That's really caused by an increase - a combination of increase in demand when combined with a reduction in commercial air traffic sort of fewer commercial airplanes, which used to cover or carry a lot of commercial freight also. Then you have - add on a little bit of container shortages and port congestion on top of that. But this has resulted in air and ocean rates on - pretty much on all our key routes, having increased by a factor of two, since the start of the pandemic. So, we are incurring premium freight cost as a result of this. And we are prioritizing customer - meeting customer expected delivery dates. So, we have been using - leveraging all modalities of freight to get our devices and products to our customers, including chartering flights from Europe - from China to Europe and the US. But this has had a negative - a negligible impact on revenues. And I'd say, our supply chain team has done an outstanding job of being able to manage this and minimize the impact on the business. They had issues around the semiconductor shortages and this impacts some of our products more than others. Our teams are - have been doing a great job of managing all angles of optimizing allocations for us. We have a history of thoughtful contingency planning, which I think is helping us here. We tend to qualify multiple components when we can and even have multiple suppliers when practical. We have seen, again, modest increases in surcharges related to sourcing these components. But despite the - both of these issues that I mentioned, we are confident in the full year sales outlook that we gave. The outlook incorporates both of these points. And lastly then on the price action you asked about. We continuously assess pricing based on the competitive environment. So, we always look at that, but there is - we have no imminent plan of addressing or having, let's say, a broader price increase to address these supply chain issues. Yes. We had an exceptional quarter for print. The growth rates were well above average - corporate average. We - as we saw growth across the portfolio and certainly pent-up demand had been an issue here. Smaller customers through the channel, it was recovering quite nicely. And we also over the last year or so, taking some steps to strengthen our go-to-market around our eco channel - channel ecosystem. And I think that's made us more competitive. And we've been able to accelerate some share gains. Our printing - RFID printing business was also particularly strong. And even the supplies business was doing very well. Tempt time was up double digits. So it was a very strong performance across the board. And maybe also highlight that, Joe mentioned earlier, the manufacturing was up very strongly in Q1 after having had a tougher go in 2020 and a little bit further - beyond that also it would further that out. And printing is the most exposed to manufacturing. So when manufacturing goes up that would have a disproportionate impact on our printing business. Yes. I will start, and then, I will ask Joe to also provide some color here. So first on smaller customers and what we're seeing, what's different. I'd say two things, Meta. One is, irrespective of size, I would say, pretty much all customers across all verticals are looking to figure out how can they digitize and automate their businesses more. And they do look to our type of solutions to connect the physical world to the digital world, to really help them connect that physical workflow - those workflows into applications and automate them better. So that is a broad-based theme across basically all sizes of customers and verticals. The other point that would be - our larger customers who generally able to pivot to a COVID operating world better. They were generally seemed to be essential businesses - were deemed to be essential business, while many of our smaller customers, many of them are in manufacturing had to shut down. And now as they come back, I think they are looking to make investments that enables them to compete with some of their larger presence who have made more - who have invested earlier in those digitization and automation themes. Joe, do you want to add anything to this? Yes. So, when you say new products, you mean new types of solutions, or were just new products more generally? Okay. Yes. I'll start and Joe, you can provide some - year also. So I'd say, we did see RFID having a very strong quarter in Q1. RFID had a tough going last year, but that's really started in Q2. So there was - Q1 last year was more of mill, was pretty reasonable quarter. So this is a strong rebound for RFID. And we see these types of solutions which are more contactless is having a great - being in demand and see more deployment of them. I would say, also our software solutions are having great traction. The combination of the Reflexis, Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Workforce Connect provides a very differentiated value proposition for us. And each of those offerings by them - and of themselves are performing very well. But when you then combine it with as a suite and then look at the - how they interact with our mobile devices that provides a very compelling offering, which we see having great, great opportunities for us to continue to grow. And some of our other intelligent edge solutions are still probably a little slow in ramping as we've had - still have a hard - we don't have access to our customers' facilities to the extent we used to, to do pilots and proof of concepts and other types of engagements like that. But we expect that to ease up here as we get through COVID and get back into more normal way of operating with our customers. Joe? It would have fallen between both EVM and printing. So we had both - I don't have the exact split off them, but it was... So equally - or proportionately weighted between EVM and AIT. Yes. I'll - I think, Joe can probably provide most colors. But the USPS will be in Channel customer, I think, Joe. And second, our Channel business had a fantastic quarter, with I believe stronger growth than what we had in our direct accounts. Joe? Yes, please. All right. I'll start and we'll see if I missed anything. But if - so competitive environment. First I'd say, we are very confident in our competitive positioning. I'd say as confident as we've ever been probably. We're coming out of COVID 19 with good momentum and it provide - we've actually gained share as we've gone through last 2020 here. We took the attack of continuing to invest in new solutions and staying as close as we could with customers. We actually launched more new products last year than we've done in the other year in history, and I think that's coming back to benefit us here now. Our markets are, we think very attractive. We have some strong secular growth trends. I mentioned kind of the trends around digitizing and automating workflows as a broad theme that I think that's something that's very broad-based and very - we believe will be something that companies will invest in for several years. The - we have some strong advantages also. We have our scale, our go-to-market network, the ecosystem we have there. So there is a number of things that will make us a formidable competitor from that perspective. And lastly, I'd say our vision. Our Enterprise Asset Intelligence something that differentiates us from our competitors. When our customers look, talk to us, they are not looking to just buy device for here and now, they are looking to see how they can partner with somebody who can help them drive that digitization and automation of their operations into the future. From a share perspective, we get share data from independent sources and they tend to lag. So we only have Q4 data. But we had a record share in mobile computing over, I think it was over 50% on print and we - the Number 2, I think is, I believe 12%, certainly directionally in that area. On print, we have a low 40%, 43% I think it is... And our next second competitor is low double digits. I think also about 12%. And in scan, we have about 30%, where the second largest is more like 24%. So, we have strong position across our business. And your last question was about the mix of Android and - Windows. And we now have over 85% of our mobile computing sales are Android. Well, I just - our share in Android remains particularly strong. We probably have approximately 60% of the share of Android, so we're particularly strong in that Android element. Yes. Machine vision is a very exciting, sensing and data acquisition technology for us that helps us enable intelligent automation solutions. We've already incorporated machine vision into a number of our solutions like SmartPack, SmartSight, our MP7000 flatbed scanners for the color camera. So, we just clearly see great opportunities to continue to leverage machine vision to create unique solutions for our customers. The tire tread depth sensor, that is an accessory that we put on our mobile computers to be able to do, but it's another example of how we're trying to find use cases where we feel that we have a strong right to play and where we can be competitive. I now expect that machine vision is going to be continued area for us to invest. We acquired a company called Cortexica about 18 months back, I think it is now, that was basically as an engineering team that has deep expertise into machine vision. Their focus was on figuring out how to extract useful information from digital images and video and we put - they put, they have been a great addition to our team and helping our other solutions - accelerate the deployment of our other solutions. Yes. So to wrap up, I would like to thank our employees and partners for their focus, dedication and resiliency, leading to exceptional Q1 results and an improved outlook for 2021. Our top priority continues to be protecting the health and well-being of our employees, partners, and customers as we recover from the pandemic. Stay safe everyone."

            "name": "Nathan Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q1, adjusted net sales increased 28.3%, including the impact of currency and the Reflexis acquisition, and 25% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions. Direct sales to large customers grew double-digits, and we saw even higher growth from smaller customers through the channel, partially driven by pent-up demand. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment, including printing and supplies grew 21.4%, while Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 26.8%, driven by exceptional growth in enterprise mobile computing. We realized strong double-digit growth in services and software. And also had strong growth in our RFID solutions, which is beginning to rebound from the depths of the pandemic. We recognized double-digit growth in all regions. In North America, sales increased 28%, with mobile computing, printing, services and supplies each growing double-digits. In EMEA, sales increased 22%, with solid growth across all sub regions and solutions offering. APAC returned to growth with sales up 19% led by strength in China, Australia, New Zealand and India. Latin America also returned to growth in all sub regions, with sales increasing 31%. Adjusted gross margin expanded 370 basis points to 48.9%, primarily driven by favorable business mix, and higher service and software margin. The favorable year-on-year impact from China tariffs was offset by $11 million of incremental premium freight charges. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 280 basis points. We have been accelerating high return investments in the business, while prudently managing discretionary costs. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.3%, a 620 basis point increase from the prior-year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. We drove non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $4.79, a $2.12 or 79.4% year-over-year increase. EPS growth also benefited from lower interest expense and a lower share count, partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. We generated $214 million of free cash flow in Q1. This was $119 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. In Q1, we had $13 million of venture investments in two companies that provide real-time asset visibility and artificial intelligence solutions. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended Q1 at a modest 0.9 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. Yes. So this time on the pent-up demand. I think one, it is an estimate, so this isn't a precise deal reconciliation. And we think it is recovering most of our 2020 miss to our original plan and guidance last year and recovering that here in the first half of the year, which is contributing low double digits, both in the first and second quarter. Maybe I can add something too. If you look at the regions nominally, the one that's swung the most from last quarter was Latin America. Latin America was the one that was hardest hit in the pandemic and has rebounded the most, but it's also our smallest region. In terms of verticals, another one that is notable is manufacturing, which was hit very hard in the pandemic as well and we're seeing some good rebound in that area. I think the biggest swing that we haven't mentioned yet is one of deal size and customer size, right? So, notably our run rate and the purchases by small and medium businesses have accelerated and are catching up now to what was a big driver in past quarters of the larger customers, investing in e-commerce and digitization. We're now seeing that in the small and medium business, which of course manifest in our run rate. Yes, Andrew, this is Nathan. Firstly, our teams have been executing very well on what we can control. You see that through the gross margin improvement year-on-year up 370 basis points. About two-thirds of that is related to business mix, as well as volume leverage. We have especially high mix of large orders, due to the recovering small and medium business that Joe mentioned earlier. And about a third of that was from expansion of our service margins, as well as the Reflexis acquisition. And most of that coming from expansion within our service business. I think the one thing to also note, as we stated last year, we look at our underlying gross margin trends. They remained healthy throughout 2020. And we expected the overall margin and we're seeing that play out to improve as the mix has returned. Yes. So if you look at our Q2 EBITDA guide of 21% to 22%, it is up nearly 3 points year-on-year due to favorable business mix from 2020. Sequentially, it is down 4 points, most of that is due to lower gross margin. As we said, as deal size, I think, comes back from the exceptionally high level we are - we had here in Q1. And you also have CRS seasonality, a slight care for recovery in the first quarter all lowering gross margin sequentially. As well as we do expect higher OpEx, as we continue to accelerate investment in our new solutions both in R&D and go to market. Keith. So just - first part of your question, to the growth in both our service and software. Now again, seeing on both ends, right at the - the addition of Reflexis gross margin being higher than the company average is helping. But also from an organic basis, up nearly 7 points year-on-year from our core service business. And part of that is due to the actions we took over the last several years to improve efficiency and streamline the repair operations and the team is continuing to work that. And then the other is, now with double-digit revenue growth, I've seen that volume leverage flow through the P&L is the other big driver of the margin improvement. And we do expect that to continue to grow year-on-year as we grow the top line, as well as improve efficiency in the operations. But, do you expect the benefit to continue? We have not included that into our guidance for the quarter or the year in terms of incremental benefit. As - quite frankly, it's very hard to predict when and how the claims we've processed will be approved and paid. But it's something we continually work and actively manage. But yes, it's pretty tough to predict the timing of when we expect to get the recovery from the government. So if you look at our full-year guide of 22% to 23%, we do expect gross margin in that to improve year-on-year, and particularly our software solutions grow. And we do expect premium freight cost of $50 million to $60 million, which we've raised by $20 million and most of that coming in the second half. Because we really don't see any change in those expectations from what we're seeing here in the first half, or at least it's hard to predict when the - particularly the supply side will come back around commercial air travel. And that's also $20 million higher than all of our 2020 transitory costs, including tariffs. And we also expect to continue to invest in and grow OpEx as we accelerate investment in some of the high ROI opportunities and including the continued integration of our software offerings with Reflexis. Yes. And so, the first part of your question is just in terms of the full-year guide of greater than $850 million really just aligns to the increased profitable growth outlook for the year. So no notable changes in - from a working capital perspective relative to our last guide. Our target year in and out - year-in and year-outs be at 100% free cash flow conversion. This year it'll be slightly lower than that just because of the strength we had in 2020. But we don't see that noticeably changing and something we can achieve over time as we look - as we move forward."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please come ahead.\nMike Steele: Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's fourth quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com, and will be archived there for at least one year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of this slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Anders Gustafsson, our Chief Executive Officer; Bill Burns, our Chief Product and Solutions Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Anders will begin with our fourth quarter highlights and an update on the previously announced CEO transition. Then Nathan will provide additional detail on the Q4 results and discuss our 2023 outlook. Bill will conclude with progress made on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer, will join us as we take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Anders.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. It was a strong finish to a challenging year, with sales and profitability near the high end of our outlook. For the quarter, we realized sales growth of approximately 4%, an adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.5%, an 80-basis-point increase year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.75, a 5% increase from the prior year, and strong free cash flow. Our team recovered from distribution challenges in North America to drive record sales volumes, which more than offset softer sales in our EMEA region. From a solutions offering perspective, printing, data capture, tablets and RFID were bright spots, more than offsetting lower sales of mobile computers. Although we continue to see cautious spending behavior with certain large customers, demand has generally remained solid, with strength in small to midsized orders. We secured a number of exciting wins, helping to drive a strong year-end and momentum into 2023. These wins included a large postal customer in Asia who expects to improve productivity and efficiency by equipping 70,000 mail carriers with our mobile computing solutions. A British grocer expects to improve their shopper experience and drive store efficiencies by deploying 80,000 personal shopper devices. And the European-based auto manufacturer plans to enable process improvement and quality assurance along all stages of the production line with 30,000 Zebra mobile computers. From a profitability perspective, we expanded EBITDA margin and increased EPS by scaling operating expenses and drove our strongest cash flow quarter of the year. As you are aware, in December, we announced that Bill Burns will succeed me as CEO effective March 1. Bill is the ideal leader to continue to advance our strategy and has the full support of our Board and executive team. Throughout his career, Bill has maintained a strong focus on culture, talent and innovation. He has been a key member of Zebra's executive leadership team since joining us more than seven years ago to lead and integrate the enterprise business, which we had just acquired at the time. Since the announcement, Bill and I have been busy meeting with stakeholders discussing the transition and Zebra's bright future. I've also been taking this opportunity to thank our employees, suppliers and partners for their support and growth collaboration through the years as we transformed our business. I look forward to continuing to ensure a smooth transition as I assume the role of Executive Chair. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q4 financial results in more detail and discuss our 2023 outlook.\nNathan Winters: Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 7. In Q4, net sales increased 2.5%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 3.9% on an organic basis. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment increased 13.5%, driven by double-digit growth in printing. Enterprise Visibility and Mobility segment sales were approximately flat, with mixed performance among our offerings. We realized particularly strong growth in data capture solutions, including RFID as well as rugged tablets. Mobile computing sales declined, primarily due to challenging prior year compares, particularly in EMEA. We also drove growth across services and software with strong service attach rates. Performance was mixed across our regions. North America sales increased 11%, helped by the recovery from supply chain challenges and strength in data capture and printing. EMEA sales declined 7%, primarily due to the 5-point impact of our suspension of sales into Russia in March as well as lower sales to large customers in Northern Europe. Asia-Pacific sales grew 3%, with strength in Japan and growth in China despite COVID challenges late in the quarter. And Latin America sales increased 7%, with strong growth in Brazil and Mexico. Adjusted gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 45.6% due to FX, offset by lower premium supply chain costs. Adjusted operating expenses were lower, improving by 100 basis points as a percent of sales, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and effective cost management. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.5%, an 80-basis-point increase driven by operating expense scaling. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.75, a 4.6% year-over-year increase. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 8. In 2022, we generated $413 million of free cash flow. Although Q4 was strong, the full year was significantly lower than last year, primarily due to a higher use of working capital due to elevated inventory, higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance, and $135 million of previously announced settlement payments, which are scheduled to conclude in Q1 of 2024. In 2022, we invested approximately $880 million in the Matrox Imaging acquisition to expand our machine vision solutions offering. We made $751 million of share repurchases and invested $12 million in venture investments. We ended the year at a comfortable 1.6 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, and with more than $1.4 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility. On Slide 9, we highlight premium supply chain costs, which have continued to improve from peak levels. The actions we have taken to redesign products, targeted price increases as well as improving freight rates and capacity have enabled us to reduce component purchases on the spot market and reduce the freight cost impact. Additionally, we have increased the volume of printer shipments on Ocean Premier, which will contribute to reduced freight costs through 2023. In Q4, we incurred premium supply chain costs of $25 million as compared to the prepandemic baseline, which was favorable to what we had anticipated in our prior outlook, and $38 million lower than the prior year. We are expecting these premium supply chain costs to steadily decline in 2023. Let's now turn to our outlook. Customer demand and our order pipeline remained healthy, yet we continue to see some softening of demand and elongated sales cycles that we referenced last quarter through the uncertain macro environment. We are taking a cautious approach to our sales outlook and expense management while working to rightsize our inventory levels. For the first quarter, our sales are expected to decline between 4% and 1% compared to the prior year. Our outlook assumes a 3-point negative impact from foreign currency changes and a 150-basis-point additive impact from recent acquisitions. This translates to expectations of negative 1% organic growth, which includes a 1-point headwind from sales into Russia last year. We anticipate Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 21%, driven by higher gross margins from improving supply chain costs despite significant FX headwinds. We expect premium supply chain costs to be approximately $20 million in Q1, a nearly $50 million year-over-year reduction. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $4. For the full year 2023, we anticipate net sales to be in the range of a 3% decline and 1% growth. This outlook assumes a 50-basis-point net negative impact from foreign currency changes and acquisitions as FX headwinds moderate throughout the year. We anticipate full year adjusted EBITDA margin between 22% and 23%. We expect premium supply chain costs of approximately $50 million for the year, with continued improvement in product availability. We have also proactively managed operating expenses as evidenced by OpEx scaling in Q4 and recent targeted restructuring actions as we enter 2023, which enabled us to preserve strategic investments in the business. We expect our free cash flow to be at least $650 million for the year, which reflects the benefit of working down elevated inventory levels through the year, higher cash taxes and $180 million of previously announced settlement payments. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 10. Note that the cost of borrowing is expected to be approximately 5% to 6% this year, and our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 19% due to the United Kingdom corporate tax rate increase. With that, I will turn the call to Bill to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\nBill Burns: Thank you, Nathan. Before I talk about the progress we are making on our vision, I'd like to take a moment to thank Anders for his exceptional leadership with Zebra over the last 15 years. Through disciplined organic investment and strategic acquisitions, he's led the transformation of Zebra. He sponsored an innovative and authentic culture that has received many awards recognizing Zebra as a great place to work. Also under his leadership, shareholder value creation has significantly exceeded broader market benchmarks. I'm excited to build upon Anders legacy by continuing to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Slide 12 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions that generate an attractive return on investment, Zebra's customers can effectively address their increasingly complex operational challenges. Our innovative solutions empower the workforce to do their jobs more effectively by navigating constant change in a near real time, utilizing insights driven by our advanced software capabilities such as prescriptive analytics and intelligent automation. As I focus on moving Zebra forward, we will collaborate closely with customers and partners to continue to elevate Zebra as a premier solutions provider and work to attract, develop and retain top global talent to drive innovation. Slide 13 summarizes our served market opportunities and long-term growth profile. The fundamental drivers of our business remain intact. Mega trends, including the on-demand economy, asset visibility, mobility and cloud computing and intelligent automation, provides secular tailwinds for our business. I am proud of the progress we're making in elevating our strategic relationship with our customers. We continue to extend our leadership position in our core business and are gaining traction in adjacent and expansion markets, which have higher growth profiles. Anders and Nathan highlighted RFID as a bright spot, where we have a comprehensive solutions offering for a wide range of use cases. Our momentum continues as we were just awarded a record RFID win last week. Another highlight is our market share gains in rugged tablets as a result of our focused investment. Overall, I believe we're well positioned to deliver 5% to 7% organic growth over a cycle, with an increasing attractive margin profile as we drive continued traction across our core, adjacent and expansion markets. Now we turn to Slide 14. Businesses partnered with Zebra to optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet an increasing demands of consumers across a variety of vertical end markets. As you can see on the slide, we address a wide range of workflows and use cases across retail and e-commerce, transportation logistics, manufacturing, health care and other markets. Anders highlighted a few recent wins across these markets. The breadth of business challenges we are addressing has been expanding through our investment in new offerings and markets, enabling us to further penetrate customer accounts. For example, leveraging our existing relationships enabled us to secure autonomous mobile robot and machine vision wins with our customers in manufacturing and warehouse use cases. We see a tremendous opportunity to continue to elevate and grow our customer relationships through our expanded solutions offerings. On Slide 15, we highlight how Zebra was able to showcase how our solutions positively impact retail store operations to more than 1,300 customers at the National Retail Federation's trade show last month. At the event, we brought the modern store concept to life by demonstrating how our portfolio of solutions empower retailers to better engage associates, optimize inventory and elevate the customer experience. Our booth featured representatives from 2 prominent retailers who share how our solutions have improved their operational challenges. [Although some] improvement has realized the synergies of combining Zebra's mobile printers, mobile computers and our workflow optimization software solutions that improve the customer experience, increase efficiency and reduce friction in their workflows. Zebra's solutions have resulted in increased customer satisfaction by improving inventory accuracy and streamlining the buy online, pickup in store experience as well as over 1 million hours of annualized labor savings and reduced label waste. Vera Bradly has improved associate engagement and retention by prioritizing workloads through our task and workforce management software solutions. By leveraging Zebra's mobile devices and software solutions, they can now align the right task to the right associate in real time, and increased employee satisfaction by reducing friction in scheduling. Additionally, insights in our software solutions elevate the customers' experience for Vera Bradley by empowering frontline associates with better information, including visibility of product inventory and pricing. In closing, I look forward to working with our team to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision by fostering an innovation -- innovative culture, collaborating with our customers and partners and delivering profitable growth across our core adjacent expansion markets. Now I'll hand it back to Mike.\nMike Steele: Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDamian Karas: So my first question is related to your sales outlook. And in particular, we've heard some of your competitors and even one of your major distribution partners recently talking about inventory channel destocking taking place. I'm just curious if you guys are seeing the negative impact from that at all? And to what extent that's factored into your guidance for the year?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. Starting on the channel inventory side, our -- the global channel inventory levels are healthy for us, and we see solid sell-through signals and -- particularly, that's true for our run rate business. Inventory levels have rebounded in 2022 for our -- in our channel. But you've got to remember that, at the end of 2021, the industry was going through some very substantial supply chain constraints and the channel was nearly stocked out. So in 2022, that rebounded to some degree, but more back to normal levels. But inventory levels, in absolute dollar terms in our channel compared to, say, pre-pandemic is up. But if you normalize that around days on hand inventory, which is how we really measure the health of the inventory in the channel, that is actually about only up by a couple of days compared to prepandemic.\nDamian Karas: And then switching gears to the margin trajectory here. If we kind of look at the low end of that adjusted EBITDA guidance, it doesn't suggest much improvement, especially when you kind of look at the notable step down you guys are expecting in the premium supply chain cost. So I was wondering if you could maybe just give a sense on how you're thinking about that margin guidance range? And as it relates to the $50 million premium costs, are you basically assuming that, that's more or less eliminated by the third quarter?\nNathan Winters: So David, this is Nathan. If you look at our guide for the year, an EBITDA of 22% to 23%, it's a point higher than we were in 2022. And as you mentioned, the primary driver is the supply chain improvements, which is about 2 points of improvement, but that's being offset by 1 point of FX for the year, particularly here in the first half on the comps from where the FX -- the rate was a year ago in the euro. We also have pricing actions we've taken throughout the year that are flowing through, and that's largely offsetting material labor costs predicted for the year. So that's -- that's how to frame it. We're definitely seeing the flow-through from the improvement in premium supply chain costs and lower freight rates, but FX is the real headwind that's offsetting it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jim Rashidi at Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: I wonder if you could provide us with your general outlook for the projects business in '23. Are you seeing any changes? You've expressed some caution that you're seeing from some customers. But what's your outlook for that part of the business?\nBill Burns: Yes, Joe, I'd say -- this is Bill. I'd say overall that, from a macro environment, we're seeing really mixed signals. As you said, we're seeing, on one hand, really elongated sales cycles and some softening of demand, especially from some select large customers. That's resulting in some delays in pushouts. We saw that in first quarter -- sorry, fourth quarter, and it's reflected in our first quarter and 2023 outlook. On the other hand, we're really seeing that we've got strong backlog and the pipeline is healthy for projects for 2023. Our run rate sales in fourth quarter were strong, and we're continuing to see that in Q1. And as we just talked about, our global -- just the inventory levels are healthy. So it's really mixed signals out there that's keeping us cautious overall. And I think that our view of that is that we're going to continue to monitor the environment in 2023. We're going to take an agile approach to really managing expenses and focus on profit margin expansion and -- but at the same time, really preserving the strategic investments we're making throughout the year. So I think, overall, we're highly confident in our solutions offering and our ability to continue to take share in 2023, but it just makes sense for us to be cautious given the macro uncertainty that's out there today.\nJoe Heel: Jim, this is Joe Heel. Maybe 1 or 2 additional data points on this. As we entered the year, our pipeline of large projects was about the same as it was the year before. So quite strong, and we're quite satisfied with how solid that pipeline of large deals was. When we are talking about caution and softness, I would say it's sort of the best possible thing you can hope for if you're in sales, which is, customers are keeping the projects. In some cases, they are delaying the start time at them. In some cases, they are rolling them out over a longer period of time. But I would say those are few and far between at this point, and that's really the nature of what's driving some caution on our front.\nJim Ricchiuti: The follow-up question I have is just as you went through Q4 and thus far this year, have you seen any changes in demand, meaningful changes, either in some of your major geographic regions or major market verticals?\nJoe Heel: Yes. I can also speak to that. I think we have a few anomalies that you're aware of, right? You know about our exit from Russia prior year. So that revenue is obviously not there. You probably expected that, in the Chinese market, we would have less revenue this quarter than we had in the quarter -- same quarter prior year because of the COVID situation. By the way, that is very quickly recovering. We're seeing a quick recovery of that. So those are perhaps some of the changes. But other than that, I couldn't say that there's a major shift in region or vertical makeup of our revenue structure.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Paul Chung at JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nPaul Chung: So just on the EBITDA margin guide up this year, can you expand on kind of the gross margin versus OpEx dynamic and driving that outlook? Freight's coming down materially, but just want to get a sense for gross margin expansion expected throughout the year, with 1Q most likely be in the trough? And then I have a follow-up.\nNathan Winters: Yes. So Paul, if you look at the full year guide on EBITDA, I mean both the supply chain improvements and FX will flow through from a margin perspective. So I think we expect margin to -- gross margin to increase throughout the year because of those two dynamics. I think from an OpEx scaling, we'd say roughly flat to in line with prior year just as we work through some of the increasing compensation and incentive compensation year-on-year. But again, I think, largely, the benefit in EBITDA would flow through mostly in gross margin.\nPaul Chung: And then just on the RFID opportunity, how large is the contribution to the business today? I mean, you guys have been in the market for a long time. So where are you seeing accelerating growth, and some use cases across retail and other verticals?\nBill Burns: Yes, I would say that -- this is Bill, Paul. The low single digits is the size we think about. We're excited about the RFID opportunity. As we mentioned in the remarks that we've just won our largest RFID opportunity ever really in the T&L space. And we've seen RFID move from just really retail into retail supply chain, now into the broader supply chain and opportunities within transportation logistics, which is really around parcel and others that create really an opportunity of a wider served use cases. And in retail, we're seeing large retailers mandate the tagging of items within retail. We're seeing new opportunities there around loss prevention. As I mentioned, T&L opportunities, we're seeing quick-serve restaurants deploy RFID. In the NFL, we're doing both active and passive RFID. So we just renewed the contract there within -- in our relationship within the NFL. So we're excited about the RFID market. We've got the broadest and deepest set of RFID solutions today in the market, ranging and covering all those use cases I talked about. So the expansion of the use cases beyond retail is what's exciting to us, and we've got the portfolio really to go address it and we're excited about it.\nJoe Heel: Let me add one other thing, Paul, to that, which is, I think tipping points in the RFID market have been claimed several times in history, and I don't think we want to say that today, but there are some very exciting developments in this market that we're certainly bullish on. One of them is, last year, one of our largest retailers announced that they were converting significant portions of their operation to RFID. And the win that Bill mentioned earlier in his remarks that we just -- which was a record RFID deal, the largest in certainly our business and we believe in the industry, is in T&L. And so with two large retailer and a large T&L company adopting RFID, what this will do, we think, is that it will drive economies of scale in the market and also be a lighthouse for other competitors in these segments to adopt this technology, which provides significant improvements in throughput time and productivity, in addition to the economies of scale that delivers for the broader market. So we're pretty excited about this and foresee some strong growth for it.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Joe, just unpacking some of the guidance a little bit. When you're seeing deals that are being delayed or kind of spread out, perhaps can you give us a little bit of color about the momentum or the motivation that the companies have in doing so? Is it business specific issues? Are they worried about the economy, perhaps a little bit of guidance there.\nJoe Heel: Yes. Keith, this is Joe Heel again. What we're hearing from those customers is mostly that they are looking to adapt their spending to their budgets. And if we think about retailers, which probably make up a meaningful portion of some of those situations where we're seeing that, they are adapting their budgets to what they see as demand in for their business. And as they're doing that, they're asking to spread -- they still need our technology. I think that's the important piece that we see and why we're seeing a push out or maybe a delay in the deployment schedule. So they're trying to fit it in because they know they need this technology, but they're trying to adapt when they're spending the money to when they think it will be available in their business. I think that's the best description.\nKeith Housum: And Bill, just trying to unpack a little bit more about the supply chain issues as my follow-up here. Do you guys see still the middle of the year when supply chain issues really become alleviated and you're back to prepandemic levels?\nBill Burns: Yes. I think that -- I mean, from an availability perspective, I think we're pretty much there. I mean we're seeing components move into reasonable, much more reasonable lead times, not all, but many. The majority of our items have come back to normal delivery time frames overall. So I think that we feel good about our supply chain and the recovery of that, really almost the majority of almost everything really in first quarter is what I say, from our supply chain perspective.\nNathan Winters: Yes. Keith, the only thing -- this is Nathan. I'd add is, it's obviously a dynamic environment, and we're monitoring it in terms of events and shutdowns and things like that, that could disrupt that. And I'd also say it's also relative. If you look at -- our freight rates is a great example. It's meaningfully better than where they were a year ago or even 6 months ago, but still we're still paying 2 times to 3 times what we pay prepandemic. So I think it's also relative in terms of where we were historically to where we've been a year ago in terms of how we feel about the overall supply chain.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Just a couple of questions for me. One, you mentioned longer deal cycles, but I guess I was just wondering, is there any change to kind of the deal sizing that they're putting together of maybe looking at some lower-cost SKUs or outfitting kind of fewer reps? Just any change to kind of the overall deal size that's worth noting? And then maybe, second, now that you've had Matrox just a couple of quarters, you did mention some kind of machine vision type wins. Just wondering kind of where you're seeing -- where you are on that integration where you see kind of the best opportunities going forward there?\nJoe Heel: Meta, Joe Heel here. In terms of the longer -- in terms of the nature of these longer deal cycles, generally, we have not seen downsizing of deals or down tiering of devices. I could think of maybe 1 or 2 instances. It's more what I was describing earlier to Keith where the deal is being elongated in terms of either the deployment schedule over instead of taking it all in Q1, they're going to take it over 3 quarters for the rest of the year, or they might say, I don't want to take it in Q1, I want to take it in Q2. That's the most common one. Downsizing, I would say not so much, right? We're not seeing that as much.\nMike Steele: Yes. From a Matrox perspective, I can take that, Joe. I think, overall, we're encouraged certainly by the progress of Matrox. It performed well in 2022 with actually a record year. the integration is moving as planned. As kind of a quick reminder, the Matrox is really complementary to our organic investment that we made in the fixed industrial scanning and smart camera market. It really brought to us the breadth and depth of the portfolio that our partners were encouraging us to have in that marketplace. So it brought vision controllers and Frank grabbers and 3D sensors along with a portfolio of software solutions and a software library to meet many use cases in that marketplace overall. So I'd say we're happy with the progress so far. It's -- there's lots of opportunities for us out there in machine vision across manufacturing, and transportation logistics is the primary markets that we're focused on and things are going well so far.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Guy Hardwick at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nGuy Hardwick: Particularly as it pertains to your Q1 guidance, can you give us some sort of trends as to the difference between Zebra sales into the channel and then the distributor sales out of the channel, and maybe also how that differs from direct business?\nNathan Winters: So maybe just to frame the Q1 guide of minus 4% to minus 1%, again, as we mentioned before, we have, again, backlog and pipeline to support the outlook. We've actually had a solid start to the quarter, both in shipments into the channel as well as we're seeing nice momentum from a sales out, particularly on the run rate business. We're also realizing some nice price realization, which is about 1 point of benefit in the quarter. So I'd say, early on, again, seeing nice momentum both from a sales in and sales out. I'd say the -- but the guide also reflects, as we've talked about before, more the uncertainty in the environment and that cautious behavior, particularly as a lot of our customers are finalizing their capital budgets for the year. And the other thing important to note is that Q1 takes the full effect of the Russia headwind for the year, which is about 1 point for the first quarter. So I would say, no meaningful difference between what we're seeing within our own activity with the channel as well as from a sales out perspective, that's noteworthy.\nGuy Hardwick: Just to follow up. Is it correct that the gross margin benefit from supply chain, declining supply chain headwinds should be most significant in Q1?\nNathan Winters: From a year-on-year perspective, if you look at the EBITDA guide of approximately 21%, the supply chain benefit or the premium supply chain benefit is about 3 points, but that's offset by 2 points of FX. So that's -- those are the kind of main drivers from a year-on-year. But yes, you're right. From a year-on-year perspective, Q1 last year was about the peak in terms of premium supply chain costs.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Rob Mason at Baird. Please go ahead.\nRob Mason: I just wanted to circle back again to your commentary around the run rate business. Several times you've commented on healthy sales there, sell out. I'm just curious, how much visibility do you have into the bookings trends in that part of the business? And is it seeing any of the elongated deal cycles or any sense of that?\nJoe Heel: Joe Heel, here. The run rate has been very strong, I would say, for Q4, in particular, and we're seeing that continue into Q1. We -- in terms of visibility, this is the type of business where people obviously don't book big deals with us. They go to distributors and buy what they have on their shelf. So the visibility is typically based on our conversations with distributors and what they're telling us, they're seeing as their order intake. And so it's much less of a visibility. But what we have so far, even in the first weeks of this quarter, has been very strong. So we've been pleasantly surprised, in particular, for printing and scanning, which were areas of our business that we didn't have as much stock over the course of the last year. And as a result, we're very pleased to see that, that run rate in printing and scanning in particular, is so resilient, right, that customers are staying loyal to us and continuing to buy again from the distributors.\nAnders Gustafsson: Maybe there's two further points on that. One will be that we don't necessarily have the same visibility into each and in every deal, but this is one where you have a large number of orders, so you get kind of a more statistical confidence from that. And if you look at historically, our run rate business tends to be more of a longer cycle business for us. If we have a strong quarter, it tends not to be kind of one strong quarter and then it drops down. It tends to be that we have four to six quarters of strength in those -- in that cycle. So it's followed by maybe one or two quarters of a little softer demand. So we would expect this to continue for a few more quarters.\nRob Mason: Understood. Understood. And then I wanted to go back to your geographic commentary. I think when you mentioned Asia, you called out Japan was strong. I think, historically, Japan has not necessarily been a large market for you. Could you just outline maybe what you're seeing in Japan, what your expectations might be there? If anything is changing on that front?\nAnders Gustafsson: First, we're very pleased with the performance of the quarter. We had record sales. We came in above the high end of our outlook. We executed very well, I think, and recovered from the distribution network challenges that we had in Q3, and we drove double-digit sales in North America. We talked earlier about the strength we've seen in kind of run rate business, and we see that certainly in small and midsized customers. And we had particularly strong growth from a solutions perspective with print, data capture, RFID, tablets, but partially offset by lower mobile computing sales in Europe, due in part to the exit from Russia in Q1 of last year. Now Asia-Pac was -- had a good performance, particularly when you consider COVID in China. We have very broad-based growth, and we saw nice growth in China, Australia and New Zealand. But Japan, as you mentioned, is kind of the standout here. They have -- we had exceptional growth in Japan. We have invested in driving penetration in the Japanese market over the last several years, both from a go-to-market perspective, but also from a product perspective. And this large postal carrier win that we mentioned is kind of the latest evidence of that. So we now have a very strong position in Japan in mobile computing, which is one of the largest markets in the world that we really didn't have much of a presence before.\nJoe Heel: And I'll add one thing to that. So Japan is the third largest market that we operate in. And it's one, as you say correctly, where our share in the past had been relatively low. But two important things have changed that I think have given us some really good momentum here. Andrew has mentioned it. The first thing that's changed is that the market has begun to embrace Android. And this may seem like it's out of pace, and it is much later than many other markets in the world that, that market has made the mobile computing shift from Windows to Android, and that has given us a big opportunity, right? Because many of the local Japanese competitors, who have dominated that market, have not been as quick with Android as we have, and that has given us an opportunity, and that's a great example is this postal carrier deal that Anders mentioned. That's what we did. The second thing that we've done is, we have shifted our go-to-market strategy to focus more heavily on partners. And so we're working with some of the largest systems integrators now in the Japanese market. That's how we won this the postal carrier deal. That's how we've won several other large deals, in particular, in retail around mobile computing. And the combination of those two are really giving us some momentum we hadn't seen in any of the years before.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Brian Drab at William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrian Drab: I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the different verticals? I'm not sure you've really sell that out this morning in terms of manufacturing, retail, transportation, logistics, health care. I assume you want to give expected growth rates for those verticals in 2023, but if you could even give ranges or rank order where you're expecting the most strength or the weakest performance?\nAnders Gustafsson: That can be a long answer. So I'll give you -- start a little bit high, and then we can pick up a couple of the verticals maybe here, but across all our verticals, as I said, we are seeing very strong secular trends to digitize and automate workflows and empower frontline workers in a much more labor-constrained environment. And these trends continue to drive an increased need for our type of solutions across a wide range of vertical end markets. You specifically mentioned manufacturing. We had a very strong performance in Q4 in manufacturing. We had a number of very significant wins that we were very proud of. We are mentioned the one in the automotive side in my prepared remarks. There are some attractive trends in manufacturing that are helping to drive our business here. One is around the business must invest in traceability tools to create more sustainable supply chains. Another one is around industrial automation investment trends in productivity and visibility. And those present opportunities for our solutions, including machine vision and our autonomous mobile robots or Fetch solutions. We've certainly seen very strong traction with machine vision in manufacturing and have some attractive early wins here. We are very excited about what we -- what and our Adaptive vision acquisitions can bring to our customers and partners here. I can dig into other verticals also, but see if you have any other questions here.\nBrian Drab: Well, I mean I was just wondering if you could comment, even just briefly or just a bullet point on each one, transportation logistics, up or down in 2023, health care up or down, retail up or down, just directionally even, and anything on all of the four major verticals you play in?\nAnders Gustafsson: I think that we probably will leave kind of the outlook around the overall corporate level. But maybe I'll just say that for -- in retail, in 2022, we had approximately flat sales in retail vertical with some very broad-based growth that offset the pullback of one very large customers. So you can see the strong momentum we have across the industry where we could offset a very large customer pulling back in a pretty big way. So the diversification we have across all of these verticals is definitely helping us to mitigate kind of volatility and drive more consistent results.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tommy Moll of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nThomas Moll : I wanted to start on the revenue outlook you've provided for 2023, which you've described as embedding a cautious approach. When you use that word cautious, are you primarily referring to some of the spending patterns among the large customers that you referenced? Or is this more a philosophical adjustment you've made where you look at your opportunities and maybe you discount the probability of conversion on some of these deals higher than you typically would just given the macro uncertainty?\nNathan Winters: Tommy, this is Nathan. I think, as you look at the full year guide, which is about, from an organic perspective, slightly down at the midpoint, as you mentioned before, I think it's a combination of the two, right, both kind of cautious in the overall assumptions due to the macro environment and how that's going to play out through the rest of the year as well as to your other point of how we kind of look at each -- look at some of those large opportunities and probability weight those for the year. And we think, we believe the range we provided is given that overall uncertainty.\nBill Burns: Yes, I'd just add that I think we feel good about our business. I think this is really all about macro uncertainty. I mean I think we think that we're going to continue to take share in 2023. That's how we see it. We're the leader across the core markets we serve. We've got attractive opportunities across the adjacencies and the expansion business we've invested in. So I think we feel good about our business. I think the uncertainty really is around what's happening around macro, and we're clearly seeing some of that come through in our results in Q4 and our guide for Q1 and '23.\nThomas Moll : And if the macro were to deteriorate, could you rank order or maybe just identify one or two of the key verticals where you would expect to see that pressure first versus maybe some of the verticals where you would expect more a secular growth trend through the year? Is that possible?\nBill Burns: I'm not sure we'd see it as separate verticals. What I'd say is that the across the diversification of our solutions and our verticals actually give us kind of resiliency in a downturn, which would dampen some of the cyclicality. So I think this diverse solutions based that we have in product portfolio and the new investments we're making is dampen cyclicality across that customer base. So I'm not sure we'd see it as one worse than the other. I mean, Joe may want to add to it. But I think that we think overall that we're going to take a disciplined approach to OpEx during the year and focus our investments. I think that, from that perspective, I don't think we see one vertical over another.\nAnders Gustafsson: You could think of maybe as health care as one that will be more resilient. I think the economic cycles will probably not impact health care as much. So it's been our fastest-growing vertical over quite a while, and we would expect that to continue to do well. more irrespective of the economic outlook.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gustafsson for any closing remarks.\nAnders Gustafsson: So as I wrap up my 62nd earnings call, I would like to again thank our partners, customers and employees for their contributions in transforming Zebra. I am proud of the progress we have made together and believe we will continue to prosper with Bill as our next CEO. I also want to thank our analysts and investors for your continued support of Zebra. Although this will be my last earnings call, I look forward to ensuring a smooth leadership transition and starting my new role as Executive Chair, while continuing to support Bill and Zebra's ongoing success. Have a great day, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation.

            "content": "Jim, this is Joe Heel. Maybe 1 or 2 additional data points on this. As we entered the year, our pipeline of large projects was about the same as it was the year before. So quite strong, and we're quite satisfied with how solid that pipeline of large deals was. When we are talking about caution and softness, I would say it's sort of the best possible thing you can hope for if you're in sales, which is, customers are keeping the projects. In some cases, they are delaying the start time at them. In some cases, they are rolling them out over a longer period of time. But I would say those are few and far between at this point, and that's really the nature of what's driving some caution on our front. Yes. I can also speak to that. I think we have a few anomalies that you're aware of, right? You know about our exit from Russia prior year. So that revenue is obviously not there. You probably expected that, in the Chinese market, we would have less revenue this quarter than we had in the quarter -- same quarter prior year because of the COVID situation. By the way, that is very quickly recovering. We're seeing a quick recovery of that. So those are perhaps some of the changes. But other than that, I couldn't say that there's a major shift in region or vertical makeup of our revenue structure. Let me add one other thing, Paul, to that, which is, I think tipping points in the RFID market have been claimed several times in history, and I don't think we want to say that today, but there are some very exciting developments in this market that we're certainly bullish on. One of them is, last year, one of our largest retailers announced that they were converting significant portions of their operation to RFID. And the win that Bill mentioned earlier in his remarks that we just -- which was a record RFID deal, the largest in certainly our business and we believe in the industry, is in T&L. And so with two large retailer and a large T&L company adopting RFID, what this will do, we think, is that it will drive economies of scale in the market and also be a lighthouse for other competitors in these segments to adopt this technology, which provides significant improvements in throughput time and productivity, in addition to the economies of scale that delivers for the broader market. So we're pretty excited about this and foresee some strong growth for it. Yes. Keith, this is Joe Heel again. What we're hearing from those customers is mostly that they are looking to adapt their spending to their budgets. And if we think about retailers, which probably make up a meaningful portion of some of those situations where we're seeing that, they are adapting their budgets to what they see as demand in for their business. And as they're doing that, they're asking to spread -- they still need our technology. I think that's the important piece that we see and why we're seeing a push out or maybe a delay in the deployment schedule. So they're trying to fit it in because they know they need this technology, but they're trying to adapt when they're spending the money to when they think it will be available in their business. I think that's the best description. Meta, Joe Heel here. In terms of the longer -- in terms of the nature of these longer deal cycles, generally, we have not seen downsizing of deals or down tiering of devices. I could think of maybe 1 or 2 instances. It's more what I was describing earlier to Keith where the deal is being elongated in terms of either the deployment schedule over instead of taking it all in Q1, they're going to take it over 3 quarters for the rest of the year, or they might say, I don't want to take it in Q1, I want to take it in Q2. That's the most common one. Downsizing, I would say not so much, right? We're not seeing that as much. Joe Heel, here. The run rate has been very strong, I would say, for Q4, in particular, and we're seeing that continue into Q1. We -- in terms of visibility, this is the type of business where people obviously don't book big deals with us. They go to distributors and buy what they have on their shelf. So the visibility is typically based on our conversations with distributors and what they're telling us, they're seeing as their order intake. And so it's much less of a visibility. But what we have so far, even in the first weeks of this quarter, has been very strong. So we've been pleasantly surprised, in particular, for printing and scanning, which were areas of our business that we didn't have as much stock over the course of the last year. And as a result, we're very pleased to see that, that run rate in printing and scanning in particular, is so resilient, right, that customers are staying loyal to us and continuing to buy again from the distributors. And I'll add one thing to that. So Japan is the third largest market that we operate in. And it's one, as you say correctly, where our share in the past had been relatively low. But two important things have changed that I think have given us some really good momentum here. Andrew has mentioned it. The first thing that's changed is that the market has begun to embrace Android. And this may seem like it's out of pace, and it is much later than many other markets in the world that, that market has made the mobile computing shift from Windows to Android, and that has given us a big opportunity, right? Because many of the local Japanese competitors, who have dominated that market, have not been as quick with Android as we have, and that has given us an opportunity, and that's a great example is this postal carrier deal that Anders mentioned. That's what we did. The second thing that we've done is, we have shifted our go-to-market strategy to focus more heavily on partners. And so we're working with some of the largest systems integrators now in the Japanese market. That's how we won this the postal carrier deal. That's how we've won several other large deals, in particular, in retail around mobile computing. And the combination of those two are really giving us some momentum we hadn't seen in any of the years before."

            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. It was a strong finish to a challenging year, with sales and profitability near the high end of our outlook. For the quarter, we realized sales growth of approximately 4%, an adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.5%, an 80-basis-point increase year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.75, a 5% increase from the prior year, and strong free cash flow. Our team recovered from distribution challenges in North America to drive record sales volumes, which more than offset softer sales in our EMEA region. From a solutions offering perspective, printing, data capture, tablets and RFID were bright spots, more than offsetting lower sales of mobile computers. Although we continue to see cautious spending behavior with certain large customers, demand has generally remained solid, with strength in small to midsized orders. We secured a number of exciting wins, helping to drive a strong year-end and momentum into 2023. These wins included a large postal customer in Asia who expects to improve productivity and efficiency by equipping 70,000 mail carriers with our mobile computing solutions. A British grocer expects to improve their shopper experience and drive store efficiencies by deploying 80,000 personal shopper devices. And the European-based auto manufacturer plans to enable process improvement and quality assurance along all stages of the production line with 30,000 Zebra mobile computers. From a profitability perspective, we expanded EBITDA margin and increased EPS by scaling operating expenses and drove our strongest cash flow quarter of the year. As you are aware, in December, we announced that Bill Burns will succeed me as CEO effective March 1. Bill is the ideal leader to continue to advance our strategy and has the full support of our Board and executive team. Throughout his career, Bill has maintained a strong focus on culture, talent and innovation. He has been a key member of Zebra's executive leadership team since joining us more than seven years ago to lead and integrate the enterprise business, which we had just acquired at the time. Since the announcement, Bill and I have been busy meeting with stakeholders discussing the transition and Zebra's bright future. I've also been taking this opportunity to thank our employees, suppliers and partners for their support and growth collaboration through the years as we transformed our business. I look forward to continuing to ensure a smooth transition as I assume the role of Executive Chair. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q4 financial results in more detail and discuss our 2023 outlook. Yes. Starting on the channel inventory side, our -- the global channel inventory levels are healthy for us, and we see solid sell-through signals and -- particularly, that's true for our run rate business. Inventory levels have rebounded in 2022 for our -- in our channel. But you've got to remember that, at the end of 2021, the industry was going through some very substantial supply chain constraints and the channel was nearly stocked out. So in 2022, that rebounded to some degree, but more back to normal levels. But inventory levels, in absolute dollar terms in our channel compared to, say, pre-pandemic is up. But if you normalize that around days on hand inventory, which is how we really measure the health of the inventory in the channel, that is actually about only up by a couple of days compared to prepandemic. Maybe there's two further points on that. One will be that we don't necessarily have the same visibility into each and in every deal, but this is one where you have a large number of orders, so you get kind of a more statistical confidence from that. And if you look at historically, our run rate business tends to be more of a longer cycle business for us. If we have a strong quarter, it tends not to be kind of one strong quarter and then it drops down. It tends to be that we have four to six quarters of strength in those -- in that cycle. So it's followed by maybe one or two quarters of a little softer demand. So we would expect this to continue for a few more quarters. First, we're very pleased with the performance of the quarter. We had record sales. We came in above the high end of our outlook. We executed very well, I think, and recovered from the distribution network challenges that we had in Q3, and we drove double-digit sales in North America. We talked earlier about the strength we've seen in kind of run rate business, and we see that certainly in small and midsized customers. And we had particularly strong growth from a solutions perspective with print, data capture, RFID, tablets, but partially offset by lower mobile computing sales in Europe, due in part to the exit from Russia in Q1 of last year. Now Asia-Pac was -- had a good performance, particularly when you consider COVID in China. We have very broad-based growth, and we saw nice growth in China, Australia and New Zealand. But Japan, as you mentioned, is kind of the standout here. They have -- we had exceptional growth in Japan. We have invested in driving penetration in the Japanese market over the last several years, both from a go-to-market perspective, but also from a product perspective. And this large postal carrier win that we mentioned is kind of the latest evidence of that. So we now have a very strong position in Japan in mobile computing, which is one of the largest markets in the world that we really didn't have much of a presence before. That can be a long answer. So I'll give you -- start a little bit high, and then we can pick up a couple of the verticals maybe here, but across all our verticals, as I said, we are seeing very strong secular trends to digitize and automate workflows and empower frontline workers in a much more labor-constrained environment. And these trends continue to drive an increased need for our type of solutions across a wide range of vertical end markets. You specifically mentioned manufacturing. We had a very strong performance in Q4 in manufacturing. We had a number of very significant wins that we were very proud of. We are mentioned the one in the automotive side in my prepared remarks. There are some attractive trends in manufacturing that are helping to drive our business here. One is around the business must invest in traceability tools to create more sustainable supply chains. Another one is around industrial automation investment trends in productivity and visibility. And those present opportunities for our solutions, including machine vision and our autonomous mobile robots or Fetch solutions. We've certainly seen very strong traction with machine vision in manufacturing and have some attractive early wins here. We are very excited about what we -- what and our Adaptive vision acquisitions can bring to our customers and partners here. I can dig into other verticals also, but see if you have any other questions here. I think that we probably will leave kind of the outlook around the overall corporate level. But maybe I'll just say that for -- in retail, in 2022, we had approximately flat sales in retail vertical with some very broad-based growth that offset the pullback of one very large customers. So you can see the strong momentum we have across the industry where we could offset a very large customer pulling back in a pretty big way. So the diversification we have across all of these verticals is definitely helping us to mitigate kind of volatility and drive more consistent results. You could think of maybe as health care as one that will be more resilient. I think the economic cycles will probably not impact health care as much. So it's been our fastest-growing vertical over quite a while, and we would expect that to continue to do well. more irrespective of the economic outlook. So as I wrap up my 62nd earnings call, I would like to again thank our partners, customers and employees for their contributions in transforming Zebra. I am proud of the progress we have made together and believe we will continue to prosper with Bill as our next CEO. I also want to thank our analysts and investors for your continued support of Zebra. Although this will be my last earnings call, I look forward to ensuring a smooth leadership transition and starting my new role as Executive Chair, while continuing to support Bill and Zebra's ongoing success. Have a great day, everyone."

            "name": "Nathan Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 7. In Q4, net sales increased 2.5%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 3.9% on an organic basis. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment increased 13.5%, driven by double-digit growth in printing. Enterprise Visibility and Mobility segment sales were approximately flat, with mixed performance among our offerings. We realized particularly strong growth in data capture solutions, including RFID as well as rugged tablets. Mobile computing sales declined, primarily due to challenging prior year compares, particularly in EMEA. We also drove growth across services and software with strong service attach rates. Performance was mixed across our regions. North America sales increased 11%, helped by the recovery from supply chain challenges and strength in data capture and printing. EMEA sales declined 7%, primarily due to the 5-point impact of our suspension of sales into Russia in March as well as lower sales to large customers in Northern Europe. Asia-Pacific sales grew 3%, with strength in Japan and growth in China despite COVID challenges late in the quarter. And Latin America sales increased 7%, with strong growth in Brazil and Mexico. Adjusted gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 45.6% due to FX, offset by lower premium supply chain costs. Adjusted operating expenses were lower, improving by 100 basis points as a percent of sales, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and effective cost management. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.5%, an 80-basis-point increase driven by operating expense scaling. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.75, a 4.6% year-over-year increase. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 8. In 2022, we generated $413 million of free cash flow. Although Q4 was strong, the full year was significantly lower than last year, primarily due to a higher use of working capital due to elevated inventory, higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance, and $135 million of previously announced settlement payments, which are scheduled to conclude in Q1 of 2024. In 2022, we invested approximately $880 million in the Matrox Imaging acquisition to expand our machine vision solutions offering. We made $751 million of share repurchases and invested $12 million in venture investments. We ended the year at a comfortable 1.6 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, and with more than $1.4 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility. On Slide 9, we highlight premium supply chain costs, which have continued to improve from peak levels. The actions we have taken to redesign products, targeted price increases as well as improving freight rates and capacity have enabled us to reduce component purchases on the spot market and reduce the freight cost impact. Additionally, we have increased the volume of printer shipments on Ocean Premier, which will contribute to reduced freight costs through 2023. In Q4, we incurred premium supply chain costs of $25 million as compared to the prepandemic baseline, which was favorable to what we had anticipated in our prior outlook, and $38 million lower than the prior year. We are expecting these premium supply chain costs to steadily decline in 2023. Let's now turn to our outlook. Customer demand and our order pipeline remained healthy, yet we continue to see some softening of demand and elongated sales cycles that we referenced last quarter through the uncertain macro environment. We are taking a cautious approach to our sales outlook and expense management while working to rightsize our inventory levels. For the first quarter, our sales are expected to decline between 4% and 1% compared to the prior year. Our outlook assumes a 3-point negative impact from foreign currency changes and a 150-basis-point additive impact from recent acquisitions. This translates to expectations of negative 1% organic growth, which includes a 1-point headwind from sales into Russia last year. We anticipate Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 21%, driven by higher gross margins from improving supply chain costs despite significant FX headwinds. We expect premium supply chain costs to be approximately $20 million in Q1, a nearly $50 million year-over-year reduction. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $4. For the full year 2023, we anticipate net sales to be in the range of a 3% decline and 1% growth. This outlook assumes a 50-basis-point net negative impact from foreign currency changes and acquisitions as FX headwinds moderate throughout the year. We anticipate full year adjusted EBITDA margin between 22% and 23%. We expect premium supply chain costs of approximately $50 million for the year, with continued improvement in product availability. We have also proactively managed operating expenses as evidenced by OpEx scaling in Q4 and recent targeted restructuring actions as we enter 2023, which enabled us to preserve strategic investments in the business. We expect our free cash flow to be at least $650 million for the year, which reflects the benefit of working down elevated inventory levels through the year, higher cash taxes and $180 million of previously announced settlement payments. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 10. Note that the cost of borrowing is expected to be approximately 5% to 6% this year, and our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 19% due to the United Kingdom corporate tax rate increase. With that, I will turn the call to Bill to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. So David, this is Nathan. If you look at our guide for the year, an EBITDA of 22% to 23%, it's a point higher than we were in 2022. And as you mentioned, the primary driver is the supply chain improvements, which is about 2 points of improvement, but that's being offset by 1 point of FX for the year, particularly here in the first half on the comps from where the FX -- the rate was a year ago in the euro. We also have pricing actions we've taken throughout the year that are flowing through, and that's largely offsetting material labor costs predicted for the year. So that's -- that's how to frame it. We're definitely seeing the flow-through from the improvement in premium supply chain costs and lower freight rates, but FX is the real headwind that's offsetting it. Yes. So Paul, if you look at the full year guide on EBITDA, I mean both the supply chain improvements and FX will flow through from a margin perspective. So I think we expect margin to -- gross margin to increase throughout the year because of those two dynamics. I think from an OpEx scaling, we'd say roughly flat to in line with prior year just as we work through some of the increasing compensation and incentive compensation year-on-year. But again, I think, largely, the benefit in EBITDA would flow through mostly in gross margin. Yes. Keith, the only thing -- this is Nathan. I'd add is, it's obviously a dynamic environment, and we're monitoring it in terms of events and shutdowns and things like that, that could disrupt that. And I'd also say it's also relative. If you look at -- our freight rates is a great example. It's meaningfully better than where they were a year ago or even 6 months ago, but still we're still paying 2 times to 3 times what we pay prepandemic. So I think it's also relative in terms of where we were historically to where we've been a year ago in terms of how we feel about the overall supply chain. So maybe just to frame the Q1 guide of minus 4% to minus 1%, again, as we mentioned before, we have, again, backlog and pipeline to support the outlook. We've actually had a solid start to the quarter, both in shipments into the channel as well as we're seeing nice momentum from a sales out, particularly on the run rate business. We're also realizing some nice price realization, which is about 1 point of benefit in the quarter. So I'd say, early on, again, seeing nice momentum both from a sales in and sales out. I'd say the -- but the guide also reflects, as we've talked about before, more the uncertainty in the environment and that cautious behavior, particularly as a lot of our customers are finalizing their capital budgets for the year. And the other thing important to note is that Q1 takes the full effect of the Russia headwind for the year, which is about 1 point for the first quarter. So I would say, no meaningful difference between what we're seeing within our own activity with the channel as well as from a sales out perspective, that's noteworthy. From a year-on-year perspective, if you look at the EBITDA guide of approximately 21%, the supply chain benefit or the premium supply chain benefit is about 3 points, but that's offset by 2 points of FX. So that's -- those are the kind of main drivers from a year-on-year. But yes, you're right. From a year-on-year perspective, Q1 last year was about the peak in terms of premium supply chain costs. Tommy, this is Nathan. I think, as you look at the full year guide, which is about, from an organic perspective, slightly down at the midpoint, as you mentioned before, I think it's a combination of the two, right, both kind of cautious in the overall assumptions due to the macro environment and how that's going to play out through the rest of the year as well as to your other point of how we kind of look at each -- look at some of those large opportunities and probability weight those for the year. And we think, we believe the range we provided is given that overall uncertainty."

            "content": "Thank you, Nathan. Before I talk about the progress we are making on our vision, I'd like to take a moment to thank Anders for his exceptional leadership with Zebra over the last 15 years. Through disciplined organic investment and strategic acquisitions, he's led the transformation of Zebra. He sponsored an innovative and authentic culture that has received many awards recognizing Zebra as a great place to work. Also under his leadership, shareholder value creation has significantly exceeded broader market benchmarks. I'm excited to build upon Anders legacy by continuing to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Slide 12 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions that generate an attractive return on investment, Zebra's customers can effectively address their increasingly complex operational challenges. Our innovative solutions empower the workforce to do their jobs more effectively by navigating constant change in a near real time, utilizing insights driven by our advanced software capabilities such as prescriptive analytics and intelligent automation. As I focus on moving Zebra forward, we will collaborate closely with customers and partners to continue to elevate Zebra as a premier solutions provider and work to attract, develop and retain top global talent to drive innovation. Slide 13 summarizes our served market opportunities and long-term growth profile. The fundamental drivers of our business remain intact. Mega trends, including the on-demand economy, asset visibility, mobility and cloud computing and intelligent automation, provides secular tailwinds for our business. I am proud of the progress we're making in elevating our strategic relationship with our customers. We continue to extend our leadership position in our core business and are gaining traction in adjacent and expansion markets, which have higher growth profiles. Anders and Nathan highlighted RFID as a bright spot, where we have a comprehensive solutions offering for a wide range of use cases. Our momentum continues as we were just awarded a record RFID win last week. Another highlight is our market share gains in rugged tablets as a result of our focused investment. Overall, I believe we're well positioned to deliver 5% to 7% organic growth over a cycle, with an increasing attractive margin profile as we drive continued traction across our core, adjacent and expansion markets. Now we turn to Slide 14. Businesses partnered with Zebra to optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet an increasing demands of consumers across a variety of vertical end markets. As you can see on the slide, we address a wide range of workflows and use cases across retail and e-commerce, transportation logistics, manufacturing, health care and other markets. Anders highlighted a few recent wins across these markets. The breadth of business challenges we are addressing has been expanding through our investment in new offerings and markets, enabling us to further penetrate customer accounts. For example, leveraging our existing relationships enabled us to secure autonomous mobile robot and machine vision wins with our customers in manufacturing and warehouse use cases. We see a tremendous opportunity to continue to elevate and grow our customer relationships through our expanded solutions offerings. On Slide 15, we highlight how Zebra was able to showcase how our solutions positively impact retail store operations to more than 1,300 customers at the National Retail Federation's trade show last month. At the event, we brought the modern store concept to life by demonstrating how our portfolio of solutions empower retailers to better engage associates, optimize inventory and elevate the customer experience. Our booth featured representatives from 2 prominent retailers who share how our solutions have improved their operational challenges. [Although some] improvement has realized the synergies of combining Zebra's mobile printers, mobile computers and our workflow optimization software solutions that improve the customer experience, increase efficiency and reduce friction in their workflows. Zebra's solutions have resulted in increased customer satisfaction by improving inventory accuracy and streamlining the buy online, pickup in store experience as well as over 1 million hours of annualized labor savings and reduced label waste. Vera Bradly has improved associate engagement and retention by prioritizing workloads through our task and workforce management software solutions. By leveraging Zebra's mobile devices and software solutions, they can now align the right task to the right associate in real time, and increased employee satisfaction by reducing friction in scheduling. Additionally, insights in our software solutions elevate the customers' experience for Vera Bradley by empowering frontline associates with better information, including visibility of product inventory and pricing. In closing, I look forward to working with our team to advance our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision by fostering an innovation -- innovative culture, collaborating with our customers and partners and delivering profitable growth across our core adjacent expansion markets. Now I'll hand it back to Mike. Yes, Joe, I'd say -- this is Bill. I'd say overall that, from a macro environment, we're seeing really mixed signals. As you said, we're seeing, on one hand, really elongated sales cycles and some softening of demand, especially from some select large customers. That's resulting in some delays in pushouts. We saw that in first quarter -- sorry, fourth quarter, and it's reflected in our first quarter and 2023 outlook. On the other hand, we're really seeing that we've got strong backlog and the pipeline is healthy for projects for 2023. Our run rate sales in fourth quarter were strong, and we're continuing to see that in Q1. And as we just talked about, our global -- just the inventory levels are healthy. So it's really mixed signals out there that's keeping us cautious overall. And I think that our view of that is that we're going to continue to monitor the environment in 2023. We're going to take an agile approach to really managing expenses and focus on profit margin expansion and -- but at the same time, really preserving the strategic investments we're making throughout the year. So I think, overall, we're highly confident in our solutions offering and our ability to continue to take share in 2023, but it just makes sense for us to be cautious given the macro uncertainty that's out there today. Yes, I would say that -- this is Bill, Paul. The low single digits is the size we think about. We're excited about the RFID opportunity. As we mentioned in the remarks that we've just won our largest RFID opportunity ever really in the T&L space. And we've seen RFID move from just really retail into retail supply chain, now into the broader supply chain and opportunities within transportation logistics, which is really around parcel and others that create really an opportunity of a wider served use cases. And in retail, we're seeing large retailers mandate the tagging of items within retail. We're seeing new opportunities there around loss prevention. As I mentioned, T&L opportunities, we're seeing quick-serve restaurants deploy RFID. In the NFL, we're doing both active and passive RFID. So we just renewed the contract there within -- in our relationship within the NFL. So we're excited about the RFID market. We've got the broadest and deepest set of RFID solutions today in the market, ranging and covering all those use cases I talked about. So the expansion of the use cases beyond retail is what's exciting to us, and we've got the portfolio really to go address it and we're excited about it. Yes. I think that -- I mean, from an availability perspective, I think we're pretty much there. I mean we're seeing components move into reasonable, much more reasonable lead times, not all, but many. The majority of our items have come back to normal delivery time frames overall. So I think that we feel good about our supply chain and the recovery of that, really almost the majority of almost everything really in first quarter is what I say, from our supply chain perspective. Yes, I'd just add that I think we feel good about our business. I think this is really all about macro uncertainty. I mean I think we think that we're going to continue to take share in 2023. That's how we see it. We're the leader across the core markets we serve. We've got attractive opportunities across the adjacencies and the expansion business we've invested in. So I think we feel good about our business. I think the uncertainty really is around what's happening around macro, and we're clearly seeing some of that come through in our results in Q4 and our guide for Q1 and '23. I'm not sure we'd see it as separate verticals. What I'd say is that the across the diversification of our solutions and our verticals actually give us kind of resiliency in a downturn, which would dampen some of the cyclicality. So I think this diverse solutions based that we have in product portfolio and the new investments we're making is dampen cyclicality across that customer base. So I'm not sure we'd see it as one worse than the other. I mean, Joe may want to add to it. But I think that we think overall that we're going to take a disciplined approach to OpEx during the year and focus our investments. I think that, from that perspective, I don't think we see one vertical over another."

This presentation will include prepared remarks from Anders Gustafsson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Anders will begin with our third quarter results. Then Nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our fourth quarter outlook. Anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence Vision. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer, will join us as we take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Anders.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. For the quarter, we realized a sales decline of 3%, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1%, a 60 basis point decrease; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.12, a 9% decrease from the prior year. We were unable to fulfill all orders due to supply chain challenges related to persistent component shortages for certain products as well as disruption in the transition to our new North American distribution center in the Chicago area. These challenges led to lower throughput than planned late in the quarter. This, along with orders from some large customers being deferred contributed to the lower-than-expected results. In North America and EMEA, cycling two prior year large mobile computing deployments and suspension of sales in Russia resulted in the sales declines. Our Asia Pacific and Latin America regions were bright spots in the quarter with double-digit sales growth. Globally, we realized sales growth with our small and medium-sized customers, which was more than offset by a decline from our large customers. From a solutions offering perspective, we drove growth across data capture, printing, supplies, services and software. These helped to partially offset the sales decline in mobile computing. We expanded gross margin over the prior year, despite significant FX pressure, yet EBITDA margin contracted and EPS declined due to the deleveraging of operating expenses from the sales decline. We have initiated meaningful actions to address the supply chain challenges, which was the primary driver for our results. These include, organizational changes and the reallocation of resources to drive improved focus and execution in our supply chain, initiating specific actions with our supply chain partners to improve operations and extending the planned transition of our North America distribution center to mitigate execution risk. Customer demand and our order pipeline generally remains healthy, yet has slowed since late Q3. Given the macroeconomic uncertainty, we see elongated sales cycles and certain projects being deferred. As a result, we are taking a cautious approach to our Q4 sales outlook and expense management while working to rightsize our working capital levels in the coming quarters to improve free cash flow conversion. At the same time, we continue to prudently invest in initiatives that advance our solutions offerings. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q3 financial results in more detail and discuss our fourth quarter outlook.\nNathan Winters: Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q3, adjusted net sales declined 4%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and down 3.2% on an organic basis, primarily due to supply chain challenges and lower sales to large customers. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment increased 12.4%, driven by double-digit growth in both printing and supplies as product availability has continued to generally improve. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 8.8% due to supply chain bottlenecks, including component shortages. We realized particularly strong growth in data capture solutions, including RFID and as well as rugged tablets. We also drove growth across services and software with strong service attach rates and attractive software offerings. Performance was mixed across our regions. Asia Pacific sales grew 20% with broad-based strength across the region, including China. Latin America sales increased 10% with exceptional growth in Mexico. And in North America and EMEA, sales decreased 9% and 2%, respectively, due to the supply chain challenges, lower sales to large customers and the suspension of sales in Russia. Adjusted gross margin increased 80 basis points to 45.8% and due to favorable business mix and lower premium supply chain costs, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Adjusted operating expenses increased due to acquisitions and delevered by 60 basis points due to the sales decline. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.1%, a 60 basis point decrease from the prior year period due to expense deleveraging on lower sales. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.12, a 9.5% year-over-year decrease. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. For the first nine months of 2022, we generated $170 million of free cash flow, which was significantly lower than last year, primarily due to a higher use of working capital due to elevated inventory and sales volume shifting to later in the quarter. Higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance and $90 million of previously announced settlement payments. We made $50 million of share repurchases and invested $6 million in venture investments in the third quarter. We ended the quarter at a comfortable 1.7 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio and with more than $1.2 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility. On Slide 8, we highlight that premium supply chain costs have improved from peak levels. The actions we have taken to redesign products, targeted price increases as well as the improving freight capacity have enabled us to reduce purchases on the spot market and reduce the freight cost impact. We are on plan to move printer shipments to ocean from air late this year and into early 2023. For the full year 2022, we now expect approximately $190 million of premium supply chain costs over pre-pandemic 2019 levels, a $10 million reduction from our prior outlook. In Q3, we incurred premium supply chain costs of $30 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, which was favorable to what we had anticipated in our prior outlook. In total, Q3 transitory items had a combined favorable gross margin impact of $14 million year-over-year. And in Q4 are expected to be approximately $35 million, which is a nearly $30 million reduction year-on-year. Let's now turn to our outlook. Q4 sales are expected to be approximately flat from the prior year period, with a range of negative 2% to positive 1% growth. As compared to our prior outlook, the lower sales growth is driven by softening demand, continued supply chain challenges and currency headwinds. We are confident in this guide given our relatively strong order backlog, improved quarter-to-date shipment activity and actions taken to stabilize North American distribution. We estimate a two-point additive impact from recently acquired businesses and a four-point negative impact from foreign currency changes. As a reminder, approximately 25% of our global sales are denominated in euros. We anticipate Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 22% and 23%, which is an increase from both the prior year and the prior quarter. Given our tempered view of the demand environment, we are taking a conservative approach to managing operating expenses while preserving strategic growth investments. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.80. We now expect our free cash flow to be at least $400 million for the year, which we have significantly reduced from our prior outlook due to lower profits and elevated inventory levels that we will be working down into 2023 as we rationalize safety stock and execute on our North America distribution transition. Sales seasonality has improved to more normalized levels in Q4, which should drive the peak cash flow quarter for 2022. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision with our customers.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Nathan. The long-term fundamental drivers of our business remain strong. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, which have been magnified through the pandemic. This value proposition resonates with customers in any macroeconomic environment as it improves productivity and inventory accuracy among an extensive list of other operational benefits. As we have expanded our portfolio with compelling solutions, we have elevated our strategic position with our customers. Our trusted relationships with our partners across the globe augment our capabilities, enabling us to serve more customers worldwide. Our new fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions resonated well with customers and partners at recent trade shows in Stuttgart, Germany and Boston, Massachusetts. Our booths featured advanced optical character recognition supported by deep learning capabilities gained through our 2021 Adaptive Vision acquisition. Our comprehensive offering has put us in a strong competitive position. Now turning to Slide 12. Businesses partner with Zebra to optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet the increasing demands of consumers. Zebra solutions continue to represent a necessary investment, and I would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets A large North American retailer recently selected Zebra's TC52 mobile computers for their stable network connection, durability and camera performance. This customer maximizes value from Zebra solutions by combining our mobile computers with our Reflexis workforce and task management, Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Intuit software. This combination enables the retailer to improve inventory accuracy and the omni-channel shopping experience for their customers. A North American-based fast food chain has chosen Zebra's handheld RFID solution to enhance inventory management. This solution will enable each restaurant to reap the benefits of a more digitized supply chain by streamlining the process to track and trace inventory from its suppliers to the restaurant. Adoption of this technology will assist the customer to comply with the Food Safety Modernization Act. A transportation company in Europe has begun rolling out approximately 20,000 mobile tablets to streamline their vehicle rental process. Zebra's exceptional service and integrated product offerings displaced a competitor and will enable associates to complete vehicle workarounds inspections in the reservation process more efficiently. The convenience store chain in Latin America is expanding their use of Zebra solutions from the distribution center to the front of store with more than 50,000 Zebra mobile computers, printers and tablets. Deployment of these Zebra solutions is expected to significantly increase productivity, inventory accuracy and improve shopper satisfaction. Zebra's Mobility DNA software, which enables intuitive device management and our compelling customer value proposition were key differentiators in this competitive win. Apparel manufacturer, BMC, recently selected Zebra's autonomous mobile robots and fixed industrial scanners for their new 50,000 square foot North American facility. Zebra collaborated with a major partner to develop a solution that would enable a flexible workflow and enhanced visibility along each step of the production line. By combining our autonomous mobile robots and fixed industrial scanners, BMC will realize powerful synergies with scanners tracking each step of production in directing the robots along the workflow. The robots streamline associates movements, enabling faster fulfillment. This flexible and scalable solution was preferred to a traditional fixed conveyance system because it saves a vital warehouse space and adjusts to demand. Additionally, we recently secured a large win with a major European retailer who selected Zebra's fixed industrial scanners to significantly reduce scan time, increasing throughput at several thousand packing stations, resulting in a faster than one-year payback on investment. Zebra's collaboration with the customer and a valued partner was integral to this competitive win. As we turn to Slide 13, I want to reiterate that the actions we have taken to address our challenges with North American distribution, elevated inventory levels and increased macroeconomic headwinds. We have executed key organizational changes and have initiated specific actions with our supply chain partners to stabilize operations and reallocate resources to address immediate challenges. We are also taking decisive steps to rationalize inventory while maintaining optimal levels of strategic components. Additionally, we are taking prudent cost actions as we realized softening demand and implementing additional pricing actions to address FX and inflation. In closing, we continue to be very optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for our business. We have the broadest portfolio of tailored solutions to enable our customers to improve their operations in any environment. The global labor deficit and on-demand economy have escalated the need for enterprises to digitize and automate their operations with our solutions. Now I will hand the call back over to Mike.\nMike Steele: Thanks, Anders. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tommy Moll with Stephens. You may now go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning and thanks for taking my question.\nAnders Gustafsson: Good morning, Tommy.\nTommy Moll: Anders, I wanted to start on the comments you made regarding some deferred projects from large North American customers. Any context you can share there on end market type of project visibility to picking back up on some of this work going forward would be much appreciated. And as a related point, would you say that these projects are all the majority of or a smaller part of the demand softening that you called out late Q3. I'm sure it's part of what you described there with the softening, but order of magnitude would be helpful. Thank you.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. First, I'd say the -- we're getting some mixed signals from the market on on-demand pictures and that's, to some degree, clouded by the supply chain challenges we're seeing. But most signals, most demand signals we are seeing are constructive. Our backlog is healthy. Our pipeline is building nicely. Our run rate business is strong. And we continue to see some nice areas of strength in each region. And our retail vertical grew just even though we had a very large customer pulling back into this year and particularly in the quarter. But we have also seen some elongated sales cycles and a bit of softening in demand where some customers have pushed out some orders from Q3 into 2023. So the -- I think most -- I'll ask Joe for some extra color here also as most of those pushouts have come from the retail segment. That's also our largest segment, so it wouldn't be surprising and they tend to have more of the year-end spend that they're working on. So the overall environment is still quite healthy, but we have seen some select pushouts, Joe?\nJoe Heel: Yes. To put it in perspective, perhaps in terms of the miss to the outlook, the deferral of project was a minor contributor to that. Among these -- the deferral of projects, these late-in-the-quarter deferments were a relatively small number of larger projects, as Anders said, deferred primarily into 2023. That's probably as much as we can say.\nTommy Moll: That's helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, I wanted to pivot to supply chain, and you gave us quite a bit there on the North American distribution center transition. Can you give us any more -- just on the ground context in terms of the transition that's underway, some of the changes that you've made as a consequence of some of the challenges that you called out? And then I think, Anders, I heard you reference that there have been some personnel changes on this front. Anything you could highlight there would also be helpful. Thank you.\nNathan Winters: Tommy, this is Nathan. I'll start with the first part. Just a little bit of background. We selected a new DC location midway through last year. And as we said on the call, we had some issues with the transition impacting shipment volumes late in the quarter, and we've implemented corrective actions, particularly on ramping back our Texas facility. That gives us some additional time to work through the transition, both from a people and process perspective. So again, I'd say although we didn't deliver the shipment volumes necessary to meet the Q3 forecast. We are now operating at levels required to deliver Q4. Still not where we want to be. But again, the Texas facility is nearly staffed to full capacity and we've had a really nice recovery here in deliveries in October. Just as context, we've shipped out nearly $200 million more in October than we did in the month of July, which is giving us both confidence in the performance of the DC as well as confidence in the Q4 guidance. I'll pass it over to Anders.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. From an organizational perspective, we have made some changes. We have promoted a new supply chain leader who leads our global operations and supply chain team. So -- and we have also streamlined the organization a bit and moved some functions or responsibilities out of supply chain to other areas to make sure we can get greater focus and better accountability around those. We've also worked closely with our supply chain partners to make sure we take some actions with them to help improve the operations. One that Nathan talked about was ramping up our Dallas Fort Worth facilities. So they're back at close to full capacity. They're almost fully staffed and operating very well at the moment. And we're working with our Chicago area, DC partner also to see how we can best help them scale their operations there.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. You may now go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey, good morning, guys.\nAnders Gustafsson: Good morning.\nAndrew Buscaglia: So just trying to get a sense of how much of the sales change that you've seen is related to like I guess, the nature of the deferrals and the confidence that you're going to get these orders in 2023? And I guess the phrase another way, how much is this kind of the beginning of more to come, or based on the visibility you have with these customers, do you have confidence, this is like short-term issue. Yes, it's I don't think we want to get into too much of 2023 outlook yet. But I think these have been more select customers. There's not a broad-based, say, pushout or deferrals. It's much more select on certain customers and some tougher -- particularly in Q3, we also have some very difficult comp from two large customers that were particularly strong in the third quarter. But as we said, most of our demand signals are still very strong and encouraging. And we see -- it's been -- this was really very, very narrowly focused in North America.\nJoe Heel: Yes. I'll add two things perhaps for perspective. One is an example of what we're seeing is a large customer who will take an order that they would have perhaps placed in Q3 or early in Q4. And now telling us we're going to split that order, and we're going to take 80% of it now and 20% of it later in 2023. That's an example of the type of thing we're getting. So it feels like there's real demand behind the order. The other thing that we're hearing from customers quite consistently is while some customers, in particular, retailers are being cautious about their business, about their revenue expectations, and those are obviously visible to you in what they say on their earnings calls. They are telling us that their investments in IT and in the types of solutions that we provide them are important to them even in more uncertain times because they need to improve their productivity, and we help them do that with our solutions. So that's certainly something we hear pretty consistently.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. That's helpful. And you talked about last quarter and I guess this quarter again, being able to shift by -- mostly by ocean exiting Q4 I guess, where do you stand with that? And then tailwind-wise in 2023, I know you don't want to give guidance for next year, but like what -- how do you expect the cost environment to shape up for next year. And hopefully, maybe do you think that offsets some of this volatility around the sales you'll see over the next six months or so.\nNathan Winters: Yes. So Andrew, maybe just context for the broader premium supply chain costs. I think what we saw in Q3 was a positive momentum, 50% reduction from what we experienced in Q2, decreasing from nearly 4% of revenue to just over 2%. And that was primarily driven by the declining shipping cost per kilo, which we're experiencing as well as benefiting from the pricing actions beginning to take effect with the price increase we did in July. Q3 shipping costs did come in below estimate. We also benefited, if you look at the mix and the $30 million for the quarter from lower North American revenue, and that's the other reason for it ticking back up in the fourth quarter in terms of overall transitory. And our Q4 guide assumes no improvement in freight rates. So it's something we're continuing to monitor it. But if you look at the overall reduction from $200 million to $190 million in premium supply chain costs, some of that's volume driven, just over half, but also $4 million of that or so was due to the lower rates we're experiencing. And I think our expectation is that we will see steady reduction into 2023 around these costs as long as the freight rates hold where they're at today. And then we're going to continue to transition from air to ocean, really late here in the fourth quarter. We did some ocean shipments into Europe in the third quarter but we really don't expect ocean shipments to pick up until late here in the fourth quarter and into 2023. And we've also seen a nice reduction in what we've had to buy in critical components on the spot market. So we're starting to see that loosen up as well. So again, we feel confident that we'll see a steady decrease. And EBITDA benefit as we go into next year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. You may now go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi, thank you. First question, just again on the deferral that you're seeing among a few of these North America customers. When you talk about it, some of this business slipping into 2023, is the presumption that this would be slipping further into 2023 into the second half just given the seasonal investments that these types of customers may make?\nAnders Gustafsson: I think it's -- probably don't want to give too much color on that also here at this stage, but the expectation is that won't -- they're slipping from this year into the beginning of next year, not the end of next year. I would agree with that, yes.\nJim Ricchiuti: Okay. That's helpful. And Anders, I wonder if you could talk to what you're seeing in the SMB market. It sounds like you're seeing relatively good demand there. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but if you could comment on that. And also in an economic cycle, which part of the business would you see impacted more immediately, the larger customer business or the SMB business?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. Starting with the SMB business, yes, we did see strong growth globally for our small- and medium-sized customers. I think that's a good indication of kind of the confidence the broader market has in the outlook and the value that our solutions offer. The secular trends that we talked about to digitize and automate workflows and empower the frontline workers are, I would say, much more important today in a labor-constrained environment as that drives greater increase for our type of solutions across all verticals and all sizes of customers. And I think the our run rate business performed particularly well globally this quarter, which I think is -- gives us confidence around the health of the business. If you talk about kind of which verticals would be more or less impacted, I'd say, we probably get them -- gotten the most questions around our retail customer base, historically in this. And here, I mentioned earlier, our retail and e-commerce business grew in Q3 despite very challenging comps from the very large -- particularly large retailer that has been pulling back. And I think that highlights the value of having a very diversified retail e-commerce customer base, where the timing of the refresh cycles is kind of spread out and that helps to reduce volatility risks. But I think the -- in retail specifically, the focus on -- or the importance of our type of solutions to enable our customers to execute on their omni-channel and e-commerce strategies is very important. I've talked about how we believe that our solutions are now more like, say, an ERP implementation, it's harder to dial them up and down. And I think the results from Q3 gives some credence to that expectation. I'd say our health care business, which performed very well in Q2 -- in Q3, sorry, was up double digits. That is probably the vertical we expect to be the least sensitive to \u2013 to kind of recessionary forces. And here, we are also very focused on helping to transform that industry to \u2013 to be able to improve the patient journey and drive greater productivity for health care providers. The T&L vertical is -- there was one that was the hardest hit was the only vertical that was down for us in Q3. But e-commerce volumes are expected to continue to increase, and that drives greater need for real-time visibility into their overall supply chain and is a key driver for customer investments. And we enabled the last mile fulfillment for those customers, which is an important factor as consumers are expecting faster deliveries. And lastly, around manufacturing, that also tends to be -- it's a market that is more a largest in Asia for us, but it is global, and it's done very well for us over the last year or so and had a good double-digit growth this quarter. Here, we've made some -- both the -- some of the new acquisitions around -- from May trucks. And Fetch are expanding our offering and we're getting a lot of interest and early orders for manufacturing in those areas. And we've also made some quite significant and very deliberate investments in our go-to-market resources to help grow our share in manufacturing, and Joe can provide some more color on that.\nJoe Heel: Yes. Maybe I'll just amplify some of Anders' points. Number one, the growth in the medium-sized customers and also in the run rate has been particularly encouraging for us because that's where our supply constraints are particularly important, right? If you have supply, you get run rate. When we had supply return, our run rate rebounded. And that was a really good sign of the resilience of our run rate. That's very encouraging for us. You asked about which size of customer goes into the cycle first. And what we saw is that as we entered into the pandemic, the largest customers were the first to accelerate their purchases. And they were followed nine, 12 months later by medium-sized and smaller customers than also accelerating their purchases. Now as we're seeing some caution in the market, it's -- again, the largest customers that are being cautious first, some of the deferrals that we've referred to and that you asked about were larger customers with large orders while the medium-sized and small customers continue to go very strong with even double-digit growth. So that's the dynamic that we're seeing in the cycle. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Erik Lapinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Lapinski: Hi, team. Thanks. If I could go back to kind of the commentary on the run rate business you just made, I guess, just trying to get a better sense on the strength there. Do you think that's an element of customers being further behind on investments versus larger customers than And then maybe also on that point, like when we think about deferrals from the larger customers, is that related to a refresh or a new device deployment? Any kind of color you can give us there would be helpful.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. First, on the strength on the run rate business here. I think that the -- we -- I would say we don't see our customers large or small, having say, pulled forward demand and invested ahead of their capacity utilization curves with probably one exception -- one large exception. So -- and specifically for our large -- for our small and midsized customers, they tend not to have their financial capacity to invest for in advance. So they tend to be much more as the projects roll out to address more urgent business needs for them. So that would be one point on that. Joe?\nJoe Heel: Yes. When it comes to the run rate, it really matters what's on the shelf, right? You have small customers that are calling into distributor and what's on the shelf counts. And once we had product on the shelf again as our supply chain ramped up again over the course of the quarter, we saw that run rate rebounding. So I think that's the dynamic that there's no pull forward or that dynamic doesn't exist to that same extent in the run rate. When it comes to the larger customers, to the deferrals, we are talking about large customers that are typically doing deployments of mobile computers. You see it's pretty concentrated in the mobile computing segment. You have certain deployments that they have been planning and in some cases. But again, they were very few, and they were the minor reason for the miss in the quarter, right? But in those few cases, we're talking about deployments of mobile computers which are stretched out over a slightly longer time period, we think, into the first quarter of next year.\nErik Lapinski: Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just another one on kind of some of your OpEx flexibility. You did take down kind of expenses in the quarter and proved to be pretty nimble there. I guess just like where did you find those efficiencies in context of maybe some of the supply chain changes you're making? And how should we think about your ability to control OpEx in future quarters kind of sensitive to revenue?\nNathan Winters: Yes. A couple of drivers behind the OpEx flexibility. I mean the first is based on our variable comp structure, there's an element of variability in there relative to how we're performing for the year. The other one is, we did a hard look at where we're hiring and what roles and what positions around the world to ensure that where we're adding heads and investing is in our growth areas that we would kind of look at and say, there's no regrets in that in terms of those hiring. So it's a combination of those two, along with, again, continuing looking at discretionary spending where it makes sense. So I think those are the three main drivers here in the short-term. And as we go into next year, we're continuing to look at where we can drive efficiencies, looking at our real estate portfolio, but all the things you would expect us to do particularly as we go into a more challenging macro environment.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Damian Karas with UBS. You may now go ahead.\nDamian Karas: Good morning, everyone.\nAnders Gustafsson: Good morning.\nDamian Karas: Good morning, good morning. Not to beat a dead horse here on the project deferrals, but could you just clarify -- one, you haven't seen any order cancellations. And two, just thinking about these customers that have pushed out orders, it sounds like you do have visibility in terms of timing of delivery in 2023, and it's not that the conversations have been, hey, let's just put this on pause until a later determined date?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. So first on the cancellation. We have not seen any large order cancellations. I think the cancellations have been very modest. And to the extent we've had any and within what we would consider to be normal. Every quarter, we have some people who cancel an order or something like that. But that's been -- that's not been a factor in the results or in the outlook here. And the deferrals they have -- they're not pause, they just deferred. So they're -- we're expecting them to come back in the first part of next year. And the -- it's not like -- they are deploying, in the meantime, not just at the same pace as they had otherwise expected.\nJoe Heel: Yes. But there are some indications, Damian, that give us confidence that the deployment will occur. One of them is that they're taking an order and splitting it into two, right, as I've described to you. The other is that they're already working with us on deployment plans. We do see those stock signs not in every case, but in the majority of cases. So that's why we're describing it as we are.\nDamian Karas: Okay. Got it. That's really helpful. And then, Nathan, I think you suggested earlier that the \u2013 the ocean freight transition is happening late this year. Correct me if I'm wrong, I thought that, that was supposed to kind of play out in the third quarter. So is there any sort of delay there, or am I missing something?\nNathan Winters: So that's -- this was per our plan. We expected Q3 to start the modest shipments into Europe, which we did from an ocean perspective, but the plan and the guide around our premium costs had always assumed we wouldn't really feel any financial benefit to the move until we get into next year. As the priority for this year was to ensure we delivered enough printer volume to take care of our backlog as well as ensure we have the right products on the shelf to support our run rate business.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Drab with William Blair. You may now go ahead.\nBrian Drab: Good morning. I think most of the details come out here already, but I'm just wondering if you could give us a more specific update maybe on how Matrox and Fetch have been performing relative to your expectations? And again, in this difficult environment, I know Matrox committed about $100 million revenue run rate and Fetch about $10 million. I don't know if you could update those numbers directionally even. Thanks.\nAnders Gustafsson: We closed Matrox in early June. And certainly very pleased with how that's going. It creates a very comprehensive portfolio, both fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions for us. That kind of fills out our offering very nicely. I'd say we're very encouraged by progress Matrox is performing very well, and the integration is proceeding as per our plans. I think there's a very good culture fit between our organizations. We are also building out our partners. And that's going well. These are very specialized partners who provide these types of implementation and design services. And we've been seeing good traction in being able to recruit those partners to our program. So we're certainly very excited about what's going on with Matrox. And similarly, on Fetch, I say there's a lot of interest from \u2013 from warehouse operators across all our vertical markets as well as in manufacturing for our Fetch Robotic Solutions. And our ability to really combine the frontline worker, the automation of the frontline worker and the Fetch robot to automate -- orchestrate and automate the broader workflow has been resonating very well. And we're seeing -- yes, we're seeing a lot of interest, and it's obviously a smaller business, but it's ramping quite nicely.\nJoe Heel: And maybe a little bit of additional color. With the business being in sort of the early stages of development, what you look for primarily are pilot deployments, right? And we're seeing a very good stream of these pilot deployments. We were also very pleased to have two larger deployments already that we mentioned, I think, in the earlier -- in the previous earnings call already that are anchor tenants, I guess, now for our Fetch Robotics business going forward.\nBrian Drab: Great. And then I guess just as a follow-up, when you think about Matrox and some of the incumbents in that space. What have you found has been successful for you in going up against some of these incumbents and bidding on projects? What differentiates Matrox from a company like Cognex and others in the industry?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. First, I'll say that we don't see this as a zero-sum game. There's a lot of white space for us to go after without having to kind of go up and seek out opportunities where we compete with any specific competitor. It is also a very fragmented market. I think that the market leader has probably about 20% or no more than 20% market share. So there's plenty of opportunities to pursue without having to do that. That being said, I think we feel good about the value propositions that we have with Matrox. It is known for having a very some high-quality, high-performance solutions that can solve some very complicated problems for our customers. We worked hard on -- across our fixed investors scanning machine vision portfolio to drive ease of use as a differentiator to make it as easy for our customers to deploy and get time to revenue for these solutions. And that's been, I think, resonating back very well. Also, the software upgradability of our products is a differentiator. And we've had some very nice wins against a variety of different competitors with some large marquee customers. So we feel quite excited about it.\nJoe Heel: One other strength, Brian, to add perhaps is -- this is a business that's conducted predominantly through the channel. And we have used our strength in the channel to recruit a strong number of channel partners, many of which are somewhat disillusioned with other incumbents in the market. And that's been a great attraction for people to come to us because they know us as a very good channel partner for them. So that's helped us also.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Keith Housum with North Coast Research. You may now go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning. Hoping to understand a little bit more the North American warehouse issue. It looks new slide deck in North America was down 9%. Would you say a vast majority of that decline was due to that North American warehouse issue, or would that number have been without that issue?\nAnders Gustafsson: The -- I would say, the mid-term outlook was predominantly explained by the supply chain challenges related to the persistent component shortages for certain products and the disruption in the transition to our new North America warehouse. And there's probably about 45% -- $45 million on each of those. And the smallest part was the deferral of projects with about 10% of the miss to our outlook. So clearly, the supply -- the DC move was the largest part of this.\nKeith Housum: I appreciate that. It sounds like you're going to be forced to operate both the Texas facility and the Wisconsin facility, I guess, in peril for the next several quarters. What was the impact on profitability this quarter? And what do you think it's going to be going forward?\nNathan Winters: Keith, I would say it's relatively modest in terms of the cost structure we have with both of those facilities in terms of typically pay on a cost per unit with each of the facilities. So it's -- I think it's relatively modest in the -- from an overall profitability of managing both -- we had a little bit of extra cost here in the third quarter. We had to ship some products between the facilities to get the inventory rightsized moving forward. But now that, that's corrected, it's a relatively modest impact on overall profitability to manage both sites.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rob Mason with Baird. You may now go ahead.\nRob Mason: Hi, guys. Good morning. Just maybe just a follow-up on the last question. When will this North American distribution center transition be complete and I guess, consolidated into one facility?\nNathan Winters: So we don't -- we do not have a time frame lined up of when we'll completely exit. We've signed an agreement to stay down in Texas for the foreseeable future to ensure that we properly ramp the new facility in the right way and make sure it's -- we fully mitigate any potential risk to the future operations. And so once that that's clear, we're in shape, that's when we'll start to work on whether that -- how to complete the transition, but there's no time line set to date.\nRob Mason: Sure. Sure. There was also mentioned that you will be taking some pricing actions in Europe outside the US to address currency. When will those price actions be realized? Will start to show up? And then I'm just curious as well, what was the actual FX impact on your gross margin in the quarter?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So if you look at the two latest price increases we announced, they really won't have no impact until we get into next year just based on the timing of the agreements we have with our distributors. I would say, it's relatively modest compared to the previously announced price increases as it's focused around Latin America business as well as in Europe where we've already made several other pricing actions. So it's -- I'd say it's modest compared to the three we've done up to this point. If you look at it from an FX perspective, in the third quarter, it was about a one point negative impact on EBITDA margin. And as we go into the fourth quarter, FX has about a two-point negative impact year-on-year on EBITDA margin.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Chung with JP Morgan. You may now go ahead.\nPaul Chung: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So you mentioned kind of a steady reduction in 2023, our supply chain costs here a nice execution here in the second half. But can that cost move down materially in 2023 on a quarterly run rate from that $30 million to $35 million, especially as you move more products to see -- I assume there will be some lingering costs here moving forward, but just any comments there would be helpful.\nNathan Winters: Yes. So I'd say as we look at it going into next year, obviously, we think there's -- just based on the second half run rate, there will be a meaningful improvement from a year-on-year perspective. And I'd say at this point, steady is probably the right word in terms of how we're looking at it. And a lot of this has to do with how freight rates hold up. So I think based on what we've seen, they've held steady to slightly down since kind of middle of the second quarter, which is really positive. But at any moment, they can swing another way if there's any other type of supply chain shocks in the system. But yes, we would expect again, steady improvement from the second half run rate as we go into next year.\nPaul Chung: Great. That's helpful. And then on inventories, I know there's a lot of moving pieces, but can you give us a sense for kind of timing of more accelerated harvesting, I mean, do you see any risk to kind of discounting or given the elevated levels here, or is this more about converting on some of the larger deferred products? And then as we look to 2023, when can we expect to see kind of more normalized free cash flow conversion, or is this more of a second half 2023, kind of excluding the Honeywell payment. Thank you.\nNathan Winters: Yes. So maybe I'll start with the second part of that. As we look at our inventory, we'd expect this to draw down through the first half and get to maybe, say, normalized levels as we enter the second half of next year, which we think is somewhere between $600 million and $650 million of inventory. That's based on the size of the company today plus the acquisitions, as well as intentionally holding more strategic component inventory than we have in the past to improve resiliency. We have a team dedicated and working on this. A big driver of that is finishing -- getting the DC move, stabilized. We've also made several moves within our supplies business in terms of manufacturing where we've had to build some buffer stock and working through that. And for the product categories or components that that have recovered, we are planning to draw down our safety stock at our manufacturing partners over the next several quarters. And that's really the big driver of where we'll see the reduction in working capital. But as you mentioned, we expect all these actions to enable us to significantly reduce working capital and deliver free cash flow conversion above 100% if you exclude the settlement payments. And then to your first question, we have no concerns that the inventory levels create any type of risk from an excess obsolescence perspective. We have strong demand for what we have in both finished goods as well as component parts. And then there's no intention of reducing pricing beyond what's normally required in the competitive environment. I'd say alternatively, we're pushing that we have stock available for customers who may have been waiting on certainty of supply before placing an order, so using it as an opportunity.\nOperator: This concludes your question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gustafsson for any closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you. So to wrap up, I would like to thank our partners, customers and employees for their continued support. Our top priority is to meet our customers' mission-critical needs as we take bold actions to address our supply chain challenges, and we look forward to a strong finish to the year. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joe Heel",
            "content": "Yes. To put it in perspective, perhaps in terms of the miss to the outlook, the deferral of project was a minor contributor to that. Among these -- the deferral of projects, these late-in-the-quarter deferments were a relatively small number of larger projects, as Anders said, deferred primarily into 2023. That's probably as much as we can say. Yes. I'll add two things perhaps for perspective. One is an example of what we're seeing is a large customer who will take an order that they would have perhaps placed in Q3 or early in Q4. And now telling us we're going to split that order, and we're going to take 80% of it now and 20% of it later in 2023. That's an example of the type of thing we're getting. So it feels like there's real demand behind the order. The other thing that we're hearing from customers quite consistently is while some customers, in particular, retailers are being cautious about their business, about their revenue expectations, and those are obviously visible to you in what they say on their earnings calls. They are telling us that their investments in IT and in the types of solutions that we provide them are important to them even in more uncertain times because they need to improve their productivity, and we help them do that with our solutions. So that's certainly something we hear pretty consistently. Yes. Maybe I'll just amplify some of Anders' points. Number one, the growth in the medium-sized customers and also in the run rate has been particularly encouraging for us because that's where our supply constraints are particularly important, right? If you have supply, you get run rate. When we had supply return, our run rate rebounded. And that was a really good sign of the resilience of our run rate. That's very encouraging for us. You asked about which size of customer goes into the cycle first. And what we saw is that as we entered into the pandemic, the largest customers were the first to accelerate their purchases. And they were followed nine, 12 months later by medium-sized and smaller customers than also accelerating their purchases. Now as we're seeing some caution in the market, it's -- again, the largest customers that are being cautious first, some of the deferrals that we've referred to and that you asked about were larger customers with large orders while the medium-sized and small customers continue to go very strong with even double-digit growth. So that's the dynamic that we're seeing in the cycle. Hopefully, that's helpful. Yes. When it comes to the run rate, it really matters what's on the shelf, right? You have small customers that are calling into distributor and what's on the shelf counts. And once we had product on the shelf again as our supply chain ramped up again over the course of the quarter, we saw that run rate rebounding. So I think that's the dynamic that there's no pull forward or that dynamic doesn't exist to that same extent in the run rate. When it comes to the larger customers, to the deferrals, we are talking about large customers that are typically doing deployments of mobile computers. You see it's pretty concentrated in the mobile computing segment. You have certain deployments that they have been planning and in some cases. But again, they were very few, and they were the minor reason for the miss in the quarter, right? But in those few cases, we're talking about deployments of mobile computers which are stretched out over a slightly longer time period, we think, into the first quarter of next year. Yes. But there are some indications, Damian, that give us confidence that the deployment will occur. One of them is that they're taking an order and splitting it into two, right, as I've described to you. The other is that they're already working with us on deployment plans. We do see those stock signs not in every case, but in the majority of cases. So that's why we're describing it as we are. And maybe a little bit of additional color. With the business being in sort of the early stages of development, what you look for primarily are pilot deployments, right? And we're seeing a very good stream of these pilot deployments. We were also very pleased to have two larger deployments already that we mentioned, I think, in the earlier -- in the previous earnings call already that are anchor tenants, I guess, now for our Fetch Robotics business going forward. One other strength, Brian, to add perhaps is -- this is a business that's conducted predominantly through the channel. And we have used our strength in the channel to recruit a strong number of channel partners, many of which are somewhat disillusioned with other incumbents in the market. And that's been a great attraction for people to come to us because they know us as a very good channel partner for them. So that's helped us also."

            "name": "Anders Gustafsson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. For the quarter, we realized a sales decline of 3%, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1%, a 60 basis point decrease; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.12, a 9% decrease from the prior year. We were unable to fulfill all orders due to supply chain challenges related to persistent component shortages for certain products as well as disruption in the transition to our new North American distribution center in the Chicago area. These challenges led to lower throughput than planned late in the quarter. This, along with orders from some large customers being deferred contributed to the lower-than-expected results. In North America and EMEA, cycling two prior year large mobile computing deployments and suspension of sales in Russia resulted in the sales declines. Our Asia Pacific and Latin America regions were bright spots in the quarter with double-digit sales growth. Globally, we realized sales growth with our small and medium-sized customers, which was more than offset by a decline from our large customers. From a solutions offering perspective, we drove growth across data capture, printing, supplies, services and software. These helped to partially offset the sales decline in mobile computing. We expanded gross margin over the prior year, despite significant FX pressure, yet EBITDA margin contracted and EPS declined due to the deleveraging of operating expenses from the sales decline. We have initiated meaningful actions to address the supply chain challenges, which was the primary driver for our results. These include, organizational changes and the reallocation of resources to drive improved focus and execution in our supply chain, initiating specific actions with our supply chain partners to improve operations and extending the planned transition of our North America distribution center to mitigate execution risk. Customer demand and our order pipeline generally remains healthy, yet has slowed since late Q3. Given the macroeconomic uncertainty, we see elongated sales cycles and certain projects being deferred. As a result, we are taking a cautious approach to our Q4 sales outlook and expense management while working to rightsize our working capital levels in the coming quarters to improve free cash flow conversion. At the same time, we continue to prudently invest in initiatives that advance our solutions offerings. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q3 financial results in more detail and discuss our fourth quarter outlook. Thank you, Nathan. The long-term fundamental drivers of our business remain strong. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, which have been magnified through the pandemic. This value proposition resonates with customers in any macroeconomic environment as it improves productivity and inventory accuracy among an extensive list of other operational benefits. As we have expanded our portfolio with compelling solutions, we have elevated our strategic position with our customers. Our trusted relationships with our partners across the globe augment our capabilities, enabling us to serve more customers worldwide. Our new fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions resonated well with customers and partners at recent trade shows in Stuttgart, Germany and Boston, Massachusetts. Our booths featured advanced optical character recognition supported by deep learning capabilities gained through our 2021 Adaptive Vision acquisition. Our comprehensive offering has put us in a strong competitive position. Now turning to Slide 12. Businesses partner with Zebra to optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet the increasing demands of consumers. Zebra solutions continue to represent a necessary investment, and I would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets A large North American retailer recently selected Zebra's TC52 mobile computers for their stable network connection, durability and camera performance. This customer maximizes value from Zebra solutions by combining our mobile computers with our Reflexis workforce and task management, Zebra Prescriptive Analytics and Intuit software. This combination enables the retailer to improve inventory accuracy and the omni-channel shopping experience for their customers. A North American-based fast food chain has chosen Zebra's handheld RFID solution to enhance inventory management. This solution will enable each restaurant to reap the benefits of a more digitized supply chain by streamlining the process to track and trace inventory from its suppliers to the restaurant. Adoption of this technology will assist the customer to comply with the Food Safety Modernization Act. A transportation company in Europe has begun rolling out approximately 20,000 mobile tablets to streamline their vehicle rental process. Zebra's exceptional service and integrated product offerings displaced a competitor and will enable associates to complete vehicle workarounds inspections in the reservation process more efficiently. The convenience store chain in Latin America is expanding their use of Zebra solutions from the distribution center to the front of store with more than 50,000 Zebra mobile computers, printers and tablets. Deployment of these Zebra solutions is expected to significantly increase productivity, inventory accuracy and improve shopper satisfaction. Zebra's Mobility DNA software, which enables intuitive device management and our compelling customer value proposition were key differentiators in this competitive win. Apparel manufacturer, BMC, recently selected Zebra's autonomous mobile robots and fixed industrial scanners for their new 50,000 square foot North American facility. Zebra collaborated with a major partner to develop a solution that would enable a flexible workflow and enhanced visibility along each step of the production line. By combining our autonomous mobile robots and fixed industrial scanners, BMC will realize powerful synergies with scanners tracking each step of production in directing the robots along the workflow. The robots streamline associates movements, enabling faster fulfillment. This flexible and scalable solution was preferred to a traditional fixed conveyance system because it saves a vital warehouse space and adjusts to demand. Additionally, we recently secured a large win with a major European retailer who selected Zebra's fixed industrial scanners to significantly reduce scan time, increasing throughput at several thousand packing stations, resulting in a faster than one-year payback on investment. Zebra's collaboration with the customer and a valued partner was integral to this competitive win. As we turn to Slide 13, I want to reiterate that the actions we have taken to address our challenges with North American distribution, elevated inventory levels and increased macroeconomic headwinds. We have executed key organizational changes and have initiated specific actions with our supply chain partners to stabilize operations and reallocate resources to address immediate challenges. We are also taking decisive steps to rationalize inventory while maintaining optimal levels of strategic components. Additionally, we are taking prudent cost actions as we realized softening demand and implementing additional pricing actions to address FX and inflation. In closing, we continue to be very optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for our business. We have the broadest portfolio of tailored solutions to enable our customers to improve their operations in any environment. The global labor deficit and on-demand economy have escalated the need for enterprises to digitize and automate their operations with our solutions. Now I will hand the call back over to Mike. Good morning, Tommy. Yes. First, I'd say the -- we're getting some mixed signals from the market on on-demand pictures and that's, to some degree, clouded by the supply chain challenges we're seeing. But most signals, most demand signals we are seeing are constructive. Our backlog is healthy. Our pipeline is building nicely. Our run rate business is strong. And we continue to see some nice areas of strength in each region. And our retail vertical grew just even though we had a very large customer pulling back into this year and particularly in the quarter. But we have also seen some elongated sales cycles and a bit of softening in demand where some customers have pushed out some orders from Q3 into 2023. So the -- I think most -- I'll ask Joe for some extra color here also as most of those pushouts have come from the retail segment. That's also our largest segment, so it wouldn't be surprising and they tend to have more of the year-end spend that they're working on. So the overall environment is still quite healthy, but we have seen some select pushouts, Joe? Yes. From an organizational perspective, we have made some changes. We have promoted a new supply chain leader who leads our global operations and supply chain team. So -- and we have also streamlined the organization a bit and moved some functions or responsibilities out of supply chain to other areas to make sure we can get greater focus and better accountability around those. We've also worked closely with our supply chain partners to make sure we take some actions with them to help improve the operations. One that Nathan talked about was ramping up our Dallas Fort Worth facilities. So they're back at close to full capacity. They're almost fully staffed and operating very well at the moment. And we're working with our Chicago area, DC partner also to see how we can best help them scale their operations there. Good morning. I think it's -- probably don't want to give too much color on that also here at this stage, but the expectation is that won't -- they're slipping from this year into the beginning of next year, not the end of next year. I would agree with that, yes. Yes. Starting with the SMB business, yes, we did see strong growth globally for our small- and medium-sized customers. I think that's a good indication of kind of the confidence the broader market has in the outlook and the value that our solutions offer. The secular trends that we talked about to digitize and automate workflows and empower the frontline workers are, I would say, much more important today in a labor-constrained environment as that drives greater increase for our type of solutions across all verticals and all sizes of customers. And I think the our run rate business performed particularly well globally this quarter, which I think is -- gives us confidence around the health of the business. If you talk about kind of which verticals would be more or less impacted, I'd say, we probably get them -- gotten the most questions around our retail customer base, historically in this. And here, I mentioned earlier, our retail and e-commerce business grew in Q3 despite very challenging comps from the very large -- particularly large retailer that has been pulling back. And I think that highlights the value of having a very diversified retail e-commerce customer base, where the timing of the refresh cycles is kind of spread out and that helps to reduce volatility risks. But I think the -- in retail specifically, the focus on -- or the importance of our type of solutions to enable our customers to execute on their omni-channel and e-commerce strategies is very important. I've talked about how we believe that our solutions are now more like, say, an ERP implementation, it's harder to dial them up and down. And I think the results from Q3 gives some credence to that expectation. I'd say our health care business, which performed very well in Q2 -- in Q3, sorry, was up double digits. That is probably the vertical we expect to be the least sensitive to \u2013 to kind of recessionary forces. And here, we are also very focused on helping to transform that industry to \u2013 to be able to improve the patient journey and drive greater productivity for health care providers. The T&L vertical is -- there was one that was the hardest hit was the only vertical that was down for us in Q3. But e-commerce volumes are expected to continue to increase, and that drives greater need for real-time visibility into their overall supply chain and is a key driver for customer investments. And we enabled the last mile fulfillment for those customers, which is an important factor as consumers are expecting faster deliveries. And lastly, around manufacturing, that also tends to be -- it's a market that is more a largest in Asia for us, but it is global, and it's done very well for us over the last year or so and had a good double-digit growth this quarter. Here, we've made some -- both the -- some of the new acquisitions around -- from May trucks. And Fetch are expanding our offering and we're getting a lot of interest and early orders for manufacturing in those areas. And we've also made some quite significant and very deliberate investments in our go-to-market resources to help grow our share in manufacturing, and Joe can provide some more color on that. Yes. First, on the strength on the run rate business here. I think that the -- we -- I would say we don't see our customers large or small, having say, pulled forward demand and invested ahead of their capacity utilization curves with probably one exception -- one large exception. So -- and specifically for our large -- for our small and midsized customers, they tend not to have their financial capacity to invest for in advance. So they tend to be much more as the projects roll out to address more urgent business needs for them. So that would be one point on that. Joe? Good morning. Yes. So first on the cancellation. We have not seen any large order cancellations. I think the cancellations have been very modest. And to the extent we've had any and within what we would consider to be normal. Every quarter, we have some people who cancel an order or something like that. But that's been -- that's not been a factor in the results or in the outlook here. And the deferrals they have -- they're not pause, they just deferred. So they're -- we're expecting them to come back in the first part of next year. And the -- it's not like -- they are deploying, in the meantime, not just at the same pace as they had otherwise expected. We closed Matrox in early June. And certainly very pleased with how that's going. It creates a very comprehensive portfolio, both fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions for us. That kind of fills out our offering very nicely. I'd say we're very encouraged by progress Matrox is performing very well, and the integration is proceeding as per our plans. I think there's a very good culture fit between our organizations. We are also building out our partners. And that's going well. These are very specialized partners who provide these types of implementation and design services. And we've been seeing good traction in being able to recruit those partners to our program. So we're certainly very excited about what's going on with Matrox. And similarly, on Fetch, I say there's a lot of interest from \u2013 from warehouse operators across all our vertical markets as well as in manufacturing for our Fetch Robotic Solutions. And our ability to really combine the frontline worker, the automation of the frontline worker and the Fetch robot to automate -- orchestrate and automate the broader workflow has been resonating very well. And we're seeing -- yes, we're seeing a lot of interest, and it's obviously a smaller business, but it's ramping quite nicely. Yes. First, I'll say that we don't see this as a zero-sum game. There's a lot of white space for us to go after without having to kind of go up and seek out opportunities where we compete with any specific competitor. It is also a very fragmented market. I think that the market leader has probably about 20% or no more than 20% market share. So there's plenty of opportunities to pursue without having to do that. That being said, I think we feel good about the value propositions that we have with Matrox. It is known for having a very some high-quality, high-performance solutions that can solve some very complicated problems for our customers. We worked hard on -- across our fixed investors scanning machine vision portfolio to drive ease of use as a differentiator to make it as easy for our customers to deploy and get time to revenue for these solutions. And that's been, I think, resonating back very well. Also, the software upgradability of our products is a differentiator. And we've had some very nice wins against a variety of different competitors with some large marquee customers. So we feel quite excited about it. The -- I would say, the mid-term outlook was predominantly explained by the supply chain challenges related to the persistent component shortages for certain products and the disruption in the transition to our new North America warehouse. And there's probably about 45% -- $45 million on each of those. And the smallest part was the deferral of projects with about 10% of the miss to our outlook. So clearly, the supply -- the DC move was the largest part of this."

            "name": "Nathan Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q3, adjusted net sales declined 4%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and down 3.2% on an organic basis, primarily due to supply chain challenges and lower sales to large customers. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment increased 12.4%, driven by double-digit growth in both printing and supplies as product availability has continued to generally improve. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 8.8% due to supply chain bottlenecks, including component shortages. We realized particularly strong growth in data capture solutions, including RFID and as well as rugged tablets. We also drove growth across services and software with strong service attach rates and attractive software offerings. Performance was mixed across our regions. Asia Pacific sales grew 20% with broad-based strength across the region, including China. Latin America sales increased 10% with exceptional growth in Mexico. And in North America and EMEA, sales decreased 9% and 2%, respectively, due to the supply chain challenges, lower sales to large customers and the suspension of sales in Russia. Adjusted gross margin increased 80 basis points to 45.8% and due to favorable business mix and lower premium supply chain costs, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Adjusted operating expenses increased due to acquisitions and delevered by 60 basis points due to the sales decline. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.1%, a 60 basis point decrease from the prior year period due to expense deleveraging on lower sales. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.12, a 9.5% year-over-year decrease. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. For the first nine months of 2022, we generated $170 million of free cash flow, which was significantly lower than last year, primarily due to a higher use of working capital due to elevated inventory and sales volume shifting to later in the quarter. Higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance and $90 million of previously announced settlement payments. We made $50 million of share repurchases and invested $6 million in venture investments in the third quarter. We ended the quarter at a comfortable 1.7 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio and with more than $1.2 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility. On Slide 8, we highlight that premium supply chain costs have improved from peak levels. The actions we have taken to redesign products, targeted price increases as well as the improving freight capacity have enabled us to reduce purchases on the spot market and reduce the freight cost impact. We are on plan to move printer shipments to ocean from air late this year and into early 2023. For the full year 2022, we now expect approximately $190 million of premium supply chain costs over pre-pandemic 2019 levels, a $10 million reduction from our prior outlook. In Q3, we incurred premium supply chain costs of $30 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, which was favorable to what we had anticipated in our prior outlook. In total, Q3 transitory items had a combined favorable gross margin impact of $14 million year-over-year. And in Q4 are expected to be approximately $35 million, which is a nearly $30 million reduction year-on-year. Let's now turn to our outlook. Q4 sales are expected to be approximately flat from the prior year period, with a range of negative 2% to positive 1% growth. As compared to our prior outlook, the lower sales growth is driven by softening demand, continued supply chain challenges and currency headwinds. We are confident in this guide given our relatively strong order backlog, improved quarter-to-date shipment activity and actions taken to stabilize North American distribution. We estimate a two-point additive impact from recently acquired businesses and a four-point negative impact from foreign currency changes. As a reminder, approximately 25% of our global sales are denominated in euros. We anticipate Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 22% and 23%, which is an increase from both the prior year and the prior quarter. Given our tempered view of the demand environment, we are taking a conservative approach to managing operating expenses while preserving strategic growth investments. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.80. We now expect our free cash flow to be at least $400 million for the year, which we have significantly reduced from our prior outlook due to lower profits and elevated inventory levels that we will be working down into 2023 as we rationalize safety stock and execute on our North America distribution transition. Sales seasonality has improved to more normalized levels in Q4, which should drive the peak cash flow quarter for 2022. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision with our customers. Tommy, this is Nathan. I'll start with the first part. Just a little bit of background. We selected a new DC location midway through last year. And as we said on the call, we had some issues with the transition impacting shipment volumes late in the quarter, and we've implemented corrective actions, particularly on ramping back our Texas facility. That gives us some additional time to work through the transition, both from a people and process perspective. So again, I'd say although we didn't deliver the shipment volumes necessary to meet the Q3 forecast. We are now operating at levels required to deliver Q4. Still not where we want to be. But again, the Texas facility is nearly staffed to full capacity and we've had a really nice recovery here in deliveries in October. Just as context, we've shipped out nearly $200 million more in October than we did in the month of July, which is giving us both confidence in the performance of the DC as well as confidence in the Q4 guidance. I'll pass it over to Anders. Yes. So Andrew, maybe just context for the broader premium supply chain costs. I think what we saw in Q3 was a positive momentum, 50% reduction from what we experienced in Q2, decreasing from nearly 4% of revenue to just over 2%. And that was primarily driven by the declining shipping cost per kilo, which we're experiencing as well as benefiting from the pricing actions beginning to take effect with the price increase we did in July. Q3 shipping costs did come in below estimate. We also benefited, if you look at the mix and the $30 million for the quarter from lower North American revenue, and that's the other reason for it ticking back up in the fourth quarter in terms of overall transitory. And our Q4 guide assumes no improvement in freight rates. So it's something we're continuing to monitor it. But if you look at the overall reduction from $200 million to $190 million in premium supply chain costs, some of that's volume driven, just over half, but also $4 million of that or so was due to the lower rates we're experiencing. And I think our expectation is that we will see steady reduction into 2023 around these costs as long as the freight rates hold where they're at today. And then we're going to continue to transition from air to ocean, really late here in the fourth quarter. We did some ocean shipments into Europe in the third quarter but we really don't expect ocean shipments to pick up until late here in the fourth quarter and into 2023. And we've also seen a nice reduction in what we've had to buy in critical components on the spot market. So we're starting to see that loosen up as well. So again, we feel confident that we'll see a steady decrease. And EBITDA benefit as we go into next year. Yes. A couple of drivers behind the OpEx flexibility. I mean the first is based on our variable comp structure, there's an element of variability in there relative to how we're performing for the year. The other one is, we did a hard look at where we're hiring and what roles and what positions around the world to ensure that where we're adding heads and investing is in our growth areas that we would kind of look at and say, there's no regrets in that in terms of those hiring. So it's a combination of those two, along with, again, continuing looking at discretionary spending where it makes sense. So I think those are the three main drivers here in the short-term. And as we go into next year, we're continuing to look at where we can drive efficiencies, looking at our real estate portfolio, but all the things you would expect us to do particularly as we go into a more challenging macro environment. So that's -- this was per our plan. We expected Q3 to start the modest shipments into Europe, which we did from an ocean perspective, but the plan and the guide around our premium costs had always assumed we wouldn't really feel any financial benefit to the move until we get into next year. As the priority for this year was to ensure we delivered enough printer volume to take care of our backlog as well as ensure we have the right products on the shelf to support our run rate business. Keith, I would say it's relatively modest in terms of the cost structure we have with both of those facilities in terms of typically pay on a cost per unit with each of the facilities. So it's -- I think it's relatively modest in the -- from an overall profitability of managing both -- we had a little bit of extra cost here in the third quarter. We had to ship some products between the facilities to get the inventory rightsized moving forward. But now that, that's corrected, it's a relatively modest impact on overall profitability to manage both sites. So we don't -- we do not have a time frame lined up of when we'll completely exit. We've signed an agreement to stay down in Texas for the foreseeable future to ensure that we properly ramp the new facility in the right way and make sure it's -- we fully mitigate any potential risk to the future operations. And so once that that's clear, we're in shape, that's when we'll start to work on whether that -- how to complete the transition, but there's no time line set to date. Yes. So if you look at the two latest price increases we announced, they really won't have no impact until we get into next year just based on the timing of the agreements we have with our distributors. I would say, it's relatively modest compared to the previously announced price increases as it's focused around Latin America business as well as in Europe where we've already made several other pricing actions. So it's -- I'd say it's modest compared to the three we've done up to this point. If you look at it from an FX perspective, in the third quarter, it was about a one point negative impact on EBITDA margin. And as we go into the fourth quarter, FX has about a two-point negative impact year-on-year on EBITDA margin. Yes. So I'd say as we look at it going into next year, obviously, we think there's -- just based on the second half run rate, there will be a meaningful improvement from a year-on-year perspective. And I'd say at this point, steady is probably the right word in terms of how we're looking at it. And a lot of this has to do with how freight rates hold up. So I think based on what we've seen, they've held steady to slightly down since kind of middle of the second quarter, which is really positive. But at any moment, they can swing another way if there's any other type of supply chain shocks in the system. But yes, we would expect again, steady improvement from the second half run rate as we go into next year. Yes. So maybe I'll start with the second part of that. As we look at our inventory, we'd expect this to draw down through the first half and get to maybe, say, normalized levels as we enter the second half of next year, which we think is somewhere between $600 million and $650 million of inventory. That's based on the size of the company today plus the acquisitions, as well as intentionally holding more strategic component inventory than we have in the past to improve resiliency. We have a team dedicated and working on this. A big driver of that is finishing -- getting the DC move, stabilized. We've also made several moves within our supplies business in terms of manufacturing where we've had to build some buffer stock and working through that. And for the product categories or components that that have recovered, we are planning to draw down our safety stock at our manufacturing partners over the next several quarters. And that's really the big driver of where we'll see the reduction in working capital. But as you mentioned, we expect all these actions to enable us to significantly reduce working capital and deliver free cash flow conversion above 100% if you exclude the settlement payments. And then to your first question, we have no concerns that the inventory levels create any type of risk from an excess obsolescence perspective. We have strong demand for what we have in both finished goods as well as component parts. And then there's no intention of reducing pricing beyond what's normally required in the competitive environment. I'd say alternatively, we're pushing that we have stock available for customers who may have been waiting on certainty of supply before placing an order, so using it as an opportunity."

After today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Steele: Good morning and welcome to Zebra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least 1 year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Anders Gustafsson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Anders will begin with our second quarter results. Then Nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our revised 2022 outlook. Anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer will join us as we take your questions. Now let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Anders.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our team delivered solid second quarter results in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we realized sales growth of nearly 7% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.9%, a 170 basis point decrease, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.61, a 1% increase from the prior year. Customer demand remains strong for our solutions which digitize and automate workflows. We realized double-digit sales growth in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America and a slight decline in North America on strong prior comparisons. We realized growth across all major offerings including printing where we recovered nicely from a challenge in Q1. Our health care, manufacturing, and retail and e-commerce end markets each grew faster than the corporate average. Our teams successfully navigated the China COVID lockdowns and our actions to redesign certain products and secure long-term purchase agreements enabled us to generate more supply, particularly for printers. We also scaled adjusted operating expenses to drive profitability, while continuing to prudently invest in our growth initiatives. Overall, we are pleased that our second quarter sales performance was near the high-end of our expectations, and EPS exceeded our guidance range as our team executed well on our efforts to mitigate supply chain challenges. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q2 financial results in more detail and discuss our revised 2022 outlook.\nNathan Winters: Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q2, adjusted net sales increased 6.4%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 6.9%. on an organic basis as we secured a greater supply of certain products than we had anticipated. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment, including printing and supplies increased 9.7%, driven by a strong recovery in printing as we secured critical components to better satisfy record levels of customer demand. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 5.6% with solid growth in both data capture and mobile computing solutions. We realized particularly strong growth in RFID solutions as well as ruggedized tablets in Q2. We also continue to drive solid growth across services and software with strong service attached rates and attractive software offerings. We realized strong growth in three of our four regions. EMEA sales increased 17%, driven by particularly strong growth in mobile computing and printing, inclusive of the impact of exiting Russia in March. Asia Pacific sales grew 14% with particular strength in India. Latin America sales increased 16% with exceptional growth in Mexico. And in North America sales decreased 2% due to supply constraints. We also cycled particularly strong mobile computing sales volumes in Q2 of last year. Adjusted gross margin declined 200 basis points to 46% due to higher premium supply chain costs and China import tariff recovery in the prior year period, partially offset by higher service and software margin. Adjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 60 basis points. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.9%, a 170 basis point decrease from the prior year period. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.61, a 0.9% year-over-year increase held by lower share count and lower taxes. Note, that in the quarter, we entered into a settlement agreement resulting in a $372 million one-time non-GAAP charge, which will be paid out over eight quarterly installments. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. For the first half of 2022, we generated $123 million of free cash flow, which was lower than the last year primarily due to a higher use of working capital as sales volume shifted to later in the period due to the China lockdowns; higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance; and the initial $45 million quarterly installment payment related to the settlement I just mentioned. From a balance sheet perspective, as previously announced, we have significantly increased our available borrowing capacity to align with our growing business to optimize our capital structure. Our new credit facility provides us ample flexibility for organic and inorganic investment, including the recent acquisition and Matrox Imaging, as well as share repurchases through our recently announced $1 billion incremental authorization. We made $300 million of share repurchases in Q2, and from a debt leverage perspective we ended the quarter at a comfortable 1.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. On Slide 8, we highlight that premium supply chain costs have sequentially improved from peak levels. Our team has been successfully working all avenues including product redesigns, and negotiating long-term supply agreements for critical components, which has enabled us to reduce our purchases in the spot market. We have been seeing steady improvement in the supply chain environment, which we continue to closely monitor. In Q2, we incurred incremental premium supply chain costs of $56 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, which was favorable to what we had anticipated in our prior outlook. In total, Q2 transitory items had a combined unfavorable gross margin impact of $35 million year-over-year and in Q3 are expected to be approximately $45 million, which is a neutral year-on-year impact net of pricing. Let's now turn to our outlook. We ended the second half of the year with a strong quarter backlog and healthy sales pipeline supported by broad based demand for our solutions. We have been experiencing a steady improvement in manufacturing output, however, our sales growth continues to be limited by extended lead times and availability of certain component parts. Our organic growth has also been impacted by approximately 1 to 2 points after stopping shipments to Russia in March. For Q3, we are limiting our sales growth to a range of 2% to 4% due to actions to reduce expedited air freight costs, and shift our printer products to ocean shipments, which will improve both Q4 growth and profitability. We're also assuming a 2 point additive impact from recently acquired businesses and a 3 point negative impact from foreign currency translation. As a reminder, approximately 25% of our global sales are denominated in Euros. We anticipate Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 22%, which is an increase from both prior year and prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. For the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our outlook with a sales growth range between 4% and 6% inclusive of the impact of exiting Russia. We are also assuming 150 basis point additive impact from recently acquired businesses and a 225 basis point negative impact from foreign currency translation. We now anticipate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22%, the low end of our prior guide primarily due to the significantly stronger U.S dollar. Profit margins are expected to improve in the second half of the year as we continue to shift to lower cost freight options and prudently manage operating expenses and investments. We now expect our free cash flow to be at least $650 million for the year, which we have reduced primarily due to the approximately $150 million of settlement related payments. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Nathan. We are entering the second half of the year in a position of strength as we closely monitor the volatile global macro environment. We have a track record of protecting profitability and cash flow in any environment, while preserving investments that drive sustainable, profitable growth. I am encouraged by the continued strong demand we are seeing across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to mitigate the supply chain impacts. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges which have been magnified since the pandemic. As we have extended our lead in industry and expanded our portfolio with compelling solutions, we have elevated our strategic position with our customers. Our trusted relationships with our 10,000 plus partners across the globe augment our capabilities, enabling us to serve more customers worldwide. And we are always excited to engage with partners who drive value. We are excited about our new global strategic alliance with Accenture, which focuses on solving complex operational challenges in retail and other end markets with Zebra solutions. We are collaborating to advance our customers strategies to drive productivity, inventory accuracy and customer service levels, among a variety of other benefits that can be realized by digitizing and automating workflows throughout the enterprise. Now turning to Slide 12, businesses partner with Zebra to help optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet the increasing demands of consumers. I would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets. A major global transportation logistics company is expanding its relationship with Zebra across multiple product lines to ensure a more accurate package loading using RFID technology across many sites. Zebras RFID printers and scanners are integral to flagging packages loaded into the wrong truck in real time, using RFID technology before the vehicle leaves the location. Zebra also supplied more than 3,000 tablets to assist associates in moving trailers around the yard, ensuring the most efficient placement of trucks, trailers and packages. A large supermarket operator in Europe, with more than double its fleet of Zebra enterprise mobile computers in a multiyear rollout covering warehouse, front and back of store and curbside pickup use cases, displacing consumer cell phones. The customer expects improved productivity benefits through better product availability, faster execution on click and collect use cases, and real time price checking as they drive towards the zero food waste goal. This expansion win results from the exceptional service and trust established over our longstanding relationship and throughout the RFP process. In another recent win, a major U.S convenience store chain added additional mobile computers in each of its more than 2,000 stores to augment its inventory management and merchandising use cases. This customer has a deep penetration of Zebra solutions, including our printers, mobile computers and scanners to digitize and automate its workflows. Several years ago, this customer had implemented other Zebra solutions in its warehouses, and have subsequently selected Zebra for additional use cases, as it addressed other business challenges. Additionally, a significant U.S health care product distributor expanded their use of Zebra solutions, equipping their warehouse staff with wrist and ring scanners to improve efficiency in the pick and pack use cases for their warehouse associates. Zebra collaborated with the customer and partner to ensure e-supporting  of their applications to the Android operating system. We're also very pleased to be making progress in our most recent expansion markets, fixed industrial scanning, machine vision and autonomous mobile robots. We close on the purchase of Matrox Imaging in early June, and we join them at the automated warehouse trade show in Detroit. We are excited to add Matrox Imaging leading comprehensive portfolio of machine vision solutions, along with many specialized channel partners to help us scale our combined business. At automate, we also highlighted our Fetch Autonomous Mobile Robot Fulfillment solution, which we have been deploying at third-party logistics provider Rakuten. And we are excited about another recent key win with Maersk, an integrated logistics company. Additionally, Fetch AMR conveyance  and material movement solutions continues strong traction in use cases for health care supply delivery, automotive spare parts conveyance  and waste removal. In closing, our actions have enabled us to begin to recover from industry wide supply chain challenges and we continue to be very excited about our growth prospects as we monitor the volatile macro environment. The global labor deficit and supply chain challenges have escalated the need for enterprises to digitize and automate their operations with our solutions. We have the broadest portfolio of tailored solutions to help our customers advance their strategies. Now I will hand the call back over to Mike.\nMike Steele: Thanks, Anders. We will now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible.\nOperator:  Our first question is from Tommy Moll of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions.\nAnders Gustafsson: Good morning.\nNathan Winters: Good morning.\nTommy Moll: Anders, I wanted to start with a discussion of the omni-channel and e-commerce end markets. Your underlying volumes from what we can tell seem to be pretty strong there still. At the same time, there's been some mixed headlines from some of the key players there. So I'm just curious, what can you tell us anecdotally, from customers or across the business about the pace of that end market? Does it continue to grow? Does it feel healthy? Are you seeing anything deteriorate in terms of the fundamentals? The extent you can confirm on the guidance that you've provided, do you still see that those end markets growing in the second half? Thank you.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, I'll try to give as much color as I can here. I'll start little bit more on current performance which we saw in Q2 and then try to give you a little bit of a sense of how the -- how we look at the future here. But first, I just say that the trends to digitize and automate workflows and empower frontline workers that continues to accelerate and in driving increased customer demand for our solutions across all our vertical markets. Retail and e-commerce grew faster than the corporate average in Q2 -- still very strong prior comparisons. We do continue to see strong momentum of omni-channel implementations, which is -- which are straining our customers resources and that's also driving investments in technology and automation that is necessary for retailers to continue to transform their businesses. If you look at the -- in the actual store, expanding buyer line pickup, install use cases and delivery use cases require retailers to equip more associated with mobile computers, along with -- also implementing more workflow software optimization solutions. And in the warehouse we see investments in productivity and visibility as essential to their transformation. We've also expanded with some new attractive go-to-market partnerships like Microsoft and Google that helps to elevate our strategic positioning within the retail vertical as well as other verticals. And we have a very diversified retail e-commerce customer base, and each of those customers are on their own refresh cycle, which helps to reduce volatility for us. I also say that our pipelines remain very strong. And although this is a quite a challenging environment, there are several retailers who have recently publicly talked about their intend to maintain investments in technology as they try to continue to drive or execute on their visions and their strategies. There are certainly a few customers that are ahead of their investment curves. But I would say most are playing catch up with investments in solutions like ours, particularly in a labor constrained environment, where they need to improve productivity, inventory accuracy and customer service levels. So as I would say, this feels more like a normal year for us and that most customers are investing and proceeding with healthy -- healthily with their plans. But there are some they're pulling back a bit. But this is the value that we have of a diversified customer portfolio that allows us to not be overly dependent on any one customer. And I'd say it's also noteworthy that, we continue to grow despite the cyclicality of some of these large customers that we have, and that it's a testament to our diversified customer base. I hope that helps.\nTommy Moll: It does. Thank you. And as a follow-up, I wanted to pivot to the margin outlook that you gave. So this is on an adjusted EBITDA basis. You've reported 22% in the second quarter. Guidance for third quarter is, again at roughly the 22% level. And then if you look at what's implied for the fourth quarter, just based on the full year, it's a number well north of 22%. So a margin improvement from Q3 to Q4 would be implied by your outlook. And I'm just curious what the drivers there might be. Is there incremental price here assuming, is it just is the supply chain -- elevated supply chain expenses you expect to get better? Or is it something else? Thank you.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes, Tommy, if you look at our Q3 guide of 22%, I'd say just if you look year-on-year, it's up 30 bps from the last year. And when you dig into that, over 2 points increase from strong volume leverage, the pricing benefits, taking traction from what we've executed over the last 9 months, as well as we're seeing solid improvement in the underlying gross margin across the portfolio, but that's offset by nearly 2 points of FX, as we're forecasting slightly above parity. And Q3 is the first quarter where the premium supply chain costs have a neutral impact year-on-year. Sequentially from the second quarter, it's flat -- as you get some improvement from -- improvement in overall premium supply chain costs, but that's offset by FX and slightly unfavorable deal mix. So that's kind of your Q2 to Q3 dynamic. If you look at the fourth quarter, the rate increase is really driven by two dynamics. One would be continued improvement in overall premium supply chain costs, as we are taking actions here in the third quarter to reduce air freight, moving print ocean that you'll see the benefit for in the fourth quarter, as well as you get nice volume leverage sequentially in terms of revenue -- increased in revenue on a relatively flat OpEx profile. So a bit -- almost half the driver is volume leverage with the other half being continued improvement in overall cost position.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Buscaglia of Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey, good morning, guys.\nAnders Gustafsson: Good morning.\nAndrew Buscaglia: So I like to -- on that margin question. Just wondering throughout the quarter what you saw in terms of the higher supply chain costs and freight costs. Your guidance of $200 million it seems that would imply things hadn't really changed, or how would you characterize how the quarter went relative to your expectations?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yes. So both of the supply chain costs in the second quarter, I think first we saw a 20% reduction in the cost profile from the first quarter on a 4% higher sequential revenue profile. So I think, sequentially, we're seeing the improvement that we had anticipated in our guidance and things relative played out how we expected for the second quarter. If you look at it from a elevated shipping cost per kilo, we noted that those costs were continuing to trend down throughout the first quarter. And they held relatively flat to what we saw in March throughout the first -- throughout the second quarter. And we expect those to hold through the second half of the year. The real benefit was we were able to reduce purchases of some of the critical components on the spot market at elevated prices. And again, that was the primary driver from the improvement in Q2. And we expect that to continue to improve as we get to the second half of the year. And as I stated before, the key driver now is really managing as we increased our printer output filling up the pipeline on the ocean and start to get that benefit in the fourth quarter as it's a fraction of the cost to ship some of the larger printers on ocean versus air.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. Okay. Okay, great. And a question on the AIT segment. So that  really surprised me positively and great margin performance. But as I understand it, that segment really follows GDP if you look back to the pandemic and the pre-financial crisis. And if GDP estimates are slowing broadly, what do you foresee in that segment going forward? Are we seeing -- is there a lag here where that might deteriorate that growth?\nAnders Gustafsson: Well, first, I'd say that, to talk about all our product categories here that we drove nice growth across all the major product categories in Q2 and we continue to drive innovation across the portfolio. That's all helping to digitize and automate our customers workflows. And they are -- our solutions are that much more critical today as our customers are fighting labor shortages and inflationary pressure. For print specifically here, we did see very strong growth in Q2. We had nice recovery from a challenging Q1 supply situation and we had record revenues in Q2, and we manufactured and sold more printers than we've ever done in any quarter historically. And we do expect the backlog to continue to return to more normal levels or recover the delinquent backlog and also to start shipping more on ocean in Q3 and Q4. As printing has -- maybe has grown faster than GDP by a couple of percentage points, at least over the last many years, we continue to see printers having an attractive growth profile. And we have -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been gaining share steadily over a long period of time. And I see no reason for why we shouldn't be able to continue to do that going forward also. So I feel good about our printing portfolio and the positioning and the growth we should be able to drive. And I'll also ask Joe, to give some perspectives here.\nJoe Heel: Yes. Andrew, I might also point towards opportunities that we have to continue to expand in areas beyond a pure GDP growth. I'll give you two examples. One would be a use case expansion, where we can continue track and trace is becoming increasingly important, for example, in pharmaceuticals, and expanding in those use cases can help us grow beyond GDP. And another one would be a segment expansion, for example, our entry into the SOHO printer market would be evidence of that. So I think we have opportunities to weather volatilities in a GDP.\nOperator: The next question is from Erik Lapinski of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Lapinski: Hi, team. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. I'd like to ask for just a little bit more detail on some of the varying regional growth drivers you saw in the quarter. International growth is particularly strong and understand different regions are in different phases of their investment cycle. So are you seeing similar trends driving growth in each region on a vertical basis? Are there certain verticals driving the strength in whether it's EMEA, or Asia Pacific that you saw in the quarter?\nAnders Gustafsson: I'd say there's certainly some common themes across all if you look at digital transformation, that is a strong driver for us and the trends around digitizing and automate meeting workflows, or across all regions and across all verticals. So there's a lot of commonality, I'd say in what's driving that each region has slightly different profiles as far as what verticals are strongest, and so forth. But if you look at Europe, or EMEA, which was particularly strong, a great quarter, we saw print, mobile computers and services were very strong from a product perspective. We secured a number of very attractive retail wins. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say the European or EMEA performance was particularly noteworthy considering that we also had low single-digit percent in global impact on revenues from suspending shipments to Russia in March. Asia Pac, I'd say also very strong performance, particularly if you think of the shutdown in China for a good part of the quarter. Now we did see double-digit growth across mobile computing and scanning. We had record hardware and service revenues. We did see very strong growth in India and quite pleased actually with China, which was down low single digits, even though we were lockdown for 6 to 8 weeks. And now we're seeing very nice recovery in China as we move into the second half year. And maybe on North America just say that we saw a very solid broad based demand. We had strong wins across all our core verticals, and we also saw attractive strength in our run rate business. The results here were impacted by supply chain constraints and some over allocations, some were on timing. But we recovered very nicely in printing and so strong growth in data caption or equity. And for North America, the biggest impact is really recycled some very strong prior year comparisons, USPS was particularly strong in Q2 of last year. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, Joe, would you have anything to add?\nJoe Heel: Yes, I would only emphasize that the regional distribution of growth that we saw in Q2 is not reflective of the underlying demand situation, but much more reflective of how we allocated supply in times of shortage based on the shortest path that we have to get supply into a market.\nErik Lapinski: Got it. Thanks, Joe. That was actually going to be my follow-up. But maybe if I could also ask just on capital allocation, as we think about the Honeywell settlement, obviously, that's a modest drag on cash flow. But you've -- your share repurchases in the quarter were maybe a little bit higher-than-expected. M&A has been successful. Was there any change in over the last quarter or how you're thinking about allocating capital and cash flow? Or should we think similar priorities to normal?\nAnders Gustafsson: We think similar priorities as normal, we were comfortable with the overall debt levels and cash positions that gives us a lot of flexibility as we enter the second half and into next year. To continue to priorities investment in the business both inorganic, organic, we have exciting opportunities in both of those and share repurchases will remain a nice flexible way to return capital to shareholders. So I'd say no change in the overall capital allocation approach as we go into the second half of the year.\nErik Lapinski: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Drab of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrian Drab: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. And they might seem to lean a little bit cautious, but that's just because that's what we're hearing from investors right now across the board. But, first question, just under visibility, can you remind us, in general, what is the lead times for the different product lines and maybe for large orders versus the run rate business? Just trying to get a sense for how soon will you know if there really are challenges in some of these end markets?\nAnders Gustafsson: So, if are you looking at our visibility into kind of our pipeline, it certainly varies to some degree based on customer and so forth. But for our larger customers, and a large part of the market, we start the year by going through and having detailed reviews about their outlook, their investment profiles already in November, December the prior year. So we have a good perspective of what they expect to do for the year, and we stay close to them to see if there are changes. Obviously, they can always change, but it's we tend to have a good visibility from those. And we work very closely with our reseller partners to develop a pipeline for that is more than 12 months out. And we qualify that round, we are in the sales pipeline those deals are, so they something we feel we can commit to or they are more in the exploratory phase. So we tend to have a pretty good handle on that. We also have such a large volume of transactions, so we get statistically some differentiation or diversity from that, which helps. So we're not overly -- we don't -- we wouldn't necessarily over read any one signal here. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, Joe, do you want to comment on that, add anymore?\nJoe Heel: Yes, I mean, first, I would just remind that we still have a record backlog, right. So in terms of what's driving our demand for the next quarters, that is still a very dominant force, for visibility to new orders. One good thing about the pandemic is that it has driven our customers to be much more forthcoming with their expectations of their business. We now have much better visibility than we had before, with some customers giving us up to a year's worth of at least visibility in some cases, even orders. So that's -- whether that will relax again a little bit as supply becomes more available. We'll see. But at the moment, we're enjoying much better visibility quarters ahead in many cases.\nAnders Gustafsson: And I'd say the bookings velocity has remained pretty stable this year. So it's very strong. We haven't seen evidence of a recession or predict a slowdown.\nJoe Heel: Yes.\nBrian Drab: Okay, thanks. That's all very helpful. And then can I just ask if you can, and I know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sensitive because it's a legal issue, but around the settlement, it seems like a pretty big, big deal. And it's a large -- very large settlement. And can you make any comments as to what happened there? I guess it's primarily with the related to the scanner product line. And just wondering, can you comment at all, does that change the competitive dynamics going forward for that product line?\nAnders Gustafsson: So first, you're right. We wish we can say very much on that. It's a confidential agreement. But what we did settle a number of competing lawsuits with Honeywell regarding alleged patent infringement. We agreed to pay $360 million, paid over eight quarterly installments started in q2 of this year, so last quarter. And going forward, we have a royalty free, both of us enjoy a royalty free cross license, that means there's no future impact or payments. And you should just remember them from a size of the payment here that this is reflecting the relative size of our business. We are that much bigger, our market is that much larger. So that has a direct impact on that from a competitive perspective, but I don't see that having an impact. We feel very good about our portfolio, competitive positioning and our innovation. Our customers certainly resonate with our vision and our direction. So we feel good about where we are.\nOperator: The next question is from Paul Chung of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nPaul Chung: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So just on your EBITDA guide, it's at the low end guide, though your free cash flow kind of adjusting for the settlement was unchanged. So you could talk about the execution on free cash flow, and kind of your expectations of how working cap levels to kind of trend as we move into '23?\nNathan Winters: Yes, so if you look at our free cash flow, again, the -- for the first half decrease in relative to what we expect in the second half was really around the higher use of working capital and the timing of sales, as particularly in the second quarter with the China lockdown. I mean, June was one of our, I think, our highest revenue quarters on -- in history, just given the delay of getting products out of China into ship. And that obviously has a drag on from a collection of timing. And we expect that to normalize as we go into the second half of the year. And so that's -- that'll be a big driver of the increase in cash flow as we go to the second half of the year. And I would say, overall we target 100% free cash flow conversion over a cycle. We've been over 100% the last several years, if you go back to 2020 over 130 last year over a 100. This year if you normalize for the settlement around 80%. So I think, again, what we'd expect next year to recover back closer that 100% range is that we target. But obviously you can't say above a 100% forever. So this is a little bit of a year of catching up for the outperformance in the past couple of years.\nPaul Chung: Got you. And then another question on guidance for both Q3 and the year. Can you help us kind of understand the gross margin versus kind of OpEx dynamic? Should we expect kind of a more modest progression here from 2Q on gross margins? You mentioned some lapping of high freight costs from Q4 of last year, but you have some FX impact here. So how do we think about gross margins for the year  down maybe 100 basis points for the full year then OpEx pace maybe similar to the last quarter. I think you said flat. Was that quarter-on-quarter? Thank you.\nNathan Winters: Yes, I'd say if you look at from a gross margin perspective, I think actually look at total Q3, both gross margin and OpEx from a scaling and rate perspective will be similar to Q2 and thus the similar in terms of EBITDA rate of around 22%. And as we go into the fourth quarter, you'd expect both to improve as the -- as we're able to lower some of the supply chain costs, that'll be an improvement on gross margin. And then we'll get some nice OpEx scaling as we head into the fourth quarter as we expect costs to remain relatively -- OpEx remain relatively flat from a dollars perspective as we go through the second half of the year. So those be some of the dynamics as we play through the third and fourth quarter.\nOperator: The next question is from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, guys. I was hoping to unpack your second -- your third quarter guidance a little bit more of a 2% to 4%. I think, Nathan, you referenced that you guys are limiting growth to that, so you guys can move more toward the ocean freight. I guess how much of the -- of that movement actually is impacting your guidance there in terms of your top line guidance?\nNathan Winters: If you look again at this, we said Q3 2% to 4%, again, we said we're entering the quarter with a strong backlog bookings around 4% organic growth. So nice results considering the loss of Russia about 1 to 2 points as well as a strong prior year compare for Q3. And, again, the actions we're taking are really around late in the quarter to avoid some of the premium air costs that are sometimes necessary to get product over and deliver before the quarter as well as the shift in moving print to ocean, so obviously that takes a few extra weeks from a timing perspective. So this is really around, what will be delivered late in September versus into October. And we think that's the right trade off for the business long-term, as at some point you have to rebuild that funnel. And that value and benefit will obviously impact Q4 and be a big driver as we head into next year as well. So tough to quantify what that is. And we're still working those plans out here over the next month in terms of exactly how much we anticipate to get onto the ocean. But, again, that's where we're really limiting that sales growth to push some of that volume to the fourth quarter to take advantage of the lower freight costs.\nKeith Housum: Okay.\nNathan Winters: But it's clear that we do have -- we have the order coverage, therefore, this is what we're looking at supply chain and optimizing our cost profile.\nKeith Housum: Right. So are you saying then orders that is not impacting your growth would have been higher in the third quarter for your guide, if not this move? Or this does impact ?\nNathan Winters: That's right. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right. Yes, the conscious decision to limit Q3 growth in order to improve the cost profiles are going to the fourth quarter.\nKeith Housum: Okay, got it.\nNathan Winters: It's also a driver for why that you see a relative strength of Q4 rep versus Q3 on top line growth.\nKeith Housum: Right. So will the entire move to the ocean be complete then by the end of the third quarter?\nNathan Winters: No, I'd say by the end of the fourth quarter. It'll be building the pipeline in the third quarter, so as we go into next year we're in a healthy position.\nOperator: The next question is from Jim Ricchiuti of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi, thank you. I know it's early days with the Matrox acquisition. But I wonder how you would characterize the progress you're making in the machine vision market. And that tends to be -- industrial machine vision tends to be a little bit more sensitive to economic cycles. And I wonder how you're viewing the demand trends in that part of the business? Thank you.\nAnders Gustafsson: We closed on Matrox in early June. And so, we have to 2 months into this and they've helped to create a very comprehensive portfolio of both fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions for us. I'd say we're very encouraged, by the first 2 months. The integration is going well. The feedback from our customers have been very positive and we are continuing to build out the partner network. So that's a great story really around how the partners we have started to sign up for our fixed industrial scanning portfolio. See great value of being able to add machine vision to their portfolio, so they can address many more of the opportunities they see from customers with our solutions and equally from a Matrox perspective that they would have the same opportunity to add fixed industrial scanning to their fixed industrial machine vision portfolio. So feel very, very good about where we are and I think the culture are meshing very well. And Joe any further?\nJoe Heel: Yes, I would perhaps add the following sort of from the outlook perspective. Matrox is refocused on the manufacturing sector, and has a good strength there. And we complement them very well, because we are now able to introduce them to customers in the T&L sector, in particular. And the cyclicality of those two is again different, and therefore provides us with some opportunity to continue growth through diversification between the two companies. So that's a strength we're building on.\nAnders Gustafsson: And there's also Matrox has similarly a strong backlog as we have on a relative basis, of course.\nJim Ricchiuti: Thank you. Just follow-up question on RFID, which you call that and having calling out is as strong over the last several quarters. I know you don't break out the size of that business, it straddles both areas of the -- both the -- both parts of the business. But in general, can you give us, I wonder, a growth rate for that business? And are you seeing the profile change in terms of the types of applications?\nNathan Winters: Yes, RFID has -- we've had seen great momentum around RFID for several years now with a little toss in Q2 2020 I think when we couldn't really go in and do work directly with customers. But it's been a very strong part of our portfolio and market. We know growth has been double digits and solidly in the double digits for us for quite a while. So it's still a relatively small part of our portfolio, but it is a growing part of it. You've seen some large companies publicly announce plans around RFIDs like Walmart and UPS, which is helping to drive greater momentum also around it. So retail has been the primary or the first vertical to really deploy RFID around inventory visibility, some around the checkout area as well. So -- but we are seeing RFID expand into health care, transportation logistics, manufacturing, and also globally it's not a -- this is not a U.S phenomenon say, this is something we've seen across the world and Joe anymore color?\nJoe Heel: I think you've covered all of the areas.\nOperator: The next question is from Rob Mason of Baird. Please go ahead.\nRobert Mason: Yes, good morning. Just one quick question on Matrox. The -- in the reference around full year EBITDA margins and how you're guiding there, you did reference FX, but as well as the recent Matrox acquisition. How long should we think about that Matrox acquisition being a headwind on EBITDA margin to the extent that's the case? Should we start to see that not deep so as we move into next years if you're going to continue to invest there?\nNathan Winters: Yes, I think if you look at the guidance for the second half, Matrox is accretive to our overall EBITDA margin. So that's -- but it was more than offset with the impact of FX just given the relative size and impact. So it's not a headwind from an EBITDA rated. But it's neutral from an EPS perspective, particularly with as we -- until we pay down the debt from the debt cost. So -- but from an EBITDA guide, it was partially accretive from the last outlook. But again, that was more than offset with the headwind from FX.\nRobert Mason: Okay. Okay. Thanks for clarifying that. The -- and then just I will stay on maybe the cost side, just as the logistics or the premium logistics costs come down, looks like they will continue to trend down into the fourth quarter. And again, as you may be referenced, realigning your print transportation mode, should we expect that those logistic costs would continue to decline into 2023-ish, just based on what you're seeing right now, Nathan?\nNathan Winters: Yes, I think if you look at the -- if we break it into three components, one of those is what are the things we can control, which is limiting the amount of buy we do on the spot market as we work with our direct suppliers. And that's one of the benefits you saw from Q1 to Q2 in the second half. So that we expect to continue to decline. Moving print to ocean, again, is another thing that we can control that we'd expect to improve. I'd say we're not expecting at least, anytime in the near future, the kind of the underlying rate or cost per kilo to improve. I don't think you'd see until there's a significant increase in capacity -- global air capacity, while you see that rate improvement that's part of the reason we did the price increase in July, was to begin to offset that with a pricing increase. So that's the other benefit driving some of the margin as we get into Q3 and Q4 as the overlays of the pricing action. So again, two of the three variables we can control and expect to continue to improve the one around kind of that underlying air rate, I don't expect to see material improvement in that until you see something changing capacity. And that's the reason for the price increase on our side.\nRobert Mason: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Damian Karas of UBS. Please go ahead.\nDamian Karas: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to ask a follow-up on the changes to how you ship product. Because, Nathan, I know you've mentioned in the past for your business, increasing passenger travel was a key to getting that improved cost and margin profile. And it does seem consumer travel is picking up a bit. So just curious, this decision around the ocean shipment is -- would you be that as more transient kind of a tactical change? Or are you really making a more permanent structural change to the business?\nNathan Winters: The  are moving or printing, you can think the large tabletop desktop printer to ocean that's how we've historically shipped it before the third quarter of last year. So 80%, 90% of that we shipped on ocean just given its relative weight. So irregardless of the rates, it's cheaper to put on ocean versus air, given the size and density of those products. The rest of the portfolio has always primarily been shipped on air via air and so that's again where those air rates were apart. So, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say we're going back to our normal modes of -- normal modes of transportation, with this shift here as we go to the second half of the year,\nAnders Gustafsson: Just one more comment on that. The reason we started putting printers on air was a based on long lead times. So that was to make sure we could prioritize meeting customer expectations of customer demand. But the intent was always to move it back to ocean as soon as supply chain constraints started to ease up a bit. And on the air capacity, certainly in, say in the U.S., and I think part of Europe, you're seeing passenger travel increase. In and out of China, I don't think we've seen a big increase and that's where the biggest bottleneck is. But we do hear, let's say, Hong Kong is looking to add more air capacity, so there will be a slight benefit to us.\nDamian Karas: Got it. Got it. And just to clarify, so you haven't taken any further pricing actions or plan to take any further pricing actions. It's still kind of the three rounds of increases that you previously spoke to?\nNathan Winters: That's right. The last one just went into effect at the beginning of this month. And again, we'll continue to monitor if any additional necessary. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, Joe, you want to \u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\nJoe Heel: I was just saying this last month, beginning of July.\nNathan Winters: Beginning of July -- excuse me, beginning of July.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gustafsson for closing remarks.\nAnders Gustafsson: To wrap up, I would just like to thank our employees and partners for their extraordinary efforts to serve customers and deliver a better-than-expected Q2 results. We continue to focus on prioritizing our customers mission critical needs and scaling our vibrant expansion markets. And we would also like to wish a warm welcome to the Matrox Imaging team. Thank you everyone.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joe Heel",
            "content": "Yes. Andrew, I might also point towards opportunities that we have to continue to expand in areas beyond a pure GDP growth. I'll give you two examples. One would be a use case expansion, where we can continue track and trace is becoming increasingly important, for example, in pharmaceuticals, and expanding in those use cases can help us grow beyond GDP. And another one would be a segment expansion, for example, our entry into the SOHO printer market would be evidence of that. So I think we have opportunities to weather volatilities in a GDP. Yes, I would only emphasize that the regional distribution of growth that we saw in Q2 is not reflective of the underlying demand situation, but much more reflective of how we allocated supply in times of shortage based on the shortest path that we have to get supply into a market. Yes, I mean, first, I would just remind that we still have a record backlog, right.

            "name": "Anders Gustafsson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our team delivered solid second quarter results in a challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we realized sales growth of nearly 7% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.9%, a 170 basis point decrease, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.61, a 1% increase from the prior year. Customer demand remains strong for our solutions which digitize and automate workflows. We realized double-digit sales growth in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America and a slight decline in North America on strong prior comparisons. We realized growth across all major offerings including printing where we recovered nicely from a challenge in Q1. Our health care, manufacturing, and retail and e-commerce end markets each grew faster than the corporate average. Our teams successfully navigated the China COVID lockdowns and our actions to redesign certain products and secure long-term purchase agreements enabled us to generate more supply, particularly for printers. We also scaled adjusted operating expenses to drive profitability, while continuing to prudently invest in our growth initiatives. Overall, we are pleased that our second quarter sales performance was near the high-end of our expectations, and EPS exceeded our guidance range as our team executed well on our efforts to mitigate supply chain challenges. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q2 financial results in more detail and discuss our revised 2022 outlook. Thank you, Nathan. We are entering the second half of the year in a position of strength as we closely monitor the volatile global macro environment. We have a track record of protecting profitability and cash flow in any environment, while preserving investments that drive sustainable, profitable growth. I am encouraged by the continued strong demand we are seeing across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to mitigate the supply chain impacts. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges which have been magnified since the pandemic. As we have extended our lead in industry and expanded our portfolio with compelling solutions, we have elevated our strategic position with our customers. Our trusted relationships with our 10,000 plus partners across the globe augment our capabilities, enabling us to serve more customers worldwide. And we are always excited to engage with partners who drive value. We are excited about our new global strategic alliance with Accenture, which focuses on solving complex operational challenges in retail and other end markets with Zebra solutions. We are collaborating to advance our customers strategies to drive productivity, inventory accuracy and customer service levels, among a variety of other benefits that can be realized by digitizing and automating workflows throughout the enterprise. Now turning to Slide 12, businesses partner with Zebra to help optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet the increasing demands of consumers. I would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets. A major global transportation logistics company is expanding its relationship with Zebra across multiple product lines to ensure a more accurate package loading using RFID technology across many sites. Zebras RFID printers and scanners are integral to flagging packages loaded into the wrong truck in real time, using RFID technology before the vehicle leaves the location. Zebra also supplied more than 3,000 tablets to assist associates in moving trailers around the yard, ensuring the most efficient placement of trucks, trailers and packages. A large supermarket operator in Europe, with more than double its fleet of Zebra enterprise mobile computers in a multiyear rollout covering warehouse, front and back of store and curbside pickup use cases, displacing consumer cell phones. The customer expects improved productivity benefits through better product availability, faster execution on click and collect use cases, and real time price checking as they drive towards the zero food waste goal. This expansion win results from the exceptional service and trust established over our longstanding relationship and throughout the RFP process. In another recent win, a major U.S convenience store chain added additional mobile computers in each of its more than 2,000 stores to augment its inventory management and merchandising use cases. This customer has a deep penetration of Zebra solutions, including our printers, mobile computers and scanners to digitize and automate its workflows. Several years ago, this customer had implemented other Zebra solutions in its warehouses, and have subsequently selected Zebra for additional use cases, as it addressed other business challenges. Additionally, a significant U.S health care product distributor expanded their use of Zebra solutions, equipping their warehouse staff with wrist and ring scanners to improve efficiency in the pick and pack use cases for their warehouse associates. Zebra collaborated with the customer and partner to ensure e-supporting  of their applications to the Android operating system. We're also very pleased to be making progress in our most recent expansion markets, fixed industrial scanning, machine vision and autonomous mobile robots. We close on the purchase of Matrox Imaging in early June, and we join them at the automated warehouse trade show in Detroit. We are excited to add Matrox Imaging leading comprehensive portfolio of machine vision solutions, along with many specialized channel partners to help us scale our combined business. At automate, we also highlighted our Fetch Autonomous Mobile Robot Fulfillment solution, which we have been deploying at third-party logistics provider Rakuten. And we are excited about another recent key win with Maersk, an integrated logistics company. Additionally, Fetch AMR conveyance  and material movement solutions continues strong traction in use cases for health care supply delivery, automotive spare parts conveyance  and waste removal. In closing, our actions have enabled us to begin to recover from industry wide supply chain challenges and we continue to be very excited about our growth prospects as we monitor the volatile macro environment. The global labor deficit and supply chain challenges have escalated the need for enterprises to digitize and automate their operations with our solutions. We have the broadest portfolio of tailored solutions to help our customers advance their strategies. Now I will hand the call back over to Mike. Good morning. Yes, I'll try to give as much color as I can here. I'll start little bit more on current performance which we saw in Q2 and then try to give you a little bit of a sense of how the -- how we look at the future here. But first, I just say that the trends to digitize and automate workflows and empower frontline workers that continues to accelerate and in driving increased customer demand for our solutions across all our vertical markets. Retail and e-commerce grew faster than the corporate average in Q2 -- still very strong prior comparisons. We do continue to see strong momentum of omni-channel implementations, which is -- which are straining our customers resources and that's also driving investments in technology and automation that is necessary for retailers to continue to transform their businesses. If you look at the -- in the actual store, expanding buyer line pickup, install use cases and delivery use cases require retailers to equip more associated with mobile computers, along with -- also implementing more workflow software optimization solutions. And in the warehouse we see investments in productivity and visibility as essential to their transformation. We've also expanded with some new attractive go-to-market partnerships like Microsoft and Google that helps to elevate our strategic positioning within the retail vertical as well as other verticals. And we have a very diversified retail e-commerce customer base, and each of those customers are on their own refresh cycle, which helps to reduce volatility for us. I also say that our pipelines remain very strong. And although this is a quite a challenging environment, there are several retailers who have recently publicly talked about their intend to maintain investments in technology as they try to continue to drive or execute on their visions and their strategies. There are certainly a few customers that are ahead of their investment curves. But I would say most are playing catch up with investments in solutions like ours, particularly in a labor constrained environment, where they need to improve productivity, inventory accuracy and customer service levels. So as I would say, this feels more like a normal year for us and that most customers are investing and proceeding with healthy -- healthily with their plans. But there are some they're pulling back a bit. But this is the value that we have of a diversified customer portfolio that allows us to not be overly dependent on any one customer. And I'd say it's also noteworthy that, we continue to grow despite the cyclicality of some of these large customers that we have, and that it's a testament to our diversified customer base. I hope that helps. Yes, Tommy, if you look at our Q3 guide of 22%, I'd say just if you look year-on-year, it's up 30 bps from the last year. And when you dig into that, over 2 points increase from strong volume leverage, the pricing benefits, taking traction from what we've executed over the last 9 months, as well as we're seeing solid improvement in the underlying gross margin across the portfolio, but that's offset by nearly 2 points of FX, as we're forecasting slightly above parity. And Q3 is the first quarter where the premium supply chain costs have a neutral impact year-on-year. Sequentially from the second quarter, it's flat -- as you get some improvement from -- improvement in overall premium supply chain costs, but that's offset by FX and slightly unfavorable deal mix. So that's kind of your Q2 to Q3 dynamic. If you look at the fourth quarter, the rate increase is really driven by two dynamics. One would be continued improvement in overall premium supply chain costs, as we are taking actions here in the third quarter to reduce air freight, moving print ocean that you'll see the benefit for in the fourth quarter, as well as you get nice volume leverage sequentially in terms of revenue -- increased in revenue on a relatively flat OpEx profile. So a bit -- almost half the driver is volume leverage with the other half being continued improvement in overall cost position. Good morning. Yes. So both of the supply chain costs in the second quarter, I think first we saw a 20% reduction in the cost profile from the first quarter on a 4% higher sequential revenue profile. So I think, sequentially, we're seeing the improvement that we had anticipated in our guidance and things relative played out how we expected for the second quarter. If you look at it from a elevated shipping cost per kilo, we noted that those costs were continuing to trend down throughout the first quarter. And they held relatively flat to what we saw in March throughout the first -- throughout the second quarter. And we expect those to hold through the second half of the year. The real benefit was we were able to reduce purchases of some of the critical components on the spot market at elevated prices. And again, that was the primary driver from the improvement in Q2. And we expect that to continue to improve as we get to the second half of the year. And as I stated before, the key driver now is really managing as we increased our printer output filling up the pipeline on the ocean and start to get that benefit in the fourth quarter as it's a fraction of the cost to ship some of the larger printers on ocean versus air. Well, first, I'd say that, to talk about all our product categories here that we drove nice growth across all the major product categories in Q2 and we continue to drive innovation across the portfolio. That's all helping to digitize and automate our customers workflows. And they are -- our solutions are that much more critical today as our customers are fighting labor shortages and inflationary pressure. For print specifically here, we did see very strong growth in Q2. We had nice recovery from a challenging Q1 supply situation and we had record revenues in Q2, and we manufactured and sold more printers than we've ever done in any quarter historically. And we do expect the backlog to continue to return to more normal levels or recover the delinquent backlog and also to start shipping more on ocean in Q3 and Q4. As printing has -- maybe has grown faster than GDP by a couple of percentage points, at least over the last many years, we continue to see printers having an attractive growth profile. And we have -- wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been gaining share steadily over a long period of time. And I see no reason for why we shouldn't be able to continue to do that going forward also. So I feel good about our printing portfolio and the positioning and the growth we should be able to drive. And I'll also ask Joe, to give some perspectives here. I'd say there's certainly some common themes across all if you look at digital transformation, that is a strong driver for us and the trends around digitizing and automate meeting workflows, or across all regions and across all verticals. So there's a lot of commonality, I'd say in what's driving that each region has slightly different profiles as far as what verticals are strongest, and so forth. But if you look at Europe, or EMEA, which was particularly strong, a great quarter, we saw print, mobile computers and services were very strong from a product perspective. We secured a number of very attractive retail wins. And Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d say the European or EMEA performance was particularly noteworthy considering that we also had low single-digit percent in global impact on revenues from suspending shipments to Russia in March. Asia Pac, I'd say also very strong performance, particularly if you think of the shutdown in China for a good part of the quarter. Now we did see double-digit growth across mobile computing and scanning. We had record hardware and service revenues. We did see very strong growth in India and quite pleased actually with China, which was down low single digits, even though we were lockdown for 6 to 8 weeks. And now we're seeing very nice recovery in China as we move into the second half year. And maybe on North America just say that we saw a very solid broad based demand. We had strong wins across all our core verticals, and we also saw attractive strength in our run rate business. The results here were impacted by supply chain constraints and some over allocations, some were on timing. But we recovered very nicely in printing and so strong growth in data caption or equity. And for North America, the biggest impact is really recycled some very strong prior year comparisons, USPS was particularly strong in Q2 of last year. I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t know, Joe, would you have anything to add? We think similar priorities as normal, we were comfortable with the overall debt levels and cash positions that gives us a lot of flexibility as we enter the second half and into next year. To continue to priorities investment in the business both inorganic, organic, we have exciting opportunities in both of those and share repurchases will remain a nice flexible way to return capital to shareholders. So I'd say no change in the overall capital allocation approach as we go into the second half of the year. So, if are you looking at our visibility into kind of our pipeline, it certainly varies to some degree based on customer and so forth. But for our larger customers, and a large part of the market, we start the year by going through and having detailed reviews about their outlook, their investment profiles already in November, December the prior year. So we have a good perspective of what they expect to do for the year, and we stay close to them to see if there are changes. Obviously, they can always change, but it's we tend to have a good visibility from those. And we work very closely with our reseller partners to develop a pipeline for that is more than 12 months out. And we qualify that round, we are in the sales pipeline those deals are, so they something we feel we can commit to or they are more in the exploratory phase. So we tend to have a pretty good handle on that. We also have such a large volume of transactions, so we get statistically some differentiation or diversity from that, which helps. So we're not overly -- we don't -- we wouldn't necessarily over read any one signal here. I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t know, Joe, do you want to comment on that, add anymore? And I'd say the bookings velocity has remained pretty stable this year. So it's very strong. We haven't seen evidence of a recession or predict a slowdown. So first, you're right. We wish we can say very much on that. It's a confidential agreement. But what we did settle a number of competing lawsuits with Honeywell regarding alleged patent infringement. We agreed to pay $360 million, paid over eight quarterly installments started in q2 of this year, so last quarter. And going forward, we have a royalty free, both of us enjoy a royalty free cross license, that means there's no future impact or payments. And you should just remember them from a size of the payment here that this is reflecting the relative size of our business. We are that much bigger, our market is that much larger. So that has a direct impact on that from a competitive perspective, but I don't see that having an impact. We feel very good about our portfolio, competitive positioning and our innovation. Our customers certainly resonate with our vision and our direction. So we feel good about where we are. We closed on Matrox in early June. And so, we have to 2 months into this and they've helped to create a very comprehensive portfolio of both fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions for us. I'd say we're very encouraged, by the first 2 months. The integration is going well. The feedback from our customers have been very positive and we are continuing to build out the partner network. So that's a great story really around how the partners we have started to sign up for our fixed industrial scanning portfolio. See great value of being able to add machine vision to their portfolio, so they can address many more of the opportunities they see from customers with our solutions and equally from a Matrox perspective that they would have the same opportunity to add fixed industrial scanning to their fixed industrial machine vision portfolio. So feel very, very good about where we are and I think the culture are meshing very well. And Joe any further? And there's also Matrox has similarly a strong backlog as we have on a relative basis, of course. Just one more comment on that. The reason we started putting printers on air was a based on long lead times. So that was to make sure we could prioritize meeting customer expectations of customer demand. But the intent was always to move it back to ocean as soon as supply chain constraints started to ease up a bit. And on the air capacity, certainly in, say in the U.S., and I think part of Europe, you're seeing passenger travel increase. In and out of China, I don't think we've seen a big increase and that's where the biggest bottleneck is. But we do hear, let's say, Hong Kong is looking to add more air capacity, so there will be a slight benefit to us. To wrap up, I would just like to thank our employees and partners for their extraordinary efforts to serve customers and deliver a better-than-expected Q2 results. We continue to focus on prioritizing our customers mission critical needs and scaling our vibrant expansion markets. And we would also like to wish a warm welcome to the Matrox Imaging team. Thank you everyone."

            "content": "Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q2, adjusted net sales increased 6.4%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 6.9%. on an organic basis as we secured a greater supply of certain products than we had anticipated. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment, including printing and supplies increased 9.7%, driven by a strong recovery in printing as we secured critical components to better satisfy record levels of customer demand. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 5.6% with solid growth in both data capture and mobile computing solutions. We realized particularly strong growth in RFID solutions as well as ruggedized tablets in Q2. We also continue to drive solid growth across services and software with strong service attached rates and attractive software offerings. We realized strong growth in three of our four regions. EMEA sales increased 17%, driven by particularly strong growth in mobile computing and printing, inclusive of the impact of exiting Russia in March. Asia Pacific sales grew 14% with particular strength in India. Latin America sales increased 16% with exceptional growth in Mexico. And in North America sales decreased 2% due to supply constraints. We also cycled particularly strong mobile computing sales volumes in Q2 of last year. Adjusted gross margin declined 200 basis points to 46% due to higher premium supply chain costs and China import tariff recovery in the prior year period, partially offset by higher service and software margin. Adjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 60 basis points. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.9%, a 170 basis point decrease from the prior year period. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.61, a 0.9% year-over-year increase held by lower share count and lower taxes. Note, that in the quarter, we entered into a settlement agreement resulting in a $372 million one-time non-GAAP charge, which will be paid out over eight quarterly installments. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on Slide 7. For the first half of 2022, we generated $123 million of free cash flow, which was lower than the last year primarily due to a higher use of working capital as sales volume shifted to later in the period due to the China lockdowns; higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance; and the initial $45 million quarterly installment payment related to the settlement I just mentioned. From a balance sheet perspective, as previously announced, we have significantly increased our available borrowing capacity to align with our growing business to optimize our capital structure. Our new credit facility provides us ample flexibility for organic and inorganic investment, including the recent acquisition and Matrox Imaging, as well as share repurchases through our recently announced $1 billion incremental authorization. We made $300 million of share repurchases in Q2, and from a debt leverage perspective we ended the quarter at a comfortable 1.7x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio. On Slide 8, we highlight that premium supply chain costs have sequentially improved from peak levels. Our team has been successfully working all avenues including product redesigns, and negotiating long-term supply agreements for critical components, which has enabled us to reduce our purchases in the spot market. We have been seeing steady improvement in the supply chain environment, which we continue to closely monitor. In Q2, we incurred incremental premium supply chain costs of $56 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, which was favorable to what we had anticipated in our prior outlook. In total, Q2 transitory items had a combined unfavorable gross margin impact of $35 million year-over-year and in Q3 are expected to be approximately $45 million, which is a neutral year-on-year impact net of pricing. Let's now turn to our outlook. We ended the second half of the year with a strong quarter backlog and healthy sales pipeline supported by broad based demand for our solutions. We have been experiencing a steady improvement in manufacturing output, however, our sales growth continues to be limited by extended lead times and availability of certain component parts. Our organic growth has also been impacted by approximately 1 to 2 points after stopping shipments to Russia in March. For Q3, we are limiting our sales growth to a range of 2% to 4% due to actions to reduce expedited air freight costs, and shift our printer products to ocean shipments, which will improve both Q4 growth and profitability. We're also assuming a 2 point additive impact from recently acquired businesses and a 3 point negative impact from foreign currency translation. As a reminder, approximately 25% of our global sales are denominated in Euros. We anticipate Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 22%, which is an increase from both prior year and prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65. For the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our outlook with a sales growth range between 4% and 6% inclusive of the impact of exiting Russia. We are also assuming 150 basis point additive impact from recently acquired businesses and a 225 basis point negative impact from foreign currency translation. We now anticipate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22%, the low end of our prior guide primarily due to the significantly stronger U.S dollar. Profit margins are expected to improve in the second half of the year as we continue to shift to lower cost freight options and prudently manage operating expenses and investments. We now expect our free cash flow to be at least $650 million for the year, which we have reduced primarily due to the approximately $150 million of settlement related payments. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 9. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Good morning. Yes, so if you look at our free cash flow, again, the -- for the first half decrease in relative to what we expect in the second half was really around the higher use of working capital and the timing of sales, as particularly in the second quarter with the China lockdown. I mean, June was one of our, I think, our highest revenue quarters on -- in history, just given the delay of getting products out of China into ship. And that obviously has a drag on from a collection of timing. And we expect that to normalize as we go into the second half of the year. And so that's -- that'll be a big driver of the increase in cash flow as we go to the second half of the year. And I would say, overall we target 100% free cash flow conversion over a cycle. We've been over 100% the last several years, if you go back to 2020 over 130 last year over a 100. This year if you normalize for the settlement around 80%. So I think, again, what we'd expect next year to recover back closer that 100% range is that we target. But obviously you can't say above a 100% forever. So this is a little bit of a year of catching up for the outperformance in the past couple of years. Yes, I'd say if you look at from a gross margin perspective, I think actually look at total Q3, both gross margin and OpEx from a scaling and rate perspective will be similar to Q2 and thus the similar in terms of EBITDA rate of around 22%. And as we go into the fourth quarter, you'd expect both to improve as the -- as we're able to lower some of the supply chain costs, that'll be an improvement on gross margin. And then we'll get some nice OpEx scaling as we head into the fourth quarter as we expect costs to remain relatively -- OpEx remain relatively flat from a dollars perspective as we go through the second half of the year. So those be some of the dynamics as we play through the third and fourth quarter. If you look again at this, we said Q3 2% to 4%, again, we said we're entering the quarter with a strong backlog bookings around 4% organic growth. So nice results considering the loss of Russia about 1 to 2 points as well as a strong prior year compare for Q3. And, again, the actions we're taking are really around late in the quarter to avoid some of the premium air costs that are sometimes necessary to get product over and deliver before the quarter as well as the shift in moving print to ocean, so obviously that takes a few extra weeks from a timing perspective. So this is really around, what will be delivered late in September versus into October. And we think that's the right trade off for the business long-term, as at some point you have to rebuild that funnel. And that value and benefit will obviously impact Q4 and be a big driver as we head into next year as well. So tough to quantify what that is. And we're still working those plans out here over the next month in terms of exactly how much we anticipate to get onto the ocean. But, again, that's where we're really limiting that sales growth to push some of that volume to the fourth quarter to take advantage of the lower freight costs. But it's clear that we do have -- we have the order coverage, therefore, this is what we're looking at supply chain and optimizing our cost profile. That's right. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s right. Yes, the conscious decision to limit Q3 growth in order to improve the cost profiles are going to the fourth quarter. It's also a driver for why that you see a relative strength of Q4 rep versus Q3 on top line growth. No, I'd say by the end of the fourth quarter. It'll be building the pipeline in the third quarter, so as we go into next year we're in a healthy position. Yes, RFID has -- we've had seen great momentum around RFID for several years now with a little toss in Q2 2020 I think when we couldn't really go in and do work directly with customers. But it's been a very strong part of our portfolio and market. We know growth has been double digits and solidly in the double digits for us for quite a while. So it's still a relatively small part of our portfolio, but it is a growing part of it. You've seen some large companies publicly announce plans around RFIDs like Walmart and UPS, which is helping to drive greater momentum also around it. So retail has been the primary or the first vertical to really deploy RFID around inventory visibility, some around the checkout area as well. So -- but we are seeing RFID expand into health care, transportation logistics, manufacturing, and also globally it's not a -- this is not a U.S phenomenon say, this is something we've seen across the world and Joe anymore color? Yes, I think if you look at the guidance for the second half, Matrox is accretive to our overall EBITDA margin. So that's -- but it was more than offset with the impact of FX just given the relative size and impact. So it's not a headwind from an EBITDA rated. But it's neutral from an EPS perspective, particularly with as we -- until we pay down the debt from the debt cost. So -- but from an EBITDA guide, it was partially accretive from the last outlook. But again, that was more than offset with the headwind from FX. Yes, I think if you look at the -- if we break it into three components, one of those is what are the things we can control, which is limiting the amount of buy we do on the spot market as we work with our direct suppliers. And that's one of the benefits you saw from Q1 to Q2 in the second half. So that we expect to continue to decline. Moving print to ocean, again, is another thing that we can control that we'd expect to improve. I'd say we're not expecting at least, anytime in the near future, the kind of the underlying rate or cost per kilo to improve. I don't think you'd see until there's a significant increase in capacity -- global air capacity, while you see that rate improvement that's part of the reason we did the price increase in July, was to begin to offset that with a pricing increase. So that's the other benefit driving some of the margin as we get into Q3 and Q4 as the overlays of the pricing action. So again, two of the three variables we can control and expect to continue to improve the one around kind of that underlying air rate, I don't expect to see material improvement in that until you see something changing capacity. And that's the reason for the price increase on our side. The  are moving or printing, you can think the large tabletop desktop printer to ocean that's how we've historically shipped it before the third quarter of last year. So 80%, 90% of that we shipped on ocean just given its relative weight. So irregardless of the rates, it's cheaper to put on ocean versus air, given the size and density of those products. The rest of the portfolio has always primarily been shipped on air via air and so that's again where those air rates were apart. So, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d say we're going back to our normal modes of -- normal modes of transportation, with this shift here as we go to the second half of the year, That's right. The last one just went into effect at the beginning of this month. And again, we'll continue to monitor if any additional necessary. I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t know, Joe, you want to a\u0302\u0080\u00a6? Beginning of July -- excuse me, beginning of July."

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.\nMike Steele: Good morning and welcome to Zebra\u2019s first quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today\u2019s earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Anders Gustafsson, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Anders will begin with our first quarter results. Then Nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our revised 2022 outlook. Anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer will join us as we take your questions. Now let\u2019s turn to slide four as I hand it over to Anders.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our team delivered solid first quarter results in an exceptionally challenging macro environment. For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of greater than 5% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%, a 540-basis-point decrease and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.01, a 16% decrease from the prior year. Customer demand remains strong for our solutions that digitize and automate workflows. We realized sales growth across all four regions supported by exceptional strength in mobile computing with particularly strong growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Our teams have continued to manage supply chain constraints as we navigate significant global macro uncertainty including COVID-19 lockdowns across Asia. We were able to secure more supply in mobile computing and scanning than we originally anticipated, which more than offset the impact of suspending shipments to Russia in early March. However, we were unable to fully satisfy customer demand particularly for our printing products. Supply chain costs were greater than our expectations and significantly weighed on gross margin, which was partially offset by higher service and softer margin. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased due to acquisitions in our expansion markets and resuming in-person events. Overall, we are pleased that our first quarter sales and earnings performance exceeded the high-end of our guidance ranges despite extreme supply chain challenges including transitory costs that were higher than our expectations. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q1 financial results in more detail and discuss our revised 2022 outlook.\nNathan Winters: Thank you, Anders. Let\u2019s start with the P&L on slide six. In Q1, adjusted net sales increased 6.1% including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 5.4% on an organic basis, as we successfully secured a greater supply of mobile computers and data capture products than we had anticipated. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment including printing and supplies declined 8.1% due to significant supply constraints on our printing products, as well as cycling strong prior year results. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 11.6% driven by exceptional growth in mobile computing. We continue to drive solid growth across services and software with strong service attach rates and expansion of our software offerings. We recognized growth in all four regions. North America sales increased 2% with strength across the portfolio with the exception of printing. EMEA sales increased 2% driven by strong growth in mobile computing. Asia-Pacific sales grew 28%, with strength across all major geographies, including China. And in Latin America, sales increased 31% with exceptional growth in Mexico. Adjusted gross margin declined 430 basis points to 44.6% due to unprecedented premium supply chain costs and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by higher service and software margins. We will discuss our supply chain expenses further in a moment. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 100 basis points, primarily due to new business acquisitions in our expansion markets, as well as increased marketing activities and employee travel costs as we return to in-person events. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.9%, a 540-basis-point decrease from the prior year period, primarily due to negative gross margin impact of unprecedented supply chain costs. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.01, a 16.3% year-over-year decrease. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide seven, our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter at a modest 0.8 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which provides us ample flexibility. In Q1, we generated $40 million of free cash flow, which was lower than last year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance and the higher use of working capital as sales volume shifted to later in the quarter. We also made $305 million of share repurchases, as we have been opportunistic in a volatile market. On slide eight, we showed the impact of transitory costs related to industry-wide supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic. Our team continues to work all avenues to satisfy strong customer demand, including product redesigns, long-term supply agreements, buying critical components in the spot market, along with expediting component parts and finished goods to meet our commitments to our customers. In Q1, we incurred incremental premium supply chain costs of $69 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, which is higher than we had anticipated in our prior outlook. In total, transitory items had a combined unfavorable gross margin impact of $57 million year-over-year. Over the past year, these elevated supply chain costs have continued to evolve. At this point, approximately one half of the impact is associated with buying critical components on the spot market at elevated prices and expedited shipping of our printing products via air versus ocean. We expect this portion of the impact to improve throughout the year based on committed volumes from our key suppliers. The remaining half of the impact is associated with elevated freight costs. In Q1, we saw shipping cost per kilo improved and we assume March pricing holds through the remainder of the year. The war in Eastern Europe and lockdowns at manufacturing sites in China have elevated our supply chain costs above our prior expectations and delayed the improvement we had expected. We now anticipate approximately $200 million of premium supply chain costs for the full year. This impact is net of the anticipated impact of a price increase announced last week across our product portfolio that will become effective as we enter the second half of the year. Let\u2019s now turn to our outlook. We entered the second quarter with a strong order backlog and healthy sales pipeline supported by broad-based demand for our solutions. Our expected sales growth of 3% to 7% is limited by what we can deliver to our customers due to extended lead times and limited availability of component parts, amplified by COVID-19 lockdowns across China. Our guide assumes steady improvement in Chinese manufacturing output. Our outlook also assumes a neutral impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. We anticipate Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 20% and 21%, which assumes gross margin contraction from the prior year due to unfavorable sales mix and expected premium supply chain costs of $60 million, which translates to an approximately 260-basis-point detrimental margin impact as compared to the prior year period. We also expect increased operating expenses as a percentage of sales, primarily due to our entry into multiple expansion markets since last spring and resuming in-person events. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.05 to $4.35. For the full year 2022, we are reiterating our outlook of adjusted net sales growth between 3% and 7%. Demand continues to be robust and product supply is improving, which offsets the headwind of 1 point to 2 points of sales into Russia and global macro uncertainty that has escalated since our prior outlook. This sales growth outlook now assumes a 50-basis-point detrimental net impact from foreign currency and business acquisitions due to the significant move in the euro since our prior update. We now anticipate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22% to 23%, which is 1 point lower than our previous guide due to our revised expectation of supply chain costs, which are $60 million higher than the impact we realized in 2021. We now expect our free cash flow to be at least $800 million for the year, which we have reduced due to the increase in expected supply chain costs, as well as the anticipated increased use of working capital due to the timing of sales and inventory replenishment. Note, that our outlook excludes the pending acquisition of Matrox Imaging, which Anders will cover in a moment. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on slide nine. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you, Nathan. I am encouraged by the strong demand across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to navigate the supply chain challenges and the uncertain global environment. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra\u2019s customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, which have been magnified by the pandemic. We empower the workforce to do their jobs more efficiently by navigating constant change in near real-time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as prescriptive analytics, intelligent automation and machine vision. We were very excited to resume active participation in trade show events. At MODEX 2022, the world\u2019s premier supply chain show, Zebra showcased our solutions, which provide intelligent automation to help warehouses increase their productivity as e-commerce accelerates. Attendees were interested in the dynamic orchestration between our autonomous mobile robots and warehouse associates equipped with our wearable technology, which significantly increases pick productivity. Zebra also demonstrated how our fixed industrial scanners and autonomous mobile robots work together to increase efficiency and reduce costs in warehouse operations. At HIMSS, the leading Global Healthcare Conference, customers were excited to see how our solutions are designed to connect critical equipment, patients and caregivers to address challenges across their operations ranging from patient identification to pharmaceutical supply chain visibility, our both featured track and trace technologies, including scan and print solutions that increase the accuracy of inventory supply management to improve throughput, reduce waste and inform sourcing decisions. We also highlighted how Zebra\u2019s RFID solutions can further improve health care operations and patient safety. Earlier this year, we raised our long-term organic sales growth expectations to 5% to 7% and provided a refreshed view of our served markets as noted on slide 12. These expectations are supported by megatrends, including the on-demand economy, asset visibility, mobility and cloud computing, and automation. These trends have become increasingly important to our enterprise customers and are now a higher priority as labor shortages and cost inflation continue to bring more challenges. Our announcement in the March to acquire Matrox Imaging, a recognized leader in machine vision, underscores our commitment to scaling into these expansion markets. Slide 13 illustrates how the Matrox acquisition will enable us to create a comprehensive portfolio of fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions, building on our smart camera product launch last year and augmenting our growing expertise in software and deep learning. Matrox brings a complementary offering of products and solutions, including advanced smart cameras, vision controllers and 3D sensors, as well as one of the most sophisticated software imaging libraries in the market. These solutions capture, inspect, assess and record data from industrial systems in factory automation, electronics, pharmaceuticals and semiconductor industries. Customers benefit from increased productivity and improved product quality. With this acquisition, Zebra will become even better positioned to serve our customers\u2019 increasingly complex needs regardless of where they are on their automation journey. Matrox generates annual sales of approximately $100 million, with a higher profit margin profile than Zebra. The $875 million acquisition is expected to close midyear. Now turning to slide 14, businesses partner with Zebra to help optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet increasing demands of consumers, I would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets. A truck stop operator in North America recently began rolling out our task management and prescriptive analytics software solutions to its more than 700 locations. We are addressing this customer\u2019s need to track and optimize its internal supplies and retail inventory levels in real-time, while prioritizing and directing employee resources to the highest value opportunities. A feedback loop on task execution is critical, as the aim to maximize productivity and customer satisfaction. A large supermarket operator in Europe has expanded its use of Zebra products, including mobile computers and scanners to address click and collect use cases for buy online pickup in-store transactions, price checking, loss prevention, inventory, reallocation among stores and improved product availability. This expansion win demonstrates the productivity benefit of a more connected and empowered workforce. One of the largest railroad freight companies in North America is deploying our TC57 mobile computers to its train conductors and employees working in the rail yards. They use the devices to ensure cargo is on-boarded to the correct train or truck for the next leg of its journey and to automate time and attendance tasks and daily activity of the train crew. The ruggedness and productivity of the Zebra solution was a key differentiator in this competitive win against the consumer device. In another recent win, a regional health care system expanded their use of Zebra solutions, replacing desk phones with our TC21 mobile computers and deploying TC52 mobile computers with our Workforce Connect application for instant clinical communications, including secure texting and calls. We continue to collaborate with this customer to explore additional solutions that can further optimize their operations. We were also very pleased that Rakuten, a large third-party logistics provider selected Zebra\u2019s autonomous mobile robots to improve the productivity of their warehouse operations. This fulfillment solution will improve picking efficiency, eliminating unnecessary steps for its frontline workers. The connectivity of the associates through wearable technology increases the ability to share prioritized tasks in real-time to create additional efficiencies. In closing, we continue to be very excited about our growth prospects. The pandemic has accelerated trends that drive Zebra\u2019s vibrant markets including digitizing the healthcare-patient journey, e-commerce adoption, and real-time track and trace across the supply chain. We are working diligently to navigate through near-term industry-wide supply chain challenges and to satisfy strong customer demand for our solutions. Now, I will hand the call back over to Mike.\nMike Steele: Thanks. Anders. We will now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible.\nOperator: Thank you.  And ladies and gentlemen, today\u2019s first question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.\nAnders Gustafsson: Good morning.\nTommy Moll: Anders, I wanted to start on the topic of some of the pricing actions you have announced. I am just looking back through notes here and I think there was one in September, another one in February and now it sounds like one in April. So what can you tell us there about how realization has gone thus far, what feedback or pushback if any you have gotten when these have been announced and if you are able to quantify for your full year revenue outlook, how much you think you will realize on a year-over-year basis, that would be helpful to know as well? Thank you.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. I will start and then I will have some of my colleagues here add to this also. But we continue to assess and address pricing issues based on competitive environment and the inflationary environment as well. As you mentioned, we have implemented targeted price changes in September of last year and February of this year that was across the product portfolio and the intent for those was to substantially offset, the realized component cost increases that we have seen. We implemented the latest price increase last week, which was intended to partially mitigate the premium shipping costs that we have experienced and we will continue to assess this pricing -- our pricing environment and make sure that we do what we can to offset the increased costs that we are experiencing. I will let Joe Heel talk a bit more about the impact on customers here.\nJoe Heel: Yeah. Tommy, we have been quite pleased with the impacted pricing increases have had so far in the market in the way they have been accepted by our customers. Our larger customers have generally received them with understanding, as they see price increases elsewhere in the business as well and have accepted them, and in our run rate, we have been pleased with the resiliency that we have seen as the run rate has grown despite the fact that we have increased the price. So, overall, we are quite pleased with the realization.\nNathan Winters: Yeah. Tommy, this is Nathan. Just the last point of your question, so if you aggregate the three price increases, it\u2019s nearly 2-point of sales growth contribution for the full year. So, again, just to remind it is not a general increase, but they were targeted across product families and regions, and each one has a lag before you feel the full impact in the P&L as we honor committed pricing on specific deals and other contracts we have with certain customers.\nTommy Moll: That\u2019s all very helpful thing. Thank you. On Matrox, I wanted to shift gears here. I guess to start, anything you can share just in terms of P&L, revenue CAGR historically or prospectively and maybe in terms of the market? Margins you have called out is accretive to Zebra there at least a couple of public peers with substantially higher margins, both at the gross and operating margin lines? I know you probably can\u2019t give us exact numbers. But anything you can do to just situate us on what the profile looks at Matrox would be helpful. But maybe at a higher level as well, just help us situate the Matrox platform with your existing vision platform that you have built organically and what avenues are open to you through Matrox that weren\u2019t previously? Thank you.\nAnders Gustafsson: I will start and then I think Joe will help out here also. First, we announced the -- our intent to acquire Matrox Imaging back in March, and they are a recognized leader in machine vision and I think that underscores our commitment to the important expansion market for us. You might remember we launched our own fixed industrial scanning portfolio last year and Matrox very much complements our fixed industrial scanning by being clear -- one of the clear leaders in the machine vision. So we are sort of very excited about what this combination can bring to us. It sort of helps us scale our business much faster and creates a very comprehensive product and solutions portfolio. And I\u2019d say here also, Matrox has one of the absolutely most sophisticated software libraries for machine vision in the industry and we are very excited about what we can do with that together. So we feel we have a very strong platform that we can now grow off. And I think the acquisition will help Zebra to serve our customer\u2019s needs better whether they are just beginning on their automation journey or have very complex needs. And at Zebra, we have already recruited over 100 channel partners in this space. So we feel that we are able to bring the best of Zebra and the best of Matrox to bear here. So very complementary product offerings, very complementary go-to-market activities, where we are leveraging our channel centricity and able -- we are able to bring that expertise to Matrox to help accelerate their growth\nJoe Heel: Perhaps, the only thing I\u2019d add on the go-to-market side is that, recruiting channel partners is the primary thrust for developing the go-to-market opportunity, but we also see a good opportunity in bringing machine vision applications to our existing large customers. I think in particular about our P&L and our manufacturing customers are looking to automate warehouses and production facility. And we already are seeing good traction as those customers have engaged with us on the fixed industrial scanning side with our existing portfolio and as they have heard about our announced acquisition of Matrox, they are very eager to engage with us on the machine vision side as well. So we see a lot of good traction on the go-to-market part.\nNathan Winters: Yeah, Tommy has already got a three-headed answer here. But as we said, $100 million run rate, it\u2019s in an attractive market that\u2019s growing high-single digits and we would expect for us to participate in that. And from a margin standpoint, it is accretive to our overall Zebra\u2019s EBITDA rate, but not quite to maybe some of the other competitors in the market just based on size and scale of the company where it\u2019s at today.\nTommy Moll: Three-headed answer, but a multipart question. So thank you for indulging there.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, our next question today comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, guys. Anders, looking at the supply chain issues, which is obviously very fluid in China today, can you perhaps describe where Zebra is right now in terms of working with your key vendors and getting the supplies you need. I mean, is it still a matter of uncertainty or do you feel like the worst is past and things are going better for you guys?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. I think we believe that the situation improved through Q1 and we see it as improving over the year, but not a snap back into pre-COVID situations. We have been building more and more resiliency into our supply chain over the last several years, when tariffs happened, we set up new facilities in Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Mexico and so for. So we are much less dependent on China as an assembly facility. We have also worked hard on signing up long-term supply agreements with both new and existing suppliers and that is beginning to benefit us given the strong performance we had in Q1 on revenues and the solid guide we gave on Q2 outlook here. We are also continuing to buy critical components on the spot markets, that\u2019s helping to optimize our allocation with suppliers and we have been dedicating now for quite a long time a substantial part of our engineering resources to product redesigns to minimize the impact of these long lead time components. So I think we feel we have a better visibility today, better supplier commitments and then coupled that with the product redesigns, which eliminates the need for some of these long lead time components. We feel we are in a better -- in a gradually improving environment throughout this year.\nKeith Housum: So just to be clear, the ongoing issues were shutdowns in Shanghai over the past month and right in Beijing are not impacting your supply chain issues correct now, is that correct?\nAnders Gustafsson: We don\u2019t expect them to impact us for the quarter. There\u2019s been -- our main Tier I assembly facilities in China are up and running, but there are some Tier 2 facilities or Tier 3 facilities that are still impacted. But based on our latest data, we expect them to be able to come online and produce what we need for the quarter.\nKeith Housum: Great. I appreciate that. And then just coming back to the price increases, following on Tommy\u2019s question. I think if I remember, historically, you guys were trying not to pass on through price increases, the impact from the higher freight. With the most recent price increase, are you guys now attempting to do that because the cost comes so high, is that the issue?\nAnders Gustafsson: No. That\u2019s right, Keith. The first two are more really focused around the component increases and this last one is really targeted at the premium shipping costs. Primarily, if you look at the cost per kilo that we are paying, the rates have come down quite a bit from the fourth quarter to what we are seeing in March. But we don\u2019t expect those to -- we are holding that constant in our forecast for the full year, but it\u2019s going to take some time before we get back to pre-pandemic levels given the current environment.\nKeith Housum: Great. Yeah. I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, our question today comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning, guys.\nAnders Gustafsson: Good morning.\nAndrew Buscaglia: So may be just limited to the demand side a bit, so you are able to, I think, ship product to customers and able to get that -- fulfill that demand, which seems to be intact. But you are hearing some of these larger e-commerce companies talk about perhaps some lower spend on capital projects this year. I am wondering for the remainder of the year what are -- what is your assumption on where that demand is coming from? Do you see -- I think your last quarter, you still talked about some optimism around some large projects moving forward or that\u2019s not in your guide. But maybe talk about the dynamics you are seeing and what type of demand you are seeing from individual customers?\nAnders Gustafsson: Well, first I\u2019d say that, the demand environment is very strong. Particularly, say you talked about retail, but I think it goes to all verticals for us. The digital transformation is continuing at a fast pace and that\u2019s driving strong demand for our type of solutions. And we performed above the high-end of our outlook here despite these supply chain challenges and having to suspend shipments into Russia in March. So, overall, the supply was more favorable to us in Q2 -- in Q1 and we are -- we expect demand to continue to kind of outpace or certainly in Q1 the demand outpaced our supply and that was particularly true for printers. But we did see strong growth across all regions, but particularly so in Latin America and Asia-Pacific, and mobile computing was the strongest performer on the product side. It\u2019s hard for us to comment now specifically on individual customers, but we have a number of large customers. They tend to have to go through buying cycles. And at this stage, I think, we feel we can certainly offset any weakness that we have seen so far with -- due to this overall strong demand from the broader business and we highlighted also here that the strength of the run rate in Q1. Joe, do you want to add?\nJoe Heel: Yeah. I would add that we are seeing especially in the second half growth opportunities in the following areas. One is our run rate. Remember that our business has at least a third of it in the run rate, which is smaller transactions and that\u2019s a segment of the market that has shown remarkable resiliency especially recently and so we are expecting that will continue through the rest of the year. Manufacturing and P&L have been quite strong as well for us as those sectors have been renewing a lot of their technology and there is interest in new technology areas there that drive greater productivity and efficiency, which will be needed by those sectors in the economic environment that we are in. So I think about things like automation and RFID, those are areas that we are seeing good demand come in and help us in the second half.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. No. That\u2019s helpful. So maybe just one other one on capital allocation, just given how the stocks act this year amongst the tough market and I know you have lowered your cash flow expectations for the year. So are -- is share repurchase becoming more of an interesting use of cash here or are you still sort of more so committed to M&A?\nNathan Winters: So from a capital allocation, we said in the prepared remarks, we ended Q1 at just below 1 point from a net debt leverage perspective. So obviously comfortable with where we are at. It gives us lot of flexibility to do both, to continue to look for attractive M&A opportunities, as well as to be active from a share repurchase perspective and we were in Q1 with over $300 million of share repurchases, we have been active here in Q2 with more than $100 million of share repurchases so far. So I think the balance sheet flexibility and the free cash flow for the year gives us that ability to do both. And again, even with the Matrox acquisition, if there are opportunities that come along, we are still active in the market.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to get into the outlook for the AIT business, as you look at Q2, in the second half. Are you assuming some easing of the supply chain pressures that potentially will help the topline in that part of the business where clearly you have been probably a little bit more heavily disrupted as well on margins?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. First it will be more broadly across all our product categories. We continue to drive a lot of innovation across the portfolio of our solutions and that are helping to digitize and automate frontline workflows and those are increasingly important areas of investment for our customers. And I\u2019d say our synergistic portfolio of software and services and products are solving some very critical challenges for our customers. For the Printing business, we certainly saw some supply chain challenges across most of the printing portfolio in Q1 that was driven by some actually few key components. So it wasn\u2019t so widespread but it\u2019s a few key components that we needed. North America and Europe was disproportionately impacted by those challenges, but it was more a global thing. But we have succeeded in securing more of those components, particularly late in Q1 and we see then the combination of having more of those components. And some of these redesigned activities we have done to ease the need for or to enable us to get more supply and we expect to see a good sequential uptick in our Printing business in Q2 and let\u2019s say sort of the underlying demand for our Printing business is very strong.\nJim Ricchiuti: Thank you. And just as it relates to EMEA, Europe, clearly some impact from supply chain on the Printing business that you have seen. But I am just wondering are you seeing, have you seen any change in demand since we have seen the conflict in Ukraine in Western Europe from either some of the increased macro uncertainty? Are you seeing any shift in the demand that you are seeing from some of your customers and end markets there?\nAnders Gustafsson: Let\u2019s say so far Europe has been resilient and we have seen -- we had a very strong demand in first quarter. We obviously had been impacted by Russia and Ukraine. So we have about 1% to 2% of our revenues coming out of Russia and Ukraine, particularly Russia. But so far, I\u2019d ask Joe to comment here also that our European customers have been quite resilient and we haven\u2019t seen them pull back, you might have individual customers, but not across the Board.\nJoe Heel: Yeah. I can only echo that we have seen outside of the fact that we discontinued our sales into Russia and halted into Ukraine as well. We have not seen an adverse impact on the sales in the rest of Europe, neither in our large customer business nor in our run rate.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. Thank you.\nAnders Gustafsson: I think, as I mentioned\u2026\nOperator: And our next\u2026\nAnders Gustafsson: \u2026 with the tight labor market that you see in the U.S. and Europe, our solutions become more important, right? This is -- our solutions help mitigate the need for adding workers. Basically, the same workforce can add productivity, can be more productive by utilizing our type of solutions, mobile computers, printers, robots, basically all our portfolio.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of questions for me, in the past you have given a view that about a third of retail representatives or representatives kind of have mobile devices today and that\u2019s kind of a great opportunity for growth for you guys going forward. Just as we kind of emerge from a COVID environment. Just any update to that view of where we are or where organizations are looking to get to as far as penetration of devices? And then second question from me, just any update on kind of the healthcare market, particularly as they move past kind of COVID use cases to more kind of turning to their own transformation? Thanks.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. I will start and then we will see if Joe wants to add something here also. But first starting on the mobile computing side, which is the device for all. First, we had strong growth this past quarter supported by very broad-based demand across all regions. And I say here, we had a particular bright spot around rugged tablets, which we don\u2019t talk too about as much, but we were up double digits and definitely taking share in that space. We also announced a new WS50, which is the world\u2019s smallest all-in-one android wearable and that\u2019s going to be available for shipment now in Q2. And then more specifically to your question about empowering every worker with the device, that is clearly a strong theme for our customers. We estimate that in retail, less than one-third of all workers are currently equipped with the device. But we are now seeing -- we worked with several large retailers today, who are deploying our devices to every one of their associates. So this trend is definitely alive and progressing. Also I\u2019d say the partnership that we have with Microsoft Teams provides another strong collaboration platform that is aimed at frontline workers and that\u2019s helping to drive momentum and then I will go to health care and then I will -- oh, do you want to\u2026\nJoe Heel: Yeah. Before you go to healthcare\u2026\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah.\nJoe Heel: \u2026 let me just add one thing to that point. This last point is quite important. We are beginning to see elements of the strategy that have both devices and hardware and software and services applications come together bear fruit by showing synergies in both directions. And what do I mean by that? We have already been pursuing, looking at our device customers, where we have a very strong market share and offering them some of the applications like our Workforce Connect, voice communication capability or our Reflexis task management capability and have seen good opportunity for synergies in that direction. But what we are seeing now is customers are thinking about those applications that really have their workforce collaborate. The Teams example that Anders gave and also its voice communications like Workforce Connect requires a workforce to be fully equipped, otherwise they can\u2019t collaborate and that\u2019s what we are now seeing is customers think in order to deploy this Workforce Connections solution or the Teams solution, I need to get a device for all our workers. We have several examples now of where that, if you will, reverse synergy has taken place and that\u2019s a really good driver of momentum for us into that other two-thirds of workers that we have been looking forward.\nAnders Gustafsson: And a couple of words on healthcare. So healthcare continues to be a very attractive growth opportunity for us as we help the healthcare industry transform. Our purpose-built solutions are critical for improving the patient journey and to drive productivity of healthcare providers more broadly. We also enhance caregiving to better address patient demands and we accomplished this by automating workflows, as well as connecting assets, patients and staff from a fiscal digital perspective. We see also a number of new attractive growth opportunities such as tablets for telehealth, where just more interest around location of equipment, and I\u2019d say, our broad portfolio of supply is playing very well in healthcare. And lastly, our solutions are also use that we talked about in earlier call for global vaccine distribution such as for polio COVID 19 or malaria. So we start to see healthcare is being a very attractive growth market for us as we go forward.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nOperator:  Today\u2019s next question comes from Joseph Donahue with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Donahue: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about the demand you are seeing for RFID. I had some large companies announced projects that trickling down if it broad based?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. RFID is a very attractive market for us. It\u2019s been commercialized for some 30 years. But we now see strong demand around apparels, in-store inventory accuracy as it was the first driver and we have seen a few large public customer announcements in the last month or so, both from Walmart and UPS, which I am not talking about our participation in this program. I am just talking about the commitment they show to RFID and how many of the suppliers and partners of those companies will also have to figure out how to deliver solutions that are compatible with their processes now. So we have seen strong growth in our RFID portfolio, somewhat more hamstrung by supply chain constraints in first one, but the backlog and the momentum for us is very strong. And we have a leading portfolio of mobile reader, RFID readers, fixed readers, and our printer and coders.\nJoe Heel: Yeah. I think in particular, if I may add, this is Joe Heel, that a mandate like Walmart where they are asking their suppliers to tag the product going into their stores requires not only the readers that we often think are first, but it also requires printing all of those tags and getting the tags. So we are seeing a lot of increased demand now for both printers and tags in addition to readers. So there is a good momentum in RFID. This is the technology that will drive growth for some time.\nJoseph Donahue: Okay. Great. And then just to switch it up, you have talked earlier about redefines, are those factoring mostly now or should the effects be seen later in the year?\nJoe Heel: Redesigns.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. We have been redesigning a number of our products starting from last summer to now. So some of them are already in effect and working and that was part of what helped us in Q1. Others are just coming online and some are going to be completed I think more later in Q2. So, it kind of -- we -- this is a dynamic environment and we have to hook, adjust and react to feedback we get from the market about the different components. Some components might have been okay in Q3 of last year, but they were became long lead time components in Q1. So it is an ongoing program for us. But we are seeing less and less need for it. So the resources we have dedicated to it have -- we have been able to release some of those back into regular product developments. But it is helping already and I expect that it will continue to incrementally help us as we go through the year.\nJoseph Donahue: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDamian Karas: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nAnders Gustafsson: Good morning.\nJoe Heel: Good morning.\nNathan Winters: Good morning.\nDamian Karas: So I am late to join here. Switching over from another call. Apologies if I repeat anything you might have already mentioned. But I wanted to ask you first about the sales trajectory and guidance. I think you are coming in above expectations for the first quarter and looking it later this year, the comps do get easier. So, I am just wondering if you could maybe comment on why the growth rate wouldn\u2019t pick up later this year and just maybe any color you could provide sort of on the run rate for orders as you exited the quarter?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. So if you look at our full year guide of 3% to 7%, sort of saying, you have heard earlier, which is why we are as confident as ever about the business. Strong backlog, solid orders, booking momentum here in the first part of the year and we are seeing our pricing actions taking hold, which is giving us a benefit, as well as continued improvement in supply visibility assuming. But this is also helping offset the assumed headwind of 1 point to 2 points of sales into Russia that were offsetting for the full year, as well as taking a cautious view on the second half assumptions given the broader macro uncertainties, as well as the FX volatility. So if the strong momentum definitely plays a part, but offsetting two significant headwinds between Russia, the macro uncertainty and FX.\nDamian Karas: Okay. Understood. And then, I wanted to ask you about working capital, more specifically, inventory. So, sequentially, inventory did move lower. Just wondering how you are positioned in terms of any raw materials, work in processes you might have on hand that kind of satisfy your near-term demand. And wondering if you will be looking to build raw material or WIP to ensure you don\u2019t have a short per phone supply going forward?\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. So we did see a decrease in inventory here in the first quarter as we were able to ship more than what we had expected driving the sales in Q1 ahead of our guide and that is the expectation for the remainder of the year is that we would slowly build back inventory both from a strategic reserve WIP at our Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, as well as ultimately building back our finished good stock in our own warehouses. But I think you won\u2019t really see the full effects of that until later in the year and early part of next year. But that\u2019s part of the reason for our full year free cash flow guide was to give us some flexibility if we had -- if we can build inventory later in the year then we can do that.\nDamian Karas: Got it. Makes sense. Appreciate the color. Best of luck guys.\nAnders Gustafsson: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gustafsson for any closing remarks.\nAnders Gustafsson: Yeah. To wrap up, I would like to take a moment to say our thoughts are with all those affected by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, particularly our colleagues in the region and those with loved ones, who have been impacted. I would like to thank our employees and partners for their extraordinary efforts to serve customers and deliver better than expected Q1 results, We continue to focus on prioritizing our customers\u2019 needs in a supply constrained environment and we look forward to welcoming the Matrox team once the acquisition closes. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

For the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of greater than 5% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%, a 540-basis-point decrease and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.01, a 16% decrease from the prior year. Customer demand remains strong for our solutions that digitize and automate workflows. We realized sales growth across all four regions supported by exceptional strength in mobile computing with particularly strong growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Our teams have continued to manage supply chain constraints as we navigate significant global macro uncertainty including COVID-19 lockdowns across Asia. We were able to secure more supply in mobile computing and scanning than we originally anticipated, which more than offset the impact of suspending shipments to Russia in early March. However, we were unable to fully satisfy customer demand particularly for our printing products. Supply chain costs were greater than our expectations and significantly weighed on gross margin, which was partially offset by higher service and softer margin. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased due to acquisitions in our expansion markets and resuming in-person events. Overall, we are pleased that our first quarter sales and earnings performance exceeded the high-end of our guidance ranges despite extreme supply chain challenges including transitory costs that were higher than our expectations. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q1 financial results in more detail and discuss our revised 2022 outlook. Thank you, Nathan. I am encouraged by the strong demand across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to navigate the supply chain challenges and the uncertain global environment. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, which have been magnified by the pandemic. We empower the workforce to do their jobs more efficiently by navigating constant change in near real-time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as prescriptive analytics, intelligent automation and machine vision. We were very excited to resume active participation in trade show events. At MODEX 2022, the world's premier supply chain show, Zebra showcased our solutions, which provide intelligent automation to help warehouses increase their productivity as e-commerce accelerates. Attendees were interested in the dynamic orchestration between our autonomous mobile robots and warehouse associates equipped with our wearable technology, which significantly increases pick productivity. Zebra also demonstrated how our fixed industrial scanners and autonomous mobile robots work together to increase efficiency and reduce costs in warehouse operations. At HIMSS, the leading Global Healthcare Conference, customers were excited to see how our solutions are designed to connect critical equipment, patients and caregivers to address challenges across their operations ranging from patient identification to pharmaceutical supply chain visibility, our both featured track and trace technologies, including scan and print solutions that increase the accuracy of inventory supply management to improve throughput, reduce waste and inform sourcing decisions. We also highlighted how Zebra's RFID solutions can further improve health care operations and patient safety. Earlier this year, we raised our long-term organic sales growth expectations to 5% to 7% and provided a refreshed view of our served markets as noted on slide 12. These expectations are supported by megatrends, including the on-demand economy, asset visibility, mobility and cloud computing, and automation. These trends have become increasingly important to our enterprise customers and are now a higher priority as labor shortages and cost inflation continue to bring more challenges. Our announcement in the March to acquire Matrox Imaging, a recognized leader in machine vision, underscores our commitment to scaling into these expansion markets. Slide 13 illustrates how the Matrox acquisition will enable us to create a comprehensive portfolio of fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions, building on our smart camera product launch last year and augmenting our growing expertise in software and deep learning. Matrox brings a complementary offering of products and solutions, including advanced smart cameras, vision controllers and 3D sensors, as well as one of the most sophisticated software imaging libraries in the market. These solutions capture, inspect, assess and record data from industrial systems in factory automation, electronics, pharmaceuticals and semiconductor industries. Customers benefit from increased productivity and improved product quality. With this acquisition, Zebra will become even better positioned to serve our customers' increasingly complex needs regardless of where they are on their automation journey. Matrox generates annual sales of approximately $100 million, with a higher profit margin profile than Zebra. The $875 million acquisition is expected to close midyear. Now turning to slide 14, businesses partner with Zebra to help optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet increasing demands of consumers, I would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets. A truck stop operator in North America recently began rolling out our task management and prescriptive analytics software solutions to its more than 700 locations. We are addressing this customer's need to track and optimize its internal supplies and retail inventory levels in real-time, while prioritizing and directing employee resources to the highest value opportunities. A feedback loop on task execution is critical, as the aim to maximize productivity and customer satisfaction. A large supermarket operator in Europe has expanded its use of Zebra products, including mobile computers and scanners to address click and collect use cases for buy online pickup in-store transactions, price checking, loss prevention, inventory, reallocation among stores and improved product availability. This expansion win demonstrates the productivity benefit of a more connected and empowered workforce. One of the largest railroad freight companies in North America is deploying our TC57 mobile computers to its train conductors and employees working in the rail yards. They use the devices to ensure cargo is on-boarded to the correct train or truck for the next leg of its journey and to automate time and attendance tasks and daily activity of the train crew. The ruggedness and productivity of the Zebra solution was a key differentiator in this competitive win against the consumer device. In another recent win, a regional health care system expanded their use of Zebra solutions, replacing desk phones with our TC21 mobile computers and deploying TC52 mobile computers with our Workforce Connect application for instant clinical communications, including secure texting and calls. We continue to collaborate with this customer to explore additional solutions that can further optimize their operations. We were also very pleased that Rakuten, a large third-party logistics provider selected Zebra's autonomous mobile robots to improve the productivity of their warehouse operations. This fulfillment solution will improve picking efficiency, eliminating unnecessary steps for its frontline workers. The connectivity of the associates through wearable technology increases the ability to share prioritized tasks in real-time to create additional efficiencies. In closing, we continue to be very excited about our growth prospects. The pandemic has accelerated trends that drive Zebra's vibrant markets including digitizing the healthcare-patient journey, e-commerce adoption, and real-time track and trace across the supply chain. We are working diligently to navigate through near-term industry-wide supply chain challenges and to satisfy strong customer demand for our solutions. Now, I will hand the call back over to Mike. Good morning. Yeah. I will start and then I will have some of my colleagues here add to this also. But we continue to assess and address pricing issues based on competitive environment and the inflationary environment as well. As you mentioned, we have implemented targeted price changes in September of last year and February of this year that was across the product portfolio and the intent for those was to substantially offset, the realized component cost increases that we have seen. We implemented the latest price increase last week, which was intended to partially mitigate the premium shipping costs that we have experienced and we will continue to assess this pricing -- our pricing environment and make sure that we do what we can to offset the increased costs that we are experiencing. I will let Joe Heel talk a bit more about the impact on customers here. I will start and then I think Joe will help out here also. First, we announced the -- our intent to acquire Matrox Imaging back in March, and they are a recognized leader in machine vision and I think that underscores our commitment to the important expansion market for us. You might remember we launched our own fixed industrial scanning portfolio last year and Matrox very much complements our fixed industrial scanning by being clear -- one of the clear leaders in the machine vision. So we are sort of very excited about what this combination can bring to us. It sort of helps us scale our business much faster and creates a very comprehensive product and solutions portfolio. And I'd say here also, Matrox has one of the absolutely most sophisticated software libraries for machine vision in the industry and we are very excited about what we can do with that together. So we feel we have a very strong platform that we can now grow off. And I think the acquisition will help Zebra to serve our customer's needs better whether they are just beginning on their automation journey or have very complex needs. And at Zebra, we have already recruited over 100 channel partners in this space. So we feel that we are able to bring the best of Zebra and the best of Matrox to bear here. So very complementary product offerings, very complementary go-to-market activities, where we are leveraging our channel centricity and able -- we are able to bring that expertise to Matrox to help accelerate their growth Yeah. I think we believe that the situation improved through Q1 and we see it as improving over the year, but not a snap back into pre-COVID situations. We have been building more and more resiliency into our supply chain over the last several years, when tariffs happened, we set up new facilities in Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Mexico and so for. So we are much less dependent on China as an assembly facility. We have also worked hard on signing up long-term supply agreements with both new and existing suppliers and that is beginning to benefit us given the strong performance we had in Q1 on revenues and the solid guide we gave on Q2 outlook here. We are also continuing to buy critical components on the spot markets, that's helping to optimize our allocation with suppliers and we have been dedicating now for quite a long time a substantial part of our engineering resources to product redesigns to minimize the impact of these long lead time components. So I think we feel we have a better visibility today, better supplier commitments and then coupled that with the product redesigns, which eliminates the need for some of these long lead time components. We feel we are in a better -- in a gradually improving environment throughout this year. We don't expect them to impact us for the quarter. There's been -- our main Tier I assembly facilities in China are up and running, but there are some Tier 2 facilities or Tier 3 facilities that are still impacted. But based on our latest data, we expect them to be able to come online and produce what we need for the quarter. No. That's right, Keith. The first two are more really focused around the component increases and this last one is really targeted at the premium shipping costs. Primarily, if you look at the cost per kilo that we are paying, the rates have come down quite a bit from the fourth quarter to what we are seeing in March. But we don't expect those to -- we are holding that constant in our forecast for the full year, but it's going to take some time before we get back to pre-pandemic levels given the current environment. Good morning. Well, first I'd say that, the demand environment is very strong. Particularly, say you talked about retail, but I think it goes to all verticals for us. The digital transformation is continuing at a fast pace and that's driving strong demand for our type of solutions. And we performed above the high-end of our outlook here despite these supply chain challenges and having to suspend shipments into Russia in March. So, overall, the supply was more favorable to us in Q2 -- in Q1 and we are -- we expect demand to continue to kind of outpace or certainly in Q1 the demand outpaced our supply and that was particularly true for printers. But we did see strong growth across all regions, but particularly so in Latin America and Asia-Pacific, and mobile computing was the strongest performer on the product side. It's hard for us to comment now specifically on individual customers, but we have a number of large customers. They tend to have to go through buying cycles. And at this stage, I think, we feel we can certainly offset any weakness that we have seen so far with -- due to this overall strong demand from the broader business and we highlighted also here that the strength of the run rate in Q1. Joe, do you want to add? Yeah. First it will be more broadly across all our product categories. We continue to drive a lot of innovation across the portfolio of our solutions and that are helping to digitize and automate frontline workflows and those are increasingly important areas of investment for our customers. And I'd say our synergistic portfolio of software and services and products are solving some very critical challenges for our customers. For the Printing business, we certainly saw some supply chain challenges across most of the printing portfolio in Q1 that was driven by some actually few key components. So it wasn't so widespread but it's a few key components that we needed. North America and Europe was disproportionately impacted by those challenges, but it was more a global thing. But we have succeeded in securing more of those components, particularly late in Q1 and we see then the combination of having more of those components. And some of these redesigned activities we have done to ease the need for or to enable us to get more supply and we expect to see a good sequential uptick in our Printing business in Q2 and let's say sort of the underlying demand for our Printing business is very strong. Let's say so far Europe has been resilient and we have seen -- we had a very strong demand in first quarter. We obviously had been impacted by Russia and Ukraine. So we have about 1% to 2% of our revenues coming out of Russia and Ukraine, particularly Russia. But so far, I'd ask Joe to comment here also that our European customers have been quite resilient and we haven't seen them pull back, you might have individual customers, but not across the Board. I think, as I mentioned... ... with the tight labor market that you see in the U.S. and Europe, our solutions become more important, right? This is -- our solutions help mitigate the need for adding workers. Basically, the same workforce can add productivity, can be more productive by utilizing our type of solutions, mobile computers, printers, robots, basically all our portfolio. Yeah. I will start and then we will see if Joe wants to add something here also. But first starting on the mobile computing side, which is the device for all. First, we had strong growth this past quarter supported by very broad-based demand across all regions. And I say here, we had a particular bright spot around rugged tablets, which we don't talk too about as much, but we were up double digits and definitely taking share in that space. We also announced a new WS50, which is the world's smallest all-in-one android wearable and that's going to be available for shipment now in Q2. And then more specifically to your question about empowering every worker with the device, that is clearly a strong theme for our customers. We estimate that in retail, less than one-third of all workers are currently equipped with the device. But we are now seeing -- we worked with several large retailers today, who are deploying our devices to every one of their associates. So this trend is definitely alive and progressing. Also I'd say the partnership that we have with Microsoft Teams provides another strong collaboration platform that is aimed at frontline workers and that's helping to drive momentum and then I will go to health care and then I will -- oh, do you want to... Yeah. And a couple of words on healthcare. So healthcare continues to be a very attractive growth opportunity for us as we help the healthcare industry transform. Our purpose-built solutions are critical for improving the patient journey and to drive productivity of healthcare providers more broadly. We also enhance caregiving to better address patient demands and we accomplished this by automating workflows, as well as connecting assets, patients and staff from a fiscal digital perspective. We see also a number of new attractive growth opportunities such as tablets for telehealth, where just more interest around location of equipment, and I'd say, our broad portfolio of supply is playing very well in healthcare. And lastly, our solutions are also use that we talked about in earlier call for global vaccine distribution such as for polio COVID 19 or malaria. So we start to see healthcare is being a very attractive growth market for us as we go forward. Yeah. RFID is a very attractive market for us. It's been commercialized for some 30 years. But we now see strong demand around apparels, in-store inventory accuracy as it was the first driver and we have seen a few large public customer announcements in the last month or so, both from Walmart and UPS, which I am not talking about our participation in this program. I am just talking about the commitment they show to RFID and how many of the suppliers and partners of those companies will also have to figure out how to deliver solutions that are compatible with their processes now. So we have seen strong growth in our RFID portfolio, somewhat more hamstrung by supply chain constraints in first one, but the backlog and the momentum for us is very strong. And we have a leading portfolio of mobile reader, RFID readers, fixed readers, and our printer and coders. Yeah. We have been redesigning a number of our products starting from last summer to now. So some of them are already in effect and working and that was part of what helped us in Q1. Others are just coming online and some are going to be completed I think more later in Q2. So, it kind of -- we -- this is a dynamic environment and we have to hook, adjust and react to feedback we get from the market about the different components. Some components might have been okay in Q3 of last year, but they were became long lead time components in Q1. So it is an ongoing program for us. But we are seeing less and less need for it. So the resources we have dedicated to it have -- we have been able to release some of those back into regular product developments. But it is helping already and I expect that it will continue to incrementally help us as we go through the year. Good morning. Yeah. So if you look at our full year guide of 3% to 7%, sort of saying, you have heard earlier, which is why we are as confident as ever about the business. Strong backlog, solid orders, booking momentum here in the first part of the year and we are seeing our pricing actions taking hold, which is giving us a benefit, as well as continued improvement in supply visibility assuming. But this is also helping offset the assumed headwind of 1 point to 2 points of sales into Russia that were offsetting for the full year, as well as taking a cautious view on the second half assumptions given the broader macro uncertainties, as well as the FX volatility. So if the strong momentum definitely plays a part, but offsetting two significant headwinds between Russia, the macro uncertainty and FX. Yeah. So we did see a decrease in inventory here in the first quarter as we were able to ship more than what we had expected driving the sales in Q1 ahead of our guide and that is the expectation for the remainder of the year is that we would slowly build back inventory both from a strategic reserve WIP at our Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, as well as ultimately building back our finished good stock in our own warehouses. But I think you won't really see the full effects of that until later in the year and early part of next year. But that's part of the reason for our full year free cash flow guide was to give us some flexibility if we had -- if we can build inventory later in the year then we can do that. Thank you. Yeah. To wrap up, I would like to take a moment to say our thoughts are with all those affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, particularly our colleagues in the region and those with loved ones, who have been impacted. I would like to thank our employees and partners for their extraordinary efforts to serve customers and deliver better than expected Q1 results, We continue to focus on prioritizing our customers' needs in a supply constrained environment and we look forward to welcoming the Matrox team once the acquisition closes. Thank you, everybody."

            "name": "Nathan Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Anders. Let's start with the P&L on slide six. In Q1, adjusted net sales increased 6.1% including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 5.4% on an organic basis, as we successfully secured a greater supply of mobile computers and data capture products than we had anticipated. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment including printing and supplies declined 8.1% due to significant supply constraints on our printing products, as well as cycling strong prior year results. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 11.6% driven by exceptional growth in mobile computing. We continue to drive solid growth across services and software with strong service attach rates and expansion of our software offerings. We recognized growth in all four regions. North America sales increased 2% with strength across the portfolio with the exception of printing. EMEA sales increased 2% driven by strong growth in mobile computing. Asia-Pacific sales grew 28%, with strength across all major geographies, including China. And in Latin America, sales increased 31% with exceptional growth in Mexico. Adjusted gross margin declined 430 basis points to 44.6% due to unprecedented premium supply chain costs and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by higher service and software margins. We will discuss our supply chain expenses further in a moment. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 100 basis points, primarily due to new business acquisitions in our expansion markets, as well as increased marketing activities and employee travel costs as we return to in-person events. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.9%, a 540-basis-point decrease from the prior year period, primarily due to negative gross margin impact of unprecedented supply chain costs. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.01, a 16.3% year-over-year decrease. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide seven, our balance sheet remains strong. From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter at a modest 0.8 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which provides us ample flexibility. In Q1, we generated $40 million of free cash flow, which was lower than last year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance and the higher use of working capital as sales volume shifted to later in the quarter. We also made $305 million of share repurchases, as we have been opportunistic in a volatile market. On slide eight, we showed the impact of transitory costs related to industry-wide supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic. Our team continues to work all avenues to satisfy strong customer demand, including product redesigns, long-term supply agreements, buying critical components in the spot market, along with expediting component parts and finished goods to meet our commitments to our customers. In Q1, we incurred incremental premium supply chain costs of $69 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, which is higher than we had anticipated in our prior outlook. In total, transitory items had a combined unfavorable gross margin impact of $57 million year-over-year. Over the past year, these elevated supply chain costs have continued to evolve. At this point, approximately one half of the impact is associated with buying critical components on the spot market at elevated prices and expedited shipping of our printing products via air versus ocean. We expect this portion of the impact to improve throughout the year based on committed volumes from our key suppliers. The remaining half of the impact is associated with elevated freight costs. In Q1, we saw shipping cost per kilo improved and we assume March pricing holds through the remainder of the year. The war in Eastern Europe and lockdowns at manufacturing sites in China have elevated our supply chain costs above our prior expectations and delayed the improvement we had expected. We now anticipate approximately $200 million of premium supply chain costs for the full year. This impact is net of the anticipated impact of a price increase announced last week across our product portfolio that will become effective as we enter the second half of the year. Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered the second quarter with a strong order backlog and healthy sales pipeline supported by broad-based demand for our solutions. Our expected sales growth of 3% to 7% is limited by what we can deliver to our customers due to extended lead times and limited availability of component parts, amplified by COVID-19 lockdowns across China. Our guide assumes steady improvement in Chinese manufacturing output. Our outlook also assumes a neutral impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. We anticipate Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 20% and 21%, which assumes gross margin contraction from the prior year due to unfavorable sales mix and expected premium supply chain costs of $60 million, which translates to an approximately 260-basis-point detrimental margin impact as compared to the prior year period. We also expect increased operating expenses as a percentage of sales, primarily due to our entry into multiple expansion markets since last spring and resuming in-person events. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.05 to $4.35. For the full year 2022, we are reiterating our outlook of adjusted net sales growth between 3% and 7%. Demand continues to be robust and product supply is improving, which offsets the headwind of 1 point to 2 points of sales into Russia and global macro uncertainty that has escalated since our prior outlook. This sales growth outlook now assumes a 50-basis-point detrimental net impact from foreign currency and business acquisitions due to the significant move in the euro since our prior update. We now anticipate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22% to 23%, which is 1 point lower than our previous guide due to our revised expectation of supply chain costs, which are $60 million higher than the impact we realized in 2021. We now expect our free cash flow to be at least $800 million for the year, which we have reduced due to the increase in expected supply chain costs, as well as the anticipated increased use of working capital due to the timing of sales and inventory replenishment. Note, that our outlook excludes the pending acquisition of Matrox Imaging, which Anders will cover in a moment. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on slide nine. With that, I will turn the call back to Anders to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Yeah. Tommy, this is Nathan. Just the last point of your question, so if you aggregate the three price increases, it's nearly 2-point of sales growth contribution for the full year. So, again, just to remind it is not a general increase, but they were targeted across product families and regions, and each one has a lag before you feel the full impact in the P&L as we honor committed pricing on specific deals and other contracts we have with certain customers. Yeah, Tommy has already got a three-headed answer here. But as we said, $100 million run rate, it's in an attractive market that's growing high-single digits and we would expect for us to participate in that. And from a margin standpoint, it is accretive to our overall Zebra's EBITDA rate, but not quite to maybe some of the other competitors in the market just based on size and scale of the company where it's at today. So from a capital allocation, we said in the prepared remarks, we ended Q1 at just below 1 point from a net debt leverage perspective. So obviously comfortable with where we are at. It gives us lot of flexibility to do both, to continue to look for attractive M&A opportunities, as well as to be active from a share repurchase perspective and we were in Q1 with over $300 million of share repurchases, we have been active here in Q2 with more than $100 million of share repurchases so far. So I think the balance sheet flexibility and the free cash flow for the year gives us that ability to do both. And again, even with the Matrox acquisition, if there are opportunities that come along, we are still active in the market. Good morning."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Steele: Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's fourth quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially, and we refer you to the factors discussed in our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of this slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales performance are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from acquired businesses for the 12 months following the acquisition. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Bill Burns, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill will begin with our fourth quarter results and actions we are taking. Nathan will then provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our 2024 outlook. Bill will conclude with progress we are making on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Following the prepared remarks, Bill and Nathan will take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Bill.\nBill Burns: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will discuss our results, the demand environment and progress and actions we are taking to optimize our cost structure and drive sales as demand recovers. As expected, our fourth quarter performance was impacted by continued broad-based softness across our end markets and regions, which resulted in a significant decline in sales and profitability. For the quarter, we realized sales of $1 billion, a 33% decline from the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%, a seven-point decrease and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.71 a 64% decrease from the prior year. Although we experienced declines across all product categories, services and software were a bright spot in the quarter. From a sequential perspective, we realized Q4 sales growth from Q3 as demand trends stabilize. Overall profitability was primarily impacted by expense deleveraging on lower sales volumes, in a charge to renegotiate a supplier contract. However, as a result of our cost restructuring actions and inventory management initiatives, we realized a significant sequential improvement in profitability and free cash flow. Turning to Slide 5. I'd like to update you on our actions to address and mitigate the impacts of the current demand environment and position ourselves for long-term growth. As referenced in our earnings release, we have expanded the scope of our previously announced cost reduction plan and now expect $120 million of net annualized operating savings, an increase of $20 million from our last update which we expect to implement by mid-2024. Our previously announced actions were substantially completed in the fourth quarter enabled us to realize approximately $50 million of savings in 2023. On the supply front, we continue to work with our contract manufacturers to draw down component inventories, and we are substantially complete with renegotiations of long-term supply commitments. In Q4, we renegotiated 2021 agreement with a key electronic component supplier, incurring a $10 million expense. The revised agreement cancels a portion of the multiyear volume commitment and increases purchasing flexibility. We have also reallocated resources to accelerate growth in underpenetrated markets, including Japan, along with government and manufacturing sectors and to address new automation use cases with RFID and machine vision. We expect our actions to improve profitability and drive sales growth as our end markets recover. We saw double-digit declines across each of our end markets for both Q4 and full year as many customers navigate a challenging environment and absorb capacity they built out during the pandemic to address the spike in e-commerce activity. On Slide 6, we highlight secular trends that we expect to drive long-term growth including labor and resource constraints, real-time supply chain visibility, track and trace mandates and increased consumer expectations. These are all focused areas in my conversations with our customers. Entering 2024, distributor inventories are aligned with current demand. Although we are seeing some improvement in order activity, we are not yet seeing any signs of a broad market recovery and remain cautious in our planning. Consequently, we continue to take an agile approach to navigating this uncertain environment and remain disciplined with respect to our cost structure and capital allocation. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q4 financial results and discuss our 2024 outlook.\nNathan Winters: Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 8. In Q4, sales decreased 33% with distributor destocking accounting for more than one-quarter of the decline. We saw double-digit sales declines across our regions, major product categories and customers of all sizes. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment declined 33.6%, primarily driven by printing. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 32.7% led by data capture and mobile computing. On a positive note, we drove services growth with strong attach and renewal rates. From a sequential perspective, total Q4 sales were $53 million higher than Q3 despite a similar magnitude of distributor inventory destocking due to modest improvement in demand. Adjusted gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 44.6% and primarily due to expense deleveraging from lower sales volumes and the $10 million charge mentioned earlier associated with the renegotiation of a supplier agreement, all of which were partially offset by higher services and software margin and cycling premium supply chain costs in the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses delevered 670 basis points as a percent of sales. The impact was mitigated by more than $20 million of net savings in the quarter from our restructuring actions. This resulted in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%, a 710 basis point decrease. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.71, a 64% year-over-year decrease. Increased interest expense contributed to the decline offset by a lower tax rate from executing on a global tax strategy. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 9. We ended the quarter at a 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio which is at the top end of our target range. We generated $102 million of free cash flow in Q4 and had approximately $1.1 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility as of year-end, providing ample flexibility. For the full year 2023, negative free cash flow of $91 million was unfavorable to the prior year, primarily due to lower operating profit, higher interest and tax payments restructuring actions and previously announced settlement payments, all of which were partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments. Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered 2024 with distributor inventory levels aligned with recent demand trends and improved backlog driven by modest year-end budget spending into January from certain retailers. For Q1, we expect a sales decrease between 17% and 20% compared to the prior year. This outlook assumes continued declines across our major product categories, particularly printing and a 50 basis point favorable impact from FX. We anticipate Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, driven by expense deleveraging from lower sales volume, partially offset by lower premium supply chain costs. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.60. Q1 sales and profitability are expected to sequentially increase from Q4 as distributor inventories and end market demand has stabilized, and we have realized incremental benefits from cost actions. For the full year 2024, we expect sales to be in the range of a 1% decline and 3% growth. Although we are beginning to see signs of improvement in order activity, we are not yet seeing signs of a broad market recovery. Consequently, we are taking a cautious approach to our guide until we have increased visibility to a sustained recovery in demand. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024 is expected to be approximately 19%. We expect our restructuring actions and other profitability initiatives to drive improvement through the year delivering EBITDA margin of 20% in the second half. We remain cautious in our spending and continue to take an agile approach to navigating the environment. We expect our free cash flow in 2024 and to be at least $550 million, including the impact of our final $45 million settlement payment in Q1. We remain focused on rightsizing inventory on our balance sheet, driving 100% cash conversion over a cycle and prioritizing debt pay-down in the near term. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 10. With that, I will turn the call to Bill to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\nBill Burns: Thank you, Nathan. As you look towards the long-term opportunity for Zebra, our future is bright. Our solutions remain essential to our customers' operations, and we are well positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows. We are focused on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision by elevating Zebra as a premier solutions provider through a comprehensive portfolio of innovative solutions that demonstrate our industry leadership. We empower workers to execute tasks more effectively by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as intelligent automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning and prescriptive analytics.

As you can see on Slide 13, customers leverage our technology to optimize workflows for the on-demand economy. Our solutions empower enterprises to increase collaboration and productivity and better serve their customers, shoppers and patients. I would like to highlight some recent wins by our team. A leading North American retailer selected 30,000 Zebra mobile computers and our device tracker solution for customer order fulfillment in fresh food inventory tracking. This competitive win was secured by our ability to deliver higher productivity along with superior data capture performance and network connectivity. A North American retailer refreshed 60,000 mobile printers and related accessories to enable frequent product pricing updates across various locations. This retailer has a long history with Zebra across our broad portfolio, demonstrating the value they see in our hardware and software solutions coupled with our exceptional post-sale support. A European postal service purchased more than 10,000 Zebra mobile computers to facilitate proof of delivery and package tracking. This organization's decision to replace a competitor was driven by superior product performance and enhanced cybersecurity features. A European field service organization, providing public housing repairs selected Zebra for both mobile computers and tablets to replace consumer devices that had been in place for three product generations. Zebra secured the win by demonstrating a customer-first strategy by addressing their unique facial recognition and authentication challenges. And finally, a large retailer in our Asia Pacific region selected Zebra scheduling software to be utilized on Zebra mobile computers. Zebra solution was selected over our competitors based on the capabilities of our software and our trusted partnership. Slide 14 highlights Zebra's value proposition for retailers which was showcased at the National Retail Federation trade show in January. Alongside our partners, we demonstrated how our innovative solutions help retailers solve their most pressing challenges and drive increased performance by optimizing inventory, engaging associates and elevating the customer experience. As retailers address e-commerce growth, the expansion of anywhere fulfillment and consumers' demand for hyper convenience Zebra solutions provide a performance edge for retail associates. Our demonstrations included next-generation checkout solutions with machine vision, loss detection with RFID, a mobile computing, AI assistant along with other innovative solutions. In our booth, Office Depot shared how our solutions address their workflow challenges. This includes Zebra's workforce optimization software boosting operational efficiency of associates and delivering faster buy online, pick up in store, order fulfillment. The combination of Zebra software and mobile computers is driving associate productivity and engagement along with improved customer satisfaction. In closing, our long-term conviction and our strong business fundamentals remain unchanged, and we are well positioned to benefit from trends to digitize and automate workflows. We are elevating our position with customers through our innovative portfolio of solutions, while our cost and go-to-market actions are positioning us well for profitable growth as our end markets recover. I will now hand it back to Mike.\nMike Steele: Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can get to you as many as possible.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: I believe it was Bill who made the comment about the need to absorb some excess capacity in the e-commerce landscape and I'm curious, based on your discussions with end users in that ecosystem. Do you have any visibility into when most of that capacity will be absorbed? Is there any assumption in your 2024 outlook about a return to more normal levels of spending there?\nBill Burns: Yes, Tommy, I think that we've clearly seen that retail IT budgets have been under pressure and the retailers overall certainly sweating assets, but also this idea of customers absorbing capacity, not just in e-commerce but also in transportation logistics as well. And they built out significant capacity during the pandemic, believing that ultimately the growth trajectory would continue off those rates. And now, we've seen kind of a reset in both e-commerce continuing to grow, obviously, but -- and parcel delivery both kind of resetting to pre-pandemic levels and growing from there. So we've seen some positive signs in the e-commerce side where some of that capacity has been used off and that we're beginning to see orders for from those e-commerce providers that need and have continued demand now. So we're seeing that coming to an end on some of the e-commerce providers. We're seeing across transportation logistics, still challenge in volumes of parcel delivery. And we're seeing the T&L providers really taking this as an opportunity to kind of restructure their businesses and think about how to be more effective and more efficient in their delivery mechanisms. We saw the same in e-commerce over the last year plus, but I think we're coming through it in e-commerce. Still P&L challenge there is we're continuing to see is the results in the -- around parcels being still remain challenged. So I would say, coming to an e-commerce but still challenging in the build-out across e-commerce -- around, sorry, trends.\nTommy Moll: Yes. And one point I wanted to clarify, Nathan, I think in your comments, you talked to an improving backlog in January and that there were certain retail-related orders that drove that. But could you correct the record there, if I got it wrong and just give us any more detail there?\nNathan Winters: Yes. No, Tommy, I think if you look, we did in the quarter, I'd say, back at pre-pandemic levels entering the quarter from a backlog perspective, where it was a little bit more depressed as we went into Q3 and Q4. And that was primarily driven by some of the uptick we saw in year-end spend that we were able to ship here in the early part of Q1, driving some of the sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1. So, I think again, not to the backlog levels we were at a few years ago, during maybe peak of the supply chain challenges, but definitely a sequential improvement with some of the incremental volume as well as getting our inventory in the channel right-sized. So again, we feel good about the backlog we have entering the first quarter relative to the guide.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Hewitt with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBrad Hewitt: So, the Q1 guidance midpoint looks to imply a slight uptick sequentially on the top line, excluding the Q4 destock headwind. But then your full year guide seems to imply revenue remains relatively flat sequentially as we progress throughout the year. So just curious, if you could talk about how you see underlying demand progressing through the year? And do you see the potential for orders in the pipeline conversion rate to improve as we exit '24 and into 2025.\nNathan Winters: Yes. Maybe I'll start with just kind of the framework for the guidance. So yes, you're right. If you look at our Q1 guide, down 17% to 20% sequentially, that does improve from Q4 as we are not assuming any additional distributor destocking. So that drives the vast majority of the sequential improvement, again, along with the some uptick in demand that we saw particularly around year-end spend. And then if you look at the full year guide of 1% at the midpoint as you noted, if you look we expect Q2 to look similar to Q1 with the modest sequential improvement as we move through the second half. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, I think we're cautious given the lack of visibility and the commitment to the pipeline in the second half. So if you look kind of again at the balance of the year, as you noted, really the growth is entirely driven by the 2023 destocking with the market flat, maybe down a little bit in Q2, up a little bit in the second half. And we think that's appropriate given the visibility we have around the demand environment.\nBrad Hewitt: Okay. That's helpful. And then you've talked in the past about how you typically tend to gain share coming out of downturns. Could you talk about how you see the opportunity for share gains as we turn the page to and kind of where you see the lowest hanging fruit in terms of potential share gains going forward?\nNathan Winters: I would say that overall, talking to our customers and spending a lot of time with our customers and partners through NRF that clearly, our customers see that there's tremendous value in what we do for them each and every day to make their businesses more effective and more efficient and to literally run their businesses. So, we see the opportunities across each one of our vertical markets as we see really retail likely returning first is where continuing to work with them as they've been holding off and sweating assets within their environments and our engagements with NRF, certainly, we've seen optimism by our retail customers in the second half of the year. We marry our mobile devices there with our software solutions. And what we talk about is really resonating with them around our modern store initiative. We see that in transportation logistics, our value proposition remains really to help our customers with things like labor constraints and additional supply chain visibility across their businesses and we're excited about opportunities there within opportunities in technologies such as RFID as they look to get more to productivity across their businesses. We've got the MODEX trade show coming up in transportation logistics, Expo coming up next month here. And will showcase our solutions to across transportation logistics. We've talked about manufacturing has really been an opportunity for us is that we're less penetrated in that market, and we've got new solutions around machine vision and robotic automation and our demand planning software offering inside manufacturing. So we see that as an opportunity for us. And then lastly, health care, as we continue to see ways to automate workflows and digitally connect assets and patients and staff within the health care environment. We see home health care and telehealth being an opportunity. So, there's lots of opportunities across each one of the vertical markets. We'd probably say that retail is a place that we've seen some of the positive year-end spending first. And then I think the other vertical markets will follow.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Maybe first question. Just -- you noted that the headwind from destocking was about the same in Q4 as in Q3. I think we had expected it to be slightly smaller understanding that's largely behind us. But just was that amount of destocking kind of greater than expected in Q4? And then maybe as a second question, obviously, the interest rate environment is maybe a little bit friendlier now your balance sheet, your interest rate is relatively heavy on your interest expense. Just wondering, if you've looked at any opportunities to refinance that at more attractive rates?\nNathan Winters: Yes, Meta. So on the first question, you're right. So it was about $20 million, $25 million more of incremental destocking versus the original guide and the balance of that was offset by higher demand to come in above our guidance midpoint for Q4. So, I think we thought that is a -- I'll get a positive trend that again, we would take a little bit more out of the channel to set us up here as we moved into 2024. Now as it relates to interest rates, I think we feel good about actually our position. What you'll see in the cost of borrowing that includes all of our crediting and banking fees. But if you look at the overall cost of borrowing and where we trade at I think we feel good about the position, but we're always looking at opportunities given the environment to whether it makes sense to refinance and take advantage of the market. So that's something we're actively looking at. But today, we don't feel like we're at a disadvantage relative to the debt cost position.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: I just wanted to -- last year, when we initially started to see the real weakness and you guys had to adjust your guide, there was clearly like a change in methodology, and it was very stripped down. It was kind of discounting things that weren't burden hand kind of orders and a change in how you were building up from the sales force commentary. So I'm just curious now as you look into '24 and you give that kind of qualitative guide. How would you compare your buildup methodology to how you were a full year ago versus how you were like six months ago when it got much more conservative.\nBill Burns: Yes, Joe, I'd say that probably if you look back to January, we literally have met with thousands of our customers and partners across our channel partner summit in Asia Pacific and than in Europe and then North America, Latin America and then with the National Retail Federation show. And it's clear that our solutions are essential to what our customers are doing in their business every day and they're grateful to have gone honestly, Zebra is a strong partner along with them. And they're excited about the innovation that we're bringing to market and they're optimistic. So our partners and our customers are optimistic. They're happy to put 2023 behind them, quite honestly. And there's optimism for 2024, especially in second half year. However, I would say that from our perspective, and it's prudent to remain cautious and that we haven't seen a broader recovery. We've really seen some kind of green shoots here in the year-end of year-end spending across retail, mostly in North America. And we'd rather -- we'd like to see first some orders, projects, deployments really move forward before we get ahead of ourselves kind of for the full year. So, I think optimism, happy to put '23 behind us. I think we feel good about modest increases through the year as demand progresses throughout the year, but we'd like to get a little more confidence by having more orders, more projects, more deployments across our end customers move forward. And we think it's prudent and reflect in our guide to be a bit conservative at the moment.\nNathan Winters: Yes, and I think if you look back historically at this point in the year, we would have always assumed we'd have several of those large mega deployments in the second half, even though we may not have identified exactly which customer, but we would -- that was something we always had. And I think that's where we've pulled back on that assumption, given the experience we've had over the last several quarters. And the fact, as Bill said, there's not a firm commitment. So until we start to see some of those firm commitments, we didn't think it was appropriate to lean in and just assume that some of those will start to come back in the second half.\nJoe Giordano: Okay. That's fair. And then if I look at the margin guidance for the year, the EBITDA at 19%, maybe I thought maybe a little higher at that level of revenue, particularly given an extra $20 million in costs. So can you just maybe talk through the gross margin if you're seeing any pressures anywhere? And then, if you could just touch on the working capital this year, just the free cash flow. How normalize is that going to look exiting the year?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So again, if you look at our full year guide of 19% that does have us at 20% in the second half and as we head into 2025. We thought that was important for us to work through as we went through the cost actions and if you look sequentially, it's about year-on-year, I should say, about one point higher than '23 really around gross margin due to favorable pricing, some lower premium supply chain costs and a bit of volume leverage. If you think about the restructuring benefits, it's about $60 million of benefit improvement from 2024, but that's offset by incentive compensation. So getting back to fully loaded on our our incentive compensation plans for the year. So, those two negate each other for the full year. Again, if you look at our full year guide for free cash flow, one important milestone was getting back to positive free cash flow, which we did in the fourth quarter. Our guidance of at least $550 million has us above 100% free cash flow conversion, excluding our final Honeywell payment here in the first quarter, and our expectation is for modest decreases in inventory and working capital throughout the year. And there could be some opportunity to exceed, if we get back to our optimized inventory levels, but we did not include that in our guidance, just given some of the uncertainty around demand and the mix of that demand.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDamian Karas: Thanks for all the color on kind of the demand and what you guys are seeing on the project front. Maybe just a question on these long-term supply commitments that you've been renegotiating. Could you just maybe talk a little bit more about what's happening there? You highlighted one particular contract, a $10 million expense impacting gross margin. Is that -- could you just clarify, is that a onetime hit? Or is that going to kind of be a headwind for the next three quarters, a little bit of a structural change in your cost structure?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So just as it relates to the one that was a onetime charge that's behind us in the fourth quarter, no change in our structural costs or that we did anticipate having moving forward. And we feel like we're, at this point, substantially complete, working with our suppliers around a lot of those longer-term supply agreements, and particularly the ones that we had to entered into in 2021 when we had kind of both a combination of peak demand as well as some of the extended lead times across the supply chain. And you'll actually see that if you look at we have also a 75% decrease in some of our long-term purchase commitments that we have in our 10-K. So, again, a lot of great progress by the team working through that throughout the year, and our focus really here this year is around components that we still have at our Tier 1 manufacturers. So that's a lot around just demand timing, working through that as well as a lot of the great work by the team to redesign those components into existing or new products as well as working with our manufacturing partners just around the safety stock that they hold. So I think we see a lot of progress there. And again, the charge we had in the fourth quarter was really associated with one supplier and one contract we signed back in 2021. And that was a combination of canceling as well as deferring some of the purchase commitments we had here in 2024 to mitigate some of the working capital pressure as well as it gives us a lot more flexibility around the mix of the components and again, the timing of when we expect to receive those or take -- or accept those components on our balance sheet. So again, we thought it was the right thing to do to kind of get that past us and move forward here as we move into.\nDamian Karas: Got it. And could you just comment on any impacts you're seeing owing to some of the overseas shipping issues like what's happening in the Red Sea and to what extent that might be factored into your guidance?\nNathan Winters: Yes, obviously, there's new concerns that we're monitoring with the risk of the escalating tensions in the Red Sea. So, we're monitoring the situation, working with our partners Today, we have mitigation plans, again, pending any further escalation of the situation. I think what's important for context is this really primarily impacts our printing business into EMEA. That's where we ship via ocean through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. So again, the vast majority of our products are still air shipped or ocean shipped from the Asia into the West Coast of the U.S. So, we think it's -- as of today, it's a modest impact on extended lead times, which we've communicated to our partners, particularly in the EMEA region and a negligible impact expected on margin here in the first quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Bill and Nathan, is there any reason to believe there's a change to your long-term guidance or an annual growth rate of 5% to 7% over cycle?\nBill Burns: No, Keith, I think that we would see that the current sales declines are due to a cyclical bottom, really accentuated by the pandemic overall and that our long-term conviction and the strong business fundamentals really remain unchanged. And we think we're well positioned to be -- continue to be the market leader and continue to take share as our markets recover overall. The secular trends really to digitize and automate environments within our customer operations really remain unchanged. They were intact before the pandemic, and they remain intact today. And I think that our strong competitive position we have in the marketplace, especially in our core, the exciting opportunities we have in our adjacent and expansion areas. And quite honestly, we're excited about the future. So despite the near-term headwinds, we don't see a -- see that changing. We see the 5% to 7% through cycle what we're committed to and -- remains intact.\nKeith Housum: Okay. I appreciate that. Just as a quick follow-up. In terms of the software and services, obviously, it's been really resilient for you guys. As you think about that growth or what it does for 2024, can you unpack, I guess, your expectations there as we separate that from the rest of the hardware business?\nBill Burns: Yes. I think that we'd say software and service is clearly recurring revenue, right? Similar -- you saw a similar comment we had on supplies, right, which we've talked about as being semi-recurring, right? It's like a recurring business. So clearly, services and software outperformed our broader product portfolio overall. But I say that customers today continuing to strong attach rates on our mobile devices. Also, we're seeing -- this is the negative side of some of the services growth is really people extending service contracts at higher prices, right, that ultimately, we're working closely with them to get their refreshes done within their environment. So that's a target for us starting in kind of second half of '23 and into '24 is really working closely with those customers that are looking to extend service agreements and sweat assets is to get them to move ahead with new technologies and new advantages of our hardware, but that's helping software a bit -- I'm sorry, services a bit in the short term. From a software perspective, we're seeing really a compelling value proposition to our customers around what we really brought together is our work cloud software, which is bringing the multiple organic and acquisition assets together to really address the needs that a retail associate. And we talk about that of this modern store framework as an engaged associate. So think of it as communication collaboration, think of it as task management workforce management, demand planning, so marrying that all together into a single application or instance for our customers and be able to really enhance the productivity of the retail worker and that's resonating well with our customers. We had our trade show on our internal event with our user group of our software customers in the second half of the year and rolled out really what we're doing around work cloud and the future of that and they're pretty excited about it. I know, Nate, do you want to add -- I mean the other thing we're focused on is really profitability around those areas and not growing top line, but also profitability in our software business as we bring those together.\nNathan Winters: That's right. I think the other -- yes, the bright spot on the service and software is the improved margins. So a lot of great work by the team focus on the cost structure for both of those pieces of the business. So that was a nice improvement as we move to the second half, and it will be a tailwind as we move here into 2024, along with the expectation that those businesses will continue to grow.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrian Drab: I just wanted to clarify first on the cost savings. Exactly what is the incremental benefit that we'll see in terms of cost savings, OpEx savings in '24 versus '23 now that we've got these incremental savings coming on in the year, I guess?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So, if you look at our the expanded cost reduction plan at $120 million of net annualized savings, $20 million higher than our prior guide with the additional actions expected to be completed here middle part -- by the middle part of the year, so we realized $50 million of savings in the second half of '23. So, we're expecting $60 million of incremental benefit into '24 and then the balance as we head into 2025.\nBrian Drab: Yes. Perfect, okay.\nNathan Winters: And what we had in the past, they're pretty broad-based across functions. So I'd say a similar with the declines, the incremental amount was similar structure as we had with the first pass in terms of fairly broad-based.\nBrian Drab: Okay. Got it. And that's all in OpEx and won't affect gross margin, I guess. And my next question was just going to be on gross margin. I guess the best assumption here for gross margin as we track through the year would be modest increases in sequential increases in gross margin as we move through the quarters on leverage and anything that you would correct me on there or add to that?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So, I think one thing I'd say on the $120 million. There's a small piece of that that is in gross margin. So I'd say the vast majority is OpEx. So there's a piece in gross margin just based on some of the actions the supply chain team is taking within our cost structure. So a bit of that is in the $120 million in gross margin. But I'd say for modeling purposes, I'd assume the vast majority is in OpEx. But you're absolutely right. In terms of the sequential improvement in gross margin, our EBITDA rate throughout the year is primarily going to be driven by gross margin, both as some of the actions we've taken around pricing the lower prime supply chain cost, which is, I guess, really here in the first quarter, but also a little bit of volume leverage, project timing as we move through the year. So yes, there's a that's what we'd expect through the year as a kind of modest improvement as we go through the year to get us to where we have as an exit point in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead.\nRob Mason: I wanted to circle back, Bill. You mentioned several times customers willing to sweat their assets more right now, which, again, we've seen that in the past during these downturn periods. It sounds like you're trying to address that some with service strategies. I'm curious if you're testing any other strategies around trying to stimulate new product demand, whether customers might be more amenable to as service or subscription or, say, leasing type arrangements in this period of time? And then maybe relatedly, is there anything as you look into, say, the 2018-2019 devices that were put into the installed base -- anything on the horizon that would more catalyze their replacement, just where they can't be upgraded any further anything of that nature?\nBill Burns: Rob. So a couple of things kind of weaved into that. I would say, first, that our sales teams are working and our partners closely with those customers that we have identified that are -- have the devices in there in use longer than normal and working closely with them to understand how we can convince them to move forward with upgrades and lots of different ways to go do that. And -- but the driver really would be a couple of areas. One would be technology transitions. So I think 4G to 5G and wireless think of faster WiFi speeds like WiFi 6, OS upgrade. So as the devices become older, then there's Android releases aren't available. And then along with that, we extend the security with that OS so long, but eventually, the security patches aren't available. So from a security perspective, that's a driver as well. The other place is really around use case expansion, right? So that adding more functionality of the devices, things like authentication of facial recognition, think of Zebra Pay integrated RFID on those devices we're going to release here shortly. Over time, we'll be releasing. We showed this at the National Retail Federation Show generative AI large language models on the actual devices and an assistant. So we want this to really be about productivity and wanting more features and functionality within their environment versus just around security, right? And we're seeing that. I would say that in the area of leasing, what we're looking at is opportunities to marry our software with hardware, and we demonstrated some of this at the National Retail show as well is that Think of a wearable device that has our task management software, communication collaboration on that wearable device in retail, which would be sold as a service kind of offering to our customers, so not quite a lease. In most cases, our customers say, hey, I can -- I'd rather spend the capital than lease. But in this case, it would be an OpEx recurring revenue stream around software and hardware combined together. So sales teams have a lot of different plays they're running to try to move those customers forward with upgrades.\nRob Mason: That's helpful. Just as a follow-up, could you just comment on what you're seeing in some of these underpenetrated markets where perhaps you do have more runway, and I'm thinking Japan and government specifically just what the current tone of business is there.\nBill Burns: Yes, Rob, I'd say that there are opportunities for us as we look around the globe, and we have different market shares those are two good examples of really significantly lower share than we have in other places. But as we look at each vertical market as we look at each geography, we see places where we can continue to take share as a business. Japan is a great opportunity for us, as we've talked about for a while, second largest market in Asia, we won the largest postal carrier there. We've won the largest retailer we now have the attention of some of the largest integrators -- system integrators and cellular carriers in Japan to work in some new opportunities there beyond retail and postal. So those have gotten some more attention and we've changed our channel strategy there a bit to large work with larger SIs. We've just hired a new sales leader. If we look at government in the U.S., a new sales leader there is the refocus on government and building our partner community and expanding our reach inside government opportunities that includes public safety. So, we're excited about these markets because we have low share, and we know there's opportunities for our portfolio within those underserved markets.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nChris Grenga: This is Chris Grenga on for Jim. Maybe just one for me. You had mentioned the trend of new automation use cases in RFID and machine vision could you talk about what you expect from these technologies in 2024? And what use cases are you having the most productive conversations with customers currently?\nBill Burns: Chris, maybe start with RFID. We're continuing to see strong interest across many customers and verticals. We've seen the opportunity to expand beyond retail apparel really into track and trace, supply chains, parcel tracking, baggage tracking tools, work in progress in manufacturing, health care opportunities, all with RFID. Certainly, Walmart and what UPS is doing inside smart package into their environment has caused others to continue to look at of interest in RFID. The cost of the tags coming down in the has created opportunity because today, we have the broadest and deepest set of RFID solutions in the market. And that includes fixed readers, handheld readers, industrial and mobile printers, software and the label to go along with that. So we've seen strong double-digit growth over the past few years in RFID, including in 2023. And we are excited about the opportunity across everything we do in RFID. I would say in machine vision really focused in two areas: manufacturing and transportation logistics from a manufacturing perspective, automotive, food and beverage, inside logistics, it's really about warehouse and distribution. We combined our organic investment really with a few acquisitions of Matrox and Adaptive Vision. That's really given us a broad differentiated offering across those markets and creates opportunities for us to win and what we see as a fragmented multibillion-dollar market opportunity for us. Our value proposition really is around marrying software and hardware together and giving a unified software platform to our customers and easy to set up, easy to upgrade really to drive simplicity, speed, efficiency within our customers' organizations that allow them to automate in an easier way and upgrade that automation from things like fixed industrial scanning to machine vision. So, we're excited about both these opportunities. We are the leaders in RFID reading today. We're a challenger in the machine vision market, and we see both being a tremendous opportunity for Zebra.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Ken Newman at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKen Newman: First question here. Just looking at R&D expense, I know it saw that it took a sequential step down this quarter for 3Q. Just as I think about this first quarter guide in the full year, how should we think about the cadence of R&D dollars as we move through the year? And is there may be more room to take out there as we progress after the first quarter?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So I think a couple of things. Just some of the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 was related to the cost actions that we took and just the timing of those rolling into the P&L, which is, again, what we had expected coming into the quarter. You'll see it increase a bit here as we go through '24 just as we reset comp plans and things like that around incentive compensation. And typically, the first half is a little more front-end loaded just with the timing of projects and deployments. And then Q4 is always a little light just with holidays and whatnot from a project execution. So, I think I would think of similar trajectory from a sequential perspective as we move through the year, but maybe a bit of an uptick just as we kind of again reset all of our comp plans and whatnot for the year.\nKen Newman: Got it. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, with free cash flow improving this year and you being at the top and a leverage target range, what is the midpoint of guidance like here for where you think net leverage ends up relative to debt pay down? And am I right in assuming that the priority for capital deployment will be towards the debt side? Or is there other portions or avenues that you see a better return for that capital?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So as you mentioned, we ended the quarter at 2.5x debt leverage, which is at the high end of our target range. We are prioritizing debt pay down of our variable rate debt here in the short term. And we would expect the debt leverage to increase a bit here through the first and second quarter really just as we lap on the profitability side, not so much debt will come down, but the ratio will increase, but then will decline through the second half as we kind of lap Q3 and Q4's lower profitability. And so that is really the priority here starting out the year as debt pay down but as always, we're going to reassess overall capital deployment and opportunities we have, whether that's share buyback or M&A as the year progresses.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Burns for any closing remarks.\nBill Burns: Thank you. As we look towards the long term, the opportunity for Zebra is bright. I'd just like to thank our customers, our partners and employees for their support. We look forward to returning to growth in 2024. Have a good day, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Bill Burns",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will discuss our results, the demand environment and progress and actions we are taking to optimize our cost structure and drive sales as demand recovers. As expected, our fourth quarter performance was impacted by continued broad-based softness across our end markets and regions, which resulted in a significant decline in sales and profitability. For the quarter, we realized sales of $1 billion, a 33% decline from the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%, a seven-point decrease and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.71 a 64% decrease from the prior year. Although we experienced declines across all product categories, services and software were a bright spot in the quarter. From a sequential perspective, we realized Q4 sales growth from Q3 as demand trends stabilize. Overall profitability was primarily impacted by expense deleveraging on lower sales volumes, in a charge to renegotiate a supplier contract. However, as a result of our cost restructuring actions and inventory management initiatives, we realized a significant sequential improvement in profitability and free cash flow. Turning to Slide 5. I'd like to update you on our actions to address and mitigate the impacts of the current demand environment and position ourselves for long-term growth. As referenced in our earnings release, we have expanded the scope of our previously announced cost reduction plan and now expect $120 million of net annualized operating savings, an increase of $20 million from our last update which we expect to implement by mid-2024. Our previously announced actions were substantially completed in the fourth quarter enabled us to realize approximately $50 million of savings in 2023. On the supply front, we continue to work with our contract manufacturers to draw down component inventories, and we are substantially complete with renegotiations of long-term supply commitments. In Q4, we renegotiated 2021 agreement with a key electronic component supplier, incurring a $10 million expense. The revised agreement cancels a portion of the multiyear volume commitment and increases purchasing flexibility. We have also reallocated resources to accelerate growth in underpenetrated markets, including Japan, along with government and manufacturing sectors and to address new automation use cases with RFID and machine vision. We expect our actions to improve profitability and drive sales growth as our end markets recover. We saw double-digit declines across each of our end markets for both Q4 and full year as many customers navigate a challenging environment and absorb capacity they built out during the pandemic to address the spike in e-commerce activity. On Slide 6, we highlight secular trends that we expect to drive long-term growth including labor and resource constraints, real-time supply chain visibility, track and trace mandates and increased consumer expectations. These are all focused areas in my conversations with our customers. Entering 2024, distributor inventories are aligned with current demand. Although we are seeing some improvement in order activity, we are not yet seeing any signs of a broad market recovery and remain cautious in our planning. Consequently, we continue to take an agile approach to navigating this uncertain environment and remain disciplined with respect to our cost structure and capital allocation. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q4 financial results and discuss our 2024 outlook. Thank you, Nathan. As you look towards the long-term opportunity for Zebra, our future is bright. Our solutions remain essential to our customers' operations, and we are well positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows. We are focused on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision by elevating Zebra as a premier solutions provider through a comprehensive portfolio of innovative solutions that demonstrate our industry leadership. We empower workers to execute tasks more effectively by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as intelligent automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning and prescriptive analytics. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, enterprises can improve the experience of frontline workers and customers. As you can see on Slide 13, customers leverage our technology to optimize workflows for the on-demand economy. Our solutions empower enterprises to increase collaboration and productivity and better serve their customers, shoppers and patients. I would like to highlight some recent wins by our team. A leading North American retailer selected 30,000 Zebra mobile computers and our device tracker solution for customer order fulfillment in fresh food inventory tracking. This competitive win was secured by our ability to deliver higher productivity along with superior data capture performance and network connectivity. A North American retailer refreshed 60,000 mobile printers and related accessories to enable frequent product pricing updates across various locations. This retailer has a long history with Zebra across our broad portfolio, demonstrating the value they see in our hardware and software solutions coupled with our exceptional post-sale support. A European postal service purchased more than 10,000 Zebra mobile computers to facilitate proof of delivery and package tracking. This organization's decision to replace a competitor was driven by superior product performance and enhanced cybersecurity features. A European field service organization, providing public housing repairs selected Zebra for both mobile computers and tablets to replace consumer devices that had been in place for three product generations. Zebra secured the win by demonstrating a customer-first strategy by addressing their unique facial recognition and authentication challenges. And finally, a large retailer in our Asia Pacific region selected Zebra scheduling software to be utilized on Zebra mobile computers. Zebra solution was selected over our competitors based on the capabilities of our software and our trusted partnership. Slide 14 highlights Zebra's value proposition for retailers which was showcased at the National Retail Federation trade show in January. Alongside our partners, we demonstrated how our innovative solutions help retailers solve their most pressing challenges and drive increased performance by optimizing inventory, engaging associates and elevating the customer experience. As retailers address e-commerce growth, the expansion of anywhere fulfillment and consumers' demand for hyper convenience Zebra solutions provide a performance edge for retail associates. Our demonstrations included next-generation checkout solutions with machine vision, loss detection with RFID, a mobile computing, AI assistant along with other innovative solutions. In our booth, Office Depot shared how our solutions address their workflow challenges. This includes Zebra's workforce optimization software boosting operational efficiency of associates and delivering faster buy online, pick up in store, order fulfillment. The combination of Zebra software and mobile computers is driving associate productivity and engagement along with improved customer satisfaction. In closing, our long-term conviction and our strong business fundamentals remain unchanged, and we are well positioned to benefit from trends to digitize and automate workflows. We are elevating our position with customers through our innovative portfolio of solutions, while our cost and go-to-market actions are positioning us well for profitable growth as our end markets recover. I will now hand it back to Mike. Yes, Tommy, I think that we've clearly seen that retail IT budgets have been under pressure and the retailers overall certainly sweating assets, but also this idea of customers absorbing capacity, not just in e-commerce but also in transportation logistics as well. And they built out significant capacity during the pandemic, believing that ultimately the growth trajectory would continue off those rates. And now, we've seen kind of a reset in both e-commerce continuing to grow, obviously, but -- and parcel delivery both kind of resetting to pre-pandemic levels and growing from there. So we've seen some positive signs in the e-commerce side where some of that capacity has been used off and that we're beginning to see orders for from those e-commerce providers that need and have continued demand now. So we're seeing that coming to an end on some of the e-commerce providers. We're seeing across transportation logistics, still challenge in volumes of parcel delivery. And we're seeing the T&L providers really taking this as an opportunity to kind of restructure their businesses and think about how to be more effective and more efficient in their delivery mechanisms. We saw the same in e-commerce over the last year plus, but I think we're coming through it in e-commerce. Still P&L challenge there is we're continuing to see is the results in the -- around parcels being still remain challenged. So I would say, coming to an e-commerce but still challenging in the build-out across e-commerce -- around, sorry, trends. Yes, Joe, I'd say that probably if you look back to January, we literally have met with thousands of our customers and partners across our channel partner summit in Asia Pacific and than in Europe and then North America, Latin America and then with the National Retail Federation show. And it's clear that our solutions are essential to what our customers are doing in their business every day and they're grateful to have gone honestly, Zebra is a strong partner along with them. And they're excited about the innovation that we're bringing to market and they're optimistic. So our partners and our customers are optimistic. They're happy to put 2023 behind them, quite honestly. And there's optimism for 2024, especially in second half year. However, I would say that from our perspective, and it's prudent to remain cautious and that we haven't seen a broader recovery. We've really seen some kind of green shoots here in the year-end of year-end spending across retail, mostly in North America. And we'd rather -- we'd like to see first some orders, projects, deployments really move forward before we get ahead of ourselves kind of for the full year. So, I think optimism, happy to put '23 behind us. I think we feel good about modest increases through the year as demand progresses throughout the year, but we'd like to get a little more confidence by having more orders, more projects, more deployments across our end customers move forward. And we think it's prudent and reflect in our guide to be a bit conservative at the moment. No, Keith, I think that we would see that the current sales declines are due to a cyclical bottom, really accentuated by the pandemic overall and that our long-term conviction and the strong business fundamentals really remain unchanged. And we think we're well positioned to be -- continue to be the market leader and continue to take share as our markets recover overall. The secular trends really to digitize and automate environments within our customer operations really remain unchanged. They were intact before the pandemic, and they remain intact today. And I think that our strong competitive position we have in the marketplace, especially in our core, the exciting opportunities we have in our adjacent and expansion areas. And quite honestly, we're excited about the future. So despite the near-term headwinds, we don't see a -- see that changing. We see the 5% to 7% through cycle what we're committed to and -- remains intact. Yes. I think that we'd say software and service is clearly recurring revenue, right? Similar -- you saw a similar comment we had on supplies, right, which we've talked about as being semi-recurring, right? It's like a recurring business. So clearly, services and software outperformed our broader product portfolio overall. But I say that customers today continuing to strong attach rates on our mobile devices. Also, we're seeing -- this is the negative side of some of the services growth is really people extending service contracts at higher prices, right, that ultimately, we're working closely with them to get their refreshes done within their environment. So that's a target for us starting in kind of second half of '23 and into '24 is really working closely with those customers that are looking to extend service agreements and sweat assets is to get them to move ahead with new technologies and new advantages of our hardware, but that's helping software a bit -- I'm sorry, services a bit in the short term. From a software perspective, we're seeing really a compelling value proposition to our customers around what we really brought together is our work cloud software, which is bringing the multiple organic and acquisition assets together to really address the needs that a retail associate. And we talk about that of this modern store framework as an engaged associate. So think of it as communication collaboration, think of it as task management workforce management, demand planning, so marrying that all together into a single application or instance for our customers and be able to really enhance the productivity of the retail worker and that's resonating well with our customers. We had our trade show on our internal event with our user group of our software customers in the second half of the year and rolled out really what we're doing around work cloud and the future of that and they're pretty excited about it. I know, Nate, do you want to add -- I mean the other thing we're focused on is really profitability around those areas and not growing top line, but also profitability in our software business as we bring those together. Rob. So a couple of things kind of weaved into that. I would say, first, that our sales teams are working and our partners closely with those customers that we have identified that are -- have the devices in there in use longer than normal and working closely with them to understand how we can convince them to move forward with upgrades and lots of different ways to go do that. And -- but the driver really would be a couple of areas. One would be technology transitions. So I think 4G to 5G and wireless think of faster WiFi speeds like WiFi 6, OS upgrade. So as the devices become older, then there's Android releases aren't available. And then along with that, we extend the security with that OS so long, but eventually, the security patches aren't available. So from a security perspective, that's a driver as well. The other place is really around use case expansion, right? So that adding more functionality of the devices, things like authentication of facial recognition, think of Zebra Pay integrated RFID on those devices we're going to release here shortly. Over time, we'll be releasing. We showed this at the National Retail Federation Show generative AI large language models on the actual devices and an assistant. So we want this to really be about productivity and wanting more features and functionality within their environment versus just around security, right? And we're seeing that. I would say that in the area of leasing, what we're looking at is opportunities to marry our software with hardware, and we demonstrated some of this at the National Retail show as well is that Think of a wearable device that has our task management software, communication collaboration on that wearable device in retail, which would be sold as a service kind of offering to our customers, so not quite a lease. In most cases, our customers say, hey, I can -- I'd rather spend the capital than lease. But in this case, it would be an OpEx recurring revenue stream around software and hardware combined together. So sales teams have a lot of different plays they're running to try to move those customers forward with upgrades. Yes, Rob, I'd say that there are opportunities for us as we look around the globe, and we have different market shares those are two good examples of really significantly lower share than we have in other places. But as we look at each vertical market as we look at each geography, we see places where we can continue to take share as a business. Japan is a great opportunity for us, as we've talked about for a while, second largest market in Asia, we won the largest postal carrier there. We've won the largest retailer we now have the attention of some of the largest integrators -- system integrators and cellular carriers in Japan to work in some new opportunities there beyond retail and postal. So those have gotten some more attention and we've changed our channel strategy there a bit to large work with larger SIs. We've just hired a new sales leader. If we look at government in the U.S., a new sales leader there is the refocus on government and building our partner community and expanding our reach inside government opportunities that includes public safety. So, we're excited about these markets because we have low share, and we know there's opportunities for our portfolio within those underserved markets. Chris, maybe start with RFID. We're continuing to see strong interest across many customers and verticals. We've seen the opportunity to expand beyond retail apparel really into track and trace, supply chains, parcel tracking, baggage tracking tools, work in progress in manufacturing, health care opportunities, all with RFID. Certainly, Walmart and what UPS is doing inside smart package into their environment has caused others to continue to look at of interest in RFID. The cost of the tags coming down in the has created opportunity because today, we have the broadest and deepest set of RFID solutions in the market. And that includes fixed readers, handheld readers, industrial and mobile printers, software and the label to go along with that. So we've seen strong double-digit growth over the past few years in RFID, including in 2023. And we are excited about the opportunity across everything we do in RFID. I would say in machine vision really focused in two areas: manufacturing and transportation logistics from a manufacturing perspective, automotive, food and beverage, inside logistics, it's really about warehouse and distribution. We combined our organic investment really with a few acquisitions of Matrox and Adaptive Vision. That's really given us a broad differentiated offering across those markets and creates opportunities for us to win and what we see as a fragmented multibillion-dollar market opportunity for us. Our value proposition really is around marrying software and hardware together and giving a unified software platform to our customers and easy to set up, easy to upgrade really to drive simplicity, speed, efficiency within our customers' organizations that allow them to automate in an easier way and upgrade that automation from things like fixed industrial scanning to machine vision. So, we're excited about both these opportunities. We are the leaders in RFID reading today. We're a challenger in the machine vision market, and we see both being a tremendous opportunity for Zebra. Thank you. As we look towards the long term, the opportunity for Zebra is bright. I'd just like to thank our customers, our partners and employees for their support. We look forward to returning to growth in 2024. Have a good day, everyone."

            "name": "Nathan Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 8. In Q4, sales decreased 33% with distributor destocking accounting for more than one-quarter of the decline. We saw double-digit sales declines across our regions, major product categories and customers of all sizes. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment declined 33.6%, primarily driven by printing. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 32.7% led by data capture and mobile computing. On a positive note, we drove services growth with strong attach and renewal rates. From a sequential perspective, total Q4 sales were $53 million higher than Q3 despite a similar magnitude of distributor inventory destocking due to modest improvement in demand. Adjusted gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 44.6% and primarily due to expense deleveraging from lower sales volumes and the $10 million charge mentioned earlier associated with the renegotiation of a supplier agreement, all of which were partially offset by higher services and software margin and cycling premium supply chain costs in the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses delevered 670 basis points as a percent of sales. The impact was mitigated by more than $20 million of net savings in the quarter from our restructuring actions. This resulted in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.4%, a 710 basis point decrease. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.71, a 64% year-over-year decrease. Increased interest expense contributed to the decline offset by a lower tax rate from executing on a global tax strategy. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 9. We ended the quarter at a 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio which is at the top end of our target range. We generated $102 million of free cash flow in Q4 and had approximately $1.1 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility as of year-end, providing ample flexibility. For the full year 2023, negative free cash flow of $91 million was unfavorable to the prior year, primarily due to lower operating profit, higher interest and tax payments restructuring actions and previously announced settlement payments, all of which were partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments. Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered 2024 with distributor inventory levels aligned with recent demand trends and improved backlog driven by modest year-end budget spending into January from certain retailers. For Q1, we expect a sales decrease between 17% and 20% compared to the prior year. This outlook assumes continued declines across our major product categories, particularly printing and a 50 basis point favorable impact from FX. We anticipate Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 18%, driven by expense deleveraging from lower sales volume, partially offset by lower premium supply chain costs. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.60. Q1 sales and profitability are expected to sequentially increase from Q4 as distributor inventories and end market demand has stabilized, and we have realized incremental benefits from cost actions. For the full year 2024, we expect sales to be in the range of a 1% decline and 3% growth. Although we are beginning to see signs of improvement in order activity, we are not yet seeing signs of a broad market recovery. Consequently, we are taking a cautious approach to our guide until we have increased visibility to a sustained recovery in demand. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2024 is expected to be approximately 19%. We expect our restructuring actions and other profitability initiatives to drive improvement through the year delivering EBITDA margin of 20% in the second half. We remain cautious in our spending and continue to take an agile approach to navigating the environment. We expect our free cash flow in 2024 and to be at least $550 million, including the impact of our final $45 million settlement payment in Q1. We remain focused on rightsizing inventory on our balance sheet, driving 100% cash conversion over a cycle and prioritizing debt pay-down in the near term. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 10. With that, I will turn the call to Bill to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Yes. No, Tommy, I think if you look, we did in the quarter, I'd say, back at pre-pandemic levels entering the quarter from a backlog perspective, where it was a little bit more depressed as we went into Q3 and Q4. And that was primarily driven by some of the uptick we saw in year-end spend that we were able to ship here in the early part of Q1, driving some of the sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1. So, I think again, not to the backlog levels we were at a few years ago, during maybe peak of the supply chain challenges, but definitely a sequential improvement with some of the incremental volume as well as getting our inventory in the channel right-sized. So again, we feel good about the backlog we have entering the first quarter relative to the guide. Yes. Maybe I'll start with just kind of the framework for the guidance. So yes, you're right. If you look at our Q1 guide, down 17% to 20% sequentially, that does improve from Q4 as we are not assuming any additional distributor destocking. So that drives the vast majority of the sequential improvement, again, along with the some uptick in demand that we saw particularly around year-end spend. And then if you look at the full year guide of 1% at the midpoint as you noted, if you look we expect Q2 to look similar to Q1 with the modest sequential improvement as we move through the second half. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, I think we're cautious given the lack of visibility and the commitment to the pipeline in the second half. So if you look kind of again at the balance of the year, as you noted, really the growth is entirely driven by the 2023 destocking with the market flat, maybe down a little bit in Q2, up a little bit in the second half. And we think that's appropriate given the visibility we have around the demand environment. I would say that overall, talking to our customers and spending a lot of time with our customers and partners through NRF that clearly, our customers see that there's tremendous value in what we do for them each and every day to make their businesses more effective and more efficient and to literally run their businesses. So, we see the opportunities across each one of our vertical markets as we see really retail likely returning first is where continuing to work with them as they've been holding off and sweating assets within their environments and our engagements with NRF, certainly, we've seen optimism by our retail customers in the second half of the year. We marry our mobile devices there with our software solutions. And what we talk about is really resonating with them around our modern store initiative. We see that in transportation logistics, our value proposition remains really to help our customers with things like labor constraints and additional supply chain visibility across their businesses and we're excited about opportunities there within opportunities in technologies such as RFID as they look to get more to productivity across their businesses. We've got the MODEX trade show coming up in transportation logistics, Expo coming up next month here. And will showcase our solutions to across transportation logistics. We've talked about manufacturing has really been an opportunity for us is that we're less penetrated in that market, and we've got new solutions around machine vision and robotic automation and our demand planning software offering inside manufacturing. So we see that as an opportunity for us. And then lastly, health care, as we continue to see ways to automate workflows and digitally connect assets and patients and staff within the health care environment. We see home health care and telehealth being an opportunity. So, there's lots of opportunities across each one of the vertical markets. We'd probably say that retail is a place that we've seen some of the positive year-end spending first. And then I think the other vertical markets will follow. Yes, Meta. So on the first question, you're right. So it was about $20 million, $25 million more of incremental destocking versus the original guide and the balance of that was offset by higher demand to come in above our guidance midpoint for Q4. So, I think we thought that is a -- I'll get a positive trend that again, we would take a little bit more out of the channel to set us up here as we moved into 2024. Now as it relates to interest rates, I think we feel good about actually our position. What you'll see in the cost of borrowing that includes all of our crediting and banking fees. But if you look at the overall cost of borrowing and where we trade at I think we feel good about the position, but we're always looking at opportunities given the environment to whether it makes sense to refinance and take advantage of the market. So that's something we're actively looking at. But today, we don't feel like we're at a disadvantage relative to the debt cost position. Yes, and I think if you look back historically at this point in the year, we would have always assumed we'd have several of those large mega deployments in the second half, even though we may not have identified exactly which customer, but we would -- that was something we always had. And I think that's where we've pulled back on that assumption, given the experience we've had over the last several quarters. And the fact, as Bill said, there's not a firm commitment. So until we start to see some of those firm commitments, we didn't think it was appropriate to lean in and just assume that some of those will start to come back in the second half. Yes. So again, if you look at our full year guide of 19% that does have us at 20% in the second half and as we head into 2025. We thought that was important for us to work through as we went through the cost actions and if you look sequentially, it's about year-on-year, I should say, about one point higher than '23 really around gross margin due to favorable pricing, some lower premium supply chain costs and a bit of volume leverage. If you think about the restructuring benefits, it's about $60 million of benefit improvement from 2024, but that's offset by incentive compensation. So getting back to fully loaded on our our incentive compensation plans for the year. So, those two negate each other for the full year. Again, if you look at our full year guide for free cash flow, one important milestone was getting back to positive free cash flow, which we did in the fourth quarter. Our guidance of at least $550 million has us above 100% free cash flow conversion, excluding our final Honeywell payment here in the first quarter, and our expectation is for modest decreases in inventory and working capital throughout the year. And there could be some opportunity to exceed, if we get back to our optimized inventory levels, but we did not include that in our guidance, just given some of the uncertainty around demand and the mix of that demand. Yes. So just as it relates to the one that was a onetime charge that's behind us in the fourth quarter, no change in our structural costs or that we did anticipate having moving forward. And we feel like we're, at this point, substantially complete, working with our suppliers around a lot of those longer-term supply agreements, and particularly the ones that we had to entered into in 2021 when we had kind of both a combination of peak demand as well as some of the extended lead times across the supply chain. And you'll actually see that if you look at we have also a 75% decrease in some of our long-term purchase commitments that we have in our 10-K. So, again, a lot of great progress by the team working through that throughout the year, and our focus really here this year is around components that we still have at our Tier 1 manufacturers. So that's a lot around just demand timing, working through that as well as a lot of the great work by the team to redesign those components into existing or new products as well as working with our manufacturing partners just around the safety stock that they hold. So I think we see a lot of progress there. And again, the charge we had in the fourth quarter was really associated with one supplier and one contract we signed back in 2021. And that was a combination of canceling as well as deferring some of the purchase commitments we had here in 2024 to mitigate some of the working capital pressure as well as it gives us a lot more flexibility around the mix of the components and again, the timing of when we expect to receive those or take -- or accept those components on our balance sheet. So again, we thought it was the right thing to do to kind of get that past us and move forward here as we move into. Yes, obviously, there's new concerns that we're monitoring with the risk of the escalating tensions in the Red Sea. So, we're monitoring the situation, working with our partners Today, we have mitigation plans, again, pending any further escalation of the situation. I think what's important for context is this really primarily impacts our printing business into EMEA. That's where we ship via ocean through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. So again, the vast majority of our products are still air shipped or ocean shipped from the Asia into the West Coast of the U.S. So, we think it's -- as of today, it's a modest impact on extended lead times, which we've communicated to our partners, particularly in the EMEA region and a negligible impact expected on margin here in the first quarter. That's right. I think the other -- yes, the bright spot on the service and software is the improved margins. So a lot of great work by the team focus on the cost structure for both of those pieces of the business. So that was a nice improvement as we move to the second half, and it will be a tailwind as we move here into 2024, along with the expectation that those businesses will continue to grow. Yes. So, if you look at our the expanded cost reduction plan at $120 million of net annualized savings, $20 million higher than our prior guide with the additional actions expected to be completed here middle part -- by the middle part of the year, so we realized $50 million of savings in the second half of '23. So, we're expecting $60 million of incremental benefit into '24 and then the balance as we head into 2025. And what we had in the past, they're pretty broad-based across functions. So I'd say a similar with the declines, the incremental amount was similar structure as we had with the first pass in terms of fairly broad-based. Yes. So, I think one thing I'd say on the $120 million. There's a small piece of that that is in gross margin. So I'd say the vast majority is OpEx. So there's a piece in gross margin just based on some of the actions the supply chain team is taking within our cost structure. So a bit of that is in the $120 million in gross margin. But I'd say for modeling purposes, I'd assume the vast majority is in OpEx. But you're absolutely right. In terms of the sequential improvement in gross margin, our EBITDA rate throughout the year is primarily going to be driven by gross margin, both as some of the actions we've taken around pricing the lower prime supply chain cost, which is, I guess, really here in the first quarter, but also a little bit of volume leverage, project timing as we move through the year. So yes, there's a that's what we'd expect through the year as a kind of modest improvement as we go through the year to get us to where we have as an exit point in the fourth quarter. Yes. So I think a couple of things. Just some of the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 was related to the cost actions that we took and just the timing of those rolling into the P&L, which is, again, what we had expected coming into the quarter. You'll see it increase a bit here as we go through '24 just as we reset comp plans and things like that around incentive compensation. And typically, the first half is a little more front-end loaded just with the timing of projects and deployments. And then Q4 is always a little light just with holidays and whatnot from a project execution. So, I think I would think of similar trajectory from a sequential perspective as we move through the year, but maybe a bit of an uptick just as we kind of again reset all of our comp plans and whatnot for the year. Yes. So as you mentioned, we ended the quarter at 2.5x debt leverage, which is at the high end of our target range. We are prioritizing debt pay down of our variable rate debt here in the short term. And we would expect the debt leverage to increase a bit here through the first and second quarter really just as we lap on the profitability side, not so much debt will come down, but the ratio will increase, but then will decline through the second half as we kind of lap Q3 and Q4's lower profitability. And so that is really the priority here starting out the year as debt pay down but as always, we're going to reassess overall capital deployment and opportunities we have, whether that's share buyback or M&A as the year progresses."

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Steele: Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's third quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially, and we refer you to the factors discussed in our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales performance are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Bill Burns, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill will begin with our third quarter results and actions we are taking. Nathan will then provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our Q4 outlook. Bill will conclude with progress we are making on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer will join us as we take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Bill.\nBill Burns: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us. As expected, our third quarter performance was impacted by broad-based softness across our end markets and elongated sales cycles. This resulted in a significant decline in sales with expense deleveraging impacting profitability. We will spend time today discussing our results, and the demand environment as well as the progress we have made to rationalize our cost structure and shift our go-to-market resources to drive sales growth and improve profitability as our end markets recover. For the quarter, we realized sales of $956 million, a 30% decline from the prior year and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.6% and a 950 basis point decrease and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.87, a 79% decrease from the prior year. We saw broad-based softening of demand in late Q2, which continued throughout Q3 as customers demonstrated more cautious spending behavior across all our end markets and regions. These dynamics have been exacerbated by our distributors reducing their inventory levels, which accounted for about one-third of our Q3 sales decline. As a reminder, our distribution channel has been aggressively driving down inventory as end-user demand has slowed, product lead times have recovered and cost of holding working capital has increased. We believe this reset will largely complete by year-end. Although we experienced declines across all product categories, services and software were bright spots in the quarter. As we enter Q4, potentially all the cost restructuring actions now implemented, we expect to see a significant sequential improvement in profitability. These actions are now expected to yield net annualized cost savings of $100 million, which is an increase from our previous expectation of $85 million. On Slide 5, we summarize drivers of demand trends across our end markets. Our three largest end markets, representing more than three-quarters of our sales volume are indexed to the goods economy, which has been significantly underperforming the services economy. While each of our primary end markets declined, demand was weakest in retail and e-commerce and transportation logistics as many customers are navigating a challenging environment and absorbing capacity built out during the pandemic. As you see on the slide, despite current demand softness, there are several themes that we expect to drive investment in our solutions over the long-term, including labor and resource constraints, real-time supply chain visibility, track and trace mandates and increased expectations from shoppers and patients. Turning to Slide 6. I'd like to review the actions we are taking to address and mitigate the impacts of the soft demand environment and position ourselves for long-term success. In late Q3 and early Q4, we implemented most of the cost restructuring actions that are driving $100 million of net annualized operating savings. We are reallocating resources to accelerate growth in underpenetrated markets, including Japan, along with government and manufacturing sectors, and to capture the potential of new use cases that leverage our solutions to digitize and automate environments, including RFID and machine vision. We are also renegotiating long-term supply agreements and working with our contract manufacturers to drive down component inventories. And as part of our long-term incentive plan, we added a free cash flow conversion [Technical Difficulty] to improve profitability and drive sales growth as our end markets recover. While we believe we are seeing a leveling of demand trends and the peak of distributor destocking activity, we are not seeing signs of a market recovery based on customer behavior. Therefore, we remain cautious in our planning through the remainder of this year and the first half of 2024. We'll continue to take an agile approach to managing through this uncertain environment, and we remain disciplined with respect to our cost structure and cash flow. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q3 financial results and discuss our fourth quarter outlook.\nNathan Winters: Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 8. In Q3, net sales decreased 30.6% and 29.6%, excluding the impact of FX. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment declined 25.8% primarily driven by printing. Enterprise Visibility and Mobility segment sales declined 31.4% with pronounced weakness in mobile computing. On a positive note, we drove growth across service and software with strong attach and renewal rates. We saw double-digit sales declines across our regions. In North America, sales decreased 25%. EMEA sales declined 39% with broad-based declines across the region. Asia-Pacific sales decreased 32% driven by China and Southeast Asia, and Latin America sales decreased 15%, driven by Mexico. Adjusted gross margins decreased 100 basis points to 44.8%, primarily due to expense deleveraging from lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable premium supply chain costs. As these supply chain costs have been fully mitigated, we are no longer including a slide as part of our earnings presentation. Adjusted operating expenses delevered 910 basis points as a percent of sales. Note that the bulk of the previously announced restructuring plans to drive operating expense savings were implemented in late Q3 and early Q4. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.6%, a 950 basis point decrease driven by expense deleveraging. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.87, a 79% year-over-year decrease. Increased interest expense contributed to the decline, offset by a lower tax rate. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 9. For the first nine months of 2023, negative free cash flow of $193 million was unfavorable to the prior year period, primarily due to lower earnings, including the impact of restructuring actions and higher interest costs. Greater use of net working capital due to higher cash taxes and payments for inventory and $45 million more of previously announced quarterly settlement payments, all of which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments. We ended the quarter at 2.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is below the top end of our target range of 2.5x and had approximately $1 billion of capacity on a revolving credit facility providing ample flexibility as we navigate a challenging environment. Let's now turn to our outlook. As we enter the fourth quarter, we are seeing sales velocity out of the channel stabilize on a sequential basis and destocking activity moderate as expected. Our Q4 sales are expected to decline between 32% and 36% compared to the prior year. This outlook assumes double-digit declines across our major product categories, with distributor destocking accounting for approximately one-fifth of the sales decline. We are in Q4 with the necessary backlog and pipeline to support our guide. That said, we are not seeing compelling signs of a market recovery as we look to the first half of 2024. We anticipate Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 16%, driven by expense deleveraging from lower sales volumes, partially mitigated by the benefits of our cost restructuring actions. Despite anticipated expense deleveraging, we expect year-on-year gross margin improvement as we cycle $25 million of premium supply chain costs in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.80. Our Q4 outlook translates to an expected full-year sales decline of approximately 21% at the midpoint, which is 50 basis points favorable to our prior guide and an EBITDA margin of approximately 18%. We expect our free cash flow to be positive for the second half of 2023 and negative for the full-year. We continue to be focused on rightsizing inventory on our balance sheet and in driving 100% cash conversion over a cycle. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 10. With that, I will turn the call to Bill to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\nBill Burns: Thank you, Nathan. While sales are pressured near-term, our solutions remain essential to our customers' operations, and we are well positioned to benefit from the secular trends that digitize and automate workflows. We are focused on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision by elevating Zebra as a premier solutions provider through our compelling portfolio. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, including scarcity of labor and the need to improve productivity. We empower the workforce to execute tasks more effectively by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and prescriptive analytics. We continue to advance and innovate our offerings. This includes several product and solution launches across our portfolio, including our Zebra Pay solution, which equips retail associates, hospitality workers and logistics employees with the mobile point-of-sale device that accepts a variety of payment options almost anywhere. At our Annual Software Customer User Conference, we unveiled our Zebra Work Cloud suite of software solutions, which address four critical enterprise functions, workforce optimization, enterprise collaboration, inventory optimization, and demand intelligence. The user experience is tailored to customer-specific business priorities and integrate it into a single application. This unique software suite, coupled with our mobile computing platform, differentiates us and expands our market penetration opportunity. In collaboration with Qualcomm, we demonstrated a generative AI large language model for handheld mobile computers and tablets without requiring connectivity to the cloud. Is the competitive differentiator, which will enable Zebra partners and customers to create new ways of working by further empowering the frontline worker and driving additional productivity gains. We are confident that the innovation roadmap across our business will continue to elevate our customer value proposition. As you can see on Slide 13, customers leverage our technology to optimize workflows for the on-demand economy. Our solutions empower enterprises to increase collaboration and productivity and better serve customers, shoppers and patients. I would like to highlight some recent wins by our team. A global technology provider recently selected Zebra's machine vision solution to automate a previously manual inspection process for the manufacturing of engraved component parts. Our solution ensures high quality and traceability, reducing expensive material waste and false errors. We look forward to exploring opportunities to expand our relationship with this customer. A large health care system in Europe is using our mobile computers, printers and RFID solutions to enable real-time tracking of medical equipment, significantly reducing the time caregivers spend searching for critical assets throughout the hospital. A large retail pharmacy chain, selected Zebra's work Cloud task management software to improve store productivity and effectiveness by streamlining communication and accelerating on-site inspections and marketing promotion updates. Optimizing task assignments and store walks drives accountability and frees up staff to focus on customer-facing activities. A large North American retailer refreshed our mobile computers across their stores and added RFID technology to improve inventory accuracy, supply chain efficiency and customer satisfaction, the more frequent cycle counts. During the competitive review, Zebra demonstrated the most cost-effective solution for their needs. Lastly, a large Asian retailer decided to add Zebra's communication and collaboration software to their Zebra mobile computers. This subscription-based solution drives store associated connectivity benefits while displacing the legacy phone system. In closing, our long-term conviction in our business remains unchanged. While customer spend is pressured near-term, over the long-term, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows. We will continue to elevate our position with customers through our innovative portfolio of solutions, while executing on actions to position us well for profitable growth as our end markets recover. I will now hand it back to Mike.\nMichael Steele: Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible.\nOperator: And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brad Hewitt from Wolfe Research. Brad, please go ahead.\nBrad Hewitt: Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone.\nBill Burns: Good morning, Brad.\nNathan Winters: Good morning, Brad.\nBrad Hewitt: So I was wondering if you guys would be able to provide some preliminary thoughts on the overall growth setup for 2024, and how we should think about that relative to the 5% to 7% long-term growth algorithm. You talked about the first half kind of being a little bit more challenging. And then of course, comps is in the second half, but any thoughts on the growth outlook for 2024 preliminarily would be helpful.\nNathan Winters: Thanks, Brad. I guess I'd start with what we're seeing today. And from a Q3 perspective, we finished at the high end of our outlook in a challenging demand environment. And as we said, we're seeing leveling of demand trends overall and really in Q3, the peak of distributor destocking, but we're not yet seeing signs of market recovery based on our customers' behavior. So we saw really all region verticals declined in Q3 and along with customers of all sizes, but it was most pronounced in large enterprises. There were some bright spots in the quarter. Services and software are examples of that. I'd say is we're certainly not guiding to '24 at this time. But we're not seeing really compelling recovery yet and the idea that we're going to remain cautious for the remainder of the year. And really, as we look into the first half of '24, we're seeing very -- we have very challenging compares ahead of us. So I'd say that for the moment, still challenging demand environment that we would see that in '24 and the remainder of the year, we're going to remain cautious.\nBrad Hewitt: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe if you could talk about what you saw in Q3 from a bookings perspective and how bookings looked sequentially as well as what you expect bookings to look like in Q4?\nNathan Winters: I would say that, again, with demand challenging from that perspective, bookings were as we expected going into -- during Q3 and then as we enter Q4, we've got the bookings trajectory to feel good about our guide for Q4 overall. But again, not seeing quite signs of recovery yet, but feel that we've got the order velocity to be able to deliver on our guide for Q4.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tommy Moll from Stephens. Tommy, please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.\nBill Burns: Good morning, Tommy.\nTommy Moll: I think I heard in your prepared comments, you described the velocity on the sell-through as having stabilized. And I wanted to circle back to that topic. One, just to make sure that, that's correct. And two, if you think about that sell-through velocity at some point, and maybe you could tell us when that is when would you expect an acceleration there, just given that you'll have some product refresh cycles where a lot of your installed base is approaching end of useful life, and it's less of a discretionary spend on the part of the customer.\nNathan Winters: Yes, I think, Tom, we view the word leveling is we've seen those demand trends level out in Q3, and we're seeing that kind of into Q4. And we're seeing that from a destocking perspective, the biggest impact has been Q3 and again, less so in Q4, and we believe that will be behind us by year-end. And again, while we're not guiding to '24, maybe a little more color to add to what I said on the first question, we don't see compelling signs of recovery yet, right? And therefore, our guide for fourth quarter. And then as we look into first half of '24, we see very challenging compares. But that said, we're not seeing customers cancel projects. They continue to push them out. And they can't do that forever. We're seeing use cases across our products and solutions continue to grow within our customer environment. They will resume deployments as they use the excess capacity across retail and e-commerce across transportation logistics and as our customers around the world see the macro uncertainty abate. So we've seen this in similar downturns where typically, they last for Zebra quarters, not years. So as we go through the year, we do see some progression. And while our visibility for the second half would remain very challenging at the moment, we would be clearly cycling through easier compares at that time and really due to the restocking -- that the destocking, sorry, that we were seeing in the second half of this year. So I think that's how we'd see it at the moment.\nTommy Moll: And to follow-up on the destocking theme, it sounds like you expect most of that to be behind you by the end of the year. And my question is just relating to the visibility there. If 60 days on hand is typical or something in that ZIP code for your channel, broadly speaking, do you have any idea where you sit today? And is there a view that, that will remain the \"normal level,\" or could there be some period of time where we end up below that, just given conservatism among your channel partners at this point? Thanks.\nNathan Winters: Hey Tommy, this is Nathan. As we said, from a global channel inventory, which again, we measure on days on hand, and as you said, the average is around 60 days, two months, but that varies -- you can see quite a bit of variation based on the product type and by region. So again, it's not consistent globally. And as we said, we -- in the end of Q3, better than we did in Q2, so the days on hand and the relative inventory balances decreased throughout the quarter. I'd say still slightly higher than the normal range despite those decreases. And that's why we expect distributors will continue to lower their inventory here throughout the fourth quarter, but we do expect to exit the fourth quarter within our normal operating levels. And that's something we work with very closely with our distributors on in terms of where they try to get to what products do they need to support the markets. And so again, as we enter next year, we expect kind of the destocking to be and where it needs to be as we move forward into the year.\nOperator: And we move to a question from Damian Karas from UBS. Damian, please go ahead.\nDamian Karas: Hi, good morning everyone.\nBill Burns: Good morning, Damian.\nDamian Karas: Good morning. So not to beat a dead horse here on the demand environment and recovery. But Bill mentioned not seeing signs of that as you think about early 2024, I get that you're seeing that based on your order patterns, but based on your customer conversations, I mean, what do you think it's going to take to see that inflection of demand to drive that? And where would you see it first? Thinking about the various markets you play in and your diverse set of customers?\nBill Burns: Yes. What I'd say is that overall, we'd have to see strengthening certainly of a goods based economy. And our customers overall will resume deployments as they -- some of the macroeconomic uncertainty around the good based economy abates. And in T&L and e-commerce, we've seen significant capacity built out during the pandemic and that excess capacity has to be used within their environment. And that's across their entire environment where we've built that capacity that now is more being used and demand is more normalized levels than the accelerated levels through the pandemic. I would say overall, when we see the broader demand across the industry, we're seeing that where first, likely large customers first is what we'd expect that large customers, the first area where we saw it challenging from a demand environment, so we'd expect that to return first. And then from their midsize and run rate would follow. I don't know, Joe, if you want to add anything.\nJoachim Heel: Yes. Maybe just a little bit on that point. During the supply-constrained phase, we had given some priority to some of our larger customers. So that's where a large amount of the volume and the capacity that went into the market went. And that's where we're seeing the steepest declines at this point. So I would expect that, that's also where we would see the first signs of recovery where those customers would begin purchasing again. And we are staying very close to those large customers as we're seeing them sweat their assets longer, we know exactly when they are reaching those points in the product life cycle where they will need to refresh. And we're working with them on plans that will fit their budgets. And you can imagine, as we're going into 2024, they're coming up with new budgets and we're working with them on doing that. So that's perhaps where I would look first.\nDamian Karas: Got it. That's really helpful. And then maybe if we could switch gears and talk about gross margins. Curious how you are thinking about what those look like from here, is there a further downside from the third quarter just based on the volume levels you're seeing? And how should we think about the kind of the new baseline or normalized gross margin?\nNathan Winters: Yes, Damian. So if you look just maybe for context on Q3 gross margin, obviously, down year-on-year by about one point to 44.8%, volume deleveraging was a major driver of the decline as we did see favorability in premium supply chain costs. Now that those are entirely mitigated. So that was a two-point favorable impact as well as we're seeing nice traction from the pricing actions we've taken over the last several years and continued to strengthen our service and software margins. So if we look at our underlying gross margins with the pricing actions we've taken to offset component cost increases, inflation with the freight cost declining. Really now the focus is on rebalancing our manufacturing and distribution capacity to the lower volumes so that we can again, start to see those margins recover as we go into next year. So I think the -- as we look here at the second half is the low watermark just given the sharp volume declines and making sure we reset capacity to that while giving us flexibility to grow as the market recovers.\nOperator: We now have a question from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Keith, please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Thank you. Good morning guys. If you perhaps focus a little bit on Zebra's own inventory levels, which obviously are still high compared to historical levels. Is this more component cost product parts, or is it more finished goods? And then second to that is, do you guys have minimum purchase agreements with your OEMs where if you're not making the minimum purchases, you're going to have penalties you'll incur?\nNathan Winters: Keith, so just on our own inventory, as expected, our inventory balances stayed relatively flat to where we were at the end of the second quarter. We don't expect to see a material change as we exit the year. And as we said before and as you stated, the primary increase from where we'd expect to be is all around component -- consigned components that are at our Tier 1 manufacturers. So these are inventory that we made purchase commitments on going back to a year, 1.5 year ago at really the peak demand as well as the peak supply chain challenges and issues where the lead times were out greater than a year. So really absorbing those inbound components as our demand decrease. I think the team has done a phenomenal job working with all of our partners to reduce those purchase commitments. If you look at our outstanding purchase commitments, we've cut those in half since the beginning of the year. We've driven down finished good balance since the beginning of the year. So we're making traction, although you don't see it in the headline numbers. So really now, it's around getting stability in the demand signal to our suppliers so that we can in right size those inbound components. If you -- to your last question, we don't have a minimum purchase agreement that it has penalties. Obviously, we work with our Tier 1 manufacturers to have different tiering in terms of volume on our purchase price to cover their overhead. But there's not a, I'd say, a penalty per se at certain volumes, it's just making sure that they have the right capacity within their cost structure.\nKeith Housum: Okay. If I could follow-up on that. And as we look forward to like 2024, is there a rule of thumb or where do you think your inventory level should be under optimal level? Because, of course, we'd assume that you'll have some positive free cash flow next year as that gets worked down?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So I would say, if you look at base, if you go back to our historical turns and you account for some of the M&A over the past couple of years, we said about a $200 million reduction would get us back to say, normalized levels. When and how quickly we can achieve that is the question. And some of that depends on, again, some of the demand stability as we go into next year. But that $200 million reduction would be entirely in consigned inventory components at our manufacturers.\nOperator: We'll take a question now from Joe Giordano from TD Cowen. Joe, please go ahead.\nJoseph Giordano: Hey, good morning guys.\nBill Burns: Good morning, Joe.\nJoseph Giordano: So I'll ask a couple of higher, bigger picture kind of questions. We've dug into the near term dynamics quite a bit here. I've had a lot of questions about like longer term, what is a shift from potentially into kind of fixed automation mean for you guys? So you have huge share in mobile computers. And then what happens as you get more and more of these kind of big RFID-type fixed mounted scanners instead of having a person make scans. Like what does that mean for you over time if the percentage of scans being done by humans goes down?\nBill Burns: Yes, I would say that the investments we're making across the portfolio, including new areas such as RFID and machine vision both play to exactly that. We see a need for both handheld devices, handled scanning, mobile printing just as we do fixed table operating and fixed industrial scanning/machine vision as well as RFID readers. So that's why we've got a broad base across the portfolio as our customers continue to digitize and automate their environments. Ultimately, there are places where a fixed industrial scanning machine vision imager makes more sense than someone holding hands -- something in their hand or a hand scanner. RFID does very similar type things, but you marry RFID technology along with barcode scanning. So we think of machine vision and fixed industrial scanning is closely addition to our scanning business, really fixed versus handheld, and we see RFID portfolio the same way where we've got handheld RFID readers and fixed RFID readers across the portfolio just as we have tabletop RFID printers in mobile. So we think that mobility is going to continue to be an important aspect of our business, but fixed is as well as we're seeing more fixed infrastructure, more automation in our environments. And that's why we're invested in both. And I think that machine vision and RFID both represent attractive markets for us for that very reason.\nJoachim Heel: And Joe -- this is Joe Heel, I'll add. I think this is also an opportunity for us to add additional value to our customers, specifically because in both areas, the customers will need more than just the hardware solutions that they might buy from us today as a handheld reader, for example, they will need, in particular, software and other accessories. And so if you think about our machine vision business, a very important part of that is the software component, which, by and large, we don't provide today when it comes to a handheld scanner. But in the machine vision, environment, we do provide that. So it's a great opportunity for us to create additional value for customers, but also for us at Zebra.\nJoseph Giordano: That was a very good answer. I just want one more on -- we talked about the trends are not yet improving, but some of the true weakness in the destock is getting away. So as we come out of that, which I assume we do at some point, when I think back to your 2021, 2022, you're doing $17.5, $18.5 of earnings, how do you categorize those years? So revenue was obviously very strong, but margins were maybe somewhat pressured from some of the supply chain, and what you guys had to do to deliver. So like what would it -- what kind of market -- end market dynamics do you think would need to be in place to get earnings back to levels like that? Because my guess is that you don't need revenues to be nearly that high.\nBill Burns: I think that overall, we would expect to see continued progression in margin as our markets recover overall. So I would say that we would expect to get back to the levels that we've had in the past, and there's no reason why we wouldn't. There's been a lot of challenges in moving pieces over the last several years, including tariffs, supply chain challenges that the significant increase demand we saw over the last two years driven by the pandemic and building out of capacity. But I think that returning to the profitability levels that we've had prior, we see that continuing to progress throughout in 2024 as we get back to more normal levels of demand and our customers begin to buy again. And as we continue to be very thoughtful around our costs, right? So I think we're going to continue to be cautious in spending as we have been. We are taking $100 million of annual cost out of the business in 2024 and that will also add to profitability along with demand returns. So we see profitability to continue to progress, and there's no reason why we can't get back to past levels. That's how we see it.\nOperator: And we will take a question now from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Meta, please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of questions for me. The health care market has been kind of a source of strength over the past couple of years. Just wondering if there's kind of any commentary about that market maybe being less consumer goods related than the others? And then maybe the second question, you noted kind of a step-up in investments in the manufacturing market. That's already kind of a pretty strong market for you. So I guess, is that kind of a combination of bringing robotics machine vision into that market, or just kind of what are kind of some of the areas that you think are unexploited there? Thanks.\nBill Burns: I would say that health care and manufacturing less declines than the other markets, so less impacted overall, but they are still seeing the same trends at a broader market. I would say, overall, in health care, our -- has been in the past, our fastest growing vertical market, but our smallest. As health care continues to look to improve productivity, enhance patient safety, clearly automating workflows and digitizing assets within that environment creates an opportunity for the full breadth of our solutions portfolio across scanning, printing, mobile computing, RFID all play a role within health care. We're also announcing new opportunities across health care in things like tablets for home health care or telehealth all remain opportunities for us. So we're -- we like the health care market, and we continue to develop very specific products for the health care their market overall. I'd say in manufacturing, while we've got a strong base within our manufacturing customers, a lot of that is really tied to more of their logistics and distribution network more so than kind of assembly and on the line. And I think you said it best already machine vision, robotic automation for -- in the manufacturing environment with good transport demand planning for our CPG customers with Antuit, all leverage or give us more strength to meet the demands of that marketplace overall. So we've shifted sales resources to focus on manufacturing and continue to look to recruit more partners in that area. We see that as an area for Zebra where we're less penetrated than others, primarily because we are in certain product areas, print and for instance, on the manufacturing floor, but we could do more there in our new solutions. So we clearly see manufacturing and health care is both opportunities for us to grow moving forward.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take a question from Andrew Buscaglia from PNB Paribas. Andrew, please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Good morning, guys.\nBill Burns: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. So just -- I know you don't give guidance for '24, but you are talking to kind of how you think the things trending into the New Year. And I'm wondering if you could talk about maybe a range of scenarios with distributors starting to restock potentially. I guess what drives the slope of that restocking? Like in terms of like is there the psychology of the distributor more aligned with what their end customer is providing them with the confidence to restock those shelves, I guess what I'm trying to ask is like, how do you view the cadence of that restocking event if it were to occur next year?\nJoachim Heel: Yes. So I can address some of that, Andrew. Over the course of the last few quarters, we've gotten a lot tighter with our distributors in both understanding and agreeing on the objectives that they have in their business, which have changed. And in particular, the increasing cost of capital has led them to set very aggressive inventory targets for their business. And then using those targets, to ensure that we stay in sync as demand has been relatively volatile, right? So demand has come down, they have adjusted their inventory to match that, and that's what we're calling destocking. So if you now think about that in reverse, what has to occur is that they have to start seeing improvements in sales out, which we, of course, are working very heavily. We generate the majority of our demand with our sales force working together with our partners. So we're working with them to generate that sales out demand. As soon as they see that tick up again, we're pretty confident that they will follow with stocking in lockstep to achieve those DIO or days of inventory outstanding targets that we have now really good visibility to and a clear understanding with them as well as incentives in place for them to reach those. So it's really generating that demand and seeing it. We think the inventory will just follow.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. Very clear. And your two biggest markets, e-commerce and retail versus transportation and logistics, are you seeing any difference in the demand trends and dynamics driving those two areas. I guess, what is the key difference for you? Is one starter than the other, is one more likely to come back faster than the other. Yes, I guess could you parse that out?\nNathan Winters: Yes, Andrew, I would say they're tied a couple pretty tightly together, especially when you consider e-commerce versus buy online and pick up in store or brick-and-mortar retail. So I'd say e-commerce and trans logistics tied together because of really parcel delivery. And I think in that case, both had built out e-commerce providers and transportation logistics built out significant network capacity across everything they did, their networks, their capacity around logistics and others to be able to meet the demands during COVID, which now kind of reset to pre-COVID levels and are going to grow from there. And I think you've seen moderating demand across e-commerce overall. So I think those two are tied together. I think brick-and-mortar retail, think of in-store, I think that's really more tied to the goods economy. So goods versus service-based economy, which is still relatively challenged. So I'd say e-commerce and translation districts tied hand-in-hand, brick-and-mortar retail, a little bit more goods economy focused. I wouldn't see much difference in those two. The recovery really is going to be driven by using up this excess capacity we talked about or and a recovery from more positive signs in from an economic perspective overall for those markets to come back.\nJoachim Heel: Maybe there's one area that you could see a slight additional opportunity on the retail front. And that is, of course, the one area where they don't overlap, which is the store. Retailers have been itching for some time, and we have had this vision that you can significantly improve the productivity of a retail store by having all of the workers in the store connected and collaborating. And they haven't yet realized that vision. That's been part of what's been deferred as they're going through the current phase of pausing and spending and scrutinizing their budgets. But they really do want to do that. I hear that from retailers all the time that they believe that there's a big productivity improvement to be had there, in particular, because some of their peers have done it, and they have seen those improvements. So that part of spending is still out there and it I'm convinced it will come our way, and that will create an additional demand on the part of retailers with stores that transportation companies don't have.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Rob Mason from Baird. Rob, please go ahead.\nRobert Mason: Yes, good morning all. I wanted to maybe just probe again, your thoughts as we get into '24 and not the put a stake into the ground at midyear '24. But I'm just curious, as you think about normal replacement cycles, how would your average age of your installed base look midyear next year? Would it be at an average level or below average, above average?\nBill Burns: Yes, I'd say that, Rob, what we said is we're not guiding to 24% as we've talked about before. I would say, again, from a color perspective, that on average, I guess, it would be the same. What we're seeing today is our customers sweating some of their assets longer than they normally would. They can only do that so long. Devices get older, they want to use more applications requiring faster processor speeds, more memory, you see OSs moving forward, so security and others. So there's reasons for them to upgrade those devices over time. Could they sweat them for a certain amount of time, yes. But then eventually, that kind of comes our way, and they go ahead and upgrade. So I would say average life cycle of demand in second half, nothing changing there. We're working closely with our customers to make sure we understand their refresh cycles. And I think that while there's very little visibility in the second half of the year, I think the biggest thing to remember is we're going to cycle compares that are easier and this destocking moves away. So I think that's positive. But I would say average number of refreshes out their average length of the devices in service and today, customer sweating assets.\nJoachim Heel: Maybe I'll give you a two data points to support that. One is in Q2, the pushouts that we had in Q1 tripled. And in Q3, the pushouts were about the same as they were in Q2 which was almost the same as what we had in the entire year of 2020. So you can see that there's a lot of demand being pushed out, and those are all refreshes that should be happening now to maintain the average life of our estate out there. And so the average life of our estate is likely going up. And at some point, and that's what we said a couple of times already, sorry to repeat it, is that at some point, they will have to buy and refresh those devices.\nRobert Mason: Understood. That's good color. Bill, I wanted to go back to one of your earlier comments in the opening remarks. I thought I heard you mentioned a shift in go-to-market resources. And I was hoping you could put a little more color around that. And maybe just jointly, you talked about also accelerating growth in some of these underpenetrated markets, and I'm just curious if there's a connection there. And how are those underpenetrated markets performing right now relative to some of your more traditional markets?\nBill Burns: Yes, I would say that manufacturing is a good example of that. It's has been less impacted, still down significantly year-on-year, but less than other markets. That is an opportunity we've talked about earlier in the call. I think there's other markets. Japan is an area that we're investing additional resources as well. And we've won a large postal opportunity there and the largest retailer in Japan most recently, and we're leveraging those wins and larger partners within Japan to do more business within Japan. Government is another area that we haven't had a lot of focus on in the past, but there remains opportunities for us to grow our business within government. I think from a product perspective, we talked a bit about RFID and machine vision as fixed industrial scanning and machine vision around inspection, but also RFID around automation and digitizing and automating customers' environments. Tablet is another good example of an area in which is closely adjacent to mobile computing and people want larger screen formats at times, and that creates an opportunity for us. So it's both a market perspective as well as a technology perspective. And tactically, we're reallocating resources across regions and areas to address these. We've started that already in Q3, and we'll continue to do that as we enter 2004. Some are short-term opportunities and others are longer-term opportunities. But we think it's important that we continue to be agile, not only in the cost side of things, but also on where we're deploying our resources to see and address the most attractive growth markets for us and stay close to our current customers, but really shift resources are the places that we see recovering the faster or that we're underpenetrated today, that's how we see it.\nOperator: We will now take a question from Brian Drab from William Blair. Brian, please go ahead.\nBrian Drab: Okay. Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered, obviously, at this point. Can you just talk about Fetch and some of the other acquisitions that you made in 2021. You spent quite a bit of money in 2021 and the assets kind of averaged like 9x to 10x sales in terms of purchase price. Is there -- can you just give an update on how Fetch and Matrox and the other business that you've acquired recently is doing? And is there any risk of impairment as you're looking at that going into year-end here potentially?\nBill Burns: I think we can -- starting maybe with software is the largest segment and some of the acquisitions we did around Reflexis and Antuit prescriptive analytics in that area. We continue to focus on the retail associates and really enabling the retail associate through a suite of products and solutions portfolio around work cloud as we've announced at our recent customer user event around software, and that seems to be resonating well with our customers. This idea that taking task management, workforce management, communication, collaboration, demand planning combining that into a single application, leveraging our mobile devices in the hands of the associates in retail, and it plays into what Joe talked about earlier, this idea for a device for everyone within retail. So we see our software assets being important part of marrying with our mobile devices within retail and the idea of putting devices in the hands of more retail associates. I would say machine vision, $100-plus million market to us attractive, fragmented market overall. The focus there is manufacturing. We've talked about that earlier in the call, but also logistics and the idea of fixed industrial scanning, they continue to both look to ways to automate, to drive productivity, to improve quality across their organizations. I think the challenge to machine vision in the short term is the same as others are seeing, certainly, cyclical weakness in semiconductors where when we acquired the asset in machine vision, we knew Matrox was heavily weighted towards semiconductor and our objective there is to not only scale that business, but to diversify the offerings outside of semiconductor into new attractive markets. They could include automotive, food and beverage, inside fixed industrial scanning warehouse and distribution. So all those are represent opportunities for us, and we're excited about that market and our focus there is really diversification scale in driving share gains across machine vision. I would say Fetch and robotics automation or warehouse automation perspective, it's the smallest, still nascent in that area. I would say we're focused in two areas predominantly. First is Goods Transport. And again, we talked about that playing in line side replenishment, for instance, inside manufacturing, but also just good transport in general, of moving goods from A to B of varying sizes, that's an attractive market for us. The other market is e-commerce. So think of e-commerce picking, cobots and humans working together within that environment, where our devices today are being used by those workers to pick orders and adding additional productivity using automation and robotics is an interesting opportunity for us longer term. So it's the smallest of the segment. We don't see any impairment opportunities there or issues or concerns. We really find these three as attractive long-term growth opportunities for Zebra overall. And some are challenged in the short-term. As I said, machine vision is a good example of that with semiconductors, but we have the long-term prospects of the machine vision and fixed industrial scanning market remain very attractive to us.\nOperator: Ken Newman from KeyBanc Capital Markets has a question. Ken, please go ahead. I'm sorry. Let's go to Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Company. Jim, go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: [Indiscernible] on for Jim. Most of the questions that I had have been addressed, but maybe just one for me. for the incremental $15 million of savings, is that in any one particular area or just a broad deepening across the existing targeted areas? Thank you.\nNathan Winters: Not in one particular area, just broad-based, as we've worked through the plans throughout the third quarter and the fourth and scrutinized where we had to backfill certain roles with the retirement plans as well as just any open roles that have come along, just again scrutinizing that spend is really what drove it. So again, I would say fairly broad based and in line with the actions that we're driving for the company.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Burns for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nBill Burns: Thank you. I'd like to thank our customers, partners, and employees for their support and dedication to our long-term success. Have a good day, everybody. Thank you.\nOperator: Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Burns",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us. As expected, our third quarter performance was impacted by broad-based softness across our end markets and elongated sales cycles. This resulted in a significant decline in sales with expense deleveraging impacting profitability. We will spend time today discussing our results, and the demand environment as well as the progress we have made to rationalize our cost structure and shift our go-to-market resources to drive sales growth and improve profitability as our end markets recover. For the quarter, we realized sales of $956 million, a 30% decline from the prior year and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.6% and a 950 basis point decrease and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.87, a 79% decrease from the prior year. We saw broad-based softening of demand in late Q2, which continued throughout Q3 as customers demonstrated more cautious spending behavior across all our end markets and regions. These dynamics have been exacerbated by our distributors reducing their inventory levels, which accounted for about one-third of our Q3 sales decline. As a reminder, our distribution channel has been aggressively driving down inventory as end-user demand has slowed, product lead times have recovered and cost of holding working capital has increased. We believe this reset will largely complete by year-end. Although we experienced declines across all product categories, services and software were bright spots in the quarter. As we enter Q4, potentially all the cost restructuring actions now implemented, we expect to see a significant sequential improvement in profitability. These actions are now expected to yield net annualized cost savings of $100 million, which is an increase from our previous expectation of $85 million. On Slide 5, we summarize drivers of demand trends across our end markets. Our three largest end markets, representing more than three-quarters of our sales volume are indexed to the goods economy, which has been significantly underperforming the services economy. While each of our primary end markets declined, demand was weakest in retail and e-commerce and transportation logistics as many customers are navigating a challenging environment and absorbing capacity built out during the pandemic. As you see on the slide, despite current demand softness, there are several themes that we expect to drive investment in our solutions over the long-term, including labor and resource constraints, real-time supply chain visibility, track and trace mandates and increased expectations from shoppers and patients. Turning to Slide 6. I'd like to review the actions we are taking to address and mitigate the impacts of the soft demand environment and position ourselves for long-term success. In late Q3 and early Q4, we implemented most of the cost restructuring actions that are driving $100 million of net annualized operating savings. We are reallocating resources to accelerate growth in underpenetrated markets, including Japan, along with government and manufacturing sectors, and to capture the potential of new use cases that leverage our solutions to digitize and automate environments, including RFID and machine vision. We are also renegotiating long-term supply agreements and working with our contract manufacturers to drive down component inventories. And as part of our long-term incentive plan, we added a free cash flow conversion [Technical Difficulty] to improve profitability and drive sales growth as our end markets recover. While we believe we are seeing a leveling of demand trends and the peak of distributor destocking activity, we are not seeing signs of a market recovery based on customer behavior. Therefore, we remain cautious in our planning through the remainder of this year and the first half of 2024. We'll continue to take an agile approach to managing through this uncertain environment, and we remain disciplined with respect to our cost structure and cash flow. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q3 financial results and discuss our fourth quarter outlook. Thank you, Nathan. While sales are pressured near-term, our solutions remain essential to our customers' operations, and we are well positioned to benefit from the secular trends that digitize and automate workflows. We are focused on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision by elevating Zebra as a premier solutions provider through our compelling portfolio. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, including scarcity of labor and the need to improve productivity. We empower the workforce to execute tasks more effectively by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and prescriptive analytics. We continue to advance and innovate our offerings. This includes several product and solution launches across our portfolio, including our Zebra Pay solution, which equips retail associates, hospitality workers and logistics employees with the mobile point-of-sale device that accepts a variety of payment options almost anywhere. At our Annual Software Customer User Conference, we unveiled our Zebra Work Cloud suite of software solutions, which address four critical enterprise functions, workforce optimization, enterprise collaboration, inventory optimization, and demand intelligence. The user experience is tailored to customer-specific business priorities and integrate it into a single application. This unique software suite, coupled with our mobile computing platform, differentiates us and expands our market penetration opportunity. In collaboration with Qualcomm, we demonstrated a generative AI large language model for handheld mobile computers and tablets without requiring connectivity to the cloud. Is the competitive differentiator, which will enable Zebra partners and customers to create new ways of working by further empowering the frontline worker and driving additional productivity gains. We are confident that the innovation roadmap across our business will continue to elevate our customer value proposition. As you can see on Slide 13, customers leverage our technology to optimize workflows for the on-demand economy. Our solutions empower enterprises to increase collaboration and productivity and better serve customers, shoppers and patients. I would like to highlight some recent wins by our team. A global technology provider recently selected Zebra's machine vision solution to automate a previously manual inspection process for the manufacturing of engraved component parts. Our solution ensures high quality and traceability, reducing expensive material waste and false errors. We look forward to exploring opportunities to expand our relationship with this customer. A large health care system in Europe is using our mobile computers, printers and RFID solutions to enable real-time tracking of medical equipment, significantly reducing the time caregivers spend searching for critical assets throughout the hospital. A large retail pharmacy chain, selected Zebra's work Cloud task management software to improve store productivity and effectiveness by streamlining communication and accelerating on-site inspections and marketing promotion updates. Optimizing task assignments and store walks drives accountability and frees up staff to focus on customer-facing activities. A large North American retailer refreshed our mobile computers across their stores and added RFID technology to improve inventory accuracy, supply chain efficiency and customer satisfaction, the more frequent cycle counts. During the competitive review, Zebra demonstrated the most cost-effective solution for their needs. Lastly, a large Asian retailer decided to add Zebra's communication and collaboration software to their Zebra mobile computers. This subscription-based solution drives store associated connectivity benefits while displacing the legacy phone system. In closing, our long-term conviction in our business remains unchanged. While customer spend is pressured near-term, over the long-term, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows. We will continue to elevate our position with customers through our innovative portfolio of solutions, while executing on actions to position us well for profitable growth as our end markets recover. I will now hand it back to Mike. Good morning, Brad. Good morning, Tommy. Good morning, Damian. Yes. What I'd say is that overall, we'd have to see strengthening certainly of a goods based economy. And our customers overall will resume deployments as they -- some of the macroeconomic uncertainty around the good based economy abates. And in T&L and e-commerce, we've seen significant capacity built out during the pandemic and that excess capacity has to be used within their environment. And that's across their entire environment where we've built that capacity that now is more being used and demand is more normalized levels than the accelerated levels through the pandemic. I would say overall, when we see the broader demand across the industry, we're seeing that where first, likely large customers first is what we'd expect that large customers, the first area where we saw it challenging from a demand environment, so we'd expect that to return first. And then from their midsize and run rate would follow. I don't know, Joe, if you want to add anything. Good morning, Joe. Yes, I would say that the investments we're making across the portfolio, including new areas such as RFID and machine vision both play to exactly that. We see a need for both handheld devices, handled scanning, mobile printing just as we do fixed table operating and fixed industrial scanning/machine vision as well as RFID readers. So that's why we've got a broad base across the portfolio as our customers continue to digitize and automate their environments. Ultimately, there are places where a fixed industrial scanning machine vision imager makes more sense than someone holding hands -- something in their hand or a hand scanner. RFID does very similar type things, but you marry RFID technology along with barcode scanning. So we think of machine vision and fixed industrial scanning is closely addition to our scanning business, really fixed versus handheld, and we see RFID portfolio the same way where we've got handheld RFID readers and fixed RFID readers across the portfolio just as we have tabletop RFID printers in mobile. So we think that mobility is going to continue to be an important aspect of our business, but fixed is as well as we're seeing more fixed infrastructure, more automation in our environments. And that's why we're invested in both. And I think that machine vision and RFID both represent attractive markets for us for that very reason. I think that overall, we would expect to see continued progression in margin as our markets recover overall. So I would say that we would expect to get back to the levels that we've had in the past, and there's no reason why we wouldn't. There's been a lot of challenges in moving pieces over the last several years, including tariffs, supply chain challenges that the significant increase demand we saw over the last two years driven by the pandemic and building out of capacity. But I think that returning to the profitability levels that we've had prior, we see that continuing to progress throughout in 2024 as we get back to more normal levels of demand and our customers begin to buy again. And as we continue to be very thoughtful around our costs, right? So I think we're going to continue to be cautious in spending as we have been. We are taking $100 million of annual cost out of the business in 2024 and that will also add to profitability along with demand returns. So we see profitability to continue to progress, and there's no reason why we can't get back to past levels. That's how we see it. I would say that health care and manufacturing less declines than the other markets, so less impacted overall, but they are still seeing the same trends at a broader market. I would say, overall, in health care, our -- has been in the past, our fastest growing vertical market, but our smallest. As health care continues to look to improve productivity, enhance patient safety, clearly automating workflows and digitizing assets within that environment creates an opportunity for the full breadth of our solutions portfolio across scanning, printing, mobile computing, RFID all play a role within health care. We're also announcing new opportunities across health care in things like tablets for home health care or telehealth all remain opportunities for us. So we're -- we like the health care market, and we continue to develop very specific products for the health care their market overall. I'd say in manufacturing, while we've got a strong base within our manufacturing customers, a lot of that is really tied to more of their logistics and distribution network more so than kind of assembly and on the line. And I think you said it best already machine vision, robotic automation for -- in the manufacturing environment with good transport demand planning for our CPG customers with Antuit, all leverage or give us more strength to meet the demands of that marketplace overall. So we've shifted sales resources to focus on manufacturing and continue to look to recruit more partners in that area. We see that as an area for Zebra where we're less penetrated than others, primarily because we are in certain product areas, print and for instance, on the manufacturing floor, but we could do more there in our new solutions. So we clearly see manufacturing and health care is both opportunities for us to grow moving forward. Good morning, Andrew. Yes, I'd say that, Rob, what we said is we're not guiding to 24% as we've talked about before. I would say, again, from a color perspective, that on average, I guess, it would be the same. What we're seeing today is our customers sweating some of their assets longer than they normally would. They can only do that so long. Devices get older, they want to use more applications requiring faster processor speeds, more memory, you see OSs moving forward, so security and others. So there's reasons for them to upgrade those devices over time. Could they sweat them for a certain amount of time, yes. But then eventually, that kind of comes our way, and they go ahead and upgrade. So I would say average life cycle of demand in second half, nothing changing there. We're working closely with our customers to make sure we understand their refresh cycles. And I think that while there's very little visibility in the second half of the year, I think the biggest thing to remember is we're going to cycle compares that are easier and this destocking moves away. So I think that's positive. But I would say average number of refreshes out their average length of the devices in service and today, customer sweating assets. Yes, I would say that manufacturing is a good example of that. It's has been less impacted, still down significantly year-on-year, but less than other markets. That is an opportunity we've talked about earlier in the call. I think there's other markets. Japan is an area that we're investing additional resources as well. And we've won a large postal opportunity there and the largest retailer in Japan most recently, and we're leveraging those wins and larger partners within Japan to do more business within Japan.

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 8. In Q3, net sales decreased 30.6% and 29.6%, excluding the impact of FX. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment declined 25.8% primarily driven by printing. Enterprise Visibility and Mobility segment sales declined 31.4% with pronounced weakness in mobile computing. On a positive note, we drove growth across service and software with strong attach and renewal rates. We saw double-digit sales declines across our regions. In North America, sales decreased 25%. EMEA sales declined 39% with broad-based declines across the region. Asia-Pacific sales decreased 32% driven by China and Southeast Asia, and Latin America sales decreased 15%, driven by Mexico. Adjusted gross margins decreased 100 basis points to 44.8%, primarily due to expense deleveraging from lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable premium supply chain costs. As these supply chain costs have been fully mitigated, we are no longer including a slide as part of our earnings presentation. Adjusted operating expenses delevered 910 basis points as a percent of sales. Note that the bulk of the previously announced restructuring plans to drive operating expense savings were implemented in late Q3 and early Q4. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.6%, a 950 basis point decrease driven by expense deleveraging. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.87, a 79% year-over-year decrease. Increased interest expense contributed to the decline, offset by a lower tax rate. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 9. For the first nine months of 2023, negative free cash flow of $193 million was unfavorable to the prior year period, primarily due to lower earnings, including the impact of restructuring actions and higher interest costs. Greater use of net working capital due to higher cash taxes and payments for inventory and $45 million more of previously announced quarterly settlement payments, all of which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments. We ended the quarter at 2.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is below the top end of our target range of 2.5x and had approximately $1 billion of capacity on a revolving credit facility providing ample flexibility as we navigate a challenging environment. Let's now turn to our outlook. As we enter the fourth quarter, we are seeing sales velocity out of the channel stabilize on a sequential basis and destocking activity moderate as expected. Our Q4 sales are expected to decline between 32% and 36% compared to the prior year. This outlook assumes double-digit declines across our major product categories, with distributor destocking accounting for approximately one-fifth of the sales decline. We are in Q4 with the necessary backlog and pipeline to support our guide. That said, we are not seeing compelling signs of a market recovery as we look to the first half of 2024. We anticipate Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 16%, driven by expense deleveraging from lower sales volumes, partially mitigated by the benefits of our cost restructuring actions. Despite anticipated expense deleveraging, we expect year-on-year gross margin improvement as we cycle $25 million of premium supply chain costs in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.80. Our Q4 outlook translates to an expected full-year sales decline of approximately 21% at the midpoint, which is 50 basis points favorable to our prior guide and an EBITDA margin of approximately 18%. We expect our free cash flow to be positive for the second half of 2023 and negative for the full-year. We continue to be focused on rightsizing inventory on our balance sheet and in driving 100% cash conversion over a cycle. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 10. With that, I will turn the call to Bill to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Good morning, Brad. Thanks, Brad. I guess I'd start with what we're seeing today. And from a Q3 perspective, we finished at the high end of our outlook in a challenging demand environment. And as we said, we're seeing leveling of demand trends overall and really in Q3, the peak of distributor destocking, but we're not yet seeing signs of market recovery based on our customers' behavior. So we saw really all region verticals declined in Q3 and along with customers of all sizes, but it was most pronounced in large enterprises. There were some bright spots in the quarter. Services and software are examples of that. I'd say is we're certainly not guiding to '24 at this time. But we're not seeing really compelling recovery yet and the idea that we're going to remain cautious for the remainder of the year. And really, as we look into the first half of '24, we're seeing very -- we have very challenging compares ahead of us. So I'd say that for the moment, still challenging demand environment that we would see that in '24 and the remainder of the year, we're going to remain cautious. I would say that, again, with demand challenging from that perspective, bookings were as we expected going into -- during Q3 and then as we enter Q4, we've got the bookings trajectory to feel good about our guide for Q4 overall. But again, not seeing quite signs of recovery yet, but feel that we've got the order velocity to be able to deliver on our guide for Q4. Yes, I think, Tom, we view the word leveling is we've seen those demand trends level out in Q3, and we're seeing that kind of into Q4. And we're seeing that from a destocking perspective, the biggest impact has been Q3 and again, less so in Q4, and we believe that will be behind us by year-end. And again, while we're not guiding to '24, maybe a little more color to add to what I said on the first question, we don't see compelling signs of recovery yet, right? And therefore, our guide for fourth quarter. And then as we look into first half of '24, we see very challenging compares. But that said, we're not seeing customers cancel projects. They continue to push them out. And they can't do that forever. We're seeing use cases across our products and solutions continue to grow within our customer environment. They will resume deployments as they use the excess capacity across retail and e-commerce across transportation logistics and as our customers around the world see the macro uncertainty abate. So we've seen this in similar downturns where typically, they last for Zebra quarters, not years. So as we go through the year, we do see some progression. And while our visibility for the second half would remain very challenging at the moment, we would be clearly cycling through easier compares at that time and really due to the restocking -- that the destocking, sorry, that we were seeing in the second half of this year. So I think that's how we'd see it at the moment. Hey Tommy, this is Nathan. As we said, from a global channel inventory, which again, we measure on days on hand, and as you said, the average is around 60 days, two months, but that varies -- you can see quite a bit of variation based on the product type and by region. So again, it's not consistent globally. And as we said, we -- in the end of Q3, better than we did in Q2, so the days on hand and the relative inventory balances decreased throughout the quarter. I'd say still slightly higher than the normal range despite those decreases. And that's why we expect distributors will continue to lower their inventory here throughout the fourth quarter, but we do expect to exit the fourth quarter within our normal operating levels. And that's something we work with very closely with our distributors on in terms of where they try to get to what products do they need to support the markets. And so again, as we enter next year, we expect kind of the destocking to be and where it needs to be as we move forward into the year. Yes, Damian. So if you look just maybe for context on Q3 gross margin, obviously, down year-on-year by about one point to 44.8%, volume deleveraging was a major driver of the decline as we did see favorability in premium supply chain costs. Now that those are entirely mitigated. So that was a two-point favorable impact as well as we're seeing nice traction from the pricing actions we've taken over the last several years and continued to strengthen our service and software margins. So if we look at our underlying gross margins with the pricing actions we've taken to offset component cost increases, inflation with the freight cost declining. Really now the focus is on rebalancing our manufacturing and distribution capacity to the lower volumes so that we can again, start to see those margins recover as we go into next year. So I think the -- as we look here at the second half is the low watermark just given the sharp volume declines and making sure we reset capacity to that while giving us flexibility to grow as the market recovers. Keith, so just on our own inventory, as expected, our inventory balances stayed relatively flat to where we were at the end of the second quarter. We don't expect to see a material change as we exit the year. And as we said before and as you stated, the primary increase from where we'd expect to be is all around component -- consigned components that are at our Tier 1 manufacturers. So these are inventory that we made purchase commitments on going back to a year, 1.5 year ago at really the peak demand as well as the peak supply chain challenges and issues where the lead times were out greater than a year. So really absorbing those inbound components as our demand decrease. I think the team has done a phenomenal job working with all of our partners to reduce those purchase commitments. If you look at our outstanding purchase commitments, we've cut those in half since the beginning of the year. We've driven down finished good balance since the beginning of the year. So we're making traction, although you don't see it in the headline numbers. So really now, it's around getting stability in the demand signal to our suppliers so that we can in right size those inbound components. If you -- to your last question, we don't have a minimum purchase agreement that it has penalties. Obviously, we work with our Tier 1 manufacturers to have different tiering in terms of volume on our purchase price to cover their overhead. But there's not a, I'd say, a penalty per se at certain volumes, it's just making sure that they have the right capacity within their cost structure. Yes. So I would say, if you look at base, if you go back to our historical turns and you account for some of the M&A over the past couple of years, we said about a $200 million reduction would get us back to say, normalized levels. When and how quickly we can achieve that is the question. And some of that depends on, again, some of the demand stability as we go into next year. But that $200 million reduction would be entirely in consigned inventory components at our manufacturers. Yes, Andrew, I would say they're tied a couple pretty tightly together, especially when you consider e-commerce versus buy online and pick up in store or brick-and-mortar retail. So I'd say e-commerce and trans logistics tied together because of really parcel delivery. And I think in that case, both had built out e-commerce providers and transportation logistics built out significant network capacity across everything they did, their networks, their capacity around logistics and others to be able to meet the demands during COVID, which now kind of reset to pre-COVID levels and are going to grow from there. And I think you've seen moderating demand across e-commerce overall. So I think those two are tied together. I think brick-and-mortar retail, think of in-store, I think that's really more tied to the goods economy. So goods versus service-based economy, which is still relatively challenged. So I'd say e-commerce and translation districts tied hand-in-hand, brick-and-mortar retail, a little bit more goods economy focused. I wouldn't see much difference in those two. The recovery really is going to be driven by using up this excess capacity we talked about or and a recovery from more positive signs in from an economic perspective overall for those markets to come back. Not in one particular area, just broad-based, as we've worked through the plans throughout the third quarter and the fourth and scrutinized where we had to backfill certain roles with the retirement plans as well as just any open roles that have come along, just again scrutinizing that spend is really what drove it. So again, I would say fairly broad based and in line with the actions that we're driving for the company."

            "name": "Joachim Heel",
            "content": "Yes. Maybe just a little bit on that point. During the supply-constrained phase, we had given some priority to some of our larger customers. So that's where a large amount of the volume and the capacity that went into the market went. And that's where we're seeing the steepest declines at this point. So I would expect that, that's also where we would see the first signs of recovery where those customers would begin purchasing again. And we are staying very close to those large customers as we're seeing them sweat their assets longer, we know exactly when they are reaching those points in the product life cycle where they will need to refresh. And we're working with them on plans that will fit their budgets. And you can imagine, as we're going into 2024, they're coming up with new budgets and we're working with them on doing that. So that's perhaps where I would look first. And Joe -- this is Joe Heel, I'll add. I think this is also an opportunity for us to add additional value to our customers, specifically because in both areas, the customers will need more than just the hardware solutions that they might buy from us today as a handheld reader, for example, they will need, in particular, software and other accessories. And so if you think about our machine vision business, a very important part of that is the software component, which, by and large, we don't provide today when it comes to a handheld scanner. But in the machine vision, environment, we do provide that. So it's a great opportunity for us to create additional value for customers, but also for us at Zebra. Yes. So I can address some of that, Andrew. Over the course of the last few quarters, we've gotten a lot tighter with our distributors in both understanding and agreeing on the objectives that they have in their business, which have changed. And in particular, the increasing cost of capital has led them to set very aggressive inventory targets for their business. And then using those targets, to ensure that we stay in sync as demand has been relatively volatile, right? So demand has come down, they have adjusted their inventory to match that, and that's what we're calling destocking. So if you now think about that in reverse, what has to occur is that they have to start seeing improvements in sales out, which we, of course, are working very heavily. We generate the majority of our demand with our sales force working together with our partners. So we're working with them to generate that sales out demand. As soon as they see that tick up again, we're pretty confident that they will follow with stocking in lockstep to achieve those DIO or days of inventory outstanding targets that we have now really good visibility to and a clear understanding with them as well as incentives in place for them to reach those. So it's really generating that demand and seeing it. We think the inventory will just follow. Maybe there's one area that you could see a slight additional opportunity on the retail front. And that is, of course, the one area where they don't overlap, which is the store. Retailers have been itching for some time, and we have had this vision that you can significantly improve the productivity of a retail store by having all of the workers in the store connected and collaborating. And they haven't yet realized that vision. That's been part of what's been deferred as they're going through the current phase of pausing and spending and scrutinizing their budgets. But they really do want to do that. I hear that from retailers all the time that they believe that there's a big productivity improvement to be had there, in particular, because some of their peers have done it, and they have seen those improvements. So that part of spending is still out there and it I'm convinced it will come our way, and that will create an additional demand on the part of retailers with stores that transportation companies don't have. Maybe I'll give you a two data points to support that. One is in Q2, the pushouts that we had in Q1 tripled. And in Q3, the pushouts were about the same as they were in Q2 which was almost the same as what we had in the entire year of 2020. So you can see that there's a lot of demand being pushed out, and those are all refreshes that should be happening now to maintain the average life of our estate out there. And so the average life of our estate is likely going up. And at some point, and that's what we said a couple of times already, sorry to repeat it, is that at some point, they will have to buy and refresh those devices."

After today's presentation, there will be opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Steele: Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's second quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially and we refer you to the factors discussed in our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth, our year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. Additionally, note that our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment now includes our RFID solutions and we have recast quarterly segment results since 2021 in a schedule included in the Appendix of our earnings press release. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Bill Burns, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill will begin with our second quarter results. Then Nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our revised 2023 outlook. Bill will conclude with progress made on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer, will join us as we take your questions. Now, let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Bill.\nBill Burns: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results were impacted by weakening demand and cautious customer spending behavior across our end markets. While these results are certainly disappointing to us, we'll spend some time today discussing the drivers that are having the greatest impact, as well as the actions we are taking to control what we can in a difficult demand environment, including our expanded cost reduction initiatives. For the quarter, we realized sales of $1.2 billion, a 16% decline from the prior year and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.2%, a 70 basis point decrease, and a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.29, a 29% decrease from the prior year. Let me now put these results in context. On our last quarter call, we discussed the broader softening of industry demand as customers tightened their CapEx budgets and IT device spending slows. During the second quarter, those trends accelerated as we saw more cautious spending behavior by our customers of all sizes across our vertical end markets and regions. While all end markets declined, demand was weakest in retail and e-commerce and transportation logistics as many customers are absorbing capacity they build out during the pandemic. These dynamics have been exacerbated by our distributors focus on reducing their inventory levels, which accounted for approximately 20% of our Q2 sales decline. Our distribution channel has been aggressively driving down inventory as end user demand has slowed, product lead times have recovered, and the cost of holding working capital has increased. Although global macro indicators have been resilient, the goods economy has underperformed the services economy, and certain key indicators most relevant to our industry have become significantly weaker, including IT device spending. This particular metric has been most correlated with mobile computing where sales declines have accelerated year-to-date following more than two years of very strong demand. Growth across RFID, data capture, supplies, services and software were bright spots in the quarter. From a profitability perspective, improved gross margin and cost controls enable us to achieve our EBITDA margin and EPS outlook for the second quarter. In our current market environment swift action is needed and we are taking a number of steps to position us to deliver profitable growth and improve free cash flow. Slide 5 summarizes key industry challenges that have intensified since our prior update, and our actions to address and mitigate the impacts. These actions include reducing spending across the organization, including additional restructuring actions to drive an incremental $65 million of net annualized operating savings as we exit 2023, increasing our focus on accelerating growth in underpenetrated markets, and continue to work closely with our customers as we continue to digitize and automate their environments. Our revised full-year outlook incorporates the slowdown and deceleration across our end markets, including a significant reduction in near-term demand in the mobile computing market, destocking buyer distributors, as well as a partial year benefit of our expanded restructuring actions. Given our limited visibility in this environment, we are cautious in our assumptions and not expecting a recovery in 2023. We expect the reset of our cost structure and shift of our go-to market resources to drive sales growth and improved profitability as our end markets recover. We'll continue to take an agile approach to managing through this uncertain near-term environment. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q2 financial results and provide additional details on our revised 2023 outlook.\nNathan Winters: Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 7. In Q2, net sales decreased 17.3% including the impact of currency and acquisitions and were 16% lower on an organic basis. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment was flat, strengthen in RFID and supplies was offset by a decline in printing as we lapped particularly strong prior year results. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 23.6%, driven by a sharp decline in mobile computing, partially offset by growth in data capture solutions. Additionally, we drove organic growth across service and software with strong service attach rates. Sales declined across our regions driven by broad-based double-digit declines in mobile computing. In North America, sales decreased 11%. EMEA sales declined 24% with pronounced weakness in Eastern Europe. Asia-Pacific sales decreased 17% driven by China and India with growth in Japan and Australia. And Latin America sales decreased 6%, partially offset by growth in Brazil and Mexico. Adjusted gross margin increased 200 basis points to 48%, primarily due to lower premium supply chain costs in favorable business mix and pricing, partially offset by expense de-leveraging and unfavorable FX. We are pleased to see gross margins recovering from the inflationary headwinds we experienced over the past couple of years. Adjusted operating expenses deleveraged 310 basis points as a percent of sales, partially offset by lower incentive compensation and cost controls. Note, that as we began to see demand soften, we announced incremental restructuring plans that are expected to drive $65 million of net annualized operating expense savings as they're implemented. Including previous actions taken over the past year, our total net annual cost savings is $85 million. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.2%, a 70 basis point decrease driven by operating expense de-leveraging partially offset by improved gross margin. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.29, a 29% year-over-year decrease. Increased interest expense contributed to the decline partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 8. For the first half of 2023, negative free cash flow of $144 million was unfavorable to the prior year period, primarily due to a greater use of networking capital due to higher cash taxes and payments for inventory. And $45 million of previously announced quarterly settlement payments, which are scheduled to conclude in Q1 of 2024, partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments. In the first half of 2023, we also made $52 million of share repurchases and invested $1 million in our venture portfolio. We ended the quarter at a 1.8x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is below the top end of our target range of 2.5x and had approximately $1.1 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility. On Slide 9, we highlight the impact of premium supply chain costs on our gross margin over the past 2.5 years. The actions we have taken to redesign products and increase price along with improving freight rates and capacity have enabled us to avoid component purchases on the spot market and reduce the freight cost impact. In Q2, we incurred premium supply chain costs of an incremental $5 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline and $51 million lower than the prior year quarter. As we enter the third quarter, we believe these costs will have been fully mitigated, which is the key lever to margin recovery. Let's now turn to our outlook. As we enter the third quarter, we are seeing sharp broad-based declines across most of our product offerings, which continues to be amplified by distributors recalibrating their inventory to lower demand trends. Our Q3 sales are expected to decline between 30% and 35% compared to the prior year. This outlook assumes double-digit declines across each of our core product categories with distributor destocking accounting for approximately one-third of the decline. We anticipate Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 10% and 12% driven by expense de-leveraging from lower sales volume, partially offset by higher gross margin from cycling $30 million of premium supply chain costs in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in range of $0.60 to $1. Given our Q2 results in the continued challenging demand environment, we are significantly reducing our full-year outlook, expecting a sales decline between 20% and 23%. This assumes the Q3 sales trajectory continues through the remainder of the year. We're seeing broad-based declines across our end markets as we enter the second half with significant uncertainty in this environment. We expect full-year adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 18%. We expect increased de-leveraging on significantly reduced sales volumes expectations partially offset by early benefits from cost reduction actions as most of the actions will be implemented by early Q4. We plan to continue to align our cost structure with the long-term trajectory of our business. We now expect free cash flow to be positive in the second half, but negative for the year given lower sales and earnings expectations. Our cash flow will be impacted by new restructuring charges, increased cash taxes due to change in R&D expected regulation and $180 million of previously announced settlement payments. We continue to be focused on rightsizing inventory on our balance sheet as component lead times have normalized. However, we now expect minimal inventory reduction in 2023 due to our lowered sales outlook. We are focused on achieving 100% cash conversion over a cycle, which is one of the metrics in our long-term incentive compensation plan. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 10. Note that we have improved our expected 2023 non-GAAP tax rate by 1 point due to favorable geographic mix. With that, I'll turn the call back to Bill to discuss how we're advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\nBill Burns: Thank you, Nathan. While sales are pressured near-term, over the long-term, our solutions remain essential to our customers' operations, and we are well-positioned to benefit from the secular trends to digitize and automate workflows across our served markets. We are focused on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision by elevating Zebra as a premier solutions provider through our compelling portfolio. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, including scarcity of labor and the need to improve productivity. We empower the workforce to execute tasks more effectively by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by our advanced software capabilities such as machine learning and prescriptive analytics. Now turning to Slide 13. I would like to highlight several key mega trends, which supports Zebra's growth and customer value propositions over the long-term. These include automation, mobility and cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. Our customers rely on Zebra to help them take advantage of these key mega trends, which drive their growth strategies. As you can see on Slide 14, Zebra's enterprise mobile computers are critical to the front line of business. We are excited about our innovation roadmap and new solution launches that advance our value proposition. Labor is a scarce resource and leveraging technology is a key way our customers can advance their operations. Our solutions empower enterprises to increase collaboration and productivity and better serve customers, shoppers, and patients by enabling and expanding number of use cases across our end markets. Our enterprise mobile computing installed base has expanded significantly over the past several years due to the perforation of use cases and the investment in Zebra solutions should rebound as technology refreshes or reprioritized. On Slide 15, we highlight a few areas that are advancing our capabilities to serve our customers evolving needs and are expected to be profitable growth drivers for Zebra as we continue to scale them. Collectively, these offerings are approaching $0.5 billion of annualized sales and have a long runway for growth. First, we are a leader in advanced location solutions through RFID. We have been driving strong double-digit growth in recent years with the heightened importance of real-time inventory accuracy. We are now addressing an expanding set of use cases throughout the supply chain, including our previously announced large win with a global transportation logistics provider, which highlights the long-term growth opportunity for RFID solutions. Second, we believe investments in our machine vision business, which is accretive to our growth and EBITDA margins, positions us well for long-term growth. We continue to invest in innovation and go-to-market efforts to further diversify and scale in attractive subcategories. Strong growth in certain end markets, including warehouse distribution, and electric vehicle manufacturing has partially offset weakness in the semiconductor industry. An example of our recent success is a win with the U.S.-based global auto manufacturer who has been transitioning to electric vehicle production. The ease of use of our solutions was a key differentiator as the manufacturer capitalized on the disruption in the auto market to modernize its processes with more flexible solutions. And lastly, our workflow optimization software offerings include workforce and task management, communication and collaboration tools, inventory visibility and demand planning. Recent notable wins include our workforce management solution for location staffing at a large North America bank and our retail demand forecasting solution for a North America consumer packaged goods company. The actions we are taking to improve profitability of our software offerings, including migration to a cloud-based platform are expected to enable software to become EBITDA margin accretive in 2024. In closing, our long-term conviction in our business remains unchanged. While customer spend is pressured near-term, over the long-term, we believe we're well-positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows. We'll work to continue to elevate our position with customers through our comprehensive portfolio of solutions while taking the actions needed to improve profitability and position us for success both in the current environment and in the future. I will now hand it back to Mike.\nMike Steele: Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Bill, you referenced the reset of the trajectory for e-commerce including parcel. I wanted to dig in on that a little bit. Do you have any sense of how long that reset appears to need going forward. And how widespread is this? And I ask that second part because there's certainly one fairly high profile, maybe the most high profile end user there where these trends I think are well known at this point. But anything you could do to highlight and maybe other examples would be helpful as well. Thank you.\nBill Burns: Yes. I think overall that we've said that what we've seen in the market is that as the goods economy is clearly weaker than the service economy, which is resulting in we're seeing more of our customers really absorbing the capacity that they bought through the pandemic, and that extends beyond just the largest e-commerce retailer we've talked about in the past, but to other e-commerce even our retail customers and into transportation logistics customers as well. And we've seen softness now spread into other markets. But specific to your question, I think that I guess maybe a good example of that is recently we've seen a large logistics company talk about really what's been detrimental to their volumes, right? And I think it is this idea that the overall industrial economy is slowing, right? Clearly focused on goods and not services. And they've said, look, that's slowing obviously because of all the macroeconomic indicators, right? Inflation interest rates slowdown in global trade. It's also being driven by consumers buying less, right? And then this reset of e-commerce coming out of the pandemic to the levels of purchases of goods slowing down transportation logistics package delivery as well, which has really been detrimental to the entire industry overall from a volume perspective. So we're seeing this additional capacity built out in e-commerce players. We're seeing it in retail, and I wouldn't say it as much as excess capacity is really, they have what they need for now, and as the goods economy slows, they eventually will come back and buy more. But for today, they've got what they need. We're seeing it move into parcel delivery with transportation logistics, but also spread into other markets as well. As you know, in first quarter we talked about slowing down of large orders and large customers. We've seen that move into mid-tier and smaller customers as well. So it's more broad-based than we had seen in the past. And we think it really is the two years of very strong demand we've seen, especially in mobile computing across our entire customer base is now being absorbed and into the marketplace and then ultimately, that's why we're seeing the decline in the short-term. And that will come back as the macro indicators come back, as people buy more goods than services, as you know they use this excess capacity within their environment. They will buy more from us. And we'll see that inflection point at some point, but right now we're not seeing it. We're clearly seeing our demand be pressured because of it.\nTommy Moll: Bill, you mentioned an inflection point, which is the theme for my second question here. I'm using the mid-points of your revenue guidance for the third quarter and the full-year, and just looking at what's implied in the fourth quarter. And at least on the mid-points, it looks like the implication is from third quarter to fourth quarter revenue steps up somewhere in the mid-single-digit range on a percentage basis. I just want to unpack that a little bit. Is that an inflection that you think you have visibility too? Is it just there's some ranges in here and it depends on what you want to assume within those ranges, or is there anything you can point to maybe that's impacting 3Q disproportionately, but not 4Q? Thank you.\nBill Burns: Yes. Kind of a combination answers there probably is that overall, we would say that, why do we believe our guide, right? And as we looked at Q3 and Q4, clearly in Q3, you're seeing more destocking from a distribution perspective than you are in Q4. But I think that we've taken an approach that basically for the guide for Q3 and full-year, where we see the demand trends that we'll continue that begin to deteriorate really in Q1 and continue through Q2. We'll continue from a booking and sales velocity perspective, it'll remain about the same for the full-year. We're assuming that a significantly lower conversion of opportunities within our pipeline than historical levels just because of these push-outs of large orders by our customers. And we've removed expectations really for recovery in year-end -- at year-end in fourth quarter. But the reason you see that the uptick there is really because we're seeing an oversize effect of our distributors destocking inventory levels as their end demand continues to slow. So ultimately our sales out of distribution, when that slows, they hold a specific days on hand inventory and they need to buy less from us because they're selling less out. They need less in inventory. And I think that the -- we see an oversize effect when end demand slows. So in fourth quarter, we're seeing less of the destocking than we were in Q3. The destocking is also driven by the fact that our delivery times have shortened and their cost of capital's gone up. So there's pressure on inventory and to lower those inventory levels really as their end demand is slowed and we're seeing a bit less of that in fourth quarter. So that's really the trajectory we're seeing around. We believe ultimately we're seeing -- in the process of seeing really the bottom in Q3 and Q4 and do see an inflection point in 2024. But the difference between Q3 and Q4 is really predominantly based on inventory destocking levels. And we expect to exit year-end with the right levels of inventory for what is the end demand that our distributors are seeing. So we see destocking taking place through the second half year, and then being really at the right levels for the demand that our distributors are seeing as we exit the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDamian Karas : Bill, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit on the demand environment for your end customers kind of moving past the distribution destocking impacts, but you talked about declines across all end markets and all customers. I mean, what do you think are the biggest drivers of that change over the past few months here? Is it your end customers really are facing sales pressures and budgetary constraints, or do you think to some extent your customers are just feeling a lot better about their productivity, now that supply chains have almost kind of uniformly eased across the globe?\nBill Burns: Yes. Maybe I'll start and then I'll add Joe can jump in as well. Really, if we look back to our May call, we talked about broader softening of industry demands. And those trends really have accelerated in Q2 as we saw more cautious spending on the part of our customers, again, after two years of really strong demand for our products and solutions. And we see this as really broader global macro weakness, but we've seen particular impact from that in EMEA and in China and China we expected more recovery out of COVID that we haven't seen in slower economic factors within China. Retail and e-commerce, as we've talked about a little bit earlier on Tommy's question really is driving that, that trend as they're absorbing capacity, but coming out of the pandemic, but we've seen it more broad across other industries as well as we worked our way through Q2. We're seeing an increased number of push-outs from a project perspective as well, or those projects being reduced in size. And Joe will talk a little bit more about that overall, but I would say that, the dynamics that we're seeing around distribution is one element of it, but the end demand clearly is slowed, and that's what's driving the distribution destocking of inventory is really about end demand. That's really, and after two years of really strong demand, we're now ultimately seeing that it really is in Zebra, we're seeing this across industry trends like IT device spending that ultimately our -- we're seeing that same trend that that IT device spending is correlated to our mobile computing market, which we see as the biggest impact of this slowdown. But it's really broad-based across IT devices and through that we expect to continue to outperform our competition, but clearly disappointing demand levels from an end market, but maybe Joe wants to jump in.\nJoe Heel: Yes. Maybe if a little bit of additional color. So first, the declines in our larger customers were larger than the declines in our mid-tier and small, run rate business as we would call it. And that helps us understand this better because we track, of course, we have direct contact with our large customers and we see what's happening to individual deals there. Now what we've been seeing is that a lot of those deals hundreds of millions of dollars have pushed out of the first half into the future or in some cases have disappeared as deals altogether. I'll give you some examples of those, but before I do this behavior has accelerated in the second quarter. So, for example, in North America, the amount of push-outs that we've seen relative to the first quarter has tripled. Now let me give you just a few examples, right? So you can -- you see what's driving this and what's happening, right? At the beginning of Q3, we had a grocer who came to us and said, I want to buy $4 million worth of your mobile computers. And midway through the quarter they said, we're not going to do this deal in Q2, we're going to do it in Q3. I'm sorry, I said Q3 at the beginning, my mistake. So they came at the beginning of Q2, said, we want to buy this. And midway through the quarter they said we now want to do this deal in Q3 rather than in Q2. So a good example of what we would call a push-out. But we also had another grocer who at the beginning of the quarter was indicating that they're going to buy over $5 million worth of mobile computers. And they came and said, we now want to do take these $5 million of mobile computers, but we want to buy them over the next five quarters equally distributed, which of course, delays our revenue trajectory. We also had a DIY retailer who wanted to buy $7 million at the beginning of Q2 and came to us during the quarter and said, my budgets have been cut. I can't do this project right now anymore. We'll do it sometime in the future, but I can't tell you when. So these are three different examples that all impact our Q2 revenue and indicate that our customers' budgets are under pressure to the extent that they're trying to extend out when they buy from us, which diminishes our revenue. Hopefully that's helpful.\nDamian Karas: Yes. That's all very helpful. So could you maybe tell us like what proportion of firm orders you've actually seen canceled?\nJoe Heel: I can answer that directly. We have had no or virtually no firm orders canceled. So all of what I was describing to you were movements in our pipelines. Generally, we have not seen orders that we've already taken or backlogged canceled.\nDamian Karas: Got it. Okay. Appreciate it. And then I -- the bright spot in the quarter seems to be the gross margin recovery. So should we be thinking 48% is the appropriate run rate for gross margin or given your portfolio of assets now with machine vision and Amer's [ph] and so forth, is there possibly some upside to gross margin down the road?\nNathan Winters: This is Nathan. Again, as you mentioned, I'd say gross margin was a bright spot in the second quarter hitting 48%, which we haven't achieved that level since the first half of 2021 when we had a bit more revenue and the euro was at a $1.20. So obviously the bright spot in the quarter, including the reduction in the premium supply chain costs down to $5 million and then negligible as we enter the second half of the year due to all the nice work by the team redesigning products getting our printer capacity back on ocean. So again, I think we feel good about gross margin. I think that's a -- the 48% is a new baseline. There will be fluctuations, as we move quarter-to-quarter based on deal size, that is one dynamic that's helping us with the lack of large deals is a benefit to gross margin. But there's other tailwinds that we have going through the remainder of the year, including FX assuming it stays at its current level. So I think that's the right watermark, but I'd say quarter-to-quarter there'll be fluctuations as with just general mix and business dynamics.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nJim Ricchiuti: All right. Thank you. So as we think about the Q3 guidance and the implied outlook for Q4, it sounds like you're expecting at least geographically some worsening conditions in North America. Just if we look at what the organic decline was in Q2, is that the way to think about how the geographic distribution looks into the second half of the year?\nNathan Winters: Yes. Maybe I can give just a little bit more color on the guide and then to your point on the some of the regional dynamics is just to read what Bill mentioned earlier, the guide is supported by the most recent sales and bookings velocity and we're not assuming any type of recovery as we enter the quarter or as we move through the quarter. So you really see that I'd say across all our geographies. So I think that it's -- if you look at the similarities across each region, they're very similar in terms of being impacted by mobile computing tougher year-on-year comps for the business like print. So what we've effectively done is said, what is that velocity we're seeing in the end markets? How does that continue through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter? And again, removing some of the upside or opportunities to ensure that we have the right baseline to build from here, but I'd say the dynamics are very similar across each of the regions as we go through the second half.\nJim Ricchiuti: And does your guidance assume slowing in the areas of the business that have been relative bright spots, you highlighted data capture RFID and the recurring business, the supply service presumably holds up a little bit better. But what kind of assumptions are you making for these areas that, that have been more of a bright spot for you?\nBill Burns: Yes. I would say that, RFID continues to be a bright spot and continue to see growth across multiple applications, not just retail. Our supplies business continues to be positive from not just an RFID perspective, but a broader supplies business in our Temptime acquisition as well. Services and software we think will be clearly bright spots in the second half year. Data capture is a tougher compare in second half. So I think what you're still seeing is in print and data capture solutions a fair amount of variation across supply chain availability in 2022 that were cycling through in 2023, so you see strong growth in first half with tough compares in second half across those businesses, which still remain challenging from as you look at the numbers overall that you're seeing -- still seeing the supply chain dynamic take place in comparison from prior years. So data capture solutions is just a tough compare in second half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. I guess just putting into context, do you think you're seeing the greatest impact to the refresh business, which with just elongating hardware cycles, is this just slowdown in new builds or slowdown in new use cases? I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of you prepared yourself to the mobile IT market. We've seen some lengthening and refresh cycles in those markets over time as devices improve. And so is this just lengthening refresh cycles that may be more permanent or just kind of more macro impact to new builds or new use cases?\nBill Burns: I think we're seeing clearly the refresh cycles, we would say, are elongated as people are using those assets and making tough business decisions at the moment. They can only hold off so long in those technology refreshes. And you've got to remember the strong demand over the last two years has put a lot more devices in the hands of frontline workers. So when they go to refresh those devices that will be a higher number of devices that they refresh. In the short-term, they're consuming capacity they built in e-commerce and transportation logistics and even our retail customers where they've bought a lot of devices through the pandemic and they've got to work through those devices, but eventually they will buy more. We're still seeing -- there's still a great opportunity for us to continue to underserved hands, more devices in the hands of frontline workers across all of our vertical markets. And Joe can talk a little bit about more about that. So I think we're still seeing that there's plenty of bright spots for new applications for our devices and leveraging our retail software, for instance, on our devices within retail and communication, collaboration, visibility, AI and leveraging, workers with more information leveraging your mobile devices. So the longer-term trends continue despite the challenges in short-term demand. And Joe, do you want to add to that?\nJoe Heel: Yes. I would underline that specifically that I think we're seeing is an extension of the sales cycles not a diminishing set of use cases in any way. In fact, I think it's almost the opposite. So the examples I gave earlier were all examples of extending sales cycles. And what we're seeing with our customers is that in fact they're discovering during this period how they can use their devices and the Zebra solutions for more use cases. So we're seeing more use cases in the store like communication or flexible checkout advising customers on where to find goods and products in the store are being added to the devices that they have. And we're of course fueling that because we're releasing new use cases. For example, we just released the ability to take payment directly on our devices, right? So I would say very clearly it's an elongation of sales cycles, new use cases are alive and well.\nMeta Marshall: Got it. And maybe just is -- do you expect any -- you noted that you were renegotiating some supply agreements. Is there expected to be any cash charges with those or just anything we should be mindful of as part of the restructuring?\nBill Burns: No. Not as part -- not as part of the restructuring, Meta in terms of obviously the team's working on renegotiating supply agreements to maximize cash with the demand changes. But we'll work each one of those and make sure it's the right economic decision for the short and long-term. But those -- that is not included as any part of the restructuring charges.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nTyler Hutin: Good morning. This is Tyler Hutin on for Brian. Thanks for taking my questions.\nBill Burns: Hi, Tyler.\nTyler Hutin: Hi, just starting off with pricing, I believe you may have mentioned the full-year benefit before, and I was just wondering if that has changed due to even more softening in what you would expect from volume growth. So is there any -- can you give us a expectation for full-year benefit from pricing?\nNathan Winters: So we expect the full-year pricing benefit to be around 2 points. It's a little bit higher than our previous guide with the most recent price increases that went into effect late in the second quarter. But we're actually seeing those actions hold and stick in the market. So I'd say it's again about 2 points for the year. And I think just to again these were very specific targeted actions, not broad-based, and it's something we monitor constantly to ensure that we're competitive in the market. And that the -- I wouldn't say any part of the volume decline is related to the pricing actions. Again, because most of these are broad-based across the industry and very targeted at where there's opportunity to ensure we maintain our market share position in each of the markets and products we operate in.\nTyler Hutin: Okay. Thank you for that. And just following-up, can you describe the opportunities that you're seeing with the government like what products, et cetera? And has this been an unexpected contribution in 2023? And will that be supplemental to your sales volume when other demand picks up? Thank you.\nJoe Heel: This is Joe Heel. Yes. So we've been working with governments around the world and have been seeing an increasing level of demand and opportunity there. And of course, we have commensurately increased the resources that we have put into this. Where we saw the North American government is the largest part of that. And of course, there are multiple different levels of that. State and local has been a growth area for us for some time. Specifically for example, outfitting police forces with tablets in their cars or parking enforcement handhelds devices with mobile printers have been the staple of our business there. But recently where we've been successful and have extended our engagement is with federal and state governments. And there are of course some very large contracts. You can see contracts with defense and in logistics areas that are increasingly important. And we've seen an increase in interest in those same levels in governments outside of the U.S. And of course, that has a little bit to do with some of the geopolitical situation that we find ourselves in and the governments needing in particular the types of solutions we provide to enhance the logistics behind some of those operations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning guys. I was hoping you could unpack the --\nBill Burns: Good morning, Keith.\nKeith Housum: I was hoping you could unpack the commentary regarding the customers digesting what they previously bought. Certainly, we're aware of one or two e-commerce guys that probably overbought, but I guess the people are digesting what they previously bought. Are they questioning the ROI that they previously experienced? I mean, perhaps just a little bit more color on the digestion commentary.\nBill Burns: Yes, Keith, I mean, I -- they're not questioning the ROI at all. They're clearly seeing the benefit of our devices that are mission critical in their environment. What they're really seeing is that, that extends beyond e-commerce to parcel delivery for instance. So we're seeing that in our T&L customers that are saying if you look at what they've said around parcel delivery, the entire industry's down as the result of kind of e-commerce resetting to kind of pre-pandemic growth rates, and they build out capacity, assuming it was going to be much stronger than that. I would say in retail, they've bought the devices they have, so I wouldn't say it's absorbing beyond what they need in most cases. Now, some bought ahead because of supply chain challenges, right? They knew that they needed the devices they bought ahead for a project, but in most cases, they just have what they need. And they're -- I think to the earlier question continuing to use those devices in other applications or just making tough budget decisions that ultimately they'd like to buy more, but they're leveraging what they have today instead of purchasing new because there's pressure from either their CFOs and others on IT, spending and CapEx within their environments and a certain macro environments. So I think it's in some cases using capacity. In other cases, it's just leveraging what they have today and they don't need anymore. In some cases they bought ahead because of supply chain challenges. But we saw a significant increase in demand over the last two years and now we're seeing ultimately that demand slow and then we'll see growth from here. Joe may want to add something.\nJoe Heel: Maybe to make it concrete, let me give again just a few examples, right? So if you're in a retailer, you buy our devices typically with an expectation of a growth trajectory, which means how many associates you will have in your store, or how many new stores you will open. And so those retailers that some of examples I gave earlier had planned for a certain growth trajectory, and then they've seen that growth trajectory change and lower. And so as a result, the ROI hasn't really changed for them, but they just see a lower demand trajectory, which then they're translating into lower purchases with us, right? I'm looking at I have four pages of individual deals that we look through and where customers have done exactly this. And here's an example of one where it says, customers working through gear they already have on hand not ready for additional orders until Q3. That's literally the type of thing we're hearing. And I don't think it has anything to do with the ROI, it's simply about the expectation for demand.\nKeith Housum: All right. I appreciate that. As a follow-up, is the same issues extending to the machine vision and robotics segment, perhaps any commentary you can offer on how that's progressing?\nBill Burns: No. We feel good about our machine vision business. When we acquired Matrox, at the same time we developed organically solutions in the low end of that range in fixed industrial scanning. And we acquired Adaptive Vision, which gave us software capabilities around things like optical character recognition. We knew when we acquired Matrox that they were heavily weighted in their sales to the semiconductor industry. And we all know that has slowed. But our objective all along was to really diversify that customer base as a smaller private company. Ultimately, they hadn't made the investments to go-to-market that we're making diversify it. We're seeing that the diversification is working. Our focus on things like electric vehicles, electric vehicle battery manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, really a broader push for us into manufacturing is working. And as we're driving into also into e-commerce opportunities, T&L, so we're seeing that the traction of diversification work within the business, despite the challenges with semiconductor in the short-term, which we were well aware of when acquiring the business. I'd say our organic investments as well are paying off in that space. From robotics perspective, I think it's just early days. We've got working solutions today moving pallets at customers for goods transport. We have goods being transported on smaller sized robots in multiple different applications. We're OEMing some of our robots in hospital environments delivering pharmaceuticals. We're picking e-commerce orders that that was one of the areas we've invested in since owning the business beyond just goods transport, but it's still early days. It's a small business and there's a large growth trajectory expected in that marketplace today. But it just takes time. You got to do early pilots with customers. You got to prove in the ROI and ultimately you see deployments and growth beyond that. So we feel okay about a robotics business. It's just small at the moment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Just I kind of wanted to just square up the commentary about push-out and your customers kind of changing. I guess like, if we step back, big picture, everything we hear, granted the industrial economy, the data has been pretty horrible, but every -- I guess the takeaway has been that the consumer's been really resilient and that the consumer recession that people saw coming isn't happening or hasn't happened. So like, how do you square that commentary with what you're hearing directly from your customers who are kind of leveraged to those consumers who maybe aren't getting as bad as people thought?\nBill Burns: I mean, I think we're seeing it, and I think you're seeing more people point to this, that it really is the service economy that's holding up, right? It's -- I think coming out of COVID, people are looking for more experiences. They're doing more travel this summer. They're saying, look, I'm going to take that trip no matter whether the cost of the flights or vacation are more expensive than it was in the past. I'm going to go do that. I mean, I don't know about you, but every flight I get on, every seat's taken, right? But I think from a goods perspective, we clearly are seeing a slowdown in customers buying goods. I think of Joe mentioned the DIY retailers, right, as is the interest rates have gone up, new housing sales have gone down and therefore people buy less from do it yourself retailers as an example. So I think people bought a lot of goods during COVID for their homes that now they're spending on experiences instead. So I think that while we're seeing the broader economy hold up, I think we're seeing goods purchases decline, and we're seeing that in where e-commerce is still growing, it's now reset back to a more traditional growth rate off the very high as we saw through the pandemic, which has then flows through to how many parcels have delivered from e-commerce. And I think that the -- and as Joe said, the expectations within our retail customers brick-and-mortar retail of how much they are going to sell has slowed so all that is playing a role in this. I think that it's really around goods versus services in the macro environment.\nJoe Giordano: And apologies if you said this already I'm kind of multi-tasking a couple calls here, but can you comment on what Matrox did specifically in a quarter on growth and maybe where they're at year-to-date?\nBill Burns: Yes. So I think that I said earlier in the call that, we're happy with the machine vision progress we've made with the Matrox acquisition, the acquisition of Adaptive Vision and our organic investing in machine vision. We knew when we purchased that business that it was heavily weighted towards semiconductor. And one of the objectives we have is for Joe and our marketing teams to focus on expanding markets beyond semiconductor into pharmaceutical, electrical vehicle manufacturing, transportation logistics, e-commerce that are all big users of machine vision and fixed industrial scanning. And we're seeing early progress and wins in that area. So we're pretty happy with the progress overall, I think that we're excited about the machine vision business overall. It's closely adjacent to our scanning business and we're seeing good results so far despite the headwinds associated with semiconductor.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Hewitt with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBrad Hewitt: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question.\nBill Burns: Absolutely.\nBrad Hewitt: I'm curious if you could elaborate more on what's embedded in your second half guidance in terms of pipeline conversion rates and any further project deferrals, and then also what drives your confidence that the full-year guide is properly derisked from here?\nBill Burns: So maybe I'll start. So again, if you look at the, what's embedded in the guide for the second half, one, it's supported by the most recent sales velocity. If you look, we are assuming significantly lower conversion rates on our pipeline of opportunities than we've had historically used due to the continued push-outs of orders that we've discussed earlier in the call. So again, a much lower conversion rate assumption on those deals. And again, the other impact which is you have to include is this the overall size impact of destocking within the channel. But again, we're assuming kind of that similar type of velocity through the year-end. And I think the other important assumption is we're not having -- we're not assuming there's any type of potential year-end spending or new large deployments in the fourth quarter, which we typically see as we approach the end of the year.\nJoe Heel: I'd say probably, as we look beyond, right, the second half, where our customers can only hold off so long on deployments of our products, they're really mission critical in their environments as they look to serve the other customers. And over time they will use the excess capacity they've purchased or we'll see the macro environment get better from a goods economy perspective, and they will begin to buy again. So I think that long-term we see that our value proposition remains very strong with our customers. Our relationships remain strong and across all of our core markets, our adjacencies to those core markets and our expansion investments will all continue to grow again as we see things from the macro environment improve, and our customers work through some of the demand that they've created over the last couple of years and the purchases they've made -- we'll continue to grow again.\nBrad Hewitt: Okay. That's helpful. And then I'm curious what you're seeing in your run rate business and how you expect that business to trend in the second half of the year. And also, does your guidance assume any negative mix shift from a softening of run rate in the second half?\nBill Burns: Yes. So we -- again, as we said earlier, we saw reduction in the velocity of our run rate business particularly in the second half of Q2, so kind of late May and into June. And we're assuming that trajectory continues through the remainder of the year. So I'd say no further deterioration, but definitely not any type of incremental improvement. And also that's why you see as you go into the fourth quarter kind of the year-on-year comps get more challenging, which is why you see the increase in terms of the year-on-year decline in the fourth quarter greater than in the third quarter. Just as that, that velocity continues to no assumed improvement that the comps get tougher as we move through the end of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead.\nRob Mason: So I mean, it looks like the run rate business has followed the large project business slower. I think you indicated earlier that's typically the pattern, but I'm curious if you think about a recovery scenario, perhaps looking out into next year or whenever this -- it happens, would you expect the run rate business to also follow the larger project business up or has just the -- what's happened in retail in particular changed that dynamic? I'm not sure that retail's overrepresented in large project, but maybe my impression is it might be.\nBill Burns: Yes. I think in the -- historically we've seen large deals are the first to decline and the first to recover, right? So that's what we've historically seen and we'd expect the same here. The mid-tier and run rate has slowed clearly in second quarter and that likely you don't see as large an effect as quickly in that business you've seen see a longer-term trajectory. And then the reverse of that is it recovers, but as you said, we would expect large deals to recover first and then mid-tier and run rate to follow in that recovery is how we typically see it, but you see more pronounced swings in large deals than you do certainly in run rate or mid-tier.\nRob Mason: Understood. And then just as a follow-up, Nathan, how are you feeling about inventory obsolescence risk at this point? And if a pause were to last multiple quarters, long of a pause, before that becomes a greater risk.\nNathan Winters: Look, overall, I think the -- obviously, we would -- we were expecting better results on inventory as we entered the year. I think the team is doing everything in our control working with our suppliers to reduce the committed volumes that are coming in. It's obviously a challenge though as the volume has continued to decline. So we're kind of chasing and -- chasing down when it relates to the inbound inventory supply that we have coming in. But like I -- when I look at E&O, I think again there's always risk in a technology business, so that's not different. But where we have supply, it's primarily in our run rate kind of high volume type of business. So when the volume returns, we have the components for it. So -- and this isn't unique SKUs or products for kind of one-off type products we have in the portfolio. The vast majority is around kind of our mainstream product portfolio. And so again, as the volume recovers, we'll burn through that component inventory, and that's their value. If you look at where the primary increase is at, it's in components. So this isn't fully finished goods, which again gives us that flexibility to flex between different SKUs, different customers that we have given that most of the increase is in components sitting at our Tier 1 manufacturing partners.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Guy Hardwick with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nGuy Hardwick: Just trying sort of dissect your comments on channel inventories and runway business. I think Nathan, you said the guidance in Q3, a third of it's accounted for by channel destocking. And then -- but I think you said that continues at kind of a similar rate in Q4. So just wondering what you -- has there been any -- what are the kind of the very latest indicators you're seeing in terms of sellout from the channel? Has there been any signs of stabilization yet? And if not, I mean, what is your kind of view where channel inventories could be at the end of the year? I mean, will the destocking continue into next year?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So maybe just to clarify, so if you look at the guidance assumptions for the third and fourth quarter, it assumes that similar velocity of demand, so that includes 80% of our business is the channel so that kind of similar velocity from Q3 to Q4. Then you have the -- again, the outsize impact of destocking in the third quarter. So we do not plan to destock as much in the fourth quarter as again the -- and that's really the driver of the sequential improvement in our revenue between Q3 and Q4 is that differential. So the expectation is that we will exit the year with our days on hand balance in the distributors at its normalized level where we expect the business to be so that we go into 2024 with both that kind of run rate trajectory and the inventory balances in the channel appropriately set so we have a clean slate as we enter 2024.\nGuy Hardwick: I mean, if we take a kind of three or four year view on channel inventories, would you expect channel inventories to be back to pre-pandemic levels in terms of days on hand? Would it still be elevated relative to say 2019, 2020 levels?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So again, two different points. I think from a days on hand, we've always stayed relatively within the boundaries we have as a business, and that's -- we measure our partners and channel partners on that as part of their incentive plan. Again, the absolute dollars increased over the last two to three years in balance as our revenue increased. And those balances are declining now that our volume's declining. But the -- we -- again, we spent a lot of time with our partners ensuring that they have the right levels of days on hand inventory to support the business. And those vary by product family by region and what the business needs are. So again, we're a little bit higher than that range today, just given the velocity decline we saw late in the second quarter. We're going to get that corrected here in the third and then a little bit more in the fourth, so that we go into 2024 again with a clean sheet.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Burns for any closing remarks.\nBill Burns: Yes. While our spend is pressured certainly in near-term, over the long-term, we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows within our customers environments. To wrap up, I'd like to just thank our customers, partners, and employees for their support and dedication over to our long-term success. Have a great day, everybody.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joe Heel",
            "content": "Yes. Maybe if a little bit of additional color. So first, the declines in our larger customers were larger than the declines in our mid-tier and small, run rate business as we would call it. And that helps us understand this better because we track, of course, we have direct contact with our large customers and we see what's happening to individual deals there. Now what we've been seeing is that a lot of those deals hundreds of millions of dollars have pushed out of the first half into the future or in some cases have disappeared as deals altogether. I'll give you some examples of those, but before I do this behavior has accelerated in the second quarter. So, for example, in North America, the amount of push-outs that we've seen relative to the first quarter has tripled. Now let me give you just a few examples, right? So you can -- you see what's driving this and what's happening, right? At the beginning of Q3, we had a grocer who came to us and said, I want to buy $4 million worth of your mobile computers. And midway through the quarter they said, we're not going to do this deal in Q2, we're going to do it in Q3. I'm sorry, I said Q3 at the beginning, my mistake. So they came at the beginning of Q2, said, we want to buy this. And midway through the quarter they said we now want to do this deal in Q3 rather than in Q2. So a good example of what we would call a push-out. But we also had another grocer who at the beginning of the quarter was indicating that they're going to buy over $5 million worth of mobile computers. And they came and said, we now want to do take these $5 million of mobile computers, but we want to buy them over the next five quarters equally distributed, which of course, delays our revenue trajectory. We also had a DIY retailer who wanted to buy $7 million at the beginning of Q2 and came to us during the quarter and said, my budgets have been cut. I can't do this project right now anymore. We'll do it sometime in the future, but I can't tell you when. So these are three different examples that all impact our Q2 revenue and indicate that our customers' budgets are under pressure to the extent that they're trying to extend out when they buy from us, which diminishes our revenue. Hopefully that's helpful. I can answer that directly. We have had no or virtually no firm orders canceled. So all of what I was describing to you were movements in our pipelines. Generally, we have not seen orders that we've already taken or backlogged canceled. Yes. I would underline that specifically that I think we're seeing is an extension of the sales cycles not a diminishing set of use cases in any way. In fact, I think it's almost the opposite. So the examples I gave earlier were all examples of extending sales cycles. And what we're seeing with our customers is that in fact they're discovering during this period how they can use their devices and the Zebra solutions for more use cases. So we're seeing more use cases in the store like communication or flexible checkout advising customers on where to find goods and products in the store are being added to the devices that they have. And we're of course fueling that because we're releasing new use cases. For example, we just released the ability to take payment directly on our devices, right? So I would say very clearly it's an elongation of sales cycles, new use cases are alive and well. This is Joe Heel. Yes. So we've been working with governments around the world and have been seeing an increasing level of demand and opportunity there. And of course, we have commensurately increased the resources that we have put into this. Where we saw the North American government is the largest part of that. And of course, there are multiple different levels of that. State and local has been a growth area for us for some time. Specifically for example, outfitting police forces with tablets in their cars or parking enforcement handhelds devices with mobile printers have been the staple of our business there. But recently where we've been successful and have extended our engagement is with federal and state governments. And there are of course some very large contracts. You can see contracts with defense and in logistics areas that are increasingly important. And we've seen an increase in interest in those same levels in governments outside of the U.S. And of course, that has a little bit to do with some of the geopolitical situation that we find ourselves in and the governments needing in particular the types of solutions we provide to enhance the logistics behind some of those operations. Maybe to make it concrete, let me give again just a few examples, right? So if you're in a retailer, you buy our devices typically with an expectation of a growth trajectory, which means how many associates you will have in your store, or how many new stores you will open. And so those retailers that some of examples I gave earlier had planned for a certain growth trajectory, and then they've seen that growth trajectory change and lower. And so as a result, the ROI hasn't really changed for them, but they just see a lower demand trajectory, which then they're translating into lower purchases with us, right? I'm looking at I have four pages of individual deals that we look through and where customers have done exactly this. And here's an example of one where it says, customers working through gear they already have on hand not ready for additional orders until Q3. That's literally the type of thing we're hearing. And I don't think it has anything to do with the ROI, it's simply about the expectation for demand. I'd say probably, as we look beyond, right, the second half, where our customers can only hold off so long on deployments of our products, they're really mission critical in their environments as they look to serve the other customers. And over time they will use the excess capacity they've purchased or we'll see the macro environment get better from a goods economy perspective, and they will begin to buy again. So I think that long-term we see that our value proposition remains very strong with our customers. Our relationships remain strong and across all of our core markets, our adjacencies to those core markets and our expansion investments will all continue to grow again as we see things from the macro environment improve, and our customers work through some of the demand that they've created over the last couple of years and the purchases they've made -- we'll continue to grow again."

            "name": "Bill Burns",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Our second quarter results were impacted by weakening demand and cautious customer spending behavior across our end markets. While these results are certainly disappointing to us, we'll spend some time today discussing the drivers that are having the greatest impact, as well as the actions we are taking to control what we can in a difficult demand environment, including our expanded cost reduction initiatives. For the quarter, we realized sales of $1.2 billion, a 16% decline from the prior year and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.2%, a 70 basis point decrease, and a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.29, a 29% decrease from the prior year. Let me now put these results in context. On our last quarter call, we discussed the broader softening of industry demand as customers tightened their CapEx budgets and IT device spending slows. During the second quarter, those trends accelerated as we saw more cautious spending behavior by our customers of all sizes across our vertical end markets and regions. While all end markets declined, demand was weakest in retail and e-commerce and transportation logistics as many customers are absorbing capacity they build out during the pandemic. These dynamics have been exacerbated by our distributors focus on reducing their inventory levels, which accounted for approximately 20% of our Q2 sales decline. Our distribution channel has been aggressively driving down inventory as end user demand has slowed, product lead times have recovered, and the cost of holding working capital has increased. Although global macro indicators have been resilient, the goods economy has underperformed the services economy, and certain key indicators most relevant to our industry have become significantly weaker, including IT device spending. This particular metric has been most correlated with mobile computing where sales declines have accelerated year-to-date following more than two years of very strong demand. Growth across RFID, data capture, supplies, services and software were bright spots in the quarter. From a profitability perspective, improved gross margin and cost controls enable us to achieve our EBITDA margin and EPS outlook for the second quarter. In our current market environment swift action is needed and we are taking a number of steps to position us to deliver profitable growth and improve free cash flow. Slide 5 summarizes key industry challenges that have intensified since our prior update, and our actions to address and mitigate the impacts. These actions include reducing spending across the organization, including additional restructuring actions to drive an incremental $65 million of net annualized operating savings as we exit 2023, increasing our focus on accelerating growth in underpenetrated markets, and continue to work closely with our customers as we continue to digitize and automate their environments. Our revised full-year outlook incorporates the slowdown and deceleration across our end markets, including a significant reduction in near-term demand in the mobile computing market, destocking buyer distributors, as well as a partial year benefit of our expanded restructuring actions. Given our limited visibility in this environment, we are cautious in our assumptions and not expecting a recovery in 2023. We expect the reset of our cost structure and shift of our go-to market resources to drive sales growth and improved profitability as our end markets recover. We'll continue to take an agile approach to managing through this uncertain near-term environment. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q2 financial results and provide additional details on our revised 2023 outlook. Thank you, Nathan. While sales are pressured near-term, over the long-term, our solutions remain essential to our customers' operations, and we are well-positioned to benefit from the secular trends to digitize and automate workflows across our served markets. We are focused on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision by elevating Zebra as a premier solutions provider through our compelling portfolio. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, including scarcity of labor and the need to improve productivity. We empower the workforce to execute tasks more effectively by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by our advanced software capabilities such as machine learning and prescriptive analytics. Now turning to Slide 13. I would like to highlight several key mega trends, which supports Zebra's growth and customer value propositions over the long-term. These include automation, mobility and cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. Our customers rely on Zebra to help them take advantage of these key mega trends, which drive their growth strategies. As you can see on Slide 14, Zebra's enterprise mobile computers are critical to the front line of business. We are excited about our innovation roadmap and new solution launches that advance our value proposition. Labor is a scarce resource and leveraging technology is a key way our customers can advance their operations. Our solutions empower enterprises to increase collaboration and productivity and better serve customers, shoppers, and patients by enabling and expanding number of use cases across our end markets. Our enterprise mobile computing installed base has expanded significantly over the past several years due to the perforation of use cases and the investment in Zebra solutions should rebound as technology refreshes or reprioritized. On Slide 15, we highlight a few areas that are advancing our capabilities to serve our customers evolving needs and are expected to be profitable growth drivers for Zebra as we continue to scale them. Collectively, these offerings are approaching $0.5 billion of annualized sales and have a long runway for growth. First, we are a leader in advanced location solutions through RFID. We have been driving strong double-digit growth in recent years with the heightened importance of real-time inventory accuracy. We are now addressing an expanding set of use cases throughout the supply chain, including our previously announced large win with a global transportation logistics provider, which highlights the long-term growth opportunity for RFID solutions. Second, we believe investments in our machine vision business, which is accretive to our growth and EBITDA margins, positions us well for long-term growth. We continue to invest in innovation and go-to-market efforts to further diversify and scale in attractive subcategories. Strong growth in certain end markets, including warehouse distribution, and electric vehicle manufacturing has partially offset weakness in the semiconductor industry. An example of our recent success is a win with the U.S.-based global auto manufacturer who has been transitioning to electric vehicle production. The ease of use of our solutions was a key differentiator as the manufacturer capitalized on the disruption in the auto market to modernize its processes with more flexible solutions. And lastly, our workflow optimization software offerings include workforce and task management, communication and collaboration tools, inventory visibility and demand planning. Recent notable wins include our workforce management solution for location staffing at a large North America bank and our retail demand forecasting solution for a North America consumer packaged goods company. The actions we are taking to improve profitability of our software offerings, including migration to a cloud-based platform are expected to enable software to become EBITDA margin accretive in 2024. In closing, our long-term conviction in our business remains unchanged. While customer spend is pressured near-term, over the long-term, we believe we're well-positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows. We'll work to continue to elevate our position with customers through our comprehensive portfolio of solutions while taking the actions needed to improve profitability and position us for success both in the current environment and in the future. I will now hand it back to Mike. Yes. I think overall that we've said that what we've seen in the market is that as the goods economy is clearly weaker than the service economy, which is resulting in we're seeing more of our customers really absorbing the capacity that they bought through the pandemic, and that extends beyond just the largest e-commerce retailer we've talked about in the past, but to other e-commerce even our retail customers and into transportation logistics customers as well. And we've seen softness now spread into other markets. But specific to your question, I think that I guess maybe a good example of that is recently we've seen a large logistics company talk about really what's been detrimental to their volumes, right? And I think it is this idea that the overall industrial economy is slowing, right? Clearly focused on goods and not services. And they've said, look, that's slowing obviously because of all the macroeconomic indicators, right? Inflation interest rates slowdown in global trade. It's also being driven by consumers buying less, right? And then this reset of e-commerce coming out of the pandemic to the levels of purchases of goods slowing down transportation logistics package delivery as well, which has really been detrimental to the entire industry overall from a volume perspective. So we're seeing this additional capacity built out in e-commerce players. We're seeing it in retail, and I wouldn't say it as much as excess capacity is really, they have what they need for now, and as the goods economy slows, they eventually will come back and buy more. But for today, they've got what they need. We're seeing it move into parcel delivery with transportation logistics, but also spread into other markets as well. As you know, in first quarter we talked about slowing down of large orders and large customers. We've seen that move into mid-tier and smaller customers as well. So it's more broad-based than we had seen in the past. And we think it really is the two years of very strong demand we've seen, especially in mobile computing across our entire customer base is now being absorbed and into the marketplace and then ultimately, that's why we're seeing the decline in the short-term. And that will come back as the macro indicators come back, as people buy more goods than services, as you know they use this excess capacity within their environment. They will buy more from us. And we'll see that inflection point at some point, but right now we're not seeing it. We're clearly seeing our demand be pressured because of it. Yes. Kind of a combination answers there probably is that overall, we would say that, why do we believe our guide, right? And as we looked at Q3 and Q4, clearly in Q3, you're seeing more destocking from a distribution perspective than you are in Q4. But I think that we've taken an approach that basically for the guide for Q3 and full-year, where we see the demand trends that we'll continue that begin to deteriorate really in Q1 and continue through Q2. We'll continue from a booking and sales velocity perspective, it'll remain about the same for the full-year. We're assuming that a significantly lower conversion of opportunities within our pipeline than historical levels just because of these push-outs of large orders by our customers. And we've removed expectations really for recovery in year-end -- at year-end in fourth quarter. But the reason you see that the uptick there is really because we're seeing an oversize effect of our distributors destocking inventory levels as their end demand continues to slow. So ultimately our sales out of distribution, when that slows, they hold a specific days on hand inventory and they need to buy less from us because they're selling less out. They need less in inventory. And I think that the -- we see an oversize effect when end demand slows. So in fourth quarter, we're seeing less of the destocking than we were in Q3. The destocking is also driven by the fact that our delivery times have shortened and their cost of capital's gone up. So there's pressure on inventory and to lower those inventory levels really as their end demand is slowed and we're seeing a bit less of that in fourth quarter. So that's really the trajectory we're seeing around. We believe ultimately we're seeing -- in the process of seeing really the bottom in Q3 and Q4 and do see an inflection point in 2024. But the difference between Q3 and Q4 is really predominantly based on inventory destocking levels. And we expect to exit year-end with the right levels of inventory for what is the end demand that our distributors are seeing. So we see destocking taking place through the second half year, and then being really at the right levels for the demand that our distributors are seeing as we exit the year. Yes. Maybe I'll start and then I'll add Joe can jump in as well. Really, if we look back to our May call, we talked about broader softening of industry demands. And those trends really have accelerated in Q2 as we saw more cautious spending on the part of our customers, again, after two years of really strong demand for our products and solutions. And we see this as really broader global macro weakness, but we've seen particular impact from that in EMEA and in China and China we expected more recovery out of COVID that we haven't seen in slower economic factors within China. Retail and e-commerce, as we've talked about a little bit earlier on Tommy's question really is driving that, that trend as they're absorbing capacity, but coming out of the pandemic, but we've seen it more broad across other industries as well as we worked our way through Q2. We're seeing an increased number of push-outs from a project perspective as well, or those projects being reduced in size. And Joe will talk a little bit more about that overall, but I would say that, the dynamics that we're seeing around distribution is one element of it, but the end demand clearly is slowed, and that's what's driving the distribution destocking of inventory is really about end demand. That's really, and after two years of really strong demand, we're now ultimately seeing that it really is in Zebra, we're seeing this across industry trends like IT device spending that ultimately our -- we're seeing that same trend that that IT device spending is correlated to our mobile computing market, which we see as the biggest impact of this slowdown. But it's really broad-based across IT devices and through that we expect to continue to outperform our competition, but clearly disappointing demand levels from an end market, but maybe Joe wants to jump in. Yes. I would say that, RFID continues to be a bright spot and continue to see growth across multiple applications, not just retail. Our supplies business continues to be positive from not just an RFID perspective, but a broader supplies business in our Temptime acquisition as well. Services and software we think will be clearly bright spots in the second half year. Data capture is a tougher compare in second half. So I think what you're still seeing is in print and data capture solutions a fair amount of variation across supply chain availability in 2022 that were cycling through in 2023, so you see strong growth in first half with tough compares in second half across those businesses, which still remain challenging from as you look at the numbers overall that you're seeing -- still seeing the supply chain dynamic take place in comparison from prior years. So data capture solutions is just a tough compare in second half. I think we're seeing clearly the refresh cycles, we would say, are elongated as people are using those assets and making tough business decisions at the moment. They can only hold off so long in those technology refreshes. And you've got to remember the strong demand over the last two years has put a lot more devices in the hands of frontline workers. So when they go to refresh those devices that will be a higher number of devices that they refresh. In the short-term, they're consuming capacity they built in e-commerce and transportation logistics and even our retail customers where they've bought a lot of devices through the pandemic and they've got to work through those devices, but eventually they will buy more. We're still seeing -- there's still a great opportunity for us to continue to underserved hands, more devices in the hands of frontline workers across all of our vertical markets. And Joe can talk a little bit about more about that. So I think we're still seeing that there's plenty of bright spots for new applications for our devices and leveraging our retail software, for instance, on our devices within retail and communication, collaboration, visibility, AI and leveraging, workers with more information leveraging your mobile devices. So the longer-term trends continue despite the challenges in short-term demand. And Joe, do you want to add to that? No. Not as part -- not as part of the restructuring, Meta in terms of obviously the team's working on renegotiating supply agreements to maximize cash with the demand changes. But we'll work each one of those and make sure it's the right economic decision for the short and long-term. But those -- that is not included as any part of the restructuring charges. Hi, Tyler. Good morning, Keith. Yes, Keith, I mean, I -- they're not questioning the ROI at all. They're clearly seeing the benefit of our devices that are mission critical in their environment. What they're really seeing is that, that extends beyond e-commerce to parcel delivery for instance. So we're seeing that in our T&L customers that are saying if you look at what they've said around parcel delivery, the entire industry's down as the result of kind of e-commerce resetting to kind of pre-pandemic growth rates, and they build out capacity, assuming it was going to be much stronger than that. I would say in retail, they've bought the devices they have, so I wouldn't say it's absorbing beyond what they need in most cases. Now, some bought ahead because of supply chain challenges, right? They knew that they needed the devices they bought ahead for a project, but in most cases, they just have what they need. And they're -- I think to the earlier question continuing to use those devices in other applications or just making tough budget decisions that ultimately they'd like to buy more, but they're leveraging what they have today instead of purchasing new because there's pressure from either their CFOs and others on IT, spending and CapEx within their environments and a certain macro environments. So I think it's in some cases using capacity. In other cases, it's just leveraging what they have today and they don't need anymore. In some cases they bought ahead because of supply chain challenges. But we saw a significant increase in demand over the last two years and now we're seeing ultimately that demand slow and then we'll see growth from here. Joe may want to add something. No. We feel good about our machine vision business. When we acquired Matrox, at the same time we developed organically solutions in the low end of that range in fixed industrial scanning. And we acquired Adaptive Vision, which gave us software capabilities around things like optical character recognition. We knew when we acquired Matrox that they were heavily weighted in their sales to the semiconductor industry. And we all know that has slowed. But our objective all along was to really diversify that customer base as a smaller private company. Ultimately, they hadn't made the investments to go-to-market that we're making diversify it. We're seeing that the diversification is working. Our focus on things like electric vehicles, electric vehicle battery manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, really a broader push for us into manufacturing is working. And as we're driving into also into e-commerce opportunities, T&L, so we're seeing that the traction of diversification work within the business, despite the challenges with semiconductor in the short-term, which we were well aware of when acquiring the business. I'd say our organic investments as well are paying off in that space. From robotics perspective, I think it's just early days. We've got working solutions today moving pallets at customers for goods transport. We have goods being transported on smaller sized robots in multiple different applications. We're OEMing some of our robots in hospital environments delivering pharmaceuticals. We're picking e-commerce orders that that was one of the areas we've invested in since owning the business beyond just goods transport, but it's still early days. It's a small business and there's a large growth trajectory expected in that marketplace today. But it just takes time. You got to do early pilots with customers. You got to prove in the ROI and ultimately you see deployments and growth beyond that. So we feel okay about a robotics business. It's just small at the moment. I mean, I think we're seeing it, and I think you're seeing more people point to this, that it really is the service economy that's holding up, right? It's -- I think coming out of COVID, people are looking for more experiences. They're doing more travel this summer. They're saying, look, I'm going to take that trip no matter whether the cost of the flights or vacation are more expensive than it was in the past. I'm going to go do that. I mean, I don't know about you, but every flight I get on, every seat's taken, right? But I think from a goods perspective, we clearly are seeing a slowdown in customers buying goods. I think of Joe mentioned the DIY retailers, right, as is the interest rates have gone up, new housing sales have gone down and therefore people buy less from do it yourself retailers as an example. So I think people bought a lot of goods during COVID for their homes that now they're spending on experiences instead. So I think that while we're seeing the broader economy hold up, I think we're seeing goods purchases decline, and we're seeing that in where e-commerce is still growing, it's now reset back to a more traditional growth rate off the very high as we saw through the pandemic, which has then flows through to how many parcels have delivered from e-commerce. And I think that the -- and as Joe said, the expectations within our retail customers brick-and-mortar retail of how much they are going to sell has slowed so all that is playing a role in this. I think that it's really around goods versus services in the macro environment. Yes. So I think that I said earlier in the call that, we're happy with the machine vision progress we've made with the Matrox acquisition, the acquisition of Adaptive Vision and our organic investing in machine vision. We knew when we purchased that business that it was heavily weighted towards semiconductor. And one of the objectives we have is for Joe and our marketing teams to focus on expanding markets beyond semiconductor into pharmaceutical, electrical vehicle manufacturing, transportation logistics, e-commerce that are all big users of machine vision and fixed industrial scanning. And we're seeing early progress and wins in that area. So we're pretty happy with the progress overall, I think that we're excited about the machine vision business overall. It's closely adjacent to our scanning business and we're seeing good results so far despite the headwinds associated with semiconductor. Absolutely. So maybe I'll start. So again, if you look at the, what's embedded in the guide for the second half, one, it's supported by the most recent sales velocity. If you look, we are assuming significantly lower conversion rates on our pipeline of opportunities than we've had historically used due to the continued push-outs of orders that we've discussed earlier in the call. So again, a much lower conversion rate assumption on those deals. And again, the other impact which is you have to include is this the overall size impact of destocking within the channel. But again, we're assuming kind of that similar type of velocity through the year-end. And I think the other important assumption is we're not having -- we're not assuming there's any type of potential year-end spending or new large deployments in the fourth quarter, which we typically see as we approach the end of the year. Yes. So we -- again, as we said earlier, we saw reduction in the velocity of our run rate business particularly in the second half of Q2, so kind of late May and into June. And we're assuming that trajectory continues through the remainder of the year. So I'd say no further deterioration, but definitely not any type of incremental improvement. And also that's why you see as you go into the fourth quarter kind of the year-on-year comps get more challenging, which is why you see the increase in terms of the year-on-year decline in the fourth quarter greater than in the third quarter. Just as that, that velocity continues to no assumed improvement that the comps get tougher as we move through the end of the year. Yes. I think in the -- historically we've seen large deals are the first to decline and the first to recover, right? So that's what we've historically seen and we'd expect the same here. The mid-tier and run rate has slowed clearly in second quarter and that likely you don't see as large an effect as quickly in that business you've seen see a longer-term trajectory. And then the reverse of that is it recovers, but as you said, we would expect large deals to recover first and then mid-tier and run rate to follow in that recovery is how we typically see it, but you see more pronounced swings in large deals than you do certainly in run rate or mid-tier. Yes. While our spend is pressured certainly in near-term, over the long-term, we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows within our customers environments. To wrap up, I'd like to just thank our customers, partners, and employees for their support and dedication over to our long-term success. Have a great day, everybody."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 7. In Q2, net sales decreased 17.3% including the impact of currency and acquisitions and were 16% lower on an organic basis. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment was flat, strengthen in RFID and supplies was offset by a decline in printing as we lapped particularly strong prior year results. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 23.6%, driven by a sharp decline in mobile computing, partially offset by growth in data capture solutions. Additionally, we drove organic growth across service and software with strong service attach rates. Sales declined across our regions driven by broad-based double-digit declines in mobile computing. In North America, sales decreased 11%. EMEA sales declined 24% with pronounced weakness in Eastern Europe. Asia-Pacific sales decreased 17% driven by China and India with growth in Japan and Australia. And Latin America sales decreased 6%, partially offset by growth in Brazil and Mexico. Adjusted gross margin increased 200 basis points to 48%, primarily due to lower premium supply chain costs in favorable business mix and pricing, partially offset by expense de-leveraging and unfavorable FX. We are pleased to see gross margins recovering from the inflationary headwinds we experienced over the past couple of years. Adjusted operating expenses deleveraged 310 basis points as a percent of sales, partially offset by lower incentive compensation and cost controls. Note, that as we began to see demand soften, we announced incremental restructuring plans that are expected to drive $65 million of net annualized operating expense savings as they're implemented. Including previous actions taken over the past year, our total net annual cost savings is $85 million. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.2%, a 70 basis point decrease driven by operating expense de-leveraging partially offset by improved gross margin. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.29, a 29% year-over-year decrease. Increased interest expense contributed to the decline partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 8. For the first half of 2023, negative free cash flow of $144 million was unfavorable to the prior year period, primarily due to a greater use of networking capital due to higher cash taxes and payments for inventory. And $45 million of previously announced quarterly settlement payments, which are scheduled to conclude in Q1 of 2024, partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments. In the first half of 2023, we also made $52 million of share repurchases and invested $1 million in our venture portfolio. We ended the quarter at a 1.8x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is below the top end of our target range of 2.5x and had approximately $1.1 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility. On Slide 9, we highlight the impact of premium supply chain costs on our gross margin over the past 2.5 years. The actions we have taken to redesign products and increase price along with improving freight rates and capacity have enabled us to avoid component purchases on the spot market and reduce the freight cost impact. In Q2, we incurred premium supply chain costs of an incremental $5 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline and $51 million lower than the prior year quarter. As we enter the third quarter, we believe these costs will have been fully mitigated, which is the key lever to margin recovery. Let's now turn to our outlook. As we enter the third quarter, we are seeing sharp broad-based declines across most of our product offerings, which continues to be amplified by distributors recalibrating their inventory to lower demand trends. Our Q3 sales are expected to decline between 30% and 35% compared to the prior year. This outlook assumes double-digit declines across each of our core product categories with distributor destocking accounting for approximately one-third of the decline. We anticipate Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 10% and 12% driven by expense de-leveraging from lower sales volume, partially offset by higher gross margin from cycling $30 million of premium supply chain costs in the prior year period. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in range of $0.60 to $1. Given our Q2 results in the continued challenging demand environment, we are significantly reducing our full-year outlook, expecting a sales decline between 20% and 23%. This assumes the Q3 sales trajectory continues through the remainder of the year. We're seeing broad-based declines across our end markets as we enter the second half with significant uncertainty in this environment. We expect full-year adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 18%. We expect increased de-leveraging on significantly reduced sales volumes expectations partially offset by early benefits from cost reduction actions as most of the actions will be implemented by early Q4. We plan to continue to align our cost structure with the long-term trajectory of our business. We now expect free cash flow to be positive in the second half, but negative for the year given lower sales and earnings expectations. Our cash flow will be impacted by new restructuring charges, increased cash taxes due to change in R&D expected regulation and $180 million of previously announced settlement payments. We continue to be focused on rightsizing inventory on our balance sheet as component lead times have normalized. However, we now expect minimal inventory reduction in 2023 due to our lowered sales outlook. We are focused on achieving 100% cash conversion over a cycle, which is one of the metrics in our long-term incentive compensation plan. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 10. Note that we have improved our expected 2023 non-GAAP tax rate by 1 point due to favorable geographic mix. With that, I'll turn the call back to Bill to discuss how we're advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. This is Nathan. Again, as you mentioned, I'd say gross margin was a bright spot in the second quarter hitting 48%, which we haven't achieved that level since the first half of 2021 when we had a bit more revenue and the euro was at a $1.20. So obviously the bright spot in the quarter, including the reduction in the premium supply chain costs down to $5 million and then negligible as we enter the second half of the year due to all the nice work by the team redesigning products getting our printer capacity back on ocean. So again, I think we feel good about gross margin. I think that's a -- the 48% is a new baseline. There will be fluctuations, as we move quarter-to-quarter based on deal size, that is one dynamic that's helping us with the lack of large deals is a benefit to gross margin. But there's other tailwinds that we have going through the remainder of the year, including FX assuming it stays at its current level. So I think that's the right watermark, but I'd say quarter-to-quarter there'll be fluctuations as with just general mix and business dynamics. Yes. Maybe I can give just a little bit more color on the guide and then to your point on the some of the regional dynamics is just to read what Bill mentioned earlier, the guide is supported by the most recent sales and bookings velocity and we're not assuming any type of recovery as we enter the quarter or as we move through the quarter. So you really see that I'd say across all our geographies. So I think that it's -- if you look at the similarities across each region, they're very similar in terms of being impacted by mobile computing tougher year-on-year comps for the business like print. So what we've effectively done is said, what is that velocity we're seeing in the end markets? How does that continue through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter? And again, removing some of the upside or opportunities to ensure that we have the right baseline to build from here, but I'd say the dynamics are very similar across each of the regions as we go through the second half. So we expect the full-year pricing benefit to be around 2 points. It's a little bit higher than our previous guide with the most recent price increases that went into effect late in the second quarter. But we're actually seeing those actions hold and stick in the market. So I'd say it's again about 2 points for the year. And I think just to again these were very specific targeted actions, not broad-based, and it's something we monitor constantly to ensure that we're competitive in the market. And that the -- I wouldn't say any part of the volume decline is related to the pricing actions. Again, because most of these are broad-based across the industry and very targeted at where there's opportunity to ensure we maintain our market share position in each of the markets and products we operate in. Look, overall, I think the -- obviously, we would -- we were expecting better results on inventory as we entered the year. I think the team is doing everything in our control working with our suppliers to reduce the committed volumes that are coming in. It's obviously a challenge though as the volume has continued to decline. So we're kind of chasing and -- chasing down when it relates to the inbound inventory supply that we have coming in. But like I -- when I look at E&O, I think again there's always risk in a technology business, so that's not different. But where we have supply, it's primarily in our run rate kind of high volume type of business. So when the volume returns, we have the components for it. So -- and this isn't unique SKUs or products for kind of one-off type products we have in the portfolio. The vast majority is around kind of our mainstream product portfolio. And so again, as the volume recovers, we'll burn through that component inventory, and that's their value. If you look at where the primary increase is at, it's in components. So this isn't fully finished goods, which again gives us that flexibility to flex between different SKUs, different customers that we have given that most of the increase is in components sitting at our Tier 1 manufacturing partners. Yes. So maybe just to clarify, so if you look at the guidance assumptions for the third and fourth quarter, it assumes that similar velocity of demand, so that includes 80% of our business is the channel so that kind of similar velocity from Q3 to Q4. Then you have the -- again, the outsize impact of destocking in the third quarter. So we do not plan to destock as much in the fourth quarter as again the -- and that's really the driver of the sequential improvement in our revenue between Q3 and Q4 is that differential. So the expectation is that we will exit the year with our days on hand balance in the distributors at its normalized level where we expect the business to be so that we go into 2024 with both that kind of run rate trajectory and the inventory balances in the channel appropriately set so we have a clean slate as we enter 2024. Yes. So again, two different points. I think from a days on hand, we've always stayed relatively within the boundaries we have as a business, and that's -- we measure our partners and channel partners on that as part of their incentive plan. Again, the absolute dollars increased over the last two to three years in balance as our revenue increased. And those balances are declining now that our volume's declining. But the -- we -- again, we spent a lot of time with our partners ensuring that they have the right levels of days on hand inventory to support the business. And those vary by product family by region and what the business needs are. So again, we're a little bit higher than that range today, just given the velocity decline we saw late in the second quarter. We're going to get that corrected here in the third and then a little bit more in the fourth, so that we go into 2024 again with a clean sheet."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. And at this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Steele: Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's first quarter conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth, our year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Bill Burns, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill will begin with our first quarter highlights. Then Nathan will provide additional detail on the Q1 results and discuss our revised 2023 outlook. Bill will conclude with progress made on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Following the prepared remarks, Joe Heel, our Chief Revenue Officer, will join us as we take your questions. Now, let's turn to slide 4 as I hand it over to Bill.\nBill Burns: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Our team executed well in a challenging macroeconomic environment, delivering first quarter sales and earnings results above the midpoint of our outlook. For the quarter, we realized sales of $1.4 billion approximately in line with the prior year; and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4%, a 150 basis point increase; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.94, a 2% decrease from the prior year. Regional sales performance was mixed with growth in Asia Pac and North America mostly offsetting declines in EMEA and Latin America. From a solutions perspective, printing, data capture and RFID were bright spots, while sales of mobile computers declined. We continue to see cautious spending behavior by enterprise customers with a decline in large orders and growth in small to midsized orders. From a profitability perspective, improved gross margin drove our EBITDA margin increase. Higher interest and tax expense resulted in a slight earnings decline. I would now like to spend a moment on our sales outlook. As the risk of broader softening of industry demand has materialized, we have reduced our full year outlook. Late in Q1 and into Q2, demand trends softened across our end markets, particularly for mobile computers in EMEA and North America as customers' CapEx budgets tightened and IT device spending contracts. We are mitigating the impact of softer sales with targeted go-to-market actions to drive additional demand and incremental cost actions. We will continue to take an agile approach to managing throughout this uncertain near-term environment. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q1 financial results and provide additional details on our revised 2023 outlook.\nNathan Winters: Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on slide 6. In Q1, net sales decreased 1.9%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and were 0.3% lower on an organic basis. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment increased 28.4%, led by strength in printing as we lapped significant supply constraints in the prior year period. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 11.2%, with mixed performance among our offerings. We realized strong growth in data capture solutions and RFID. Mobile computing sales declined, primarily due to large customer order deferrals, slowing demand through distribution, and the impact of ceasing sales to Russia in March of 2022. Additionally, we also drove growth across Service and Software with strong service attach rates. Performance was mixed across our regions. North America sales increased 1%, due to strength in printing and data capture, helped by the recovery from supply chain challenges. EMEA sales declined 4%, primarily due to a 350 basis point impact of our suspension of sales into Russia. Asia Pacific sales grew 6%, driven by strong mobile computing growth in Japan. And Latin America sales decreased 1%, with relative outperformance in Brazil and Mexico. Adjusted gross margin increased 290 basis points to 47.5%, primarily due to lower premium supply chain costs, partially offset by FX and lower service margin. Adjusted operating expenses increased 130 basis points as a percent of sales, primarily due to a return to normalized sales and marketing activity and strategic investments in the business, partially offset by a reduction in G&A expense. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.4%, a 150 basis point increase driven by gross margin expansion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.94, a 1.7% year-over-year decrease due to increased interest expense and a higher tax rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide 7, in Q1, we had negative free cash flow of $92 million, which was unfavorable to the prior year period primarily due to the timing of inventory payments, higher interest cost and cash taxes and $45 million of previously announced quarterly settlement payments, which are scheduled to conclude in Q1 of 2024, all of which was partially offset by favorability in the timing of customer collections, and lower incentive compensation payments. In Q1, we also made $15 million of share repurchases and invested $1 million in our venture portfolio. We ended the quarter at a comfortable 1.6 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is well below the top of our target range of 2.5 times and had approximately $1.3 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility. On slide 8, we highlight premium supply chain costs, which have continued to improve from peak levels. The actions we have taken to redesign products, along with the improving freight rates and capacity, have enabled us to reduce component purchases on the spot market and reduce freight cost impact. In Q1, we incurred premium supply chain costs of $15 million, as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, and $53 million lower than the prior year. We are expecting these premium supply chain costs to continue to decline. Let's now turn to our outlook. We continue to see enterprise customers defer large orders and are also realizing lower sales into the channel as distributors adjust to softer demand trends as well as our improved product lead times and their higher cost of capital. For the second quarter, our sales are expected to decline between 9% and 11% compared to the prior year. Our outlook assumes a two-point negative impact from foreign currency changes and a one point additive impact from recent acquisitions. We anticipate Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, driven by expense deleveraging from lower sales volume, partially offset by higher expected gross margin from improved supply chain costs. We expect premium supply chain costs to be approximately $15 million in Q2 and more than $40 million year-on-year reduction. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.40. We are reducing our full year 2023 sales outlook by three points. We now anticipate net sales to decline between 2% and 6%. This outlook assumes an approximately 50 basis point net negative impact from foreign currency changes and acquisitions. Second half sales are expected to benefit from easier year-on-year comparisons, our recently announced price increase, and abating FX headwinds. We have a solid pipeline of opportunities that gets us to the high end of the sales range, but are embedding caution in our outlook, given recent demand trends in the uncertain macro environment. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22%, which is the low end of our previous outlook. We now expect premium supply chain costs of approximately $40 million for the year, as we are seeing faster-than-expected supply chain recovery. We have been proactively managing operating expenses through targeted restructuring actions and discretionary cost controls, and we expect sequentially lower operating expenses in the second half of the year. We now expect our free cash flow to be between $450 million and $550 million for the year, which reflects increased caution in our revised full year outlook. As a reminder, cash flow is impacted by increased cash taxes and $180 million of previously announced settlement payments. We continue to be focused on rightsizing elevated inventory on our balance sheet as component lead-times have normalized. Working capital variability over the past year has been significantly impacted by global supply chain dynamics. Our fundamental business model is unchanged and we believe the actions we are taking will enable us to deliver greater than 100% free cash flow conversion as we normalize inventory levels. We are focused on achieving a 100% conversion over a cycle, which is now included in our long-term executive incentive compensation plan. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on slide nine. With that, I will turn the call to Bill to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision.\nBill Burns: Thank you, Nathan. While customer spend is pressured near-term, our solutions are essential to our customers' operations, and we are well-positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows across our served markets. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software, and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, including scarcity of labor and improving productivity in challenging times. We empower the workforce to execute tasks more efficiently by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and prescriptive analytics. Now, turning to slide 12. We are focused on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision by continuing to elevate Zebra, as a premier solutions provider through our compelling portfolio. In March, at the ProMat manufacturing and supply chain trade show, Zebra, along with our partners, showcased the depth and breadth of our innovative solutions for manufacturing, logistics and the broader supply chain. Our industrial automation solutions, including autonomous mobile robots, machine vision and fixed industrial scanning, are synergistic with technology-equipped frontline workers. At the show, we featured Zebra solutions at each stage of warehouse operations, including receiving, storage and fulfillment. It demonstrated how we improve key outcomes for our customers, such as enhancing supply chain agility, improving production quality and maximizing utilization and productivity. As you can see on slide 13, Zebra powers the front line of business across retail and e-commerce, transportation logistics, manufacturing, health care and other markets. Businesses partnered with Zebra to optimize their end-to-end workflows, as they strive to meet the increasing demands of customers across a variety of vertical end markets. The business challenges we are solving have expanded through our investment in complementary offerings that enable us to further penetrate customer accounts. I would like to highlight several wins across our end markets. We are beginning to deploy the record RFID win, we mentioned on our last call. This global transportation logistics provider plans to tag every package that enters their facilities with RFID and coated labels to enhance tracking visibility. Zebra solutions improved productivity, enable faster error detection, driving cost savings and increased customer satisfaction. In addition to our RFID offerings, this customer is also deploying our mobile computers as an integral part of the overall solution. A major e-commerce provider in Europe recently expanded their use case of Zebra's fixed industrial scanners at several thousand packing stations. This enables the customer to continue to significantly reduce scan time and increase throughput, particularly for their more complex packing needs. The support and collaboration with Zebra and our partner was a key differentiator among our competition. A large Australian supermarket chain has replaced consumer-grade devices with our Zebra rugged tablets and scanners to enable faster and more accurate buy online, pick up in store and home delivery fulfillment. Zebra's enterprise-grade solution, along with our commitment to sustainability, including our recycling program and eco-friendly packaging, were competitive differentiators in securing this win. A Latin American manufacturing company recently selected Zebra mobile computers and mobile printers to help streamline delivery and warehouse operations. Delivery personnel will benefit from synergies between these products, while warehouse employees realize similar efficiencies with Zebra scanners and desktop printers. This manufacturer shows our products for reliability and durability and considers us a strategic partner in their technology journey. A regional bank recently selected our workforce management software for all branch locations, displacing a competitor. Our solution is expected to drive cost savings through more efficient scheduling and allocation of people resources. We are pleased about the benefits our solutions are delivering in our customers' mission-critical operations. Slide 14 reiterates challenges that have materialized since our last guide. We believe the actions we are taking, which include working closely with our customers as they look to deploy solutions to drive efficiency within their businesses, increasing our focus on accelerating growth in underpenetrated markets and driving incremental cost actions within our business will allow us to exit 2023 stronger, positioning us to deliver profitable growth, increased market share and improved free cash flow. In closing, we are facing near-term headwinds and have taken actions to drive a stronger second half. Our long-term conviction in our business is unchanged. Moving forward, we are focused on driving profitable growth in our core and expansion markets, collaborating closely with our customers and partners to continue to elevate Zebra as a premier solutions provider in attracting, developing and retaining top global talent to drive innovation. I will now hand it back to Mike.\nMike Steele: Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please proceed.\nTommy Moll: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions.\nBill Burns: Good morning.\nNathan Winters: Good morning, Tommy.\nTommy Moll: Bill, I wanted to start on the topic of run rate versus large customer demand. It sounds like the run rate business might have been a little bit stronger in Q1, but maybe also got a little weaker towards the end. So any commentary you could give us on one versus the other would be appreciated. And specifically, when you're talking about the potential for channel destocking, is that more a run rate driven phenomenon, or is that not the right way to think about it? Thank you.\nBill Burns: Hey, Tommy, I would say that in the first quarter, our sales growth in -- we saw sales growth in run rate or non-large deals, which moderated towards the end of the quarter. And I would say that if we kind of characterize where we're at today that through the majority of Q1, we saw that our sales opportunities were developing as we had expected, and it allowed us to deliver on our first quarter guide. And I think that as we got later into the quarter towards the end of Q1 and into April, while our run rate continued to be strong in the first quarter, we saw that begin to moderate. But the real challenge has been around large customers and really tightening their CapEx budgets further as we got to the second -- the end of Q1 and into Q2. And we saw new projects not receiving the funding that our sales teams had expected in the near-term. So we saw a number of projects really in our sales funnel that were planned for Q2 and early Q3, really become deferred. And we especially saw this in retail and again, in specifically in North America and EMEA. So that ultimately, that slowing demand of larger deals and overall, a bit of moderating of our run rate, has really impacted our distributors that are looking to adjust their working capital levels that -- to really these -- the slowing demand of large deals and some of the moderating of run rate, we've also seen our lead times improve. So our distributors are having to hold less inventory as our lead times improve. And of course, they've got an increase in cost of capital and holding costs as they adjust their days on hand to the right level. So overall, these pressures really led us to say, hey, our Q2 guiding that down further and then ultimately look at the full year is despite run rate being strong in first quarter, we saw it moderate. And large deals are really in large customers, specifically around retail in EMEA and North America are really driving our guide for the full year.\nTommy Moll: Just to continue with that theme, Bill, as you mentioned, some of the incremental weakness that drove your revision to the full year outlook really didn't manifest until late first quarter into the second quarter, it sounds like. Nonetheless, the outlook does imply a fairly healthy improvement in terms of revenue in the second half versus the first half. At this point, though, how much visibility do you have there? It feels like some of these conversations, particularly on a large customer side may still be early with a lot of question marks. But if I'm wrong in that characterization, please let me know. Thank you.\nNathan Winters: Yeah, Tommy, this is Nathan. And then just a little color on the full year guide. So if you look for the full year down 3.5% on organic sales in the midpoint, as we said in the prepared remarks, we do have a pipeline of opportunities and actions to get to the high end of the range, how we're being cautious in the assumptions and what we expect out of the pipeline due to the uncertain macro environment, and the cautious behavior we're seeing. I think the other thing that's important to note is as we go into the second half, we have easier year-on-year comps, particularly in Q3 as well as we have the recently announced price increases that will benefit in the second half as well as a favorable FX from our last guide, helping offset some of the macro headwinds. So all those factors, a lot of factors played into some of the first half or second half dynamic, as well as what we believe we've taken a conservative view at the pipeline and actions we have as we look at the second half guide.\nTommy Moll: Thank you both. I\u2019ll turn it back.\nOperator: The next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please proceed.\nDamian Karas: Hey, good morning, everyone. I have a follow up\u2026\nBill Burns: Good morning.\nNathan Winters: Good morning, Damian.\nDamian Karas: Morning. Just a follow-up question on your comments, Bill, about some of these project deferrals. Just for clarification, right, are we talking about the same kind of select handful of large customers, North America retail and EMEA retail, or are there additional large customers that are mimicking these behavior or just kind of a combination of both of those factors? I'm curious if thinking about kind of future execution and delivery, do you have any kind of sense on time line on that, or are they just kind of on pause for the moment?\nBill Burns: Yeah. I think maybe it's worth covering the vertical markets as we -- and what we saw in Q1. So predominantly retail, I would say that from a T&L perspective, we continue to see customers invest in visibility and productivity solutions. And Transportation & Logistics was up in Q1. In Q1, we also saw strong growth across manufacturing as they continue to invest in industrial automation and productivity within manufacturing. And healthcare also continued to be strong. So it really was around -- on retail. And those customers, ultimately not all retail customers, but a significant number of those across EMEA and North America had pushed out projects that were in our sales funnel for Q2 and Q3 out. And I think that ultimately, as Nathan said, allowed us to take or drove us to take a more conservative view of the funnel and pipeline for second half year. And maybe Joe wants to comment more on that.\nJoe Heel: Sure. So Damian, I wanted to underline one thing first, and then maybe I'll give you some examples because I thought you might -- someone might ask these questions. I put together a few examples to illustrate what we're seeing. I want to underscore that by and large, we're not seeing cancellations from these large customers. We're seeing deferrals of the decision and, in some cases, deferrals of the deployment. And the majority of those deferrals are to the second half of this year, to Q3 and Q4, which goes in part also to Tommy's earlier question about what confidence do we have, right? That's where we're seeing in most of those push. I'll give you two examples. One of our large US customers in the retail space, by the time we last spoke here in the first quarter, had ordered about $3 million from us. And they had told us that they were going to be ordering by the end of Q2, an additional $20 million. Since then, in the last three months, they've taken $6 million and said we're still going to order that in Q2, but we still don't have the purchase order yet. They're still trying to secure the budget for it. They have $10 million that they moved to Q3 and another $4 million that they moved to Q4. At least that's what they've told us so far. Of course, to your point about the visibility, will they actually order it then? We will see. But that's the current state of what we know and what's changed since we last spoke. Another even larger customer in the US, also a retailer, had ordered $5 million by the time we were speaking last year in February, and had indicated that they were planning to buy $35 million by the end of Q2. Since then, they have said $11 million of that we're going to order in Q3. And $24 million, we will not have budget for this year, but we plan to order it in 2024. So that gives you an idea of how things are moving and how these deferrals are happening, hopefully.\nNathan Winters: I think just one thing to add, that's both -- those are two good examples of the decline for the overall year and the full year guide. But at the same token, while we have a pipeline and actions that are above -- towards the high end of the range, but yet being conservative on assuming all those deals won't get pushed further. So I think that's the -- trying to find the balance there around what we're hearing from our customers and the visibility, with also understanding that it's not certain until we get the PO.\nDamian Karas: Understood. Appreciate that color. I also wanted to ask you about your margin guidance. It seems you're actually expecting higher gross margins than previously. So is that the case? And could you maybe walk through the changes underlying your margin guidance for the year? Thank you.\nNathan Winters: Yes. So look, our full year EBITDA guide of 22%, that was the low end of our prior range. We are seeing favorable gross margin trends, but that's being offset by the lower volume. So again, if you look at an aggregate, nearly one point higher than last year, primarily due to the supply chain improvements. And you can see it from our versus our prior guide of reducing those transitory or premium supply chain costs for the year from 50% to 40% as both the freight rates improved, and we're having to buy less components on the spot market. And that's still being offset. Those two points improvement are being offset by about one point of FX. Despite the improvement in FX with our hedging program, there's still a headwind for the year on FX. And again, I think a couple of things. The pricing actions we've taken over the past 1.5 years are offsetting the material and labor cost inflation or recouping some of that degradation over the past year, and we have actions identified to adjust our cost structure with the lower volume.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please proceed.\nJim Ricchiuti: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to drill down a little bit more, if I can, on the deferrals. And you may have mentioned this, and I apologize if you did. But are the deferrals that you're seeing, are they skewed more in North America, or are you seeing that same kind of level of deferrals in EMEA?\nBill Burns: Yes. I would say, Jim, it's really both. And again, it's centered predominantly around retail. We believe ultimately have seen some moderation of demand in the other vertical markets, T&L and manufacturing, but it's predominantly retail and it's predominantly North America and EMEA. And I think it's Important, as Joe said, to say that these projects haven't been canceled, and our customers still have conviction about the value we ultimately deliver to them around improve productivity, increased visibility across supply chains, more effective and efficient operations within retail. All those are important because these projects, while they're moving out are still -- have strong return on investments for our customers. They're making tough decisions around CapEx in the short-term to adjust in a macroeconomic environment. But what they're telling us is that as their CapEx loosens up inside their organizations, they expect to move ahead with these projects. And the challenge in retail is because we've seen them continue to move out, we've had to take a conservative view of the outlook. And as Joe said, some of those projects have moved into 2024. But our customers are still committed to do those. So I think that we're seeing that, ultimately, our customers can only hold off from buying for so long, that we have mission-critical solutions. And they truly deliver value to our customers that make them more effective and more efficient in their business each and every day. And I think we feel that, ultimately, they are going to buy these projects and they're going to move forward. It's really an issue around timing and it's really North America and EMEA in retail is the primary challenge at the moment.\nJim Ricchiuti: Got it. And I wanted to just follow up with a question only because you mentioned it several times, the strength in RFID. Is that mainly from this large North American logistics customer, or is this -- are you seeing the strength in other areas of logistics, or is it also a function of what we're seeing and hearing in retail? And is that sustainable as you go through the year? .\nBill Burns: Yes, I would say that we're seeing broad-based demand for RFID across supply chains in general. So, all the way from retail through transportation logistics all the way back into manufacturing, so it is broad-based. We have the broadest and deepest RFID portfolio of solutions of fixed readers, handheld readers, mobile printers, software and solutions as well as our labels. So, we expect that we'll continue to benefit from the strength in RFID. I don't know, Joe, if you want to add anything to that, but I think that we feel good about the RFID portfolio beyond this large win in C&O.\nJoe Heel: We do. And I would underline, Jim, the broad-based nature of this demand. We're seeing it in health care, for example, we're seeing it in T&L, where entire package operations that were previously barcode-based are being driven by RFID now for greater efficiency and fewer errors. And we're seeing it in multiple regions of the world. We're seeing it strong in Asia-Pacific, but also strong in Europe where labor costs are high and RFID can have an outsized impact. This is a broad-based movement.\nJim Ricchiuti: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning guys. In terms of looking at the guidance for the full year, can you kind of help me with some context in terms of how you're thinking about the overall macro economy and how changes in the macro economy may affect your guidance, the good and the bad?\nBill Burns: Yes, I'd say, Keith, that I'll start, and then I'll let Nate or Joe want to jump in. But we're clearly seeing a softer macroeconomic environment that is having our customers take a more conservative view of their CapEx budgets and -- in first half year, and we're seeing less certainty in those budgets for second half year. So, a bit of the unknown, mostly in retail and again, mostly in North America and EMEA where we're seeing this, it's most pronounced there. What it results to for us is directly elongated sales cycles and opportunities that we thought we're going to close in Q2 and be deployed in early Q3 as moving out. And Joe gave the examples of all the business isn't moving out. Some portion of it is doing that, and some is moving into Q3 and Q4 from Q2 and others is moving into 2024. So, we think that ultimately, we've taken a more conservative view of our pipeline and the opportunities we expect to close in second half year. There's lots of reasons why we believe that guide is the right one as Nathan covered. But we also believe that our T&L manufacturing customers, where we saw strong growth in first quarter, even at the end of Q1, we're seeing them moderate a bit due to the macro environment. And we're taking a cautious view overall of what our pipeline and the projects within it because of it. But I think ultimately, we feel good about our business. We feel good about the value we bring to our customers, and this is really all about the macro environment and specifically in -- more pronounced in retail in North America and EMEA.\nKeith Housum: Maybe if I can tweak that question just a little bit. I guess, does your guidance include, I guess, a soft or hard landing in the US and Europe, or do you go look at that context?\nBill Burns: Well, I'd say that we've had a tough Q1 from a mobile computing perspective, with double-digit declines in Q1. We see Q2 continue to be challenged from a mobile computing perspective. But, we saw strong growth in other parts of the portfolio like data capture and print. So I think, overall, what we're seeing is mobile computing remaining challenged in first half. And then in second half, we see some of these projects moving forward and then continuing into 2024. So we don't see the environment being a hard landing or much different than what we're guiding to at the moment, which is we were delivered on our first quarter guide, which ultimately was down. But we see Q2, obviously, we knew it was going to be our toughest quarter, and we see recovery in the second half. But modest, and we believe we can deliver on our guide.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nJoe Giordano: Hey. Good morning, guys. So I'm just curious on -- coming out of COVID, you put in a ton of assets. And I'm just curious on thoughts on the replacement cycle of that. So as we go into a soft patch here, what's the ability of customers to like extend, when they need to refresh this stuff? I'm just curious the deferrals that Joe mentioned, are these like new, new expansions, or is this like refresh of old product that is getting pushed out? Just curious there. Thank you.\nJoe Heel: Yes, why don't I start right away. This is Joe Heel. The investments we've made over the last few years in customer success have given us a really good insight as to what our installed base is and how our customers are using it. And that has generally revealed to us that the usage cycles have shortened, and that the replacements that are being contemplated now are things that have gone in approximately three years ago or even less than that. And of course, we have just launched a brand-new set of our mid-range and high-end mobile computers and the value tier was released last year. So those are coming right into that refresh cycle that we're seeing from those customers. And that's another reason why we're quite confident that while these customers are deferring decisions and deployments as we speak, they will have to purchase shortly. And we have pretty good confidence in that. It's the timing that we're uncertain about.\nJoe Giordano: And then just a follow-up, Nathan, if things do get cyclically worse here, how should we think about risk of, like inventory obsolescence on things that you have on the books, if the channel stays tough, things like that. Thank you.\nNathan Winters: Yes. I would say, there's always a risk in a technology business of excess and obsolescence. That's something the team actively manages in terms of when we put something in -- a lot of that's in our control in terms of the life cycle of a product, when we end of life a component or our finished good. And today, we look and say there's still demand for what we have in inventory on a component level. The team has a series of actions, working with our suppliers to reduce purchase commitments where we can and drive programs where we have available stock with the commercial team. So today, I don't feel -- I think there's -- again, there's always risk given our business model, but I would say nothing more -- not more than we've had in other times.\nJoe Giordano: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. You guys noted the benefit of price increases in the second half. I just wondered, given the macro environment, if there's been any pushback to that or kind of shrinking of the amount of units to kind of keep with the same dollar amount that you've seen in response to that? And then maybe just as a second question. You noted backlog was a benefit to printing, kind of, in Q1. I just wondered, is there any meaningful kind of backlog or pent-up orders kind of across the space that we should be mindful of for the year? Thanks.\nBill Burns: Joe, do you want to take the price increases?\nJoe Heel: Yeah. So Meta, we increased prices last year outside of North America towards the end of the year, and we have increased them in North America here in the first quarter. We have a very analytical approach to doing this where we literally analyze by product and by region where we stand competitively and what economics we can afford for our channel partner's because we want them to thrive. And as a result, we looked at that and we said we have additional headroom in North America, just as we saw that at the end of the year outside of North America. We have implemented those and we have seen generally good traction with those, and they're going to have a meaningful impact in terms of helping us to mitigate the challenges that we outlined earlier.\nNathan Winters: And if you look at the overall backlog position, I'd say it's normalized from where we were over the past several years, in line with what we need to deliver for the second quarter. I think the positive news, both for print and DCS as we've largely worked through our delinquent or aged backlog, as supply has improved, still have some backlog to work through for both of those businesses. But in aggregate, I think we go back more to normalized levels, if not a little bit higher than we were pre-pandemic, but enough to definitely support our 2Q guide.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. Please proceed.\nRob Mason: Yes. Good morning. I had a question just around your thought process on the channel distribution level, I guess, destocking. Is that a process that you think can be complete here in the current quarter, or does that extend into the second half as well?\nNathan Winters: There's a few -- I can take a couple of things, I'll start. One, if you look at our overall inventory, I think in aggregate, remains healthy. However, as we highlighted before, there is our realigning, or aligning their days on hand to say, with the moderating demand as well as the improved lead times in the cost of capital. So we work closely with all the distributors, so they have the appropriate days on hand levels and that is recalibrating to the slower demand. You'll definitely see variations across distributors or regions due to the various dynamics. And that's why we look at it as a range in aggregate. But I'd say, overall, we think those levels are in line with where we were pre-pandemic. But obviously, we think that is definitely an outsized impact in Q2 relative to the rest of the year, as the demand has softened here over the past month or two.\nRob Mason: Does your guide at the midpoint take it down 4%? Does that assume that the run rate business would be down this year also?\nA \u2013 Bill Burns: I think that we've seen moderating, Rob, in the run rate business. We saw it -- in Q1, small to medium deals continue to grow. But as we got later into first quarter, we saw some moderating of that run rate business. So I'd say that we see it moderating. The real challenge seems to be around large customer orders and larger deals and run rate, because we're continuing to see growth in DCS growth across our printing business. We hadn't talked about it, but services and software were positive and delivered growth in first quarter as well. So we continue to see that throughout the year. So there's certainly bright spots. But the challenge isn't as much around run rate, I would say, is really around larger deals and larger customers.\nRob Mason: Understood. Maybe just last question to follow up on that. The -- how do you think about -- again, in a situation like this where deals are being pushed and conservative outlooks on IT budgets, how do you feel about how the adjacent expansion areas perform relative to your core business? Are those at the same level of risk, or how do you view those differently just given different growth dynamics there?\nA \u2013 Bill Burns: Yes, I'll start. And then I'll let Joe jump in. I think as I said, we saw growth in services and software in first quarter. So we continue to see that our software value proposition to our retail customers across Reflexis offering, Prescriptive Analytics, our Antuit. offerings, our Workforce Connect, has value to our retailers. And that falls into really an OpEx spending versus CapEx inside retail. We're seeing that strong interest in in our fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions. As we said, manufacturing continues to be more spending and focused on continuing to drive productivity inside their environment. So we're seeing opportunities there inside fixed industrial scanning, inside T&Ls, another opportunity. Again, we have lots of places where we can grow our market share across both those two segments. And we're seeing that Fetch from autonomous mobile robot and warehouse automation perspective, both fulfillment and material movement, and that applies again to T&L with 3PLs and then manufacturing with good movement, again strong interest there. So those businesses are much smaller, but I think we're continuing to see interest across our customers, and then we have lots of room to grow market share in things like machine vision and fixed industrial schemes.\nJoe Heel: Yes, Rob, I would also point out some of the near adjacencies have been very strong contributors for us, not just in the last quarter, but recently. Tablets, for example, has become our fastest-growing mobile computing category, and we now have a number one market share position in tablets. That's been a terrific contributor. We're seeing those use cases only expand in areas like healthcare in areas like manufacturing that we hadn't even considered initially. And I mentioned earlier, RFID, right? How that's been a broad-based growth driver for us. And by the way, the same is true for what we did in bioptic scanning, where we now have a very strong market position. So those adjacencies that are close to our core have contributed very nicely.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. You may proceed.\nBlake Keating : Hi. Good morning. This is Blake Keating on for Brian.\nBill Burns : Good morning.\nNathan Winters : Good morning.\nBlake Keating : Just wanting to dive a little bit into the second half implied guidance. I know it's already been asked a little bit, but I was curious just to hear outside of retail, what's driving your confidence in that second half revenue guide, if there's any end markets that are really -- that are growing or -- any color you can give there? And then how we should think about that in volume versus price?\nBill Burns : Yes, I would say that across T&L, that our customers continue to struggle with labor constraints and are looking to add to visibility across the supply chain, across their -- your networks. We've seen some positives where T&L customers continue to make investments despite some of the challenges around the macro environment. So two examples of that is our postal win in Japan and the RFID win in North America. T&L show that some large projects and outside of retail are clearly continuing and our customers see the value in our solutions. So I think that T&L manufacturing is another area where we're seeing really investment in that business around industrial automation and opportunities, as I mentioned before, around fixed industrial scanning and machine vision. So they delivered solid growth in Q1. And they continue to invest in infrastructure to be more effective and efficient and productive within both their environments, T&L and manufacturing, and we expect that to continue to grow. But to moderate from the strong growth we saw in Q1 due to macro environments. Health care is -- we saw strong results in Q1, and it's less sensitive and less correlated to the macro environment. So we feel good about health care as well. So I think those are areas that outside of retail that we've taken into account for our second half guide.\nJoe Heel : And so -- and what I would add, Joe Heel here. By and large, we have not seen the deferrals of either project decisions or deployments nearly to the same degree in any of the three verticals Bill mentioned, T&L manufacturing or health care. They've had steady demand. Now we're expecting that some of that may moderate a bit because it was -- they were all up very strongly in Q1. But nevertheless, we expect those will continue to contribute. One other area that we're investing in that we think has some good growth potential is government. We're seeing some -- for reasons that are probably obvious, we're seeing some strong demand in the government sector.\nNathan Winters : And one thing I'd add, just on the second half, I mean for the full year, we're expecting about 1.5 of benefit in price, including the most recent announcement. And I think I'll just get back. If you look at the second half, the implied guide around minus 2% again. But on much easier comps, if you look at just the trajectory of the business last year and the first half growth versus second half as well as the favorable FX impact. So those are, again, some different dynamics when you look at the first half versus second half for the year.\nBlake Keating : Got it. Thank you. And then just lastly, on the Matrox acquisition, I was just curious how the business is trending and how we should think about it moving forward?\nBill Burns: Yes. I think, I would say, overall, with the Matrox acquisition and Adaptive Vision, that it really creates a comprehensive portfolio of solutions across fixed industrial scanning and machine vision. So we marry our organic investment plus the acquisition of Matrox and Adaptive Vision to the portfolio. It really is what our customers and partners were looking for is to -- some of our customers are just beginning their automation journey. Others are -- have increased complex, use cases that they're trying to deploy solutions and they're looking for a provider, both our channel partners and our end customers that can provide the breadth and depth of that solution from hardware to software. From a Matrox perspective, specifically, we've seen continued progress. It's performed as expected, and the integration is proceeding as planned. We're looking to diversify our customer base there and really continue to grow the top line of that business. And that means that how do we extend our channel network and our partner community; we're working on expanding that. We're focusing on manufacturing opportunities. Examples could be automotive or battery manufacturing are two areas in which we see opportunities for us. And then, ultimately, leveraging the synergies, I said, across the two acquisitions in our organic portfolio. We're seeing strong interest from our customer base. We were just at ProMat manufacturing and supply chain trade show, and we saw strong interest from our customers. So we feel good about where we're at with Matrox and the opportunities we have ahead of us for machine vision and fixed industrial scanning.\nBlake Keating: Got it. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it along.\nOperator: Today's last question comes from Guy Hardwick with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nGuy Hardwick: Hi. Good morning.\nBill Burns: Hi. Good morning.\nGuy Hardwick: I think, three months ago, you guys said on the Q4 call that channel inventories were only a few days higher than pre-pandemic levels. But, I think, Nathan said in answer to Rob's question that channel inventories are now back to pre-pandemic levels. Did I hear that correctly? First of all. And it sounds like in your prepared remarks that Q2 guidance in particular assumes further destocking. So based on your Q2 guidance, can you quantify what the difference could be between sell-in and sell-out in Q2?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So, I think, again, just sort of maybe clarify the comment in terms of -- we look at it in terms of an absolute range. So, I think, we're still in that same range we were in from a pre-pandemic, no different than we were in Q4, maybe just a little bit on the higher end. And so, we don't have a sales out to sales in reconciliation. I would say that, historically, when the velocity of the channel slows, we see an outsized impact as the distis moderate and manage their days on hand. So if they're selling over sales out of the channel that requires less inventory to support that, which means they're not going to make the same type of stocking orders. So it has an outsized impact on what we see from a sales end. So there's always a disconnect there based on, as you see the markets improve or decline. I think in Q2, that's amplified a bit by the improving lead times and their higher carrying costs. And I would just say, the opposite is true when the macro improves, we tend to see an accelerated recovery. But, again, that's not assumed in our full year guide.\nGuy Hardwick: So there is an assumption of destocking in Q2. So it suggests that underlying demand is better than your sales guidance you gave.\nNathan Winters: That's right. As you would expect, if you have lower sales out of the channel that requires less inventory in the channel to support that business.\nGuy Hardwick: So Nathan, last question for me. Just what is your FX assumption? FX rate assumption for the full -- rest of the year?\nNathan Winters: Yes, we take the spot market as we put the guide together. So sitting around whatever, just around $1.09 to $1.10 to the euro. .\nGuy Hardwick: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Burns for any closing remarks.\nBill Burns: Yes, I'd like to thank our partners, customers and employees for their support and dedication in this challenging in a certain environment. It's an honor to serve as CEO, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Thank you. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Heel",
            "content": "Sure. So Damian, I wanted to underline one thing first, and then maybe I'll give you some examples because I thought you might -- someone might ask these questions. I put together a few examples to illustrate what we're seeing. I want to underscore that by and large, we're not seeing cancellations from these large customers. We're seeing deferrals of the decision and, in some cases, deferrals of the deployment. And the majority of those deferrals are to the second half of this year, to Q3 and Q4, which goes in part also to Tommy's earlier question about what confidence do we have, right? That's where we're seeing in most of those push. I'll give you two examples. One of our large US customers in the retail space, by the time we last spoke here in the first quarter, had ordered about $3 million from us. And they had told us that they were going to be ordering by the end of Q2, an additional $20 million. Since then, in the last three months, they've taken $6 million and said we're still going to order that in Q2, but we still don't have the purchase order yet. They're still trying to secure the budget for it. They have $10 million that they moved to Q3 and another $4 million that they moved to Q4. At least that's what they've told us so far. Of course, to your point about the visibility, will they actually order it then? We will see. But that's the current state of what we know and what's changed since we last spoke. Another even larger customer in the US, also a retailer, had ordered $5 million by the time we were speaking last year in February, and had indicated that they were planning to buy $35 million by the end of Q2. Since then, they have said $11 million of that we're going to order in Q3. And $24 million, we will not have budget for this year, but we plan to order it in 2024. So that gives you an idea of how things are moving and how these deferrals are happening, hopefully. We do. And I would underline, Jim, the broad-based nature of this demand. We're seeing it in health care, for example, we're seeing it in T&L, where entire package operations that were previously barcode-based are being driven by RFID now for greater efficiency and fewer errors. And we're seeing it in multiple regions of the world. We're seeing it strong in Asia-Pacific, but also strong in Europe where labor costs are high and RFID can have an outsized impact.

            "name": "Bill Burns",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Our team executed well in a challenging macroeconomic environment, delivering first quarter sales and earnings results above the midpoint of our outlook. For the quarter, we realized sales of $1.4 billion approximately in line with the prior year; and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4%, a 150 basis point increase; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.94, a 2% decrease from the prior year. Regional sales performance was mixed with growth in Asia Pac and North America mostly offsetting declines in EMEA and Latin America. From a solutions perspective, printing, data capture and RFID were bright spots, while sales of mobile computers declined. We continue to see cautious spending behavior by enterprise customers with a decline in large orders and growth in small to midsized orders. From a profitability perspective, improved gross margin drove our EBITDA margin increase. Higher interest and tax expense resulted in a slight earnings decline. I would now like to spend a moment on our sales outlook. As the risk of broader softening of industry demand has materialized, we have reduced our full year outlook. Late in Q1 and into Q2, demand trends softened across our end markets, particularly for mobile computers in EMEA and North America as customers' CapEx budgets tightened and IT device spending contracts. We are mitigating the impact of softer sales with targeted go-to-market actions to drive additional demand and incremental cost actions. We will continue to take an agile approach to managing throughout this uncertain near-term environment. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q1 financial results and provide additional details on our revised 2023 outlook. Thank you, Nathan. While customer spend is pressured near-term, our solutions are essential to our customers' operations, and we are well-positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows across our served markets. Slide 11 illustrates how we digitize the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software, and services. By transforming workflows with our proven solutions, Zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, including scarcity of labor and improving productivity in challenging times. We empower the workforce to execute tasks more efficiently by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and prescriptive analytics. Now, turning to slide 12. We are focused on advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision by continuing to elevate Zebra, as a premier solutions provider through our compelling portfolio. In March, at the ProMat manufacturing and supply chain trade show, Zebra, along with our partners, showcased the depth and breadth of our innovative solutions for manufacturing, logistics and the broader supply chain. Our industrial automation solutions, including autonomous mobile robots, machine vision and fixed industrial scanning, are synergistic with technology-equipped frontline workers. At the show, we featured Zebra solutions at each stage of warehouse operations, including receiving, storage and fulfillment. It demonstrated how we improve key outcomes for our customers, such as enhancing supply chain agility, improving production quality and maximizing utilization and productivity. As you can see on slide 13, Zebra powers the front line of business across retail and e-commerce, transportation logistics, manufacturing, health care and other markets. Businesses partnered with Zebra to optimize their end-to-end workflows, as they strive to meet the increasing demands of customers across a variety of vertical end markets. The business challenges we are solving have expanded through our investment in complementary offerings that enable us to further penetrate customer accounts. I would like to highlight several wins across our end markets. We are beginning to deploy the record RFID win, we mentioned on our last call. This global transportation logistics provider plans to tag every package that enters their facilities with RFID and coated labels to enhance tracking visibility. Zebra solutions improved productivity, enable faster error detection, driving cost savings and increased customer satisfaction. In addition to our RFID offerings, this customer is also deploying our mobile computers as an integral part of the overall solution. A major e-commerce provider in Europe recently expanded their use case of Zebra's fixed industrial scanners at several thousand packing stations. This enables the customer to continue to significantly reduce scan time and increase throughput, particularly for their more complex packing needs. The support and collaboration with Zebra and our partner was a key differentiator among our competition. A large Australian supermarket chain has replaced consumer-grade devices with our Zebra rugged tablets and scanners to enable faster and more accurate buy online, pick up in store and home delivery fulfillment. Zebra's enterprise-grade solution, along with our commitment to sustainability, including our recycling program and eco-friendly packaging, were competitive differentiators in securing this win. A Latin American manufacturing company recently selected Zebra mobile computers and mobile printers to help streamline delivery and warehouse operations. Delivery personnel will benefit from synergies between these products, while warehouse employees realize similar efficiencies with Zebra scanners and desktop printers. This manufacturer shows our products for reliability and durability and considers us a strategic partner in their technology journey. A regional bank recently selected our workforce management software for all branch locations, displacing a competitor. Our solution is expected to drive cost savings through more efficient scheduling and allocation of people resources. We are pleased about the benefits our solutions are delivering in our customers' mission-critical operations. Slide 14 reiterates challenges that have materialized since our last guide. We believe the actions we are taking, which include working closely with our customers as they look to deploy solutions to drive efficiency within their businesses, increasing our focus on accelerating growth in underpenetrated markets and driving incremental cost actions within our business will allow us to exit 2023 stronger, positioning us to deliver profitable growth, increased market share and improved free cash flow. In closing, we are facing near-term headwinds and have taken actions to drive a stronger second half. Our long-term conviction in our business is unchanged. Moving forward, we are focused on driving profitable growth in our core and expansion markets, collaborating closely with our customers and partners to continue to elevate Zebra as a premier solutions provider in attracting, developing and retaining top global talent to drive innovation. I will now hand it back to Mike. Good morning. Hey, Tommy, I would say that in the first quarter, our sales growth in -- we saw sales growth in run rate or non-large deals, which moderated towards the end of the quarter. And I would say that if we kind of characterize where we're at today that through the majority of Q1, we saw that our sales opportunities were developing as we had expected, and it allowed us to deliver on our first quarter guide. And I think that as we got later into the quarter towards the end of Q1 and into April, while our run rate continued to be strong in the first quarter, we saw that begin to moderate. But the real challenge has been around large customers and really tightening their CapEx budgets further as we got to the second -- the end of Q1 and into Q2. And we saw new projects not receiving the funding that our sales teams had expected in the near-term. So we saw a number of projects really in our sales funnel that were planned for Q2 and early Q3, really become deferred. And we especially saw this in retail and again, in specifically in North America and EMEA. So that ultimately, that slowing demand of larger deals and overall, a bit of moderating of our run rate, has really impacted our distributors that are looking to adjust their working capital levels that -- to really these -- the slowing demand of large deals and some of the moderating of run rate, we've also seen our lead times improve. So our distributors are having to hold less inventory as our lead times improve. And of course, they've got an increase in cost of capital and holding costs as they adjust their days on hand to the right level. So overall, these pressures really led us to say, hey, our Q2 guiding that down further and then ultimately look at the full year is despite run rate being strong in first quarter, we saw it moderate. And large deals are really in large customers, specifically around retail in EMEA and North America are really driving our guide for the full year. Good morning. Yeah. I think maybe it's worth covering the vertical markets as we -- and what we saw in Q1. So predominantly retail, I would say that from a T&L perspective, we continue to see customers invest in visibility and productivity solutions. And Transportation & Logistics was up in Q1. In Q1, we also saw strong growth across manufacturing as they continue to invest in industrial automation and productivity within manufacturing. And healthcare also continued to be strong. So it really was around -- on retail. And those customers, ultimately not all retail customers, but a significant number of those across EMEA and North America had pushed out projects that were in our sales funnel for Q2 and Q3 out. And I think that ultimately, as Nathan said, allowed us to take or drove us to take a more conservative view of the funnel and pipeline for second half year. And maybe Joe wants to comment more on that. Yes. I would say, Jim, it's really both. And again, it's centered predominantly around retail. We believe ultimately have seen some moderation of demand in the other vertical markets, T&L and manufacturing, but it's predominantly retail and it's predominantly North America and EMEA. And I think it's Important, as Joe said, to say that these projects haven't been canceled, and our customers still have conviction about the value we ultimately deliver to them around improve productivity, increased visibility across supply chains, more effective and efficient operations within retail. All those are important because these projects, while they're moving out are still -- have strong return on investments for our customers. They're making tough decisions around CapEx in the short-term to adjust in a macroeconomic environment. But what they're telling us is that as their CapEx loosens up inside their organizations, they expect to move ahead with these projects. And the challenge in retail is because we've seen them continue to move out, we've had to take a conservative view of the outlook. And as Joe said, some of those projects have moved into 2024. But our customers are still committed to do those. So I think that we're seeing that, ultimately, our customers can only hold off from buying for so long, that we have mission-critical solutions. And they truly deliver value to our customers that make them more effective and more efficient in their business each and every day. And I think we feel that, ultimately, they are going to buy these projects and they're going to move forward. It's really an issue around timing and it's really North America and EMEA in retail is the primary challenge at the moment. Yes, I would say that we're seeing broad-based demand for RFID across supply chains in general. So, all the way from retail through transportation logistics all the way back into manufacturing, so it is broad-based. We have the broadest and deepest RFID portfolio of solutions of fixed readers, handheld readers, mobile printers, software and solutions as well as our labels. So, we expect that we'll continue to benefit from the strength in RFID. I don't know, Joe, if you want to add anything to that, but I think that we feel good about the RFID portfolio beyond this large win in C&O. Yes, I'd say, Keith, that I'll start, and then I'll let Nate or Joe want to jump in. But we're clearly seeing a softer macroeconomic environment that is having our customers take a more conservative view of their CapEx budgets and -- in first half year, and we're seeing less certainty in those budgets for second half year. So, a bit of the unknown, mostly in retail and again, mostly in North America and EMEA where we're seeing this, it's most pronounced there. What it results to for us is directly elongated sales cycles and opportunities that we thought we're going to close in Q2 and be deployed in early Q3 as moving out. And Joe gave the examples of all the business isn't moving out. Some portion of it is doing that, and some is moving into Q3 and Q4 from Q2 and others is moving into 2024. So, we think that ultimately, we've taken a more conservative view of our pipeline and the opportunities we expect to close in second half year. There's lots of reasons why we believe that guide is the right one as Nathan covered. But we also believe that our T&L manufacturing customers, where we saw strong growth in first quarter, even at the end of Q1, we're seeing them moderate a bit due to the macro environment. And we're taking a cautious view overall of what our pipeline and the projects within it because of it. But I think ultimately, we feel good about our business. We feel good about the value we bring to our customers, and this is really all about the macro environment and specifically in -- more pronounced in retail in North America and EMEA. Well, I'd say that we've had a tough Q1 from a mobile computing perspective, with double-digit declines in Q1. We see Q2 continue to be challenged from a mobile computing perspective. But, we saw strong growth in other parts of the portfolio like data capture and print. So I think, overall, what we're seeing is mobile computing remaining challenged in first half. And then in second half, we see some of these projects moving forward and then continuing into 2024. So we don't see the environment being a hard landing or much different than what we're guiding to at the moment, which is we were delivered on our first quarter guide, which ultimately was down. But we see Q2, obviously, we knew it was going to be our toughest quarter, and we see recovery in the second half. But modest, and we believe we can deliver on our guide. Joe, do you want to take the price increases? Good morning. Yes, I would say that across T&L, that our customers continue to struggle with labor constraints and are looking to add to visibility across the supply chain, across their -- your networks. We've seen some positives where T&L customers continue to make investments despite some of the challenges around the macro environment. So two examples of that is our postal win in Japan and the RFID win in North America. T&L show that some large projects and outside of retail are clearly continuing and our customers see the value in our solutions. So I think that T&L manufacturing is another area where we're seeing really investment in that business around industrial automation and opportunities, as I mentioned before, around fixed industrial scanning and machine vision. So they delivered solid growth in Q1. And they continue to invest in infrastructure to be more effective and efficient and productive within both their environments, T&L and manufacturing, and we expect that to continue to grow. But to moderate from the strong growth we saw in Q1 due to macro environments. Health care is -- we saw strong results in Q1, and it's less sensitive and less correlated to the macro environment. So we feel good about health care as well. So I think those are areas that outside of retail that we've taken into account for our second half guide. Yes. I think, I would say, overall, with the Matrox acquisition and Adaptive Vision, that it really creates a comprehensive portfolio of solutions across fixed industrial scanning and machine vision. So we marry our organic investment plus the acquisition of Matrox and Adaptive Vision to the portfolio. It really is what our customers and partners were looking for is to -- some of our customers are just beginning their automation journey. Others are -- have increased complex, use cases that they're trying to deploy solutions and they're looking for a provider, both our channel partners and our end customers that can provide the breadth and depth of that solution from hardware to software. From a Matrox perspective, specifically, we've seen continued progress. It's performed as expected, and the integration is proceeding as planned. We're looking to diversify our customer base there and really continue to grow the top line of that business. And that means that how do we extend our channel network and our partner community; we're working on expanding that. We're focusing on manufacturing opportunities. Examples could be automotive or battery manufacturing are two areas in which we see opportunities for us. And then, ultimately, leveraging the synergies, I said, across the two acquisitions in our organic portfolio. We're seeing strong interest from our customer base. We were just at ProMat manufacturing and supply chain trade show, and we saw strong interest from our customers. So we feel good about where we're at with Matrox and the opportunities we have ahead of us for machine vision and fixed industrial scanning. Hi. Good morning. Yes, I'd like to thank our partners, customers and employees for their support and dedication in this challenging in a certain environment. It's an honor to serve as CEO, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Thank you. Have a great day."

            "name": "Nathan Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on slide 6. In Q1, net sales decreased 1.9%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and were 0.3% lower on an organic basis. Our Asset Intelligence and Tracking segment increased 28.4%, led by strength in printing as we lapped significant supply constraints in the prior year period. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 11.2%, with mixed performance among our offerings. We realized strong growth in data capture solutions and RFID. Mobile computing sales declined, primarily due to large customer order deferrals, slowing demand through distribution, and the impact of ceasing sales to Russia in March of 2022. Additionally, we also drove growth across Service and Software with strong service attach rates. Performance was mixed across our regions. North America sales increased 1%, due to strength in printing and data capture, helped by the recovery from supply chain challenges. EMEA sales declined 4%, primarily due to a 350 basis point impact of our suspension of sales into Russia. Asia Pacific sales grew 6%, driven by strong mobile computing growth in Japan. And Latin America sales decreased 1%, with relative outperformance in Brazil and Mexico. Adjusted gross margin increased 290 basis points to 47.5%, primarily due to lower premium supply chain costs, partially offset by FX and lower service margin. Adjusted operating expenses increased 130 basis points as a percent of sales, primarily due to a return to normalized sales and marketing activity and strategic investments in the business, partially offset by a reduction in G&A expense. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.4%, a 150 basis point increase driven by gross margin expansion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.94, a 1.7% year-over-year decrease due to increased interest expense and a higher tax rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide 7, in Q1, we had negative free cash flow of $92 million, which was unfavorable to the prior year period primarily due to the timing of inventory payments, higher interest cost and cash taxes and $45 million of previously announced quarterly settlement payments, which are scheduled to conclude in Q1 of 2024, all of which was partially offset by favorability in the timing of customer collections, and lower incentive compensation payments. In Q1, we also made $15 million of share repurchases and invested $1 million in our venture portfolio. We ended the quarter at a comfortable 1.6 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is well below the top of our target range of 2.5 times and had approximately $1.3 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility. On slide 8, we highlight premium supply chain costs, which have continued to improve from peak levels. The actions we have taken to redesign products, along with the improving freight rates and capacity, have enabled us to reduce component purchases on the spot market and reduce freight cost impact. In Q1, we incurred premium supply chain costs of $15 million, as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, and $53 million lower than the prior year. We are expecting these premium supply chain costs to continue to decline. Let's now turn to our outlook. We continue to see enterprise customers defer large orders and are also realizing lower sales into the channel as distributors adjust to softer demand trends as well as our improved product lead times and their higher cost of capital. For the second quarter, our sales are expected to decline between 9% and 11% compared to the prior year. Our outlook assumes a two-point negative impact from foreign currency changes and a one point additive impact from recent acquisitions. We anticipate Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 20%, driven by expense deleveraging from lower sales volume, partially offset by higher expected gross margin from improved supply chain costs. We expect premium supply chain costs to be approximately $15 million in Q2 and more than $40 million year-on-year reduction. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.40. We are reducing our full year 2023 sales outlook by three points. We now anticipate net sales to decline between 2% and 6%. This outlook assumes an approximately 50 basis point net negative impact from foreign currency changes and acquisitions. Second half sales are expected to benefit from easier year-on-year comparisons, our recently announced price increase, and abating FX headwinds. We have a solid pipeline of opportunities that gets us to the high end of the sales range, but are embedding caution in our outlook, given recent demand trends in the uncertain macro environment. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22%, which is the low end of our previous outlook. We now expect premium supply chain costs of approximately $40 million for the year, as we are seeing faster-than-expected supply chain recovery. We have been proactively managing operating expenses through targeted restructuring actions and discretionary cost controls, and we expect sequentially lower operating expenses in the second half of the year. We now expect our free cash flow to be between $450 million and $550 million for the year, which reflects increased caution in our revised full year outlook. As a reminder, cash flow is impacted by increased cash taxes and $180 million of previously announced settlement payments. We continue to be focused on rightsizing elevated inventory on our balance sheet as component lead-times have normalized. Working capital variability over the past year has been significantly impacted by global supply chain dynamics. Our fundamental business model is unchanged and we believe the actions we are taking will enable us to deliver greater than 100% free cash flow conversion as we normalize inventory levels. We are focused on achieving a 100% conversion over a cycle, which is now included in our long-term executive incentive compensation plan. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on slide nine. With that, I will turn the call to Bill to discuss how we are advancing our Enterprise Asset Intelligence vision. Good morning, Tommy. Yeah, Tommy, this is Nathan. And then just a little color on the full year guide. So if you look for the full year down 3.5% on organic sales in the midpoint, as we said in the prepared remarks, we do have a pipeline of opportunities and actions to get to the high end of the range, how we're being cautious in the assumptions and what we expect out of the pipeline due to the uncertain macro environment, and the cautious behavior we're seeing. I think the other thing that's important to note is as we go into the second half, we have easier year-on-year comps, particularly in Q3 as well as we have the recently announced price increases that will benefit in the second half as well as a favorable FX from our last guide, helping offset some of the macro headwinds. So all those factors, a lot of factors played into some of the first half or second half dynamic, as well as what we believe we've taken a conservative view at the pipeline and actions we have as we look at the second half guide. Good morning, Damian. I think just one thing to add, that's both -- those are two good examples of the decline for the overall year and the full year guide. But at the same token, while we have a pipeline and actions that are above -- towards the high end of the range, but yet being conservative on assuming all those deals won't get pushed further. So I think that's the -- trying to find the balance there around what we're hearing from our customers and the visibility, with also understanding that it's not certain until we get the PO. Yes. So look, our full year EBITDA guide of 22%, that was the low end of our prior range. We are seeing favorable gross margin trends, but that's being offset by the lower volume. So again, if you look at an aggregate, nearly one point higher than last year, primarily due to the supply chain improvements. And you can see it from our versus our prior guide of reducing those transitory or premium supply chain costs for the year from 50% to 40% as both the freight rates improved, and we're having to buy less components on the spot market. And that's still being offset. Those two points improvement are being offset by about one point of FX. Despite the improvement in FX with our hedging program, there's still a headwind for the year on FX. And again, I think a couple of things. The pricing actions we've taken over the past 1.5 years are offsetting the material and labor cost inflation or recouping some of that degradation over the past year, and we have actions identified to adjust our cost structure with the lower volume. Yes. I would say, there's always a risk in a technology business of excess and obsolescence. That's something the team actively manages in terms of when we put something in -- a lot of that's in our control in terms of the life cycle of a product, when we end of life a component or our finished good. And today, we look and say there's still demand for what we have in inventory on a component level. The team has a series of actions, working with our suppliers to reduce purchase commitments where we can and drive programs where we have available stock with the commercial team. So today, I don't feel -- I think there's -- again, there's always risk given our business model, but I would say nothing more -- not more than we've had in other times. And if you look at the overall backlog position, I'd say it's normalized from where we were over the past several years, in line with what we need to deliver for the second quarter. I think the positive news, both for print and DCS as we've largely worked through our delinquent or aged backlog, as supply has improved, still have some backlog to work through for both of those businesses. But in aggregate, I think we go back more to normalized levels, if not a little bit higher than we were pre-pandemic, but enough to definitely support our 2Q guide. There's a few -- I can take a couple of things, I'll start. One, if you look at our overall inventory, I think in aggregate, remains healthy. However, as we highlighted before, there is our realigning, or aligning their days on hand to say, with the moderating demand as well as the improved lead times in the cost of capital. So we work closely with all the distributors, so they have the appropriate days on hand levels and that is recalibrating to the slower demand. You'll definitely see variations across distributors or regions due to the various dynamics. And that's why we look at it as a range in aggregate. But I'd say, overall, we think those levels are in line with where we were pre-pandemic. But obviously, we think that is definitely an outsized impact in Q2 relative to the rest of the year, as the demand has softened here over the past month or two. Good morning. And one thing I'd add, just on the second half, I mean for the full year, we're expecting about 1.5 of benefit in price, including the most recent announcement. And I think I'll just get back. If you look at the second half, the implied guide around minus 2% again. But on much easier comps, if you look at just the trajectory of the business last year and the first half growth versus second half as well as the favorable FX impact. So those are, again, some different dynamics when you look at the first half versus second half for the year. Yes. So, I think, again, just sort of maybe clarify the comment in terms of -- we look at it in terms of an absolute range. So, I think, we're still in that same range we were in from a pre-pandemic, no different than we were in Q4, maybe just a little bit on the higher end. And so, we don't have a sales out to sales in reconciliation. I would say that, historically, when the velocity of the channel slows, we see an outsized impact as the distis moderate and manage their days on hand. So if they're selling over sales out of the channel that requires less inventory to support that, which means they're not going to make the same type of stocking orders. So it has an outsized impact on what we see from a sales end. So there's always a disconnect there based on, as you see the markets improve or decline. I think in Q2, that's amplified a bit by the improving lead times and their higher carrying costs. And I would just say, the opposite is true when the macro improves, we tend to see an accelerated recovery. But, again, that's not assumed in our full year guide. That's right. As you would expect, if you have lower sales out of the channel that requires less inventory in the channel to support that business. Yes, we take the spot market as we put the guide together. So sitting around whatever, just around $1.09 to $1.10 to the euro. ."

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Steele: Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's third quarter earnings conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially, and we refer you to the factors discussed on our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales performance are year-on-year and on a constant currency basis. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Bill Burns, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill will begin with a discussion of our third quarter results. Nathan will then provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our fourth quarter and revised full year outlook. Bill will conclude with progress on advancing our strategic priorities. Following the prepared remarks, Bill and Nathan will take your questions. Now, let's turn to Slide 4, as I hand it over to Bill.\nBill Burns: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Our teams executed well in the third quarter delivering sales and earnings results above the high end of our outlook. For the quarter, we realized sales of almost $1.3 billion, a 31% increase compared to the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4%, a 980 basis point increase. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.49, which was 4x the prior year and delivered strong free cash flow. As we discussed on our last earnings call, during the second quarter, we began to see early signs of recovery across our end markets with mobile computing returning to growth. In the third quarter, we were encouraged to see the recovery broadened with data capture and printing also returning to growth. We realized double-digit growth across all our primary end markets and broad-based growth to customers of all sizes as began to cycle significant destocking activity in the second half of last year. We are seeing indications of customer spend generally improving in the second half, including expectations for higher year-end spending in North America and EMEA across most end markets. That said the manufacturing sector is still lagging as the goods economy continues to recover. Additionally, as we look ahead to 2025, visibility remains limited regarding the timing of large deployments. Another highlight was our improved profitability, primarily due to improved gross margin driven by volume, leverage, and business mix. With the recent consolidation of our North American distribution centers into a single Chicago area facility, we have successfully completed our restructuring actions to deliver $120 million of net annualized operating savings. Given our third quarter performance, improved momentum in demand recovery, and our focus on profitable growth, we are raising our full year outlook for sales, profitability, and free cash flow. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q3 financial results and discuss our revised 2024 outlook.\nNathan Winters: Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q3, total company sales grew 30.6% reflecting continued recovery in demand across our major product categories. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment grew 25.8%, primarily driven by printing and RFID. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 33% with strong growth in mobile computing and data capture solutions. Our services and software recurring revenue businesses grew 4% in the quarter. We realized double-digit sales growth across our regions. In North America, sales grew 22%, led by mobile computing and printing. EMEA sales grew 47% with strength in Northern Europe. Asia-Pacific sales grew 24% led by momentum in Southeast Asia and India along with stabilization in China. And sales grew 42% in Latin America with particular strength in Mexico and Brazil. Adjusted gross margin increased 430 basis points to 49.1% due to volume leverage and favorable business mix and adjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales improved by 580 basis points. This resulted in third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4%, a 980 basis point increase versus the prior year and a 90 basis point sequential improvement from Q2. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.49, a greater than 300% year-over-year increase. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. In the first nine months of 2024, we generated more than $650 million of free cash flow as EBITDA improved and we continue to drive significant improvements in working capital. We ended the quarter at a 1.6x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is within our target range. We resumed share repurchase activity in Q3 and now have increased flexibility given our improved cash flow, lower net debt, and $1.5 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility. Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered the fourth quarter with a solid backlog and pipeline of opportunities and expect sales growth between 28% and 31%. This outlook assumes continued recovery across our major product categories with an improved level of year-end spending by our customers including several large North American retail projects. We continue to cycle easier comparisons across the business due in part to significant destocking activity by our distributors during the second half of last year. Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 22% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3.80 to $4. Our fourth quarter outlook translates to full year sales growth of approximately 8%. Our full year adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 21% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of approximately $13.30 to $13.50 based on our Q4 guide. This represents stronger profitable growth than our prior outlook supported by increased momentum and demand recovery and continued focus on our cost structure. Free cash flow for the year is now expected to be at least $850 million. We continue to drive profitable growth while improving our working capital levels including rightsizing our inventory. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. With that, I will turn the call back to Bill.\nBill Burns: Thank you, Nathan. Turning to Slide 10. We remained well-positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows with their comprehensive portfolio of innovative solutions including purpose-built hardware, software, and services. We empower frontline workers to execute tasks more effectively by navigating constant change in real time to advance capabilities including automation, prescriptive analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Zebra continues to demonstrate market leadership through innovation. We have consistently reinvested approximately 10% of our revenues into research and development to advance our vibrant core and bring new innovative solutions to market. At recent customer events we hosted in North America and EMEA, we unveiled solutions that underscore our commitment to innovation. These include the latest version of our work cloud software utilizing advanced AI and machine learning and new rugged tablets for demanding environments. We also highlighted a Zebra kiosk solution offering self-checkout including tap-to-pay capabilities, which enhance the customer experience and enables frontline associates to focus on higher value tasks. This launch enables us to expand Zebra's addressable market with near adjacent technology that leverages our core software platform. Additionally, we are developing a generative AI mobile computing solution designed to assist frontline workers with sales, merchandising, and operating procedures, which we will feature at the National Retail Federation Trade Show in January. As you see on Slide 11, our customers leverage our solutions to optimize workflows across a broad range of end markets. We empower enterprises to drive productivity and better serve their customers, shoppers, and patients. Our relentless focus on innovation continues to drive our competitive differentiation and secure wins. In the second half of this year, we're seeing momentum in large Zebra deployments in North America and EMEA across retail, e-commerce, and logistics. Our customers are beginning to increase investment in our solutions as they absorb the supply chain capacity they built out during the pandemic and look to drive increased productivity. Recent key wins include a technology modernization project at a large e-commerce customer, a mobile computing upgrade at a large retailer to enable the latest software applications, a grocer's initiative to replace desktop computers with our mobile devices to drive several front of store use cases and a luxury retailer will deploy work cloud software to optimize in-season pricing. Additionally, logistics customer in EMEA selected Zebra's new wearable mobile computers to replace a competitor's voice picking solution. This customer expects to improve accuracy and increase employee and customer satisfaction with our solution. Last quarter, I highlighted our success and traction in selling the benefits of enterprise grade devices in healthcare. Our ease of integration into electronic medical record systems has been a competitive differentiator and we recently secured mobile computing and printing wins at large North America hospitals. Our solutions will improve workflows and enable enhanced visibility and tracking of assets, equipment, and specimens. Now turning to Slide 12. We realize double-digit sales growth across all vertical markets as demand recovers. Our confidence in sustainable long-term growth is underpinned by several themes that we expect to drive investment in our solutions including labor and resource constraints, track and trace mandates, increased consumer expectations, and the need for real time supply chain visibility. In closing, we are seeing the broadening of demand recovery in the second half of this year with a more normalized seasonality in sales volumes as we enter the fourth quarter and into 2025. As we look longer-term, we maintain strong conviction in the opportunity for Zebra as we elevate our strategic role with our customers through our innovative portfolio of solutions. Our sales and cost initiatives have positioned us well for profitable growth as our end markets continue to recover. I will now hand it back to Mike.\nMike Steele: Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone the chance to participate.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: So it's a, obviously demand seems to be picking up quite a bit facing some easy comps. But also you had some commentary around some larger North America retail project wins, I believe, if you could comment on that. What are you seeing in that market specifically and how do you see that playing out into next year?\nBill Burns: Yes, Andrew. I would say that, certainly, we're seeing that the quarter ended where we were pretty happy with the results and ultimately the teams executed well. I would say that we saw a broadening recovery across all vertical markets, not just retail, in Q3, which certainly was encouraging. From a retail perspective, I would say retail and e-commerce outperformed across all product categories, really in Q3, and we expect that to kind of extend into Q4, as you mentioned easier compares from a year ago. But we've also been able to see some year-end spending, which injects some more -- some normalized seasonality, which we have seen in past years, certainly year-end with larger orders from e-commerce, retail and transportation logistics, specifically North America and EMEA. So this is what we'd normally see at year-end. We hadn't seen that last year, of course, and now, we're seeing that, that return to more normalized levels. So we feel good about retail customers beginning to spend again. Sure, their focus continues to be investments in e-commerce, omni-channel continue to drive that market. We've got a solid pipeline of opportunities as we enter Q4 and we continue to win in that market against competition as we've got a differentiated portfolio of hardware and software serving the retail market. So we feel good about what we're seeing across retail in Q3 and Q4 and the seasonality coming back where we see some year-end spending across North America and EMEA. So we feel pretty good about retail at the moment. It was the first to recover, right? If you think back to the beginning of the year, retail was the first to decline and the first to recover. And we're seeing that continue across retail throughout the year.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. Okay. And then can you just comment on what you're seeing with distributors and how are they going about their decision to start to restock and what kind of trends are you seeing in with those customers?\nBill Burns: Maybe I'll start and hand to Nathan. I would say overall that our distributors are seeing the uptick in business that we're seeing from our partner community. I think that we're working closely with them to make sure that they've got the right level of inventory to meet the increase in demand as we enter Q4. But that we continue to work closely with them to make sure that across all product categories that we make sure that they've got the right level of stocking across each of the regions around the globe.\nNathan Winters: Yes, I think that's checks in, and again, when we look at it from an inventory perspective, they're at a good amount of days on hand in terms of where we'd like them to be entering the fourth quarter. So again, I think we feel, as Bill said, good about the overall inventory position here as we enter the quarter with the expectation for the year-end spend to come through.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jamie Cook with Truist. Please go ahead.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter. I guess, just back to the large orders, can you help us understand how much of the large orders did that help the third quarter and sort of what's implied in the fourth quarter and your confidence level that this continues into 2025? And then, I guess, my second question, the margins over the past two quarters, I mean the gross margins were 49% plus, that's implied 49% or so in the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering, based on the sales volume and benefits from some of their structuring, the expectation that margins can at least be at that level in 2025, given the exit rate for 2024. Thank you.\nBill Burns: Yes. So Jamie, maybe I'll start and then hand over to Nate around margin. I'd say if we kind of look back right to 2023 and kind of recap where we're at, right? I would say overall that customers in 2023 were absorbing capacity and that they built out in the pandemic. We clearly were -- they were scrutinizing budgets, sweating assets, right, and that drove significant distributor destocking in that timeframe. And in fourth quarter last year, we saw really no large deal, no larger order activity in the end of fourth quarter of 2023. So I would say that that's what's really different this year is that ultimately as we entered 2024 in the first half, we saw early signs of recovery really in mid-tier and run rate businesses we talked about in the first half and really focused on mobile, computing and retail. But larger orders really remain below historic levels in the first half. As we got into second half, what we're seeing is broader recovery across all regions. In most end markets, we're still seeing manufacturing for instance lag, but we're seeing the return of year-end spending and larger orders by retail and logistics customers in North America and EMEA. We're also seeing some probably mid-tier orders; I would call it from healthcare. So healthcare has also been a strength, which has allowed us to raise our guide. So I think more normalized seasonality that we're seeing where typically fourth quarter is an uptick in demand as our customers spend more in the fourth quarter as they move into next year. I would say the other thing we saw was that a comment on kind of large orders was probably the fact that we saw CapEx increase throughout the year. So I think as customers got more confidence in the macro environment around them and what we're seeing across their business, the increased capital spending, especially in retail throughout the year and injecting again more seasonality that we expect to happen in fourth quarter and then continue injecting seasonality back into our business in 2025. I'd say from a 2025 perspective, while we're clearly not guiding to 2025, we're optimistic that the recovery continues into 2025, certainly based on the strong second half. We'd expect again normalized seasonality to really be injected back into the business in fourth quarter just like we'd expect in 2025. So I'd say the one caution would be we're seeing a little bit of uncertainty across the customer base. And I would say that what that means is really manufacturing lagging the other segments. I would say, each customer is in a different phase of whether its refresh or new, product investment or new investment across their business and new applications. We're seeing some T&L customers' still absorbing capacity. So we've got a bit of limited visibility to large projects on when they're going to happen in 2025. So again, we'd expect the recovery to continue but a bit uneven across some of the end markets is the only thing I'd say from a caution perspective. Maybe, Nate can comment on margins.\nNathan Winters: Yes. Yes. So Jamie, if you look at our gross margin in the third quarter, just over 49%, that's the highest gross margin we've had in recent history. But really benefited from lower large deal volume, obviously, there was a bit of a return, but still lower than as a percent than what we've seen historically. But good scaling on our fixed infrastructure. We completed the consolidation of our distribution centers in North America. That was the last piece of our restructuring actions midway through the quarter, so seeing that benefit flow through. The only thing I'd say is you look at what's implied in the Q4 EBITDA guide. We do expect a sequential decline in gross margin just as you know, again, based on the incremental large deal volumes coming through on the higher volume. And I'd say that's still kind of the wild card if you look into 2025 is, what that large deal mix look like as we enter the year and as we go throughout the year, as we think about the kind of the gross margin dynamics.\nOperator: The next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDamian Karas: Hey, good morning, everyone. Nice work in the quarter.\nBill Burns: Thanks, Damian. Good morning.\nDamian Karas: Yes. So you guys mentioned that you still have limited visibility around large deployments. Could you maybe just give us a sense for like why that is and when you think about going into year-end and some of these kind of late CapEx budget type decisions, is there what have you baked into your guidance? Are you only kind of factoring in COGS these larger deployments where you do have visibility? And is there potential that after we get through the election there could still be some kind of later year spend?\nBill Burns: Yes. I would say, Damian, we feel good about the fourth quarter guide with a pipeline and visibility in all size orders really to support the guide. So I think we feel good about the guide for fourth quarter. I would say, overall from a limited visibility perspective, I think as we look into 2025, what we saw in 2024, was customers start off with kind of a conservative view on CapEx spending and kind of ramp that spending through the year. We'd expect that same thing to likely happen in 2025 is, look, I think overall there's lots of positive momentum from a macro environment, whether that's positive GDP, whether that's e-commerce growth, the capital spending increase, as I said throughout 2024, IT device spending is projected to be up in 2025. So that's all good news for 2025. But I think you mentioned it, right, all the other things that are kind of weighing on the macro around the globe, including U.S. elections, right, interest rates are still high. Inflation, impacting consumers and their spending overall, which then creates a bit of caution on the part of our customers, longer sales cycles, more approvals, those kind of things as they kind of second guess their CapEx. So I'd say overall, just while we see projects for 2025 at the moment, it's a -- it's just a bit early to have the visibility especially into large deployments and when they'll actually happen throughout 2025 given that we've seen kind of the slow CapEx release in 2024. So I think we feel good about 2025. We feel really good about our guide for fourth quarter, but there is still uncertainty out there with a lot of things happening from a macro environment.\nDamian Karas: That makes sense. And then, I was wondering if you could maybe just give us an update on the machine vision business. Is that still a drag on your financials at this point or maybe starting to see some signs of improvement there?\nBill Burns: I'd say that we still feel good about machine vision overall as being closely adjacent to our scanning portfolio overall and creating opportunity for us as our customers continue to look to automate supply chain and visibility across manufacturing from an inspection perspective and transportation logistics from a visibility perspective within their environment. And I think that -- look, machine vision declined in the quarter. I think overall weakness in manufacturing has affected that market clearly. A good example of that would be electrical vehicle manufacturing kind of slowed. We saw our semiconductor, which were kind of heavily weighted to, and that's been one of our objectives all along is to diversify the business, the acquisition of Matrox beyond semiconductor. We've seen stabilization in semiconductor in the quarter. So that's a positive sign. We are pleased with the software growth to machine vision in the quarter. And we feel good that the diversification efforts we're working on to diversify outside of semiconductor into broader manufacturing, into T&L will benefit us as the markets recover. And I think that ultimately, we feel good about the opportunity for not just software but our continued investment across go-to-market and some new investments around AI and deep learning that will benefit us as that market returns. So tough market at the moment, but we feel good about the long-term prospects of machine vision.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions.\nBill Burns: Hey, Tommy.\nNathan Winters: Hi, Tommy.\nTommy Moll: I wanted to start on the large order topic. I hear you loud and clear that the visibility on next year remains limited at this point. And then, my question is, what would a typical planning cycle look like? And in a normal year, however, you want to define that for large orders, how much advance notice do you have, and when did the conversations really start to pick up where you get that kind of visibility about what's coming? Thanks.\nBill Burns: Hey Tommy, I'd say typically six months. We typically have six months of visibility to larger projects from our customers. And I would say that then that planning cycle ultimately begins six months in advance as they think about what's the next-generation of device. What are the use cases they're using devices for? Are they -- the upgrades are always in the larger projects are always bigger than the last refresh, right, as they deploy more devices, they've used more use cases and typically when our customers refresh, they also look to add additional use cases along the way. So all that gets discussed six months plus in advance, and then they go through their process of selecting what product, what solution, what vendor and then move forward. And then the ultimate timing of the project and when it gets ordered and deployed, sometimes relies on other factors, like they're rolling out new software on their side, for instance, in working with outside vendors to do that or whether they've got internal developments happening or they've got a rollout schedule, they want to go meet based on their seasonality of their business. So that all depends from a rollout perspective. Sometimes they get delayed, sometimes they move faster. But typically six months of the visibility, and I think I would say -- at the moment, we saw CapEx ramp through 2024. We kind of expect that in 2025. In first quarter, we typically get more visibility to the first half projects in 2025. And then they typically move along through their process.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brad Hewitt with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBrad Hewitt: So as we think about next year, aside from the year-end retail spending, are you seeing anything in the pipeline or the conversion rates that makes you more optimistic than you were last quarter about large orders returning in a more meaningful way in 2025? And then how much of a recovery in large order rates do you think we need to see for growth in 2025 to be in line with or better than your long-term growth framework?\nBill Burns: Look, I'd probably say that, again, we're trying not to guide for 2025. I'll give you a little bit of color, right? Certainly, we're optimistic is the recovery. We expect to continue into 2025 based on the strong results we've seen in the second half of the year and the continued ramp of CapEx by our customers. We've seen a bit of uneven results into the marketplace, right? Retail, first to recover, continue that recovery. T&L green shoots in the second quarter now broader T&L recovery, but a bit uneven, meaning some customers are still using the capacity that they've built out during the pandemic and still working through that, but we're seeing parcel volumes increased. Manufacturing, clearly lagging the other sectors. And then healthcare has been a positive over the last two quarters. But I'd say that while we've seen that, we also see some macro headwinds overall, which include all the challenges we've talked about already, manufacturing softness in China, limited budget visibility as we kind of get into 2025 as to when projects will happen across the business. So we'd see continued recovery into 2025 on the strength of the second half. And right now, it's just too early to have a lot of visibility into 2025 overall. We do believe that seasonality does come back into the business in 2025, though. So as we're seeing seasonal effects of large orders at fourth quarter, we would expect that seasonality to really be injected back into the business in 2025.\nOperator: The next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, guys. Bill, perhaps you provide a little bit of color from a geographical perspective. EMEA and Latin America were the standouts, obviously, this quarter. Was it a matter of easier compares for those geographies? Or is there something truly unique capping in those areas that perhaps we can think about as we go forward?\nBill Burns: Yes, Keith, I'd say certainly double-digit growth across all major product categories, regions and end markets, right, was encouraging. But again, as you know easier compares with a weak Q3 last year. So an aggressive distributor destocking at that point in time. I'd say EMEA, clearly easier compares than the other regions. So I would say, we feel good about all regions overall. EMEA had a even easier compare than the other regions. But that said, I would say, strength in Northern Europe clearly within EMEA, some larger projects in T&L moving forward and some wins in mobile computing. I would say, across EMEA, manufacturing remains challenging, particularly Germany as an example. But I think that the story of EMEA is really easier comparison than the other regions. North America, I would say, improvement across all product categories, strength in retail, healthcare, T&L coming back, but a bit uneven as people are using the capacity, but the good news is we're seeing parcel volumes continue to recover. Manufacturing still a bit challenging overall and kind of lacking the other areas. Healthcare, two quarters in a row is our fastest-growing market. So that's returned to what we've seen in the past around healthcare, especially in North America. I'd say Asia, momentum in Southeast Asia, so Southeast Asia and India were kind of bright spots in the quarter. Stabilization in China, I'd probably say, and we're not expecting a near-term kind of recovery or growth driver from China overall at the moment. And I'd say Latin America strength in Mexico and Brazil, as you've kind of heard from us before. So I think we feel pretty good about recovery across all the regions. And I think the difference is more around vertical markets than it is the actual regions themselves.\nOperator: The next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. A couple questions. Just on the healthcare strength that you guys are seeing, is this new accounts that you guys are adding or just expansion of penetration or just kind of overall health and spend in that market after kind of some post-COVID hangover within healthcare so just more in-depth on healthcare? And then, second, I know a question was asked earlier just about some of the initiatives that you guys have enacted that had improved gross margins. But just as we think about OpEx into 2025, are there initiatives that are -- are all of the initiatives around some of the moves made earlier this year fully carried out? Or just how should we think about kind of OpEx into 2025? Thanks.\nBill Burns: Yes, I'll start with healthcare and then hand over gross margin to Nate. I would say that from a healthcare perspective, a combination of new customers and refreshes across the portfolio, but continued opportunities across healthcare, I would say, we saw growth across all product categories. We have specific lines for printing, scanning, mobile computing specifically towards and focused on the healthcare market. I'd say, overall, we improved productivity and healthcare providers of all sizes really enhance safety and be able to take information and put it into electronical medical record systems, which is important across healthcare, not just in North America but around the world. So I'd say overall, this idea of automating workflows, collecting digital information on patients, assets, what's happening within the medical environment creates an opportunity for us in -- across all segments of healthcare. So whether it's clinical mobility or home healthcare, virtual care, all those have been opportunities for us. So I would say healthcare is our smallest vertical market at the moment and -- but it's the fastest growing in opportunities, both new and expansion across healthcare and not just North America, but global opportunities as well.\nNathan Winters: Yes, Meta, just when you look at it from an OpEx perspective, I'd say a couple of things. One, the full benefit of the restructuring is really embedded in the OpEx for the second half of the -- in the P&L. Really the incremental gross -- incremental restructuring benefits to go are primarily in gross margin and really related to the flow-through of the closure of the DC in North America. So the team is really now focused on how we scale and drive productivity across the OpEx infrastructure that we have. And there's some really exciting things that teams are working around the use of AI to drive productivity in terms of supply chain forecasting, order management or how we leverage generative AI for technology support, software code generation, again, all allowing us to scale on the -- and drive efficiency of what we have today. So I think that's really the focus is scaling on the structure that we have today with the tools and technology that are available.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrian Drab: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is just around the cadence of demand recovery that you saw the timing of demand recovery that you saw in the third quarter because that is just the tone is a lot different today I think in the second quarter, it's a lot different even from touching base with you during the third quarter. So I'm just wondering, did you see an incremental pickup in demand in some of the end markets even as recently as October?\nNathan Winters: Hey Brian, let me start. I think, one, if you look back at our prior guide, we really assumed a similar level of demand from Q2 continuing into the second half with only really a modest increase for year-end spending. And what we wanted to see was the real commitments the POs starting to come through from our customers before embedding that in the guide. And I think that's what we saw through the second half of the third quarter and here in the early part of the fourth quarter. So really the conversion of that pipeline coming through, which is what we wanted to see to have the confidence to raise the guide as we are today. So I think that's really the difference. It's just that conversion of the pipeline really picked up in the later part of the third quarter and here in the early part of the fourth quarter where we had the confidence based on those commitments from our customers to raise the guide for the full year and see that year-end spend start to really come through here in the fourth quarter.\nBrian Drab: Okay. That certainly makes sense. And then second question, depending on the outcome of the election here, it could be -- there's a concern that there could be significant tariffs that start to go into place. And I know that in the past Trump administration, you've established a tariff task force. And I'm just wondering if you could describe what the activity that's happening at Zebra right now to potentially position for that environment?\nNathan Winters: Well, too early to speculate on the impact on all the various scenarios that could come out of next week's election. But we have been focused on some of the new tariffs that have been planned for 2026 and how we build alternatives so we can respond accordingly. So the team is actively working on mitigation plans for some of the new tariffs that are coming into place. And we continue to work -- actively work with our supply chain partners. We've been doing this since 2019 to diversify the supply base to improve resiliency overall as well as prepare for any future tariff changes. So I'd say right now, it's various scenario planning of what the different options could be, but our primary focus has been improved overall resiliency of our supply chain, so that we can respond, whether it's tariffs, geopolitical or natural disasters, how we make sure we have that structure in place to respond accordingly, that's really been the focus of the teams. And then obviously, depending on the outcome of the election and policies coming from that will respond and pivoted accordingly.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead.\nRob Mason: Hi, good morning. The commentary around the gross margin has already been touched on and is performing really well. I'm just curious; again, we're still somewhat early in the recovery. I'm sure business is competitive. But has there been any change in Zebra's promotional practices as we've gone about the recovery? Do you need to discount less either just from your leadership position, the way you've built out the portfolio? Or anything that maybe structurally could carry forward from a promotional aspect?\nBill Burns: Yes, Rob, I'll take that. I would say that overall, look, our strong customer relationships, the deep vertical market expertise we have across each of the vertical markets we serve, the breadth and depth of the solutions portfolio that's tailored to each market. I gave you an example before around healthcare, truly differentiates us from our competitors. And clearly, that our competitive advantages being the market leader around scale and investment in technology, our partner community around the world all gives us strength. And I would say that we really haven't seen really any meaningful change across the competitive landscape. I would say, we're confident that we continue to win in the market and that we'll continue to extend our industry leadership through our investments in innovation. We talked about early on in the call. And continue to strengthen our strategic relationships with customers. So we really haven't seen much different from a competitive landscape perspective around the world at the moment, pretty much of the same.\nRob Mason: I see. Yes. And just as a quick follow-up. We've talked about mobile computing leaving this recovery. Can you give any perspective just on how data capture and printing may follow that, whether you're starting to see -- and then, now, we had good year-over-year growth against easier comps? But are you starting to see accelerating momentum in those products as well?\nBill Burns: Yes, Rob, I think that again, as you said it, mobile computing was kind of the first major category to recover in Q2, and we're continuing to see broad-based demand for mobile computing in Q3 and into Q4 and then some of these larger deal activity really driven by mobile computing. But I'd say what we saw in Q3 was really broad-based growth across DCS, including all product categories within DCS and then across all regions. So I think that's a good sign. And we'd expect that strength to continue into 2024. Again, there's been more variation in the first half of the year on print in DCS around supply chain not being available in 2023 and then recovery in 2024, and all the variations around it. But I think we're seeing growth in DCS, same in print. So growth across most print categories -- one of the strengths has been particularly mobile print. So again, ties back to mobile computing, right, strength across that. There's no opportunities in print. I would say things like eco-friendly linerless printing, so the idea that less waste is creating new opportunities within print. So we feel good about the broad-based growth across DCS and print. I would say me the last area may be worth mentioning because it hasn't come up yet is RFID. So strong growth in Q3 across RFID as we continue to see broad-based adoption of RFID in the quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham. Please go ahead.\nChris Grenga: Hi, good morning. This is Chris Grenga on for Jim. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Just to follow-up on that RFID point. There have been reports about new applications for RFID in grocery, first use case apparently being one involving bakery departments. First question is whether you might anticipate new opportunities for your RFID printing business as a result of these developments? And second, more broadly, how do you view the RFID growth opportunities over the next year and whether grocery could be a meaningful use case to go along with what we're seeing in apparel, general merchandise, and logistics?\nBill Burns: Yes. I would say that strong growth in Q3 for an RFID perspective and strong pipeline of opportunities across retail, T&L, manufacturing. As you said, Chris, broadening and retail beyond what was originally apparel into general merchandise and now an opportunity that we've seen for some time and it's been worked on across the industry as things like fresh, right, within the retail store and around the outside perimeter of the store where you see fresh goods and leveraging RFID there. So I think that clearly represents an opportunity for us, track and trace across supply chains, parcel, tracking, healthcare, all those also create an opportunity from Zebra's perspective, we've got the broadest set of RFID solutions, including fixed and handheld readers, industrial and mobile printing, our software and labels to go along with that. So we feel good about the opportunity and the broadening of the opportunities out of RFID beyond, as you said, apparel and retail. I would say the exciting piece that everybody is looking at in RFID is the tag adoption, right, and the growth of tags and those items that are source-tagged or tagged within a retail store, for instance, or a parcel inside T&L, the more items are tagged, the more readers there's more, the more applications there are and that allows more automated collection of information. So I think ultimately, we're excited about the RFID market and continues to grow, and the pipeline of opportunities and applications continues to grow as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: You touched on tariffs and what you're doing? Can you just remind us like how much -- I know you guys moved with your manufacturing partners moved a lot of stuff out of China last go around. Can you update us on like where we are and how much production is still there? Or how much can be moved, if necessary? And how much is like structurally has to be there?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So we -- if you look at an aggregate in terms of dollars, it's almost close to 50% of finished goods production is outside of China, still a vast majority of the component supply chain remains within China, and that's really the trickier or more stickier part of the supply chain to move just given how embedded it is within that market. So again, we moved a significant portion of the manufacturing up really to support North America into places like Malaysia, Vietnam, back in 2019, that's continued to ramp over the last several years. But I think it's important to note, we didn't move all North American volume out of China. Some products, just given the relative volume or the return on investment still made sense to produce in China for the North American market, even with the higher tariffs. So that's, again, the inflation, and we offset that with higher pricing, the pricing actions we took back then. So that's the equation we're working through now, which is what more can be move, should be move, if and when any additional tariffs are enacted. So that's what the team is scenario planning out, but also I want to make sure we make the right business decision that gives us long-term resiliency as well as follows where the supply chain is going because we do rely on, again, components and subassemblies and making sure that we're not too far dislocated from where the those source components are coming from. So it's a pretty complex equation that the team is working through. But we're lucky that we have supply chain partners that in and around the region that we work with to work and solve that challenge.\nJoe Giordano: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just I want to make sure I understand the seasonality discussion around next year. And I know you mentioned you don't want to give 2025 guidance. I appreciate that. And normally, your first quarter is a step down versus the fourth quarter. But now we're in a situation where like big orders aren't hitting in the fourth quarter, so like is it unreasonable to think that you just have kind of a continued moderate increase quarterly as you go through next year? Or do you still get like a step down even without kind of the project activity in the end of this year?\nNathan Winters: I think based on what we said earlier, I think the expectation is to be pretty -- Q4 is maybe not back to a full recovery, but it's still -- there's been a pretty big step-up in what we saw from Q2 to Q3 and Q3 to Q4 with year-end spend. There is several large deployments within the fourth quarter. So I would -- that's why we said we'd expect it to be more maybe like a historical seasonality as you go into next year because of the year-end demand we're seeing and some of the large deployments here in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Guy Hardwick with Freedom Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nGuy Hardwick: Congrats on the results, excellent performance. Obviously, Zebra has made great progress year-to-date in deleveraging, and I noticed that trade working capital has fallen materially as a percentage of sales. But now with the leverage ratio down at 1.6x, at what point do you return to making acquisitions? And how would you balance those up against share repurchases? I believe you return to share repurchases for the first time more than a year in Q3.\nNathan Winters: Yes, Guy, I think maybe just to start because we haven't touched on it. So obviously, the free cash flow for the year-to-date, over $650 million, almost $850 million higher than from last year. So just really tremendous work by the team on working capital improvements. We've reduced inventory year-to-date by over $160 million. So it's great to see the actions that we put in place starting to flow through in the reduction in working capital and seeing that come through free cash flow. So it really puts us in a great position exiting the year and going into next year. And as you mentioned, we returned to share repurchases in slightly here in the third -- back in the third quarter. And we're continuing to take a systemic approach to share repurchases here in the quarter and as we go into next year. But with the debt leverage ratio at 1.6x, which is on the low end of the target range, overall comfortable with the net debt cash position, but puts us in a nice position to really return to either returning capital to shareholders or as you mentioned, giving us capacity for M&A opportunities as they arise.\nBill Burns: Maybe just some comments on M&A. Overall, I would say that, as Nate said, returning capital to investors through share buybacks or M&A is to really good uses of capital for us. I would say that our M&A philosophy hasn't changed. It's really -- overall, it's to leverage and advance our vision and our strategy moving forward is how we think about it. We target specific opportunities that are really closely adjacent and synergistic to what we do today. Clearly, as you pointed out, the strong balance sheet gives us optionality to return capital or look at opportunities within M&A. I would say that the bar is a bit higher today even with the increase in free cash flow from the idea of doing something larger certainly would entail higher interest rates. And there's still a bit of uncertainty out there from a market perspective. So if we were going to acquire something, we'd want to be assured kind of the revenue stream coming in. So a bit higher bar at the moment. I think we're excited about our business as it exists today. And I think that disciplined M&A is how we think about it as a vector for long-term growth that we can use in addition to returning capital to shareholders through share buyback. So both are an option. I think we continue to look and be inquisitive in the marketplace from an M&A perspective, but it's got to meet our strategic vision.\nGuy Hardwick: And Bill, just as a quick follow-up. I think in your prepared remarks, you referenced that the AI-enabled enterprise mobile computers will be showing -- you'll be showing those at the NRF show early next year. Does that mean that you are closer to commercialization, perhaps you would have thought just a few months ago when you -- we discussed this on the Q2 call?\nBill Burns: Yes. We -- I would say, yes. So we demonstrated our early version of AI companion really on mobile devices at NRF last year. This will be a continued advancement along those lines at NRF this year, working closely with our partners of Qualcomm, Google and some of our customers to continue to advance that opportunity. I think that this idea of a digital assistant on a mobile device, assisting the frontline worker that will drive productivity and really elevate the customer experiences. And we see this as being running the large language model on the device without requiring connectivities to the cloud. You can have connectivity cloud if you want or not. And a lot of our customers don't have a lot of connectivity out of their environments, think of retail stores, think of warehouses and others. So that's an advantage. And I think it's something that we're focused on and likely in 2025, what we'll see is some type of commercial offering from Zebra. We're working through what that really means from us, but I think it bodes well for us moving forward from working closely with our customers, making sure we're understanding how they're using and building large language models and their data, how do they protect that, how do they upgrade that, how do they keep it current within the mobile devices, and we're working closely with them to make that happen. So I think, yes, we're getting closer, continue our investment there and continue to move ahead with the development cycle in that area. And we're going to show a refresh demo at NRF that takes kind of the next level this year.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Brad Hewitt with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nBrad Hewitt: Thanks guys for fit me back in. It looks like you bumped up the Q4 implied sequential revenue growth by about 200 basis points. But you took down the implied sequential incremental EBITDA margins a little bit. So curious if there were any mix benefits in Q3 that you do not expect to occur in Q4? And how should we think about the puts and takes of the Q4 EBITDA margin line on a sequential basis?\nNathan Winters: Yes, Brad, as you mentioned, so if you look at our EBITDA guide of 22%, it's up just over 0.5 point from -- sequentially from Q3, and again, primarily driven by the volume leverage. And I think the real change is just the deal mix overall with the higher mix of large deals and some of the large deployments in North America that somewhat of a drag sequentially on gross margin, driving that down a bit. And OpEx relatively flat just based on some of the project timing. So and the majority of any incremental gross margin on a sequential basis is embedded within gross margin. So I think that's really the -- no other kind of -- I think Q3 obviously came through stronger just seeing all the different actions flow through on the higher volume. And then the real change from Q3 to Q4 is just the mix within the portfolio.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Burns for any closing remarks.\nBill Burns: Yes. In closing, I'd just like to say thank you to our employees and partners for their continued support and delivering strong Q3 financial results. It was about 10 years ago -- actually, 10 years ago this week, we closed the Enterprise acquisition. And I would say that our relentless focus on innovation and our continued commitment to our customers continues to drive differentiation for us in the marketplace and secure competitive wins. And I would say, we're well-positioned to advance our industry leadership as our end markets recover. So thank you. Have a great day, everyone.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Burns",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Our teams executed well in the third quarter delivering sales and earnings results above the high end of our outlook. For the quarter, we realized sales of almost $1.3 billion, a 31% increase compared to the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4%, a 980 basis point increase. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.49, which was 4x the prior year and delivered strong free cash flow. As we discussed on our last earnings call, during the second quarter, we began to see early signs of recovery across our end markets with mobile computing returning to growth. In the third quarter, we were encouraged to see the recovery broadened with data capture and printing also returning to growth. We realized double-digit growth across all our primary end markets and broad-based growth to customers of all sizes as began to cycle significant destocking activity in the second half of last year. We are seeing indications of customer spend generally improving in the second half, including expectations for higher year-end spending in North America and EMEA across most end markets. That said the manufacturing sector is still lagging as the goods economy continues to recover. Additionally, as we look ahead to 2025, visibility remains limited regarding the timing of large deployments. Another highlight was our improved profitability, primarily due to improved gross margin driven by volume, leverage, and business mix. With the recent consolidation of our North American distribution centers into a single Chicago area facility, we have successfully completed our restructuring actions to deliver $120 million of net annualized operating savings. Given our third quarter performance, improved momentum in demand recovery, and our focus on profitable growth, we are raising our full year outlook for sales, profitability, and free cash flow. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q3 financial results and discuss our revised 2024 outlook. Thank you, Nathan. Turning to Slide 10. We remained well-positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows with their comprehensive portfolio of innovative solutions including purpose-built hardware, software, and services. We empower frontline workers to execute tasks more effectively by navigating constant change in real time to advance capabilities including automation, prescriptive analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Zebra continues to demonstrate market leadership through innovation. We have consistently reinvested approximately 10% of our revenues into research and development to advance our vibrant core and bring new innovative solutions to market. At recent customer events we hosted in North America and EMEA, we unveiled solutions that underscore our commitment to innovation. These include the latest version of our work cloud software utilizing advanced AI and machine learning and new rugged tablets for demanding environments. We also highlighted a Zebra kiosk solution offering self-checkout including tap-to-pay capabilities, which enhance the customer experience and enables frontline associates to focus on higher value tasks. This launch enables us to expand Zebra's addressable market with near adjacent technology that leverages our core software platform. Additionally, we are developing a generative AI mobile computing solution designed to assist frontline workers with sales, merchandising, and operating procedures, which we will feature at the National Retail Federation Trade Show in January. As you see on Slide 11, our customers leverage our solutions to optimize workflows across a broad range of end markets. We empower enterprises to drive productivity and better serve their customers, shoppers, and patients. Our relentless focus on innovation continues to drive our competitive differentiation and secure wins. In the second half of this year, we're seeing momentum in large Zebra deployments in North America and EMEA across retail, e-commerce, and logistics. Our customers are beginning to increase investment in our solutions as they absorb the supply chain capacity they built out during the pandemic and look to drive increased productivity. Recent key wins include a technology modernization project at a large e-commerce customer, a mobile computing upgrade at a large retailer to enable the latest software applications, a grocer's initiative to replace desktop computers with our mobile devices to drive several front of store use cases and a luxury retailer will deploy work cloud software to optimize in-season pricing. Additionally, logistics customer in EMEA selected Zebra's new wearable mobile computers to replace a competitor's voice picking solution. This customer expects to improve accuracy and increase employee and customer satisfaction with our solution. Last quarter, I highlighted our success and traction in selling the benefits of enterprise grade devices in healthcare. Our ease of integration into electronic medical record systems has been a competitive differentiator and we recently secured mobile computing and printing wins at large North America hospitals. Our solutions will improve workflows and enable enhanced visibility and tracking of assets, equipment, and specimens. Now turning to Slide 12. We realize double-digit sales growth across all vertical markets as demand recovers. Our confidence in sustainable long-term growth is underpinned by several themes that we expect to drive investment in our solutions including labor and resource constraints, track and trace mandates, increased consumer expectations, and the need for real time supply chain visibility. In closing, we are seeing the broadening of demand recovery in the second half of this year with a more normalized seasonality in sales volumes as we enter the fourth quarter and into 2025. As we look longer-term, we maintain strong conviction in the opportunity for Zebra as we elevate our strategic role with our customers through our innovative portfolio of solutions. Our sales and cost initiatives have positioned us well for profitable growth as our end markets continue to recover. I will now hand it back to Mike. Yes, Andrew. I would say that, certainly, we're seeing that the quarter ended where we were pretty happy with the results and ultimately the teams executed well. I would say that we saw a broadening recovery across all vertical markets, not just retail, in Q3, which certainly was encouraging. From a retail perspective, I would say retail and e-commerce outperformed across all product categories, really in Q3, and we expect that to kind of extend into Q4, as you mentioned easier compares from a year ago. But we've also been able to see some year-end spending, which injects some more -- some normalized seasonality, which we have seen in past years, certainly year-end with larger orders from e-commerce, retail and transportation logistics, specifically North America and EMEA. So this is what we'd normally see at year-end. We hadn't seen that last year, of course, and now, we're seeing that, that return to more normalized levels. So we feel good about retail customers beginning to spend again. Sure, their focus continues to be investments in e-commerce, omni-channel continue to drive that market. We've got a solid pipeline of opportunities as we enter Q4 and we continue to win in that market against competition as we've got a differentiated portfolio of hardware and software serving the retail market. So we feel good about what we're seeing across retail in Q3 and Q4 and the seasonality coming back where we see some year-end spending across North America and EMEA. So we feel pretty good about retail at the moment. It was the first to recover, right? If you think back to the beginning of the year, retail was the first to decline and the first to recover. And we're seeing that continue across retail throughout the year. Maybe I'll start and hand to Nathan. I would say overall that our distributors are seeing the uptick in business that we're seeing from our partner community. I think that we're working closely with them to make sure that they've got the right level of inventory to meet the increase in demand as we enter Q4. But that we continue to work closely with them to make sure that across all product categories that we make sure that they've got the right level of stocking across each of the regions around the globe. Yes. So Jamie, maybe I'll start and then hand over to Nate around margin. I'd say if we kind of look back right to 2023 and kind of recap where we're at, right? I would say overall that customers in 2023 were absorbing capacity and that they built out in the pandemic. We clearly were -- they were scrutinizing budgets, sweating assets, right, and that drove significant distributor destocking in that timeframe. And in fourth quarter last year, we saw really no large deal, no larger order activity in the end of fourth quarter of 2023. So I would say that that's what's really different this year is that ultimately as we entered 2024 in the first half, we saw early signs of recovery really in mid-tier and run rate businesses we talked about in the first half and really focused on mobile, computing and retail. But larger orders really remain below historic levels in the first half. As we got into second half, what we're seeing is broader recovery across all regions. In most end markets, we're still seeing manufacturing for instance lag, but we're seeing the return of year-end spending and larger orders by retail and logistics customers in North America and EMEA. We're also seeing some probably mid-tier orders; I would call it from healthcare. So healthcare has also been a strength, which has allowed us to raise our guide. So I think more normalized seasonality that we're seeing where typically fourth quarter is an uptick in demand as our customers spend more in the fourth quarter as they move into next year. I would say the other thing we saw was that a comment on kind of large orders was probably the fact that we saw CapEx increase throughout the year. So I think as customers got more confidence in the macro environment around them and what we're seeing across their business, the increased capital spending, especially in retail throughout the year and injecting again more seasonality that we expect to happen in fourth quarter and then continue injecting seasonality back into our business in 2025. I'd say from a 2025 perspective, while we're clearly not guiding to 2025, we're optimistic that the recovery continues into 2025, certainly based on the strong second half. We'd expect again normalized seasonality to really be injected back into the business in fourth quarter just like we'd expect in 2025. So I'd say the one caution would be we're seeing a little bit of uncertainty across the customer base. And I would say that what that means is really manufacturing lagging the other segments. I would say, each customer is in a different phase of whether its refresh or new, product investment or new investment across their business and new applications. We're seeing some T&L customers' still absorbing capacity. So we've got a bit of limited visibility to large projects on when they're going to happen in 2025. So again, we'd expect the recovery to continue but a bit uneven across some of the end markets is the only thing I'd say from a caution perspective. Maybe, Nate can comment on margins. Thanks, Damian. Good morning. Yes. I would say, Damian, we feel good about the fourth quarter guide with a pipeline and visibility in all size orders really to support the guide. So I think we feel good about the guide for fourth quarter. I would say, overall from a limited visibility perspective, I think as we look into 2025, what we saw in 2024, was customers start off with kind of a conservative view on CapEx spending and kind of ramp that spending through the year. We'd expect that same thing to likely happen in 2025 is, look, I think overall there's lots of positive momentum from a macro environment, whether that's positive GDP, whether that's e-commerce growth, the capital spending increase, as I said throughout 2024, IT device spending is projected to be up in 2025. So that's all good news for 2025. But I think you mentioned it, right, all the other things that are kind of weighing on the macro around the globe, including U.S. elections, right, interest rates are still high. Inflation, impacting consumers and their spending overall, which then creates a bit of caution on the part of our customers, longer sales cycles, more approvals, those kind of things as they kind of second guess their CapEx. So I'd say overall, just while we see projects for 2025 at the moment, it's a -- it's just a bit early to have the visibility especially into large deployments and when they'll actually happen throughout 2025 given that we've seen kind of the slow CapEx release in 2024. So I think we feel good about 2025. We feel really good about our guide for fourth quarter, but there is still uncertainty out there with a lot of things happening from a macro environment. I'd say that we still feel good about machine vision overall as being closely adjacent to our scanning portfolio overall and creating opportunity for us as our customers continue to look to automate supply chain and visibility across manufacturing from an inspection perspective and transportation logistics from a visibility perspective within their environment. And I think that -- look, machine vision declined in the quarter. I think overall weakness in manufacturing has affected that market clearly. A good example of that would be electrical vehicle manufacturing kind of slowed. We saw our semiconductor, which were kind of heavily weighted to, and that's been one of our objectives all along is to diversify the business, the acquisition of Matrox beyond semiconductor. We've seen stabilization in semiconductor in the quarter. So that's a positive sign. We are pleased with the software growth to machine vision in the quarter. And we feel good that the diversification efforts we're working on to diversify outside of semiconductor into broader manufacturing, into T&L will benefit us as the markets recover. And I think that ultimately, we feel good about the opportunity for not just software but our continued investment across go-to-market and some new investments around AI and deep learning that will benefit us as that market returns. So tough market at the moment, but we feel good about the long-term prospects of machine vision. Hey, Tommy. Hey Tommy, I'd say typically six months. We typically have six months of visibility to larger projects from our customers. And I would say that then that planning cycle ultimately begins six months in advance as they think about what's the next-generation of device. What are the use cases they're using devices for? Are they -- the upgrades are always in the larger projects are always bigger than the last refresh, right, as they deploy more devices, they've used more use cases and typically when our customers refresh, they also look to add additional use cases along the way. So all that gets discussed six months plus in advance, and then they go through their process of selecting what product, what solution, what vendor and then move forward. And then the ultimate timing of the project and when it gets ordered and deployed, sometimes relies on other factors, like they're rolling out new software on their side, for instance, in working with outside vendors to do that or whether they've got internal developments happening or they've got a rollout schedule, they want to go meet based on their seasonality of their business. So that all depends from a rollout perspective. Sometimes they get delayed, sometimes they move faster. But typically six months of the visibility, and I think I would say -- at the moment, we saw CapEx ramp through 2024. We kind of expect that in 2025. In first quarter, we typically get more visibility to the first half projects in 2025. And then they typically move along through their process. Look, I'd probably say that, again, we're trying not to guide for 2025. I'll give you a little bit of color, right? Certainly, we're optimistic is the recovery. We expect to continue into 2025 based on the strong results we've seen in the second half of the year and the continued ramp of CapEx by our customers. We've seen a bit of uneven results into the marketplace, right? Retail, first to recover, continue that recovery. T&L green shoots in the second quarter now broader T&L recovery, but a bit uneven, meaning some customers are still using the capacity that they've built out during the pandemic and still working through that, but we're seeing parcel volumes increased. Manufacturing, clearly lagging the other sectors. And then healthcare has been a positive over the last two quarters. But I'd say that while we've seen that, we also see some macro headwinds overall, which include all the challenges we've talked about already, manufacturing softness in China, limited budget visibility as we kind of get into 2025 as to when projects will happen across the business. So we'd see continued recovery into 2025 on the strength of the second half. And right now, it's just too early to have a lot of visibility into 2025 overall. We do believe that seasonality does come back into the business in 2025, though. So as we're seeing seasonal effects of large orders at fourth quarter, we would expect that seasonality to really be injected back into the business in 2025. Yes, Keith, I'd say certainly double-digit growth across all major product categories, regions and end markets, right, was encouraging. But again, as you know easier compares with a weak Q3 last year. So an aggressive distributor destocking at that point in time. I'd say EMEA, clearly easier compares than the other regions. So I would say, we feel good about all regions overall. EMEA had a even easier compare than the other regions. But that said, I would say, strength in Northern Europe clearly within EMEA, some larger projects in T&L moving forward and some wins in mobile computing. I would say, across EMEA, manufacturing remains challenging, particularly Germany as an example. But I think that the story of EMEA is really easier comparison than the other regions. North America, I would say, improvement across all product categories, strength in retail, healthcare, T&L coming back, but a bit uneven as people are using the capacity, but the good news is we're seeing parcel volumes continue to recover. Manufacturing still a bit challenging overall and kind of lacking the other areas. Healthcare, two quarters in a row is our fastest-growing market. So that's returned to what we've seen in the past around healthcare, especially in North America. I'd say Asia, momentum in Southeast Asia, so Southeast Asia and India were kind of bright spots in the quarter. Stabilization in China, I'd probably say, and we're not expecting a near-term kind of recovery or growth driver from China overall at the moment. And I'd say Latin America strength in Mexico and Brazil, as you've kind of heard from us before. So I think we feel pretty good about recovery across all the regions. And I think the difference is more around vertical markets than it is the actual regions themselves. Yes, I'll start with healthcare and then hand over gross margin to Nate. I would say that from a healthcare perspective, a combination of new customers and refreshes across the portfolio, but continued opportunities across healthcare, I would say, we saw growth across all product categories. We have specific lines for printing, scanning, mobile computing specifically towards and focused on the healthcare market. I'd say, overall, we improved productivity and healthcare providers of all sizes really enhance safety and be able to take information and put it into electronical medical record systems, which is important across healthcare, not just in North America but around the world. So I'd say overall, this idea of automating workflows, collecting digital information on patients, assets, what's happening within the medical environment creates an opportunity for us in -- across all segments of healthcare. So whether it's clinical mobility or home healthcare, virtual care, all those have been opportunities for us. So I would say healthcare is our smallest vertical market at the moment and -- but it's the fastest growing in opportunities, both new and expansion across healthcare and not just North America, but global opportunities as well. Yes, Rob, I'll take that. I would say that overall, look, our strong customer relationships, the deep vertical market expertise we have across each of the vertical markets we serve, the breadth and depth of the solutions portfolio that's tailored to each market. I gave you an example before around healthcare, truly differentiates us from our competitors. And clearly, that our competitive advantages being the market leader around scale and investment in technology, our partner community around the world all gives us strength. And I would say that we really haven't seen really any meaningful change across the competitive landscape. I would say, we're confident that we continue to win in the market and that we'll continue to extend our industry leadership through our investments in innovation. We talked about early on in the call. And continue to strengthen our strategic relationships with customers. So we really haven't seen much different from a competitive landscape perspective around the world at the moment, pretty much of the same. Yes, Rob, I think that again, as you said it, mobile computing was kind of the first major category to recover in Q2, and we're continuing to see broad-based demand for mobile computing in Q3 and into Q4 and then some of these larger deal activity really driven by mobile computing. But I'd say what we saw in Q3 was really broad-based growth across DCS, including all product categories within DCS and then across all regions. So I think that's a good sign. And we'd expect that strength to continue into 2024. Again, there's been more variation in the first half of the year on print in DCS around supply chain not being available in 2023 and then recovery in 2024, and all the variations around it. But I think we're seeing growth in DCS, same in print. So growth across most print categories -- one of the strengths has been particularly mobile print. So again, ties back to mobile computing, right, strength across that. There's no opportunities in print. I would say things like eco-friendly linerless printing, so the idea that less waste is creating new opportunities within print. So we feel good about the broad-based growth across DCS and print. I would say me the last area may be worth mentioning because it hasn't come up yet is RFID. So strong growth in Q3 across RFID as we continue to see broad-based adoption of RFID in the quarter. Yes. I would say that strong growth in Q3 for an RFID perspective and strong pipeline of opportunities across retail, T&L, manufacturing. As you said, Chris, broadening and retail beyond what was originally apparel into general merchandise and now an opportunity that we've seen for some time and it's been worked on across the industry as things like fresh, right, within the retail store and around the outside perimeter of the store where you see fresh goods and leveraging RFID there. So I think that clearly represents an opportunity for us, track and trace across supply chains, parcel, tracking, healthcare, all those also create an opportunity from Zebra's perspective, we've got the broadest set of RFID solutions, including fixed and handheld readers, industrial and mobile printing, our software and labels to go along with that. So we feel good about the opportunity and the broadening of the opportunities out of RFID beyond, as you said, apparel and retail. I would say the exciting piece that everybody is looking at in RFID is the tag adoption, right, and the growth of tags and those items that are source-tagged or tagged within a retail store, for instance, or a parcel inside T&L, the more items are tagged, the more readers there's more, the more applications there are and that allows more automated collection of information. So I think ultimately, we're excited about the RFID market and continues to grow, and the pipeline of opportunities and applications continues to grow as well. Maybe just some comments on M&A. Overall, I would say that, as Nate said, returning capital to investors through share buybacks or M&A is to really good uses of capital for us. I would say that our M&A philosophy hasn't changed. It's really -- overall, it's to leverage and advance our vision and our strategy moving forward is how we think about it. We target specific opportunities that are really closely adjacent and synergistic to what we do today. Clearly, as you pointed out, the strong balance sheet gives us optionality to return capital or look at opportunities within M&A. I would say that the bar is a bit higher today even with the increase in free cash flow from the idea of doing something larger certainly would entail higher interest rates. And there's still a bit of uncertainty out there from a market perspective. So if we were going to acquire something, we'd want to be assured kind of the revenue stream coming in. So a bit higher bar at the moment. I think we're excited about our business as it exists today. And I think that disciplined M&A is how we think about it as a vector for long-term growth that we can use in addition to returning capital to shareholders through share buyback. So both are an option. I think we continue to look and be inquisitive in the marketplace from an M&A perspective, but it's got to meet our strategic vision. Yes. We -- I would say, yes. So we demonstrated our early version of AI companion really on mobile devices at NRF last year. This will be a continued advancement along those lines at NRF this year, working closely with our partners of Qualcomm, Google and some of our customers to continue to advance that opportunity. I think that this idea of a digital assistant on a mobile device, assisting the frontline worker that will drive productivity and really elevate the customer experiences. And we see this as being running the large language model on the device without requiring connectivities to the cloud. You can have connectivity cloud if you want or not. And a lot of our customers don't have a lot of connectivity out of their environments, think of retail stores, think of warehouses and others. So that's an advantage. And I think it's something that we're focused on and likely in 2025, what we'll see is some type of commercial offering from Zebra. We're working through what that really means from us, but I think it bodes well for us moving forward from working closely with our customers, making sure we're understanding how they're using and building large language models and their data, how do they protect that, how do they upgrade that, how do they keep it current within the mobile devices, and we're working closely with them to make that happen. So I think, yes, we're getting closer, continue our investment there and continue to move ahead with the development cycle in that area. And we're going to show a refresh demo at NRF that takes kind of the next level this year. Yes. In closing, I'd just like to say thank you to our employees and partners for their continued support and delivering strong Q3 financial results. It was about 10 years ago -- actually, 10 years ago this week, we closed the Enterprise acquisition. And I would say that our relentless focus on innovation and our continued commitment to our customers continues to drive differentiation for us in the marketplace and secure competitive wins. And I would say, we're well-positioned to advance our industry leadership as our end markets recover. So thank you. Have a great day, everyone."

            "name": "Nathan Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q3, total company sales grew 30.6% reflecting continued recovery in demand across our major product categories. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment grew 25.8%, primarily driven by printing and RFID. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 33% with strong growth in mobile computing and data capture solutions. Our services and software recurring revenue businesses grew 4% in the quarter. We realized double-digit sales growth across our regions. In North America, sales grew 22%, led by mobile computing and printing. EMEA sales grew 47% with strength in Northern Europe. Asia-Pacific sales grew 24% led by momentum in Southeast Asia and India along with stabilization in China. And sales grew 42% in Latin America with particular strength in Mexico and Brazil. Adjusted gross margin increased 430 basis points to 49.1% due to volume leverage and favorable business mix and adjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales improved by 580 basis points. This resulted in third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4%, a 980 basis point increase versus the prior year and a 90 basis point sequential improvement from Q2. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.49, a greater than 300% year-over-year increase. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. In the first nine months of 2024, we generated more than $650 million of free cash flow as EBITDA improved and we continue to drive significant improvements in working capital. We ended the quarter at a 1.6x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is within our target range. We resumed share repurchase activity in Q3 and now have increased flexibility given our improved cash flow, lower net debt, and $1.5 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility. Let's now turn to our outlook. We entered the fourth quarter with a solid backlog and pipeline of opportunities and expect sales growth between 28% and 31%. This outlook assumes continued recovery across our major product categories with an improved level of year-end spending by our customers including several large North American retail projects. We continue to cycle easier comparisons across the business due in part to significant destocking activity by our distributors during the second half of last year. Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 22% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3.80 to $4. Our fourth quarter outlook translates to full year sales growth of approximately 8%. Our full year adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 21% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of approximately $13.30 to $13.50 based on our Q4 guide. This represents stronger profitable growth than our prior outlook supported by increased momentum and demand recovery and continued focus on our cost structure. Free cash flow for the year is now expected to be at least $850 million. We continue to drive profitable growth while improving our working capital levels including rightsizing our inventory. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. With that, I will turn the call back to Bill. Yes, I think that's checks in, and again, when we look at it from an inventory perspective, they're at a good amount of days on hand in terms of where we'd like them to be entering the fourth quarter. So again, I think we feel, as Bill said, good about the overall inventory position here as we enter the quarter with the expectation for the year-end spend to come through. Yes. Yes. So Jamie, if you look at our gross margin in the third quarter, just over 49%, that's the highest gross margin we've had in recent history. But really benefited from lower large deal volume, obviously, there was a bit of a return, but still lower than as a percent than what we've seen historically. But good scaling on our fixed infrastructure. We completed the consolidation of our distribution centers in North America. That was the last piece of our restructuring actions midway through the quarter, so seeing that benefit flow through. The only thing I'd say is you look at what's implied in the Q4 EBITDA guide. We do expect a sequential decline in gross margin just as you know, again, based on the incremental large deal volumes coming through on the higher volume. And I'd say that's still kind of the wild card if you look into 2025 is, what that large deal mix look like as we enter the year and as we go throughout the year, as we think about the kind of the gross margin dynamics. Hi, Tommy. Yes, Meta, just when you look at it from an OpEx perspective, I'd say a couple of things. One, the full benefit of the restructuring is really embedded in the OpEx for the second half of the -- in the P&L. Really the incremental gross -- incremental restructuring benefits to go are primarily in gross margin and really related to the flow-through of the closure of the DC in North America. So the team is really now focused on how we scale and drive productivity across the OpEx infrastructure that we have. And there's some really exciting things that teams are working around the use of AI to drive productivity in terms of supply chain forecasting, order management or how we leverage generative AI for technology support, software code generation, again, all allowing us to scale on the -- and drive efficiency of what we have today. So I think that's really the focus is scaling on the structure that we have today with the tools and technology that are available. Hey Brian, let me start. I think, one, if you look back at our prior guide, we really assumed a similar level of demand from Q2 continuing into the second half with only really a modest increase for year-end spending. And what we wanted to see was the real commitments the POs starting to come through from our customers before embedding that in the guide. And I think that's what we saw through the second half of the third quarter and here in the early part of the fourth quarter. So really the conversion of that pipeline coming through, which is what we wanted to see to have the confidence to raise the guide as we are today. So I think that's really the difference. It's just that conversion of the pipeline really picked up in the later part of the third quarter and here in the early part of the fourth quarter where we had the confidence based on those commitments from our customers to raise the guide for the full year and see that year-end spend start to really come through here in the fourth quarter. Well, too early to speculate on the impact on all the various scenarios that could come out of next week's election. But we have been focused on some of the new tariffs that have been planned for 2026 and how we build alternatives so we can respond accordingly. So the team is actively working on mitigation plans for some of the new tariffs that are coming into place. And we continue to work -- actively work with our supply chain partners. We've been doing this since 2019 to diversify the supply base to improve resiliency overall as well as prepare for any future tariff changes. So I'd say right now, it's various scenario planning of what the different options could be, but our primary focus has been improved overall resiliency of our supply chain, so that we can respond, whether it's tariffs, geopolitical or natural disasters, how we make sure we have that structure in place to respond accordingly, that's really been the focus of the teams. And then obviously, depending on the outcome of the election and policies coming from that will respond and pivoted accordingly. Yes. So we -- if you look at an aggregate in terms of dollars, it's almost close to 50% of finished goods production is outside of China, still a vast majority of the component supply chain remains within China, and that's really the trickier or more stickier part of the supply chain to move just given how embedded it is within that market. So again, we moved a significant portion of the manufacturing up really to support North America into places like Malaysia, Vietnam, back in 2019, that's continued to ramp over the last several years. But I think it's important to note, we didn't move all North American volume out of China. Some products, just given the relative volume or the return on investment still made sense to produce in China for the North American market, even with the higher tariffs. So that's, again, the inflation, and we offset that with higher pricing, the pricing actions we took back then. So that's the equation we're working through now, which is what more can be move, should be move, if and when any additional tariffs are enacted. So that's what the team is scenario planning out, but also I want to make sure we make the right business decision that gives us long-term resiliency as well as follows where the supply chain is going because we do rely on, again, components and subassemblies and making sure that we're not too far dislocated from where the those source components are coming from. So it's a pretty complex equation that the team is working through. But we're lucky that we have supply chain partners that in and around the region that we work with to work and solve that challenge. I think based on what we said earlier, I think the expectation is to be pretty -- Q4 is maybe not back to a full recovery, but it's still -- there's been a pretty big step-up in what we saw from Q2 to Q3 and Q3 to Q4 with year-end spend. There is several large deployments within the fourth quarter. So I would -- that's why we said we'd expect it to be more maybe like a historical seasonality as you go into next year because of the year-end demand we're seeing and some of the large deployments here in the fourth quarter. Yes, Guy, I think maybe just to start because we haven't touched on it. So obviously, the free cash flow for the year-to-date, over $650 million, almost $850 million higher than from last year. So just really tremendous work by the team on working capital improvements. We've reduced inventory year-to-date by over $160 million. So it's great to see the actions that we put in place starting to flow through in the reduction in working capital and seeing that come through free cash flow. So it really puts us in a great position exiting the year and going into next year. And as you mentioned, we returned to share repurchases in slightly here in the third -- back in the third quarter. And we're continuing to take a systemic approach to share repurchases here in the quarter and as we go into next year. But with the debt leverage ratio at 1.6x, which is on the low end of the target range, overall comfortable with the net debt cash position, but puts us in a nice position to really return to either returning capital to shareholders or as you mentioned, giving us capacity for M&A opportunities as they arise. Yes, Brad, as you mentioned, so if you look at our EBITDA guide of 22%, it's up just over 0.5 point from -- sequentially from Q3, and again, primarily driven by the volume leverage. And I think the real change is just the deal mix overall with the higher mix of large deals and some of the large deployments in North America that somewhat of a drag sequentially on gross margin, driving that down a bit. And OpEx relatively flat just based on some of the project timing. So and the majority of any incremental gross margin on a sequential basis is embedded within gross margin. So I think that's really the -- no other kind of -- I think Q3 obviously came through stronger just seeing all the different actions flow through on the higher volume. And then the real change from Q3 to Q4 is just the mix within the portfolio."

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Steele: Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's second quarter earnings conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially and we refer you to the factors discussed in our SEC filings. During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of this slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales performance are year-on-year and on a constant currency basis. This presentation will include prepared remarks from Bill Burns, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill will begin with a discussion of our second quarter results. Nathan will then provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our third quarter and revised full year outlook. Bill will conclude with progress on advancing our strategic priorities. Following the prepared remarks, Bill and Nathan will take your questions. Now, let's turn to Slide 4, as I hand it over to Bill.\nBill Burns: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Our teams executed well in the second quarter delivering sales and earnings results above the high end of our outlook. For the quarter, we realized sales of $1.2 billion approximately flat to the prior year. An adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.5%, a 70 basis point decrease, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.18, a 3% decrease from the prior year. As we discussed in our last earnings call, during the first quarter, we began to see modest recovery in retail and e-commerce. In the second quarter, we saw signs of momentum across other end markets, including healthcare, where we realized double-digit growth. Mobile computing returned to growth across each of our vertical end markets led by healthcare and retail. The growth in mobile computing was offset by declines across our other major product categories where year-on-year comparisons are more challenging and we were in earlier stages of recovery. Services and software saw modest growth in the quarter. While we are encouraged by early momentum and demand, we continue to see cautious spending behavior from our customers on large deployments which have not yet returned to historical levels. Another highlight was our sequential improvement in profitability due to improved gross margin and the benefits of our restructuring actions. Our plan to deliver $120 million of net annualized operating savings is on track and substantially complete. Given our second quarter performance, progress in our cost actions, and early signs of momentum and demand, we are raising our full year outlook for sales and profitability. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q2 financial results and discuss our revised 2024 outlook.\nNathan Winters: Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q2, total company sales were approximately flat, reflecting early signs of momentum demand beyond retail and e-commerce. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment declined 14.4%, primarily driven by printing and RFID on challenging prior year comparisons. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 8.2% with double-digit growth in mobile computing partially offset by a decline in data capture solutions. We saw modest growth in services and software. Performance was mixed across our regions. In North America, sales decreased 7% with fewer large orders in retail and transportation and logistics, partially offset by strong growth in healthcare. In EMEA, sales increased 10%, driven by mobile computing. In Asia-Pacific, sales declined 3% with continued weakness in China and challenging compares in Australia and Japan, partially offset by growth in Southeast Asia. And sales increased 7% in Latin America led by Brazil. From a sequential perspective, total Q2 sales were slightly higher than Q1, with growth in nearly all product categories as we realized modest improvement in demand throughout the quarter in manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation and logistics. Adjusted gross margin increased 60 basis points to 48.6% as we benefited from cycling premium supply chain costs in the prior year in favorable effects. Adjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales increased 110 basis points. This was driven by normalized incentive compensation expense partially offset by approximately $25 million of incremental net savings from our restructuring actions. This resulted in second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.5%, a 70 basis point decrease versus the prior year, and a 60 basis point sequential improvement from Q1. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.18, a 3.3% year-over-year decrease. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. In the first half of 2024, we generated $389 million of free cash flow as we drove improvements in working capital. We ended the quarter at a 2.4x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is within our target range and we had approximately $1.5 billion of capacity on a revolving credit facility as of quarter end. We diversified our capital structure during the second quarter by issuing $500 million of senior unsecured notes, while retiring a receivable financing facility that matured in May. We also terminated our remaining interest rate swap agreements for $77 million of cash proceeds. We have been prioritizing debt pay down and now have increased flexibility given our lower debt balance and improved cash flow. Let's now turn to our outlook. For Q3, we expect sales growth between 25% and 28% compared to the prior year. This outlook assumes continued stability of demand trends across our major product categories with broad-based growth as we cycle easier compares across the business, including significant destocking activity by our distributors during the second half of last year. We entered the third quarter with a solid backlog and pipeline of opportunities. That said, we are not anticipating an increase in large order activity considering the conversion rates on our pipeline remain lower than historical levels as customers continue to be cautious in what remains an uncertain environment. We would like to see additional momentum in large orders before factoring in a stronger recovery. Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin is now expected to be between 20% and 21%, driven by expense leveraging from higher sales volume with benefits from restructuring actions partially offset by normalized incentive compensation expense. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3 to $3.30. We have raised our guide for the full year, reflecting our second quarter performance and early signs of momentum and demand. We now expect sales growth between 4% and 7% for the year and adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $12.30 to $12.90. Free cash flow for the year is now expected to be at least $700 million. We have been making progress rightsizing inventory in our balance sheet and improving cash conversion. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. With that, I will turn the call back to Bill.\nBill Burns: Thank you, Nathan. Zebra is well-positioned to benefit from secular trends that support our long-term growth. These include labor and resource constraints, track and trace mandates, increased consumer expectations, and the need for real time supply chain visibility. We help our customers digitize their environments and automate their workflows through our comprehensive portfolio of innovative solutions, including purpose-built hardware, software, and services. We empower frontline workers to execute tasks more effectively by navigating constant change in real-time through advanced capabilities including automation, prescriptive analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. At our Innovation Day event in May, we demonstrated how we transform workflows across the supply chain to drive positive outcomes for enterprises across our end market. Our products and solutions are mission critical to enable visibility that consumers and enterprises now expect throughout the entire supply chain. On Slide 11, you will see Zebra solutions can touch a product 30x from its origination to the point of last mile delivery. Let's briefly walk through the journey with a few high level exams. In manufacturing, our machine vision solutions provide quality inspection and track and trace visibility throughout the process. In a warehouse, our wearable mobile computers, autonomous mobile robots and comprehensive RFID portfolio transform receiving, picking and shipping. As the product arrives at a store, associates are equipped with Zebra software running on our mobile computers to assist customers' stock inventory and fulfill online orders. And when an item is delivered to your home, you receive a notification and picture from Zebra's handheld device verifying on time quality delivery. As you'll see on Slide 12, our customers leverage our solutions to optimize workflows across a broad range of end markets. We empower enterprises to drive productivity and better serve their customers, shoppers, and patients. We are seeing Zebra's competitive differentiation in mobile computing solutions drive wins across our vertical end markets. Customers value the capabilities we embed in the software layer of our devices that they leverage to transform workflows and improve outcome. For example, we secured a mobile computing win with the commercial airline utilizing our mobile package dimensioning solution enabled through AI. Also, a North American retailer will leverage Zebra's work cloud collaboration software on their new wearable mobile computers, connecting their associates to drive better outcomes in their stores. Additionally, we are able to displace consumer cell phones at a European retailer with our mobile computers and Zebra's Identity Guardian solution. It provides multifactor authentication for a shared device environment that brings security, productivity, and convenience to the front line. It is also notable that mobile computing contributed to double-digit sales growth in healthcare. Over the past year, our teams have been successfully selling the benefits of our solutions and clinical mobility that empower caregivers while delivering lower total cost of ownership for hospital systems. We have been displacing consumer cell phones with our devices and there continues to be a long runway of opportunity for equipping more clinicians with mobile computers. In closing, we expect to see broad-based growth in the second half as we cycle much easier comparisons and benefit from momentum beyond retail. We maintain strong conviction in our long-term opportunity for Zebra as we elevate our strategic role with our customers through our innovative portfolio of solutions. Our sales and cost initiatives have positioned us well for profitable growth as our end markets continue to recover. I will now hand it back to Mike.\nMike Steele: Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call to Q&A. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up to give everyone a chance to participate.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDamian Karas: Hey, good morning, everyone. Congrats on the quarter.\nBill Burns: Good morning, Damian.\nDamian Karas: Bill, I wanted to get your thoughts on what you suspect it's going to take to bring some of the larger project activity back into the fold, and maybe you could just give us a sense on, it sounds like you're not expecting much this year. How much upside to your guidance do you think there would be if you do in fact start to see a return sooner rather than later?\nBill Burns: Yes, Damian, I think that if we look back to Q1, we saw early signs of recovery, as we talked about last quarter in retail and e-commerce. We're certainly encouraged by the better than expected sales results in Q2, which really, we saw momentum, as we said around beyond retail really. And really, it was driven by mid-tier and run rate business. So large deal activity was pretty consistent in Q2 coming off of Q1, but still well below historic levels. So I think that we see customers overall continue to cite uncertainty to us in the market, their markets, their end markets, which really is reflecting in their purchasing behavior. I'd say that large deployments overall are being spread more to these mid-size deals or smaller deals, and being spread out over a longer period of time because of this, and I think ultimately, when they're placing small orders, they're placing those to add to their installed base or for new applications or expansion opportunities to-date. So I think that the pipeline of opportunities remains strong. I think there's optimism on the part of our partners and customers. I think we'd like to see more momentum in large orders. So we saw the first uptick in large orders in the first quarter kind of flat the second quarter. So we feel okay about that. We saw growth in mid-tier and run rate. I just think we'd like to see more large order activity to call a broader base recovery. So I think now we're seeing strength in mobile computing, strength across kind of large orders, medium and small. But we just want to see more large orders really from our customers. And I think it's just driven by their caution of what's happening in macro today.\nDamian Karas: Great. That makes sense. And I just want to ask you on the cost front, it seems like there's been a pick back up in shipping rates, and I know that was a little bit of a headwind for you guys in past years. To what extent have you been maybe experiencing some of that cost inflation and maybe just talk through what's kind of in your guidance for the rest of the year? Thanks.\nNathan Winters: Yes. Damian, so we have seen a modest increase in rates due to whether that's some of the Red Sea issues or now with the stronger demand, particularly on the ocean rates. I'd say it's a modest impact in terms of incremental costs that we've included in our full year guide. But the team's again working several actions in terms of the different air modes, how we leverage cost off to improve transit time, as well as again working with our partners around the forecast for the remainder of year to get ahead of that, the second half demand and mitigate as much of that as possible. So there is absolutely seeing some increase, but I'd say it's pretty modest at this point and within our second half guide.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning, and congratulations on a nice quarter. I guess, just my first question, I guess, what struck me in the quarter, your EVM margins were much better than I thought, and I think even better than your expectations. I think you were guiding to down margin sequentially. So can you just speak to the drivers behind that? I guess, that's my first question. And then I'll stop there and then I'll give you my second question after, I guess.\nNathan Winters: Good morning, Jamie. So, yes, if you look at overall gross margins at 48.6%, this is our highest gross margin quarter in three years, benefiting from the level of large deals. So the strength in run rate and mid-tier is a positive for gross margin in particular within the EVM segment. We're also seeing continued strength in our service and software margins again, which is heavily less more weighted towards EVM, as well as now fully rolling over all the premium supply chain costs. So again, I think it was part of that was just the strength in the quarter and really seeing the incremental volume fall through to the bottom line, driving the sequential improvement in gross margin both within EVM particularly.\nJamie Cook: Okay. And then I guess, just given the strength in the margin this quarter, and I mean, I don't think your EBITDA margin guide is now, what 20% to 21%, I think before it was about 20%. I'm just wondering why we wouldn't see better pull-through in the back half of the year, in particular with the top-line growth that you would see relative to declines or flat revenues in the second quarter.\nNathan Winters: Yes. If you look at our EBITDA guide for the third quarter of 20% to 21% again year-on-year, that's up primarily due to volume leverage, nearly 9 points. And I think we expect similar deal as well as business mix Q2 to Q3 such that you get a similar margin profile from Q2 to Q3. So if you look at the Q3 guide, effectively flat to Q2 based on that assumption of kind of the underlying mix of deals as well as the business unit mix gives us that similar profile. And I'd say the other really don't expect the same level of incremental benefits sequentially as we were able to realize some of the incremental benefits in Q2 from the restructuring actions. And then you do see that modest uptick implied in the guide for the fourth quarter on the incremental volume.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.\nBill Burns: Good morning.\nNathan Winters: Good morning, Tommy.\nTommy Moll: First question on the large order activity. At this point where we're nearly through July, how fully baked are your customer budgets for this year? And at what point does the large deal conversation really start to become one centered around 2025, when a lot of the customer budgets are refreshed?\nBill Burns: I think that, Tommy, I'd say that customers continue to scrutinize their budgets even as we're well into the year, right? And I think that some of those have to do with, in the past, we've seen kind of year-end spending from our customers, but I think that the uncertainty around the economy is still kind of weighing on them in large deployments and what will happen in kind of second half of year here. So I think that we typically not have visibility quite yet into whether there'll be year-end spending by our customers. We're talking about certainly a pipeline of opportunities that they see. And then the question is, do they move ahead with those in late 2024 or into 2025. I think that from a macro perspective, whether it's interest rates or presidential election or manufacturing production, all those shipping parcel, parcels, shipments have just started to inch up and turn to more positive volumes or growth in volume. So I think all those kind of weighing on their business, and I think there's even though they've got budgets, it's kind of the reluctance to move ahead with those, really because of the macro factors overall. And I think that we'd expect those to continue to kind of stabilize. They can get more confidence in their business and then abate as we get into kind of second half year and into 2025. But I'd say, overall, many discussions with our customers regarding projects; it's really about just taking longer to kind of move those forward still. Now, again, we saw a large order activity about flat Q1 to Q2 overall, and we saw this pickup in mid-tier run rates. So these are all positive signs. Growth outside of retail, which we really saw in first quarter into a broader segment. Mobile computing was the first to decline and the first to return to growth we expected that. So I think everything's moving in the right direction. So I think that -- I think our customers just don't know for kind of year-end 2024 and into 2025, but we're optimistic, I would say, that everything's moving in the right direction.\nTommy Moll: And Bill, just from a competitive standpoint, is there anything that you've sensed having changed particularly in a large deal context where you've seen other market participants perhaps become more aggressive on price or whatever other factor?\nBill Burns: Yes. No, I would say that really the competitive environment hasn't changed a lot. Overall, we're certainly continuing to maintain share in the marketplace. We feel good about our differentiation that we bring to the marketplace with the depth and breadth of our solutions, our competitive advantages, scale, technology, leadership, our partner community, our go-to-market, our relationships with our customers. So the large deal, phenomenon not coming, not returned to historic levels is not really about Zebra. It's truly about the market. And we don't really see any mark change from a competitive perspective. We're always going to have competitors out there, large and small, and then that continues to be the case. So nothing there. And we feel good about our market position and continue to win in the market.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoe Giordano: Hey guys, good morning.\nBill Burns: Good morning.\nNathan Winters: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Giordano: Bill, you had mentioned, I guess, it was last quarter that distributors were asking for more product than you were willing to sell because, but you were hesitant because you wanted to make sure you understood where it was going and try to prevent a future buildup of inventory that then needs to get liquidated again. Like, what's the update on that? Have you kind of started to give them what they're requesting?\nNathan Winters: Yes, Joe. This is Nathan. I can take that. I'd say overall, the global channel inventory as we look at it from days on hand is still at a normalized level. I think you have pockets around the world, where there's still a little bit of rebalancing both driving down inventory in the channel as well as where there's incremental needs. And I think similar to where we were last quarter, it's working with each one of those partners across the region to ensure that they have the appropriate level of inventory for the demand they're expecting and that we see in the pipeline. So again, it remains very collaborative. I'd say similar position where we were in Q1, where there's always some that want a little bit more. And again, just trying to make sure we have the right amount in the channel to support our end users, but not getting ahead of ourselves, given some of the uncertainty that we've talked about.\nJoe Giordano: Fair enough. And then just if I could ask on some of your smaller businesses, can you give us an update on trends within like RFID and with Matrox and Fetch and maybe how you see those businesses in terms of like growth in size exiting this year?\nBill Burns: Yes. I can take that, Joe. I'd say, RFID challenging kind of second quarter on compares from cycling large opportunities a year ago. I would say that overall would expect return to growth in second half year. We're continue to -- we move into the second half really with strong backlog and pipeline of opportunities across not just retail but transportation, logistics, manufacturing. So we're seeing continued use cases across RFID, including moving beyond apparel to general merchandise inside retail. Clearly track and trace across the supply chain, parcel tracking within T&L, baggage tracking within airlines, so lots of opportunities across RFID. I would say machine vision. We continue to be excited about the opportunity within machine vision, challenging market at the moment. And our Matrox acquisition, when we acquired that asset, we knew was heavily weighted towards semiconductor equipment manufacturing, which is still a challenge segment as well. So decline in the quarter in machine vision, but we feel good about it overall. We saw strength in our Adaptive Vision acquisition. So software -- machine vision software in the quarter that was a bright spot. I'd say that the diversification of that business, which was our focus all along with the Matrox business diversify into areas like automotive and logistics into new areas. We also had our organic investment in machine vision, which really applies more to logistics area. That diversification is going well. Ultimately, we're calling on more customers. We're seeing more opportunities. We're continuing to invest in go-to-market across the globe in just seeing more opportunities is across machine vision. So we feel good about that in a great opportunity for Zebra overall. I'd say software -- our software assets, we're seeing the combination of our mobile devices, especially in the wearable space now with some of our assets in software that we're pretty excited about. So the word cloud solutions really focus on retail and then leveraging our mobile device in the hands of retail associates. And we continue to advance and bring those solutions together and combine that with things like wearable mobile computing. We've seen some early wins there. So we feel good about the portfolio. They're a smaller segment of the market, right, or, sorry, our not market, meaning smaller segment of our business overall or piece of our business. So really mobile computing returning to growth, other segments being more challenged. These are areas that we see as driving the future growth of Zebra.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Hey, good morning, guys.\nBill Burns: Good morning.\nNathan Winters: Good morning.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. So I want to get your thoughts on potential upgrades of devices, especially in 2025. Do you have any data you can share around the age of your installed base? Because presumably a lot of these devices were sold during COVID and we should start to see a natural need to upgrade these in the next year, I would think.\nBill Burns: I'd say overall we're, from a mobile computing perspective, I'd say that our customers have really been absorbing the capacity that they've built out during the pandemic more than anything else. So I think there's clearly continued upgrade cycles across all of our customers. But from the idea that they built out so much capacity during the pandemic that they're using that capacity today, and then as the economy slowed, that created even more capacity, so they're ever using that capacity off, I think we're seeing customers move into the idea that they've absorbed some of the capacity and are beginning to buy again. But that's kind of early signs of what we're seeing. I'd say that there's a solid pipeline of opportunities for mobile computing overall, both in kind of refresh new use cases continue to add to the number of devices inside our customer base. And we continue to see competitive wins across the portfolio. So I think the upgrades are out there, the refreshers are out there, and ultimately some customers are sweating assets a bit more, others are leveraging what they have today. And I think that we're confident that as the macro environment gets better, our customers will continue to upgrade our devices and we'll see an uptick in large orders within our business, which will marry with what we're seeing as kind of medium in run rate business growing in second quarter.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes. Okay. Okay. And then you're raising your free cash flow expectations again and just kind of given where we are things looking to start to improve, and you probably have some confidence here. Where do you see capital allocation going into the year-end? Is M&A -- will see some M&A come to fruition before year-end? Or is there a focus more on share repurchase? Or how are you thinking about things?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So I think on the first part, again, please raise the guide for free cash flow to over $700 million, including the final settlement, as well as the swap sale in the second quarter. So -- and the improvement overall in working capital to get us above the 100% free cash flow conversion. And as you say, the -- really the prior -- we've prioritized debt paydown as well working on our capital structure in the first half of the year. So ending the second quarter just under our below the target range of 2.5x debt leverage, and that will sequentially improve as we move through the year. I think in terms of overall priority, they remain unchanged. The first is organic growth getting the business back to the growth trajectory we need it to be and want it to be along with the right profitability levels. M&A continues to be a lever. And I think now with the improved cash flow as well as our overall capital structure, we have additional flexibility for share repurchases as we move through the year. So Bill, you want to touch on the M&A brochure?\nBill Burns: Yes. I guess, I'd say that our M&A philosophy really remains unchanged. I think we continue to leverage M&A where it makes sense to advance our vision and our overall strategy. I'd say in the short-term, the bar is probably higher based on kind of macro uncertainty and then higher interest rates. But I would say that we continue to target select assets that ultimately are closely adjacent and synergistic to our business today. As Nate said, we've got a strong balance sheet and flexibility to continue to look at companies and we continue to be inquisitive. But the bar is higher at the moment.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of questions, just on the healthcare strength that you saw. I know that that had been a relatively they had been in a more challenged spend environment. So just wondering, how broad-based that is. Is that kind of new project based or just any detail there? And then second question, EMEA looked like a source of strength for you guys. I think we've seen that across some other companies. And so is that a matter of, they're just coming from a very depressed environment. And so we're coming off of a lower base and that's where some of the EMEA strength is. Are you -- are there any trends in EMEA that you think are worth calling out? Thanks.\nBill Burns: Yes. So I'll start with healthcare and then jump to EMEA. Healthcare, I'd say overall, mobile computing drove the growth in healthcare. It really is our team's focus on clinical mobility and really total cost of ownership. We've seen in the past a significant number of consumer devices used in that space. And I think that we're seeing healthcare systems realize that the total cost of ownership of Zebra devices is well-positioned for them in an environment of tighter budgets and thinner margins overall within healthcare. And we add a lot of value, ultimately by improving productivity of healthcare workers, getting data into electronic medical record systems, and then ultimately enhancing patient safety overall. So I think the automating of workflows, the digitizing the information around assets and patients and staff is of value that our healthcare customers are seeing. I think a medium to longer-term opportunity we're now seeing is things like home healthcare that remains an opportunity for us. So things like tablets in that area, in home healthcare. So we're excited about that. Healthcare has always been a smaller piece of our business, but in one of the faster growing areas, and certainly that happened in Q2. I would say, if we move to EMEA, say overall strength in EMEA was relatively easy compare in Q2 compared to the other regions. Overall, the positive, I'd say in EMEA is that we saw some larger projects move ahead outside of retail. So this is one of the places where we've seen some growth in P&L outside of retail, and some competitive wins in EMEA. So we feel good about that. Manufacturing remains challenging in EMEA today. So I think that kind of mixed overall feel good about some P&L orders, large P&L orders, easier to compare where manufacturing makes challenging. So I think overall, I think we want to see North American EMEA, we'd expect to come out of this first, but we saw some strength in Latin America too. So I think mixed results across the region.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Brad Hewitt with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nBrad Hewitt: Hey, good morning, guys. Wolfe Research, not sure what happened there.\nBill Burns: Sorry, Brad. We missed the question. You broke up there during the question.\nBrad Hewitt: Yes, sorry. So, just curious if you could elaborate a little more on what you're assuming in the second half from the top-line perspective. So at the mid-point of your full year guidance, it implies revenue in the second half, essentially flat with the Q2 run rate. So can you help me reconcile that versus kind of the early signs of momentum in mobile computing and also given the typical positive seasonality in Q4?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So if you look at our full year guide of 4 to 7 with a mid-point of 5.5, I think from a year-on-year perspective, really driven by what we see is double-digit growth in the second half demand, it's about 5 points for the year where again, if you look at the full year, a lot of moving parts where the destocking from last year accounts for about 7 points of growth. But then we had the challenging comps in the first half that offset that. So again, really the full year growth is driven by underlying strength in the business in the second half. As we said, we see modest demand increases across each of our vertical markets. That's inclusive of the Q2 beat. So I think we look at it as really the strength we saw in Q2 continuing into the third quarter. I think similar to how we structured the guide over the last several quarters of not anticipating or expecting sequential improvement. But what have we seen here in the most recent weeks and months? We see that continuing here in July in terms of that stability in the business, albeit at a bit higher level than we saw as we entered the second quarter with modest increase as we go into the fourth quarter. So as Bill highlighted before, typically a lot of the year-end spend that we see from our customers has leaned towards large orders in the past, and again, being thoughtful about how we embed those in the guide until we have more certainty and commitments from our customers on moving forward with those projects before including it for our full year guide. So I think, we think it's grounded in what we see today, given that visibility into the large deployments and appropriate.\nBrad Hewitt: Okay. That's helpful. And then you guys have talked in recent quarters about your expectation for seasonally lower OpEx spend in the second half of the year. Just curious if you could kind of shine some more light on that. And then if we look at the implied Q4 EBITDA margins about 21%, can you talk about some of the puts and takes there on a sequential basis?\nNathan Winters: Yes. So if you look just historically, sometimes it is hard to see. But typically, as we go throughout the year, just based on when a lot of our trade shows, sales, kickoff meetings, timing of benefits, et cetera, tend to be more weighted towards the first half of the year. Then as you get into the back half of the year, you get into holiday seasons around the world, as well as some of the lower benefit costs as you go sequentially through the year. So I'd say a lot of the sequential improvement is timing-related now that we've kind of flushed through all of the restructuring benefits, or the vast majority of restructuring benefits through the P&L. And then look at the sequential improvement in profitability from Q3 to Q4 is really based on that slight improvement in OpEx, as well as the higher volume leverage flowing to the bottom line.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, guys. Question for you on the software and services. With mobile computing being up double-digits, I guess, I would have expected a little bit of that flowing through more in software and services design as people sign up for their warranty contracts and things of that nature. Can you pass a little bit of light on the connection between the two and the modest growth that you had and that's in that line item this quarter?\nBill Burns: Yes. Keith, this is Bill. I would say that overall, we've seen consistent growth in software and services over the last several quarters. So we feel good about that. I'd say we continue to see strong attach rates with mobile devices. So the revenue lags that, of course, right? So ultimately, the strong attach rates continue with uptick in mobile computers. So no real change there. It's just not tied directly to revenue in the exact quarter depending on when the mobile devices are sold. So I wouldn't take anything away from that. We're continuing to see strong attach rates, really driven by things like upgrades around OS and security patches and so forth continue to be an important aspect of our customers buying service from us. I can say that we've seen in the past some customers extend their support agreements, and I think we're seeing a little bit less of that now, which is again a good sign for ultimately our customers looking to upgrade the mobile devices in the future. So maybe a little bit of less of that, if anything else. Overall, I'd say software and services, an important piece of our business, recurring revenue that we and others like. So I think all good there, nothing really to read into it, Keith.\nKeith Housum: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up, in terms of like, as most people are starting with here toward the refresh cycle of all the devices bought four or five years ago. How should we think about pricing today versus where it was, say, four years ago? Are people trading down to a lower mobile computer? Or as you think about most customers, is it relatively similar? But how do you think about pricing, what people are buying today versus four years ago?\nBill Burns: Yes. I think we're -- obviously, there's customers are making choices on the type of device they need in their environment. So I think that we continue to see that. So if somebody needs a more rugged device, and their experience was they had a lower tier device and they beat those devices up, they'll move to a higher tier device and you'll see the reverse. If they had a good experience with a more rugged device, could they go to a more mid-tier type device? I think that happens all the time. I think we continue to focus on value that the devices bring to our customers to keep ASPs as high as we can, and then if we can't, to make sure that we're getting the same gross margin out of each tier of the portfolio. In the past, we've tiered the portfolio kind of good, better, best, or all the way down to kind of value tier. And I think that's allowed us to keep our pricing and margins higher. So if you want a higher spec device, you pay us a higher price for it. In the early days, call it, eight, nine years ago of -- eight years ago, nine years ago on Android, we didn't have as many flavors of devices. So you're discounting higher end devices to meet value to your players. We don't do that today. We're really tearing the portfolio has allowed us to kind of have conviction around our prices at the higher end, and we feel good about our customers and working closely with them to select the right device for the right use case.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrian Drab: Hi, thanks. You mentioned that you're seeing sequential improvement in all the end markets, including T&L and manufacturing. There have been some signs of further softness across the manufacturing industry in recent weeks, and I'm just wondering if you are seeing any of that show up in your customers buying patterns or if it really does feel like a pretty stable sequential improvement environment now.\nBill Burns: Yes. I'd say that, as we talked about before, I think in Q1 we saw kind of retail and e-commerce first, and now we've seen mobile computer -- mobile computing kind of grow across each of the vertical end markets. So retail, manufacturing, healthcare, I'd say that, we're still seeing challenges in manufacturing and overall, demand, especially in a large deal isn't back to the historical levels that it's been in the past. But in manufacturing specifically, we saw sequential improvement from Q1 and Q2. But I still think EMEA, for instance, we're clearly seeing a challenge in manufacturing where I would say overall, I wouldn't call manufacturing back to normalized levels in any way. But I think we just saw some sequential improvement, which I think was good. Manufacturing is an important segment for us. We see we've got lesser -- we're lesser penetrated in through manufacturing. Our relationship with manufacturing, many times are more in the warehouse or the finished production and moving that through the supply chain and some of our new solutions around machine vision, rugged tablets, our demand planning solutions for CPG manufacturers, all play into having a broader portfolio for manufacturing. So we ultimately see that a segment for growth for us, but I think still challenging the short-term. We would say, we're seeing probably about the same as you're seeing.\nBrian Drab: Okay. Thank you. And then for follow-up, are you seeing opportunities potentially to gain share when we come out of this tougher environment? I mean, you obviously have a great balance sheet. You're not letting up in terms of investment in technology and customer service. Can you comment on how you might be potentially better positioned in both AIT and EVM ultimately?\nBill Burns: I'd say that overall, we feel good about where we're at in our customer relationships. We continue to stay very close to our customers as we're a trusted partner to them. And I think that as the macro environment gets better, I think we would say that they will begin to buy again, especially, and we'll see large orders improve as we continue to solve growth in medium and run rate in second quarter. The installed base continues to grow. And I think that from that perspective, I think that we're seeing increased use cases across our customer environment. So some are still sweating their assets that will shift. They can't do that forever. So I think overall, we see the momentum in demand continuing and then continue to broaden both by vertical market to your first question, and then by size of order and order activity across small, medium and large type orders.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. Please go ahead.\nRob Mason: Yes. Good morning, Bill and Nathan. The strength in the gross margin, I think has already been commented on. But as you think about when large orders do come back, how should we be thinking or how are you thinking about sensitivity in the gross margin profile today versus, say, maybe 2018, 2019? Have you done anything different structurally around either your supply agreements or just as you mentioned, Bill, tiering the portfolio that would suggest the gross margin holds up better? Or does it have that kind of return to maybe 2018, 2019 levels when large orders come back?\nNathan Winters: Yes. Rob, I'd say just if you look, I would say, no structural difference in terms of maybe the differential between the margin we'd expect on a large yield versus kind of the run rate business. So that hasn't structurally changed. The one thing, if you go back, I think the one aspect, particularly if you go from 2019 -- since 2019, whether that's tariffs, the supply chain, challenges the rapid growth. So it's pretty challenging to find what's the right baseline. And if you go back to 2018, right, so I'm just the lower rev -- lower base. So I think, if you look at the business today, I think the strength across the portfolio is -- we have strength across the portfolio in terms of the underlying gross margin and being able to leverage the scale and leverage our distribution network as we've grown to inherently build a higher gross margin profile company. But again, I think it will be somewhat decremental as we in gross margin once large deals recover, but still incremental, as you think about it from a EBITDA rates. So I think there's the balance of -- there's still incremental margin to the total -- to the bottom line, but slightly dilutive in gross margin.\nRob Mason: I see. And just to go back on the regional discussions, my math, and maybe this is not totally right, but it did look like North America stepped down a little bit sequentially. If that is the case, just any color that you could provide on what you saw there.\nBill Burns: Yes, Rob, North America was down year-on-year. I'm not sure it's sequentially -- down sequentially as well. Nate's warning to me, I would say, overall mobile computing return to growth in North America, again, just like we saw across the other regions. So that clearly was positive. The other product categories were down, as a year ago, in first and second quarter, we saw supply chain challenges abate from a print and a scanning perspective. So the compares were pretty challenging for both those businesses. They had really good Q1 and Q2s of last year. So I think that impacted North America. In North America typically has an overweight on large deals as well. So growth in North America, we really like to see kind of run rate, mid-tier and large deals because the large deals are overweight typically in North America. So we saw kind of flat sequentially, as we said before, large deal activity, Q1 to Q2. And really, North America would like to see more large deal activity come back here in kind of second half, and then hopefully some year-end spend and then growth into 2025. So that's really the story of North America.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham. Please go ahead.\nChris Grenga: Hi, good morning. This is Chris Grenga on for Jim. Most of my questions have been addressed, but maybe just one for me. The chart with the touchpoints is very helpful. Just wondering, as you look ahead to seeing larger projects return, are you preparing for large project activity to be in any one of these particular nodes, whether it's factory, warehouse store, or last mile, et cetera, or do large projects generally entail a broad coverage of one or many of those nodes, or just how you're thinking about that? Thank you.\nBill Burns: Yes. I think we see large deals typically across the portfolio, so that it's all about kind of size and scale of customers. So in retail, it'd be larger -- the larger retailers that would refresh and have refresh cycles or upgrades or larger orders across the portfolio that we do a multiple store upgrade, refreshing to a new device for instance. In transportation logistics, you'd see things like the fleet of last mile delivery drivers as an example. Upgrade across transportation logistics, or postal workers around the globe would be examples of large opportunities. So I think we see them across each one, they're a bit different. In manufacturing, it's more location by location or plant by plant, as opposed to large deal activities, would see in retail where they do multiple stores at once, or T&L, where they do an entire fleet of drivers or postal. So it's a bit different by nodes. So manufacturing more broken down by site, retail more, multiple stores at once, T&L more larger deployments, I would say, healthcare more, more like manufacturing, not as large a hospital systems more kind of hospital at a time or multiple hospitals at a time, but not those large refreshes. So I'd say large refreshes and upgrades more tied to retail and T&L.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Guy Hardwick with Freedom Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nGuy Hardwick: Hi, good morning. Zebra issued some --\nBill Burns: Good morning.\nGuy Hardwick: Good morning. Good morning, all. Zebra issued some very interesting press releases regarding working with Qualcomm to run LLMs on Zebra mobile computers, but without the requirements to kind of regular uploads to the cloud. So I was just wondering, Bill, just how close is Zebra to kind of a broad-based introduction of these kind of AI digital system products in mobile computing?\nBill Burns: Yes. So we think of AI across the portfolio in several different ways. First is that just our core business really is about collecting real-time data, and that's used as kind of intelligence to feed AI models overall. So whether that's a barcode reading a printed label with the information on it back into the cloud, whether that's an RFID tag being read. So the idea of digitizing a customers' environment, getting real time data to AI models, and ultimately to generate insights in AI is a fundamental thing we do in our -- the value of our data that we collect feeds these models. So I think that's kind of the baseline of when we think about AI. Second is traditional, more traditional AI is used about probably in 50 different solutions across the portfolio today, whether that's optical character recognition or product recognition, navigation for autonomous mobile robots, package dimensioning inside our software around workforce planning and demand forecasting. So traditional AI is kind of the second piece that we think of across the portfolio. The third is what you're kind of referring to is the idea that it's AI assistant, right? Is that empowering the frontline worker through more information, leveraging a large language model on the device without connectivity to the cloud? Working closely with Qualcomm and Google, as you mentioned, to go do that. We've demonstrated that it -- at our National Retail Federation Trade Show in January. We demonstrated again at our Innovation Day. We also demonstrated at Google's Trade Show earlier this year as well. So I think we're excited about that opportunity. Today, it's not commercialized yet. We're continuing to work closely with our customers to really understand all the use cases, what's required around that. How do we best leverage which model in that case, how do we keep the model up to date? So a lot of different discussions with our customers about what that offering will look like. But we're excited to work with Google and Qualcomm on it. Our customers excited about having a digital assistant within retail or manufacturing. You think of all the use cases of making your newest worker as good as your most experienced worker, having all of your standard operating procedures at the hands of the associate or the frontline worker, being able to tie that back to what's the source of the data being restricted to the individual customer. So we think it's a driver long-term for our mobile devices and a differentiator for us. But today, still early days, more pilots and demonstrating and working with customers than commercialization.\nGuy Hardwick: If you don't mind just me pushing a little bit on that. I mean, in terms of commercialization, is it a 2025 timeframe or beyond that?\nBill Burns: Yes, no, likely -- like we're going to have more demonstrations around it that we're planning today with some of our customers at the National Retail show as we go the next step along with it next year in 2025, and then probably commercialization in likely in 2025 as I would see it today.\nGuy Hardwick: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And the final question comes from Rob Jamieson with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Jamieson: Hey good morning, Bill and Nathan. Congrats on the quarter.\nBill Burns: Thanks, Rob.\nRob Jamieson: Just wanted to kind of ask more of a high level question around and go back and revisit M&A and add an adjacencies. I mean, you all have a great installed base and a lot of market share across your various verticals. As we think about you adding adjacencies and what you've done recently, adding things like Fetch and Matrox and other markets, given the comfort that your customers have with you, do you think that as we return to like a more normal environment that will kind of, you can leverage that and your customers be more comfortable maybe deploying a new solution, something more kind of like advanced like Fetch or Matrox in their operations.\nBill Burns: I think that clearly are strategic relationships with our customer creates an opportunity for us to deploy a broader set of solutions within those customers. That, that trusted partnership allows us to go do that. I think the backdrop of the environment hasn't been all that great. So machine vision is a good example of that. It's been kind of a challenging market and then our diversification just takes time where we were centered really around more semiconductor manufacturing and moving outside of that. So -- but that is -- our customers are giving us an opportunity to sell solutions in that space because we have a relationship with them already. I think we're seeing the same thing across retail software and robotics, as you mentioned. So clearly it matters. Our breadth and depth of our current portfolio, the relationship we have with them, the fact that we're a trusted partner to them; it's not always the same persona. So it's not -- I wouldn't say it's easy. Meaning we've got to get from our current buyer of our solutions and the person who deploys our solutions today to someone else within the organization. So if we're working with somebody inside a manufacturer more on the distribution of products at the end of the manufacturing line, we now need to form a relationship with somebody on the manufacturing line for things like machine vision solutions to stick with that example. So it's not easy, but it's certainly doable. And our -- because of our trusted relationship, they're willing to make that introduction. And then we've got to earn our way in and prove our solutions into that manufacturing space. But we're given that opportunity because of those relationships.\nRob Jamieson: That's helpful. And I appreciate it. And then to the extent that you're willing to share, just as you talked about adjacencies and things you're looking at in the portfolio, is there anything either high level or specific that you're looking at the moment, just especially as your leverage is getting to an attractive point here. Thank you.\nBill Burns: No, I think that again, it's -- we think of assets that are closely adjacent to the portfolio overall, and really synergistic to what we do today. We'd like to do things in the similar vertical markets for the reasons we just talked about. So all that comes into play. And then ultimately, as I said before, a little bit higher hurdles at the moment, given the macro uncertainty to make sure that if we were going to acquire something, or the certainty of revenue, and then ultimately higher risk interest rates weigh down on that a little bit. So I think overall, we continue to be inquisitive. It's got to be the right asset and the right fit for Zebra.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Burns for any closing remarks.\nBill Burns: Yes. I'd like just to wrap up by saying thank you to our employees and partners for continued support of Zebra and execution in the second quarter. We're now positioned for growth in the second half year. So have a great day everyone. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bill Burns",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Our teams executed well in the second quarter delivering sales and earnings results above the high end of our outlook. For the quarter, we realized sales of $1.2 billion approximately flat to the prior year. An adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.5%, a 70 basis point decrease, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.18, a 3% decrease from the prior year. As we discussed in our last earnings call, during the first quarter, we began to see modest recovery in retail and e-commerce. In the second quarter, we saw signs of momentum across other end markets, including healthcare, where we realized double-digit growth. Mobile computing returned to growth across each of our vertical end markets led by healthcare and retail. The growth in mobile computing was offset by declines across our other major product categories where year-on-year comparisons are more challenging and we were in earlier stages of recovery. Services and software saw modest growth in the quarter. While we are encouraged by early momentum and demand, we continue to see cautious spending behavior from our customers on large deployments which have not yet returned to historical levels. Another highlight was our sequential improvement in profitability due to improved gross margin and the benefits of our restructuring actions. Our plan to deliver $120 million of net annualized operating savings is on track and substantially complete. Given our second quarter performance, progress in our cost actions, and early signs of momentum and demand, we are raising our full year outlook for sales and profitability. I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q2 financial results and discuss our revised 2024 outlook. Thank you, Nathan. Zebra is well-positioned to benefit from secular trends that support our long-term growth. These include labor and resource constraints, track and trace mandates, increased consumer expectations, and the need for real time supply chain visibility. We help our customers digitize their environments and automate their workflows through our comprehensive portfolio of innovative solutions, including purpose-built hardware, software, and services. We empower frontline workers to execute tasks more effectively by navigating constant change in real-time through advanced capabilities including automation, prescriptive analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. At our Innovation Day event in May, we demonstrated how we transform workflows across the supply chain to drive positive outcomes for enterprises across our end market. Our products and solutions are mission critical to enable visibility that consumers and enterprises now expect throughout the entire supply chain. On Slide 11, you will see Zebra solutions can touch a product 30x from its origination to the point of last mile delivery. Let's briefly walk through the journey with a few high level exams. In manufacturing, our machine vision solutions provide quality inspection and track and trace visibility throughout the process. In a warehouse, our wearable mobile computers, autonomous mobile robots and comprehensive RFID portfolio transform receiving, picking and shipping. As the product arrives at a store, associates are equipped with Zebra software running on our mobile computers to assist customers' stock inventory and fulfill online orders. And when an item is delivered to your home, you receive a notification and picture from Zebra's handheld device verifying on time quality delivery. As you'll see on Slide 12, our customers leverage our solutions to optimize workflows across a broad range of end markets. We empower enterprises to drive productivity and better serve their customers, shoppers, and patients. We are seeing Zebra's competitive differentiation in mobile computing solutions drive wins across our vertical end markets. Customers value the capabilities we embed in the software layer of our devices that they leverage to transform workflows and improve outcome. For example, we secured a mobile computing win with the commercial airline utilizing our mobile package dimensioning solution enabled through AI. Also, a North American retailer will leverage Zebra's work cloud collaboration software on their new wearable mobile computers, connecting their associates to drive better outcomes in their stores. Additionally, we are able to displace consumer cell phones at a European retailer with our mobile computers and Zebra's Identity Guardian solution. It provides multifactor authentication for a shared device environment that brings security, productivity, and convenience to the front line. It is also notable that mobile computing contributed to double-digit sales growth in healthcare. Over the past year, our teams have been successfully selling the benefits of our solutions and clinical mobility that empower caregivers while delivering lower total cost of ownership for hospital systems. We have been displacing consumer cell phones with our devices and there continues to be a long runway of opportunity for equipping more clinicians with mobile computers. In closing, we expect to see broad-based growth in the second half as we cycle much easier comparisons and benefit from momentum beyond retail. We maintain strong conviction in our long-term opportunity for Zebra as we elevate our strategic role with our customers through our innovative portfolio of solutions. Our sales and cost initiatives have positioned us well for profitable growth as our end markets continue to recover. I will now hand it back to Mike. Good morning, Damian. Yes, Damian, I think that if we look back to Q1, we saw early signs of recovery, as we talked about last quarter in retail and e-commerce. We're certainly encouraged by the better than expected sales results in Q2, which really, we saw momentum, as we said around beyond retail really. And really, it was driven by mid-tier and run rate business. So large deal activity was pretty consistent in Q2 coming off of Q1, but still well below historic levels. So I think that we see customers overall continue to cite uncertainty to us in the market, their markets, their end markets, which really is reflecting in their purchasing behavior. I'd say that large deployments overall are being spread more to these mid-size deals or smaller deals, and being spread out over a longer period of time because of this, and I think ultimately, when they're placing small orders, they're placing those to add to their installed base or for new applications or expansion opportunities to-date. So I think that the pipeline of opportunities remains strong. I think there's optimism on the part of our partners and customers. I think we'd like to see more momentum in large orders. So we saw the first uptick in large orders in the first quarter kind of flat the second quarter. So we feel okay about that. We saw growth in mid-tier and run rate. I just think we'd like to see more large order activity to call a broader base recovery. So I think now we're seeing strength in mobile computing, strength across kind of large orders, medium and small. But we just want to see more large orders really from our customers. And I think it's just driven by their caution of what's happening in macro today. Good morning. I think that, Tommy, I'd say that customers continue to scrutinize their budgets even as we're well into the year, right? And I think that some of those have to do with, in the past, we've seen kind of year-end spending from our customers, but I think that the uncertainty around the economy is still kind of weighing on them in large deployments and what will happen in kind of second half of year here. So I think that we typically not have visibility quite yet into whether there'll be year-end spending by our customers. We're talking about certainly a pipeline of opportunities that they see. And then the question is, do they move ahead with those in late 2024 or into 2025. I think that from a macro perspective, whether it's interest rates or presidential election or manufacturing production, all those shipping parcel, parcels, shipments have just started to inch up and turn to more positive volumes or growth in volume. So I think all those kind of weighing on their business, and I think there's even though they've got budgets, it's kind of the reluctance to move ahead with those, really because of the macro factors overall. And I think that we'd expect those to continue to kind of stabilize. They can get more confidence in their business and then abate as we get into kind of second half year and into 2025. But I'd say, overall, many discussions with our customers regarding projects; it's really about just taking longer to kind of move those forward still. Now, again, we saw a large order activity about flat Q1 to Q2 overall, and we saw this pickup in mid-tier run rates. So these are all positive signs. Growth outside of retail, which we really saw in first quarter into a broader segment. Mobile computing was the first to decline and the first to return to growth we expected that. So I think everything's moving in the right direction. So I think that -- I think our customers just don't know for kind of year-end 2024 and into 2025, but we're optimistic, I would say, that everything's moving in the right direction. Yes. No, I would say that really the competitive environment hasn't changed a lot. Overall, we're certainly continuing to maintain share in the marketplace. We feel good about our differentiation that we bring to the marketplace with the depth and breadth of our solutions, our competitive advantages, scale, technology, leadership, our partner community, our go-to-market, our relationships with our customers. So the large deal, phenomenon not coming, not returned to historic levels is not really about Zebra. It's truly about the market. And we don't really see any mark change from a competitive perspective. We're always going to have competitors out there, large and small, and then that continues to be the case. So nothing there. And we feel good about our market position and continue to win in the market. Good morning. Yes. I can take that, Joe. I'd say, RFID challenging kind of second quarter on compares from cycling large opportunities a year ago. I would say that overall would expect return to growth in second half year. We're continue to -- we move into the second half really with strong backlog and pipeline of opportunities across not just retail but transportation, logistics, manufacturing. So we're seeing continued use cases across RFID, including moving beyond apparel to general merchandise inside retail. Clearly track and trace across the supply chain, parcel tracking within T&L, baggage tracking within airlines, so lots of opportunities across RFID. I would say machine vision. We continue to be excited about the opportunity within machine vision, challenging market at the moment. And our Matrox acquisition, when we acquired that asset, we knew was heavily weighted towards semiconductor equipment manufacturing, which is still a challenge segment as well. So decline in the quarter in machine vision, but we feel good about it overall. We saw strength in our Adaptive Vision acquisition. So software -- machine vision software in the quarter that was a bright spot. I'd say that the diversification of that business, which was our focus all along with the Matrox business diversify into areas like automotive and logistics into new areas. We also had our organic investment in machine vision, which really applies more to logistics area. That diversification is going well. Ultimately, we're calling on more customers. We're seeing more opportunities. We're continuing to invest in go-to-market across the globe in just seeing more opportunities is across machine vision. So we feel good about that in a great opportunity for Zebra overall. I'd say software -- our software assets, we're seeing the combination of our mobile devices, especially in the wearable space now with some of our assets in software that we're pretty excited about. So the word cloud solutions really focus on retail and then leveraging our mobile device in the hands of retail associates. And we continue to advance and bring those solutions together and combine that with things like wearable mobile computing. We've seen some early wins there. So we feel good about the portfolio. They're a smaller segment of the market, right, or, sorry, our not market, meaning smaller segment of our business overall or piece of our business. So really mobile computing returning to growth, other segments being more challenged. These are areas that we see as driving the future growth of Zebra. Good morning. I'd say overall we're, from a mobile computing perspective, I'd say that our customers have really been absorbing the capacity that they've built out during the pandemic more than anything else. So I think there's clearly continued upgrade cycles across all of our customers. But from the idea that they built out so much capacity during the pandemic that they're using that capacity today, and then as the economy slowed, that created even more capacity, so they're ever using that capacity off, I think we're seeing customers move into the idea that they've absorbed some of the capacity and are beginning to buy again. But that's kind of early signs of what we're seeing. I'd say that there's a solid pipeline of opportunities for mobile computing overall, both in kind of refresh new use cases continue to add to the number of devices inside our customer base. And we continue to see competitive wins across the portfolio. So I think the upgrades are out there, the refreshers are out there, and ultimately some customers are sweating assets a bit more, others are leveraging what they have today. And I think that we're confident that as the macro environment gets better, our customers will continue to upgrade our devices and we'll see an uptick in large orders within our business, which will marry with what we're seeing as kind of medium in run rate business growing in second quarter. Yes. I guess, I'd say that our M&A philosophy really remains unchanged. I think we continue to leverage M&A where it makes sense to advance our vision and our overall strategy. I'd say in the short-term, the bar is probably higher based on kind of macro uncertainty and then higher interest rates. But I would say that we continue to target select assets that ultimately are closely adjacent and synergistic to our business today. As Nate said, we've got a strong balance sheet and flexibility to continue to look at companies and we continue to be inquisitive. But the bar is higher at the moment. Yes. So I'll start with healthcare and then jump to EMEA. Healthcare, I'd say overall, mobile computing drove the growth in healthcare. It really is our team's focus on clinical mobility and really total cost of ownership. We've seen in the past a significant number of consumer devices used in that space. And I think that we're seeing healthcare systems realize that the total cost of ownership of Zebra devices is well-positioned for them in an environment of tighter budgets and thinner margins overall within healthcare. And we add a lot of value, ultimately by improving productivity of healthcare workers, getting data into electronic medical record systems, and then ultimately enhancing patient safety overall. So I think the automating of workflows, the digitizing the information around assets and patients and staff is of value that our healthcare customers are seeing. I think a medium to longer-term opportunity we're now seeing is things like home healthcare that remains an opportunity for us. So things like tablets in that area, in home healthcare. So we're excited about that. Healthcare has always been a smaller piece of our business, but in one of the faster growing areas, and certainly that happened in Q2. I would say, if we move to EMEA, say overall strength in EMEA was relatively easy compare in Q2 compared to the other regions. Overall, the positive, I'd say in EMEA is that we saw some larger projects move ahead outside of retail. So this is one of the places where we've seen some growth in P&L outside of retail, and some competitive wins in EMEA. So we feel good about that. Manufacturing remains challenging in EMEA today. So I think that kind of mixed overall feel good about some P&L orders, large P&L orders, easier to compare where manufacturing makes challenging. So I think overall, I think we want to see North American EMEA, we'd expect to come out of this first, but we saw some strength in Latin America too. So I think mixed results across the region. Sorry, Brad. We missed the question. You broke up there during the question. Yes. Keith, this is Bill. I would say that overall, we've seen consistent growth in software and services over the last several quarters. So we feel good about that. I'd say we continue to see strong attach rates with mobile devices. So the revenue lags that, of course, right? So ultimately, the strong attach rates continue with uptick in mobile computers. So no real change there. It's just not tied directly to revenue in the exact quarter depending on when the mobile devices are sold. So I wouldn't take anything away from that. We're continuing to see strong attach rates, really driven by things like upgrades around OS and security patches and so forth continue to be an important aspect of our customers buying service from us. I can say that we've seen in the past some customers extend their support agreements, and I think we're seeing a little bit less of that now, which is again a good sign for ultimately our customers looking to upgrade the mobile devices in the future. So maybe a little bit of less of that, if anything else. Overall, I'd say software and services, an important piece of our business, recurring revenue that we and others like. So I think all good there, nothing really to read into it, Keith. Yes. I think we're -- obviously, there's customers are making choices on the type of device they need in their environment. So I think that we continue to see that. So if somebody needs a more rugged device, and their experience was they had a lower tier device and they beat those devices up, they'll move to a higher tier device and you'll see the reverse. If they had a good experience with a more rugged device, could they go to a more mid-tier type device? I think that happens all the time. I think we continue to focus on value that the devices bring to our customers to keep ASPs as high as we can, and then if we can't, to make sure that we're getting the same gross margin out of each tier of the portfolio. In the past, we've tiered the portfolio kind of good, better, best, or all the way down to kind of value tier. And I think that's allowed us to keep our pricing and margins higher. So if you want a higher spec device, you pay us a higher price for it. In the early days, call it, eight, nine years ago of -- eight years ago, nine years ago on Android, we didn't have as many flavors of devices. So you're discounting higher end devices to meet value to your players. We don't do that today. We're really tearing the portfolio has allowed us to kind of have conviction around our prices at the higher end, and we feel good about our customers and working closely with them to select the right device for the right use case. Yes. I'd say that, as we talked about before, I think in Q1 we saw kind of retail and e-commerce first, and now we've seen mobile computer -- mobile computing kind of grow across each of the vertical end markets. So retail, manufacturing, healthcare, I'd say that, we're still seeing challenges in manufacturing and overall, demand, especially in a large deal isn't back to the historical levels that it's been in the past. But in manufacturing specifically, we saw sequential improvement from Q1 and Q2. But I still think EMEA, for instance, we're clearly seeing a challenge in manufacturing where I would say overall, I wouldn't call manufacturing back to normalized levels in any way. But I think we just saw some sequential improvement, which I think was good. Manufacturing is an important segment for us. We see we've got lesser -- we're lesser penetrated in through manufacturing. Our relationship with manufacturing, many times are more in the warehouse or the finished production and moving that through the supply chain and some of our new solutions around machine vision, rugged tablets, our demand planning solutions for CPG manufacturers, all play into having a broader portfolio for manufacturing. So we ultimately see that a segment for growth for us, but I think still challenging the short-term. We would say, we're seeing probably about the same as you're seeing. I'd say that overall, we feel good about where we're at in our customer relationships. We continue to stay very close to our customers as we're a trusted partner to them. And I think that as the macro environment gets better, I think we would say that they will begin to buy again, especially, and we'll see large orders improve as we continue to solve growth in medium and run rate in second quarter. The installed base continues to grow. And I think that from that perspective, I think that we're seeing increased use cases across our customer environment. So some are still sweating their assets that will shift. They can't do that forever. So I think overall, we see the momentum in demand continuing and then continue to broaden both by vertical market to your first question, and then by size of order and order activity across small, medium and large type orders. Yes, Rob, North America was down year-on-year. I'm not sure it's sequentially -- down sequentially as well. Nate's warning to me, I would say, overall mobile computing return to growth in North America, again, just like we saw across the other regions. So that clearly was positive. The other product categories were down, as a year ago, in first and second quarter, we saw supply chain challenges abate from a print and a scanning perspective. So the compares were pretty challenging for both those businesses. They had really good Q1 and Q2s of last year. So I think that impacted North America. In North America typically has an overweight on large deals as well. So growth in North America, we really like to see kind of run rate, mid-tier and large deals because the large deals are overweight typically in North America. So we saw kind of flat sequentially, as we said before, large deal activity, Q1 to Q2. And really, North America would like to see more large deal activity come back here in kind of second half, and then hopefully some year-end spend and then growth into 2025. So that's really the story of North America. Yes. I think we see large deals typically across the portfolio, so that it's all about kind of size and scale of customers. So in retail, it'd be larger -- the larger retailers that would refresh and have refresh cycles or upgrades or larger orders across the portfolio that we do a multiple store upgrade, refreshing to a new device for instance. In transportation logistics, you'd see things like the fleet of last mile delivery drivers as an example. Upgrade across transportation logistics, or postal workers around the globe would be examples of large opportunities. So I think we see them across each one, they're a bit different. In manufacturing, it's more location by location or plant by plant, as opposed to large deal activities, would see in retail where they do multiple stores at once, or T&L, where they do an entire fleet of drivers or postal. So it's a bit different by nodes. So manufacturing more broken down by site, retail more, multiple stores at once, T&L more larger deployments, I would say, healthcare more, more like manufacturing, not as large a hospital systems more kind of hospital at a time or multiple hospitals at a time, but not those large refreshes. So I'd say large refreshes and upgrades more tied to retail and T&L. Good morning. Yes. So we think of AI across the portfolio in several different ways. First is that just our core business really is about collecting real-time data, and that's used as kind of intelligence to feed AI models overall. So whether that's a barcode reading a printed label with the information on it back into the cloud, whether that's an RFID tag being read. So the idea of digitizing a customers' environment, getting real time data to AI models, and ultimately to generate insights in AI is a fundamental thing we do in our -- the value of our data that we collect feeds these models. So I think that's kind of the baseline of when we think about AI. Second is traditional, more traditional AI is used about probably in 50 different solutions across the portfolio today, whether that's optical character recognition or product recognition, navigation for autonomous mobile robots, package dimensioning inside our software around workforce planning and demand forecasting. So traditional AI is kind of the second piece that we think of across the portfolio. The third is what you're kind of referring to is the idea that it's AI assistant, right? Is that empowering the frontline worker through more information, leveraging a large language model on the device without connectivity to the cloud? Working closely with Qualcomm and Google, as you mentioned, to go do that. We've demonstrated that it -- at our National Retail Federation Trade Show in January. We demonstrated again at our Innovation Day. We also demonstrated at Google's Trade Show earlier this year as well. So I think we're excited about that opportunity. Today, it's not commercialized yet. We're continuing to work closely with our customers to really understand all the use cases, what's required around that. How do we best leverage which model in that case, how do we keep the model up to date? So a lot of different discussions with our customers about what that offering will look like. But we're excited to work with Google and Qualcomm on it. Our customers excited about having a digital assistant within retail or manufacturing. You think of all the use cases of making your newest worker as good as your most experienced worker, having all of your standard operating procedures at the hands of the associate or the frontline worker, being able to tie that back to what's the source of the data being restricted to the individual customer. So we think it's a driver long-term for our mobile devices and a differentiator for us. But today, still early days, more pilots and demonstrating and working with customers than commercialization. Yes, no, likely -- like we're going to have more demonstrations around it that we're planning today with some of our customers at the National Retail show as we go the next step along with it next year in 2025, and then probably commercialization in likely in 2025 as I would see it today. Thanks, Rob. I think that clearly are strategic relationships with our customer creates an opportunity for us to deploy a broader set of solutions within those customers. That, that trusted partnership allows us to go do that. I think the backdrop of the environment hasn't been all that great. So machine vision is a good example of that. It's been kind of a challenging market and then our diversification just takes time where we were centered really around more semiconductor manufacturing and moving outside of that. So -- but that is -- our customers are giving us an opportunity to sell solutions in that space because we have a relationship with them already. I think we're seeing the same thing across retail software and robotics, as you mentioned. So clearly it matters. Our breadth and depth of our current portfolio, the relationship we have with them, the fact that we're a trusted partner to them; it's not always the same persona. So it's not -- I wouldn't say it's easy. Meaning we've got to get from our current buyer of our solutions and the person who deploys our solutions today to someone else within the organization. So if we're working with somebody inside a manufacturer more on the distribution of products at the end of the manufacturing line, we now need to form a relationship with somebody on the manufacturing line for things like machine vision solutions to stick with that example. So it's not easy, but it's certainly doable. And our -- because of our trusted relationship, they're willing to make that introduction. And then we've got to earn our way in and prove our solutions into that manufacturing space. But we're given that opportunity because of those relationships. No, I think that again, it's -- we think of assets that are closely adjacent to the portfolio overall, and really synergistic to what we do today. We'd like to do things in the similar vertical markets for the reasons we just talked about. So all that comes into play. And then ultimately, as I said before, a little bit higher hurdles at the moment, given the macro uncertainty to make sure that if we were going to acquire something, or the certainty of revenue, and then ultimately higher risk interest rates weigh down on that a little bit. So I think overall, we continue to be inquisitive. It's got to be the right asset and the right fit for Zebra. Yes. I'd like just to wrap up by saying thank you to our employees and partners for continued support of Zebra and execution in the second quarter. We're now positioned for growth in the second half year. So have a great day everyone. Thank you."

            "name": "Nathan Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q2, total company sales were approximately flat, reflecting early signs of momentum demand beyond retail and e-commerce. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment declined 14.4%, primarily driven by printing and RFID on challenging prior year comparisons. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales increased 8.2% with double-digit growth in mobile computing partially offset by a decline in data capture solutions. We saw modest growth in services and software. Performance was mixed across our regions. In North America, sales decreased 7% with fewer large orders in retail and transportation and logistics, partially offset by strong growth in healthcare. In EMEA, sales increased 10%, driven by mobile computing. In Asia-Pacific, sales declined 3% with continued weakness in China and challenging compares in Australia and Japan, partially offset by growth in Southeast Asia. And sales increased 7% in Latin America led by Brazil. From a sequential perspective, total Q2 sales were slightly higher than Q1, with growth in nearly all product categories as we realized modest improvement in demand throughout the quarter in manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation and logistics. Adjusted gross margin increased 60 basis points to 48.6% as we benefited from cycling premium supply chain costs in the prior year in favorable effects. Adjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales increased 110 basis points. This was driven by normalized incentive compensation expense partially offset by approximately $25 million of incremental net savings from our restructuring actions. This resulted in second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.5%, a 70 basis point decrease versus the prior year, and a 60 basis point sequential improvement from Q1. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.18, a 3.3% year-over-year decrease. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. In the first half of 2024, we generated $389 million of free cash flow as we drove improvements in working capital. We ended the quarter at a 2.4x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is within our target range and we had approximately $1.5 billion of capacity on a revolving credit facility as of quarter end. We diversified our capital structure during the second quarter by issuing $500 million of senior unsecured notes, while retiring a receivable financing facility that matured in May. We also terminated our remaining interest rate swap agreements for $77 million of cash proceeds. We have been prioritizing debt pay down and now have increased flexibility given our lower debt balance and improved cash flow. Let's now turn to our outlook. For Q3, we expect sales growth between 25% and 28% compared to the prior year. This outlook assumes continued stability of demand trends across our major product categories with broad-based growth as we cycle easier compares across the business, including significant destocking activity by our distributors during the second half of last year. We entered the third quarter with a solid backlog and pipeline of opportunities. That said, we are not anticipating an increase in large order activity considering the conversion rates on our pipeline remain lower than historical levels as customers continue to be cautious in what remains an uncertain environment. We would like to see additional momentum in large orders before factoring in a stronger recovery. Q3 adjusted EBITDA margin is now expected to be between 20% and 21%, driven by expense leveraging from higher sales volume with benefits from restructuring actions partially offset by normalized incentive compensation expense. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3 to $3.30. We have raised our guide for the full year, reflecting our second quarter performance and early signs of momentum and demand. We now expect sales growth between 4% and 7% for the year and adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are now expected to be in the range of $12.30 to $12.90. Free cash flow for the year is now expected to be at least $700 million. We have been making progress rightsizing inventory in our balance sheet and improving cash conversion. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. With that, I will turn the call back to Bill. Yes. Damian, so we have seen a modest increase in rates due to whether that's some of the Red Sea issues or now with the stronger demand, particularly on the ocean rates. I'd say it's a modest impact in terms of incremental costs that we've included in our full year guide. But the team's again working several actions in terms of the different air modes, how we leverage cost off to improve transit time, as well as again working with our partners around the forecast for the remainder of year to get ahead of that, the second half demand and mitigate as much of that as possible. So there is absolutely seeing some increase, but I'd say it's pretty modest at this point and within our second half guide. Good morning, Jamie. So, yes, if you look at overall gross margins at 48.6%, this is our highest gross margin quarter in three years, benefiting from the level of large deals. So the strength in run rate and mid-tier is a positive for gross margin in particular within the EVM segment. We're also seeing continued strength in our service and software margins again, which is heavily less more weighted towards EVM, as well as now fully rolling over all the premium supply chain costs. So again, I think it was part of that was just the strength in the quarter and really seeing the incremental volume fall through to the bottom line, driving the sequential improvement in gross margin both within EVM particularly. Yes. If you look at our EBITDA guide for the third quarter of 20% to 21% again year-on-year, that's up primarily due to volume leverage, nearly 9 points. And I think we expect similar deal as well as business mix Q2 to Q3 such that you get a similar margin profile from Q2 to Q3. So if you look at the Q3 guide, effectively flat to Q2 based on that assumption of kind of the underlying mix of deals as well as the business unit mix gives us that similar profile. And I'd say the other really don't expect the same level of incremental benefits sequentially as we were able to realize some of the incremental benefits in Q2 from the restructuring actions. And then you do see that modest uptick implied in the guide for the fourth quarter on the incremental volume. Good morning, Tommy. Good morning, Joe. Yes, Joe. This is Nathan. I can take that. I'd say overall, the global channel inventory as we look at it from days on hand is still at a normalized level. I think you have pockets around the world, where there's still a little bit of rebalancing both driving down inventory in the channel as well as where there's incremental needs. And I think similar to where we were last quarter, it's working with each one of those partners across the region to ensure that they have the appropriate level of inventory for the demand they're expecting and that we see in the pipeline. So again, it remains very collaborative. I'd say similar position where we were in Q1, where there's always some that want a little bit more. And again, just trying to make sure we have the right amount in the channel to support our end users, but not getting ahead of ourselves, given some of the uncertainty that we've talked about. Good morning. Yes. So I think on the first part, again, please raise the guide for free cash flow to over $700 million, including the final settlement, as well as the swap sale in the second quarter. So -- and the improvement overall in working capital to get us above the 100% free cash flow conversion. And as you say, the -- really the prior -- we've prioritized debt paydown as well working on our capital structure in the first half of the year. So ending the second quarter just under our below the target range of 2.5x debt leverage, and that will sequentially improve as we move through the year. I think in terms of overall priority, they remain unchanged. The first is organic growth getting the business back to the growth trajectory we need it to be and want it to be along with the right profitability levels. M&A continues to be a lever. And I think now with the improved cash flow as well as our overall capital structure, we have additional flexibility for share repurchases as we move through the year. So Bill, you want to touch on the M&A brochure? Yes. So if you look at our full year guide of 4 to 7 with a mid-point of 5.5, I think from a year-on-year perspective, really driven by what we see is double-digit growth in the second half demand, it's about 5 points for the year where again, if you look at the full year, a lot of moving parts where the destocking from last year accounts for about 7 points of growth. But then we had the challenging comps in the first half that offset that. So again, really the full year growth is driven by underlying strength in the business in the second half. As we said, we see modest demand increases across each of our vertical markets. That's inclusive of the Q2 beat. So I think we look at it as really the strength we saw in Q2 continuing into the third quarter. I think similar to how we structured the guide over the last several quarters of not anticipating or expecting sequential improvement. But what have we seen here in the most recent weeks and months? We see that continuing here in July in terms of that stability in the business, albeit at a bit higher level than we saw as we entered the second quarter with modest increase as we go into the fourth quarter. So as Bill highlighted before, typically a lot of the year-end spend that we see from our customers has leaned towards large orders in the past, and again, being thoughtful about how we embed those in the guide until we have more certainty and commitments from our customers on moving forward with those projects before including it for our full year guide. So I think, we think it's grounded in what we see today, given that visibility into the large deployments and appropriate. Yes. So if you look just historically, sometimes it is hard to see. But typically, as we go throughout the year, just based on when a lot of our trade shows, sales, kickoff meetings, timing of benefits, et cetera, tend to be more weighted towards the first half of the year. Then as you get into the back half of the year, you get into holiday seasons around the world, as well as some of the lower benefit costs as you go sequentially through the year. So I'd say a lot of the sequential improvement is timing-related now that we've kind of flushed through all of the restructuring benefits, or the vast majority of restructuring benefits through the P&L. And then look at the sequential improvement in profitability from Q3 to Q4 is really based on that slight improvement in OpEx, as well as the higher volume leverage flowing to the bottom line. Yes. Rob, I'd say just if you look, I would say, no structural difference in terms of maybe the differential between the margin we'd expect on a large yield versus kind of the run rate business. So that hasn't structurally changed. The one thing, if you go back, I think the one aspect, particularly if you go from 2019 -- since 2019, whether that's tariffs, the supply chain, challenges the rapid growth. So it's pretty challenging to find what's the right baseline. And if you go back to 2018, right, so I'm just the lower rev -- lower base. So I think, if you look at the business today, I think the strength across the portfolio is -- we have strength across the portfolio in terms of the underlying gross margin and being able to leverage the scale and leverage our distribution network as we've grown to inherently build a higher gross margin profile company. But again, I think it will be somewhat decremental as we in gross margin once large deals recover, but still incremental, as you think about it from a EBITDA rates. So I think there's the balance of -- there's still incremental margin to the total -- to the bottom line, but slightly dilutive in gross margin."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Steele, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nMichael Steele: Good morning, and welcome to Zebra's first quarter earnings conference call. This presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least 1 year. Our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially, and we refer you to the factors discussed in our SEC filings.\n During this call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures as we describe our business performance. You can find reconciliations at the end of this slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales performance are year-over-year and on a constant currency basis. \n This presentation will include prepared remarks from Bill Burns, our Chief Executive Officer; and Nathan Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill will begin with a discussion of our first quarter results and strategic actions. Nathan will then provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our second quarter and full year outlook. Bill will conclude with progress on advancing our vision. Following the prepared remarks, Bill and Nathan will take your questions. Now let's turn to Slide 4 as I hand it over to Bill. \nWilliam Burns: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As expected, our first quarter performance was impacted by continued broad-based softness across our end markets and regions, which we began to experience in the second quarter of last year, resulting in a double-digit decline in sales and profitability. However, we are beginning to see a modest recovery in demand as we saw sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. We are particularly encouraged by the better-than-expected large order activity, which drove the upside for the quarter. That said, we are not yet seeing a broad-based recovery. And as a result, we continue to take an agile approach to navigating the current environment.  \n We also delivered another quarter of sequential improvement in profitability as a result of our restructuring actions and improved gross margin. Services and software were a bright spot in the quarter with improved sales and profitability, helping to offset the year-on-year sales declines across all product categories.  \n For the quarter, we realized sales of $1.2 billion, a 16.8% decline from the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%, a 150 basis point decrease and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.84, a 28% decrease from the prior year. We are pleased with the progress we have made on our previously announced actions to improve profitability and drive sales growth as our end markets recover. Our restructuring plans to deliver $120 million of net annualized operating savings is on track to be completed midyear. \n On the supply front, we made substantial improvement in our working capital driven by our renegotiation of long-term supply commitments and ongoing work to drive down component inventories with our contract manufacturers. We have also driven both tactical and strategic sales initiatives, including reallocation of resources to accelerate growth. Given the progress on our actions, we are raising our full year outlook for sales, margin and free cash flow.  \n I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q1 financial results and discuss our revised 2024 outlook. \nNathan Winters: Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q1, sales decreased 16.8% with declines across our regions, major product categories and customers of all sizes. Services as a Software were a bright spot in the quarter, with growth driven by increased units under support contract and retail software wins. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment declined 25.3% primarily driven by printing.  \n Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 11.8% with relative outperformance in mobile computing. Our Asia Pacific region saw the steepest sales declines led by continued weakness in China. From a sequential perspective, total Q1 sales were 16% higher than Q4 as distributors had completed their destocking process by year-end and we realized modest improvement in demand.  \n Adjusted gross margin increased 60 basis points to 48.1% supported by higher services and software margins and cycling premium supply chain costs in the prior year, all of which were partially offset by expense deleveraging from lower sales volumes. Adjusted operating expenses delevered 230 basis points as a percent of sales. The impact was mitigated by approximately $25 million of incremental net savings in the quarter from our restructuring actions. This resulted in first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%, a 150 basis point decrease versus the prior year and a 450 basis point sequential improvement from Q4.  \n Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.84, a 28% year-over-year decrease. Interest expense contributed to the decline, offset by a lower adjusted tax rate. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. We generated $111 million of free cash flow as we begin to realize benefits from reducing inventory levels. We ended the quarter at 2.6x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is slightly above the top end of our target range. And we had approximately $1.3 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility as of quarter end, providing ample flexibility.  \n Let's now turn to our outlook. For Q2, we expect sales to decrease between 1% and 5% compared to the prior year. We entered the second quarter with a solid backlog and pipeline of opportunities, particularly for mobile computing in retail and e-commerce. This outlook assumes a modest improvement in demand trends across our major product categories, with mobile computing and the EVM segment returning to growth as we cycle easier compares.  \n We anticipate Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be slightly above 19% driven by expense deleveraging from lower sales volume with the benefit from restructuring actions and lower premium supply chain costs, offset by normalized incentive compensation expense. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.90. We have raised our guide for the full year, reflecting our progress on actions to drive sales and profitability as our end markets have stabilized. \n Although there is optimism from partners and customers regarding recovery in the second half of the year, we would like to see additional momentum in large orders before factoring in a broader recovery. We now expect sales growth between 1% and 5% for the year, with adjusted EBITDA margin now expected to be approximately 20%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $11.25 to $12.25. And we now expect our free cash flow for the year to be at least $600 million, including the impact of our final $45 million settlement payment in the quarter.  \n We have been making progress rightsizing inventory in our balance sheet and improving cash conversion and have been prioritizing debt paydown in the near term. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. With that, I will turn the call back to Bill. \nWilliam Burns: Thank you, Nathan. As we look longer term, we continue to be well positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows for our customers. We remain focused on elevating Zebra as a premier solutions provider through a comprehensive portfolio of innovative solutions and our go-to-market ecosystem. Zebra empowers workers to execute test more effectively by navigating constant change in real time through advanced capabilities, including intelligent automation, machine learning, prescriptive analytics and artificial intelligence.  \n As you see on Slide 11, our customers leverage our solutions to optimize workflows across a broad range of end markets. We empower enterprises to increase collaboration and productivity and better serve their customers, shoppers and patients. In March, at the MODEX Manufacturing and Supply Chain trade show, Zebra, along with our partners, showcase our expanded portfolio of solutions that are modernizing workflows across the broader supply chain.  \n Managing operations has become complex with increased consumer expectations for inventory visibility and same-day deliveries. The event provided an opportunity to demonstrate how we improve key outcomes such as production quality, supply chain agility and capacity utilization. Machine vision was one of the many solutions we featured where we have enhanced our capabilities to address emerging use cases. We continue to build our market presence with a few notable wins.  \n A large state-owned European logistics company recently invested in thousands of Zebra machine vision cameras to enhance the speed and efficiency of inspections of government bonds and transaction documents. Additionally, an Asian manufacturer incorporate our machine vision cameras and frame grabbers, into their product sorting and quality control processes. This solution is significantly faster and more accurate than the previous manual approach.\n At HIMSS, the leading Global Healthcare Conference, Zebra and our partners demonstrated how our solutions improve the patient journey from check-in to bedside point-of-care as well as medical equipment track and trace. Additionally, the University of Maryland Health System shared how they are utilizing our clinical communications platform, which includes our mobile computers and work cloud software.  \n I'd also like to call out a win with a North America hospital network, who recently implemented thousands of Zebra printers, specifically enhancing its specimen tracking and labeling processes. These printers integrate with the electronic health record system facilitating noticeable organizational improvements across departments. Zebra's reputation for ease of use helps secure this win.  \n Recent wins in retail, demonstrate how customers are driving productivity, improving asset visibility, enhancing the experience for associates and shoppers. The European retailer selected thousands of Zebra mobile computers to replace their legacy devices from a competitor. The customer plans to pair our new mobile computers with their Zebra mobile printers to improve their price markdown, labeling and online order-picking processes.  \n The North America-based retail department store chain enhanced thousands of Zebra mobile computers by incorporating our device tracking software. Prior deployment of this software, the retailer experienced issues with misplaced devices in stores and fulfillment centers, resulting in wasted time and resources. Additionally, a North American grocer has expanded their installed base of Zebra mobile computers with thousands of additional units and implemented our work cloud software. The solution is expected to enhance operational efficiency among associates, improve employee communication and streamline inventory management within their stores.  \n On Slide 12, we highlight secular trends that we expect to support long-term growth for Zebra as we drive value for our customers. These include labor and resource constraints, real-time supply chain visibility, track and trace mandates and increased consumer expectations. We are hosting an innovation day on May 14 at our headquarters near Chicago where Nathan and I will be joined by other members of our leadership team to discuss how we digitize and automate workflows to drive positive business outcomes for customers across our end markets.  \n In closing, as we look forward to a long-term opportunity for Zebra, our conviction in the business remains strong. We continue to elevate our strategic role with our customers through our innovative portfolio of solutions while our cost and go-to-market actions are positioning us well for profitable growth as our end markets recover.  \n I will now hand it back to Mike. \nMichael Steele: [Operator Instructions] \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. \nJamie Cook: Nice quarter. I guess first question, can you just call out how much freight helped the first quarter lower freight cost? And then what's implied in the guide relative to how you guided last quarter?  And then I guess just my second question. The gross margins in the quarter struck me, in particular, the sorry, the EVM margins, which were up year-over-year. And so I'm just wondering if you could help us understand what drove the gross margin improvement on the sales decline there? \nNathan Winters: Yes. So, Jamie, I'll take that. So if you look for the -- particularly the freight in Q1, it was about 1 point year-on-year improvement just given the cycling through, now that we fully neutralize the premium supply chain costs between the operational actions and the price increases. So year-on-year, that was about 1 point of benefit in the quarter.  \n Yes, I'd say the other drivers for the relative strength in Q1 was both from the slightly higher volume as well as some favorable mix. Along with the service and software profitability and the strength we saw there, which is primarily in EVM, which is, I think, driving the benefit both sequentially as well as relative to our guide in the quarter. \nJamie Cook: And then just a follow-up, sorry, the larger order activity that you talked about in the quarter, which obviously isn't in the guide, and I guess would reflect some conservatism in the guide? If that continues, I mean, what's preventing you from putting that in that -- in the guidance if that continues, how would we think about the sales guidance relative to your sales growth of 1% to 5% ex-FX? \nNathan Winters: Yes. I think as we stated, we've seen some improvement in demand, particularly in mobile computing and retail, which drove the beat in Q1 as well as what we're expecting to see come through for the remainder of the year, driving the raise for the full year from 1% to 3%.  \n And so the way we think about the full year was we'd expect Q3 to look very similar to Q2, which looks similar to Q1, just in terms of run rate and trajectory, which as they maintain that relative strength in some of the large orders we've seen come through in the first quarter. But I would separate that from what we have yet to see, I'd say what's still kind of waiting to look at is the larger mega deals, mega deployments, that's still not coming through. The deal sizes are still in the, let's say, $1 million to $5 million range, some of the initial phases of the deployment.  \n So that's what you see carry through for the remainder of the year and inflected in the guide, but not that uptick in terms of the larger deployments. \nOperator: The next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. \nDamian Karas: I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on the large order activity, which you spoke? Could you give us a sense, right, is this sort of 1 or 2 customers that are placing rather large orders or are you kind of seeing just your larger customer base in general, start to bring back a larger quantity of project activity? If you could just maybe elaborate and provide any detail like which end markets and regions you're seeing some of these larger orders as well? \nWilliam Burns: Yes. I'd say overall in Q1 and into -- as we entered '24, we've really seen demand stabilize and we've seen modest improvement in large order activity overall. And it's been particularly in mobile computing, and it's been specific to retail as they've kind of wrapped up their year. So we're certainly encouraged by the better-than-expected sales results in Q1 as a result. And we'd expect modest improvement in demand as we continue to progress throughout the year. \n However, H2 is -- the growth there is primarily driven by lapping through the prior destocking activity that we've seen. So overall, I think as we anticipated, mobile computing is the first place that we're seeing recovery. We're seeing it in retail. Both of those were the first to be impacted coming through the cycle with COVID. And what we'd like to see is more visibility and momentum in order activity beyond what we've seen so far.  \n And I think we'd like to see it move from retail to T&L and manufacturing in other verticals before we'd call it kind of a broad-based recovery. \nDamian Karas: That's really helpful. And then a follow-up question on your guidance, just maybe ask a little bit differently. I know you guys have spoken of, right, this really large funnel, but just kind of a lack of conversion to orders. Guidance sort of has you sequentially second half sales comparable to the first half. Could you just tell us like what you're assuming for that funnel conversion, kind of a probability of some of those projects hitting in the back half? \nNathan Winters: Yes, I'd say the -- as I mentioned earlier, really the second half, I would call it, grounded and based on what we see today, both in terms of the orders velocity, what we're seeing in terms of being sold out through the channel as well as the conversion rates that we've experienced now over the last 2 quarters.  \n I'd say still lower conversion rates on our pipeline than we would have historically assumed based on what we experienced in the second half. But again, aligned with what we've experienced over the past 2 quarters. I think the big difference is, we're not assuming, we're making an assumption around a mega deployment just given that we've yet to see kind of firm commitments from our customers. There's a lot of optimism, discussions around those. \n But in terms of committing to move forward those projects or ensuring that they have the budget available in the year, that really remains the uncertainty and the way you look and see the second half look very similar to the first half because that's what we're experiencing and what we're seeing play out in the market. We think that's appropriate for the guide for the year. \nOperator: The next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. \nKeith Housum: In terms of Asia Pacific region, obviously, underperformed compared to the rest of the company. And I understand China is challenged right now, but perhaps can you just expand a little bit on what you're seeing here? And expectations for us and the pressures perhaps be a little bit longer lasting versus short-lasting? And just more color about the performance in that area, please? \nWilliam Burns: Yes. I mean, Keith, it's Bill. I think that overall, the Q1 performance was continued to impact by soft demand across all of the regions. So I think we start there. I think that as we've said, the relative outperformance was really in mobile computing, and we saw some bright spots in services and software clearly in the quarter. \n I would say the regions pretty much look the same, except Asia was, as you said, impacted probably more through the declines in China. I would say that we see Asia overall having China continued to a longer recovery for the China market. We've seen some bright spots again, in retail, again, in larger orders in Australia and New Zealand. So that was a positive for the Asia market.  \n I think we continue to see opportunities outside of China. So Southeast Asia and India with the investments in manufacturing there. We continue to see Japan as the longer-term opportunity for us as we're making investments there, and we have lower share there than other places. But I think we expect that China continue to remain a challenging moving forward. \nKeith Housum: All right. And just as a follow-up, Nathan, in terms of adjusted EBITDA, a little bit decline in the guidance you've given for 2Q versus 1Q. Sequentially, how should we think about the moving parts and the reason for a little bit lower adjusted EBITDA margins in the second quarter? \nNathan Winters: Keith, as you mentioned, our Q2 guide slightly above 19%, so down from the 19.9% in Q1. That's entirely driven by the seasonality of our retail software business, which you probably recall, but is seasonally higher in Q1 at accretive margins, just given the timing of retailers when they've performed their cycle counts and physical inventories, which is where that platform really focuses.  \n So that's the adjustment from Q1 to Q2. And the way I'd characterize it is the Q2 guide is fairly in line with how we've structured the full year going into it. I think Q1 was benefited by some of the cost actions coming in earlier, giving us confidence in the remainder of the year as well as some of the benefits in just a bit of -- a little bit better mix and revenue start of the year.  \n So -- but then Q2 in line with where we expected the year to play out and the sequential decline is entirely driven by the seasonality of our retail software business. \nOperator: The next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. \nThomas Moll: You've given us some context on the omnichannel retail and e-commerce end markets, but I wanted to ask for any other detail you could provide. In particular, on the e-commerce side, there are some anecdotes regarding finally hitting the end of this absorption phase from some of the overbuilding in years past. Are you seeing any signs of that on your side? \nWilliam Burns: Yes. I would say that overall, retail relatively outperformed, as we've talked about already. And we're seeing encouraging signs, right? We saw some modest year-end retail spending across Q4 and Q1. Some customers clearly have absorbed the capacity and it begin to buy again, as you've kind of referenced, Tommy. \n We've also seen some of the pushouts that took place in last year and really over the last 18 months or so, begin to come back. So we've seen those projects as we expected and we talked about for a long time, those projects will come back. What we've seen mostly is initiating of really Phase 1 of those projects and the customers not quite ready to commit to the full deployment.  \n So we've seen deployments that in the past would have been larger, even larger orders and full rollouts immediately, now a more conservative, let's start with that project, but roll it out over time and complete the deployment kind of later in the year. So we have confidence that there'll continue to be a recovery. I think we anticipated retail would recover first, followed by T&L and manufacturing and health care, and we're seeing that play out.  \n And we also anticipated, it would be mobile computing first as well, and that's what we're seeing. So the bright spots are really mobile computing and retail, retail and e-commerce. That capacity is being used off, retailers are beginning to bring those projects back, but they're doing it in a very measured way. And I think what we want to see is, retail, T&L, manufacturing, more of the vertical markets come back and more of that order activity, even more than we're seeing today and the uptick in orders before we call a broad-based recovery. \nThomas Moll: That's helpful. As a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the channel inventory levels. It sounds like there really wasn't any noise from a destocking perspective in the first quarter. But I'm curious what's your view on how many days on hand in the channel currently?  \n And if you think historically, do we sit today below what that historic level is? And does that imply at some point there may need to be a restock? \nNathan Winters: Yes, Tom, I think ending the Q1, somewhat to exit in Q4 that the global channel inventories measure that on a days-on-hand basis is normalized to support the current demand. So I'd say within the range that we'd expect on a global basis, there's puts and takes if you go by region and product families. So I think a nice improvement from where we were just 6 to 9 months ago.  \n And as you said, I think, no meaningful impact in the quarter or assumed in the full year guide in terms of changes -- relative changes in the distribution inventory levels. \nOperator: The next question comes from Brad Hewitt with Wells Fargo. \nBrad Hewitt: So you just talked about a return of some of the project deferrals from last year. I guess, how would you describe your pipeline and sort of overall visibility versus 6 months ago? It kind of feels like visibility across the space has been generally trending in a positive direction, but just any color on how your visibility looks relative to history would be helpful. \nWilliam Burns: I'd say that overall, we'd expect orders -- customer orders that continued to resume overall. I think that as I just talked about with Tommy's question, we've seen customers absorbing the capacity that's previously been built out. That's been more, again, focused on retail and e-commerce as opposed to the other verticals so far. I would say that the macroeconomy, kind of the uncertainty around that abating will certainly help as well. We're viewed as a trusted partner of our customers, and we're staying close to them across each of the verticals as we would see this order momentum picking up across other verticals as we progress through the year. \n We've got a large installed base, right? We're growing solutions. So we're continuing to work with our customers as well. Kind of on new solutions and new use cases. So overall, I would say that we anticipated large deployments kind of starting to come back. We anticipated in retail. We want to see more of that across manufacturing and T&L.  \n As I said, we'd like to see more of it to in kind of different size deals, so mid-tier and run rate deals come back a bit. But I would say, overall, we're -- our engagement with customers have been encouraging. There's certainly uncertainty remains around timing of some of the projects. I think Nate covered that earlier. And I think it's reflected in our year-end outlook overall. \nNathan Winters: You see it in the pipeline in terms of where the deals are at in the deal stage. So you qualify versus where we'd like to see them more in the validate secure. So earlier stages of the funnel, particularly in the second half, than where we'd like to see it at this point in the year or relative to what we've maybe seen in prior years. \nBrad Hewitt: Okay. That's helpful. I think you guys had some retail orders that you expected to convert to revenue at the end of Q4 that were pushed into Q1. Would you be able to quantify the magnitude of that deferral? And then when you talked about the uptick in the large order activity on the retail side, was that inclusive of some of that year-end spending? Or was that a separate bucket? \nWilliam Burns: I would say that year-end spending across retailers that their years and differently, whether it's the truly year-end or into first quarter. So I think we typically see orders that bridge both on an annual basis. So I don't think there was much that move between Q4 and Q1 as much as just customers need product before they have their year-end from a retail perspective. \n And again, I think those are all encouraging signs, whether it was Q4 or Q1 to us, the retailer start beginning to buy again. And I think we continue to want to see more of that momentum. I would say that even those orders are measured. You know what I mean, so it's -- it was year-end spending, but it was the first phase of a project, and we want to see those continued projects moving forward, and we believe they will. \n So I would say nothing really in movement of Q4, Q1 as much as just normal activity around that, where some customers in retail ended the true year-end, December 31 and others in the first quarter. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. \nJames Ricchiuti: Maybe I missed it. Did you comment about the activity you're seeing in the SMB market? Is that -- is the recovery you're seeing in ports to retail, also impacting that part of the business? \nWilliam Burns: I would say that SMB would fall kind of in this mid-tier to run rate business. And I think we've seen, again, more recovery in large opportunities. I think we're seeing optimism clearly on the part of our partners and our distributors. That business will continue to progress and get better through the second half year. \n But I think at the moment, we have not seen the uptick we've seen in large orders across mid in run rate business, which really falls in this SMB category. So I'd say not yet. I would say there's optimism on the part of our partners, but I think that we want to see more of that. As large orders typically are the first to decline or the first to recover, retail was the first to pull back, and now we're seeing it first to recover.  \n And I think that SMB, call it, mid-tier and run rate business will follow. \nJames Ricchiuti: Got it. How would you characterize the RFID business in the quarter, level of activity you're seeing and just the trends in that business, we're starting to see more activity, it sounds like on the T&L side with the big customer moving out of the distribution center into the package delivery side of the business? How would you characterize RFID for you? \nWilliam Burns: Yes. I would say RFID, clearly, we see as an opportunity in across multiple verticals now, not just retail and retail apparel, where it was originally focused and we're clearly seeing opportunities across track and trace and supply chain. You mentioned parcel tracking with the transportation logistics, airports and airlines with baggage tracking inside manufacturing work in progress in tools and over. So a whole series of different applications we're seeing, quick-serve restaurants. \n Clearly, the move ahead of large retailers like Walmart or UPS smart package initiatives are causing others to continue to look at what they're doing in RFID and move things along across multiple industries and verticals. Zebra has the broadest and deepest set of RFID solutions in the market today. So whether it's fixed or handheld readers, industrial and mobile printers, our software that we utilized to -- for reads and locates and then our labels printed through our printers.\n So we've seen strong growth across the portfolio over the past few years. We continue to see the drivers being the fact that the technologies continue to improve with greater rerate accuracy across the development of new tag types that make that more efficient in the reading of the tags. I think we're seeing more software applications being available today of serving these different markets. \n We're -- clearly, overall, the idea that the number of tags, I think what excites all of us is the fact that readers follow tags, right? So from our perspective, that the adoption of tags and source tagging of items at that point of manufacturing, the number of tags being sold is certainly going to allow more applications of those tags in customer environment. \n So we remain excited about this space overall, and I think we're going to continue to see growth across RFID. \nOperator: The next question is from Joe Giordano with TD Cowen. \nJoseph Giordano: Just -- I know people are hesitant to lay out big capital still, like you said a couple of times. But as you get into like next year, just considering the large-scale increase in your installed base that happened in the immediate aftermath of COVID. Like should we be thinking refresh cycle is kind of like in play for 2025? \nWilliam Burns: I think overall that the EMC clearly, across mobile computing is really what you're talking about in kind of large refresh cycles. And as I've said a couple of times already, we're seeing that as the first signs of recovery. And really in retail to start, I think that the customers in have begun to absorb their capacity, certainly in e-commerce. We'd like to see that happen across T&L as those customers build out a lot of capacity as well during the pandemic.\n And we'd like to see manufacturing be a bit more healthy in the idea that moving from a services-based economy to more goods-based economy overall. I'd say that the refresh cycle, our sales teams are focused on that with our customers. And ultimately, mobile computing -- mobile computers are essential that are operation, they have worked with us across multiple generations of products. We've got a healthy pipeline of opportunities, but we'd want to see those move ahead through this year and into next year, as you described.\n So clearly, there is a refresh cycle out there. The embedded base is larger than it's ever been that's people that deployed more applications for mobile devices in their environment. So the installed base is larger. So those will continue to refresh and every customer is on a different cycle. So I think that whether you're talking about a postal environment in a specific country or a G&L provider or a larger retailer. \n What we have seen is that even in retail, these larger orders have been more measured as I talked about, so haven't been large scale, as Nate described in kind of mega deals, they've been smaller in size and rolling out over time. We'd expect probably that same thing will happen in places like T&L. So I think it will be a measured overall recovery. And I think we feel that we've got a strong base to continue to refresh, but it's going to take time. \nJoseph Giordano: Fair enough. And then maybe just shifting to the balance sheet quickly. With your key markets, at least we get the data magnitude of recovery, but it seems like deterioration has kind of stopped. It was good to see you pay back some debt here. Cash flow looks strong. So is there an appetite for buybacks to kind of increase your leverage on a recovery as you come out of this? \nNathan Winters: Yes. As you mentioned, we finished the quarter at a little over 2.5x leverage ratio, so slightly above the target range. That begins to move back within the range, particularly as we roll through Q3 of last year. Today, we feel like we have ample flexibility with the revolver. As you mentioned, we are prioritizing debt paydown just given the debt leverage ratios and the current interest rate environment, but we do plan to reassess buybacks as the year progresses, particularly in the second half. \nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. \nAndrew Buscaglia: So I just want to check on -- you commented on the guidance. You're seeing a sequential step down in margin seasonally. It seems like -- the comment on the Q3 looking more like looking similar to Q2, just to clarify, you're talking about run rate on sales? And then what about margins? Because it does seem like you're expecting some lift in Q4. I'm wondering what's behind that. \nNathan Winters: Yes. No, you're absolutely right. So the comment on Q3 similar to Q2 was on -- from a revenue perspective, we do expect an uptick in margin as we go through the year. Some of that just similar to what we talked about in the last call, which is phasing of some of the incremental cost actions that will be coming through late this quarter and early part of Q3 as well as our, say just normal project timing between things, like payroll taxes and just the typical funding cycle with -- as you get into Q3, Q4, you get into holidays, so it tends to be a little bit of a downtick in terms of just seasonal spend. \n So I think there's no magic bullet there in terms of the actions we need to take in order to deliver that sequential improvement from Q3 -- into Q3 and Q4. \nAndrew Buscaglia: Okay. And then maybe along the lines of Joe's question, heading into your cash flow is improving, you raised it a bit. What about M&A now? I think the software story has been nice. It's helping you lately. So what's the environment like as you see it with deals? \nWilliam Burns: Yes, I'll take that, Nate. I would say that organic growth continues to be our first priority overall. I think our M&A philosophy really hasn't changed much. We're clearly targeting assets that are clearly adjacent and synergistic to our portfolio today, as you've seen us acquiring kind of these adjacent and expansion areas. We have a strong balance sheet, obviously, that could support that over time here.\n I think in the short term, there's clearly a higher bar as -- given the macro environment and the debt leverage that we're at today. So I think we'll continue to be inquisitive and look what's out there. I think we see it as an opportunity to be strategic and add to our portfolio, products and solutions that we have in the marketplace. And I think that in the short term, I think it's just a higher hurdle. \nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Drab with William Blair. \nBrian Drab: So clearly, I just want to clarify one thing. So clearly, you're seeing the recovery in retail, and you said you expected that to play out this way where retail comes back before manufacturing and T&L. Are you -- does that mean that you're not seeing recovery in manufacturing and T&L yet or that the recovery in retail is just stronger at this point than those 2 categories? \nWilliam Burns: Yes, I would say that we're not seeing it there yet. I would say that the T&L customers are clearly still absorbing capacity built out during the pandemic and that they're continuing to take actions to optimize their operations overall. I would say that manufacturing is impacted by the broader market trends of uncertainty.\n And clearly, still a services-based economy versus a goods-based economy. But I think overall, our value proposition remains strong in both markets. We've got strong relationship across T&L. And I think that we'll see them continue to buy again once the capacity is built out. I would say manufacturing is an opportunity for us. Overall, as customers continue to buy again, they are -- will invest in automation and things like traceability and resilient supply chains. \n Those themes haven't gone away, but we've seen just a conservative nature of spending based on the uncertainty. So that represents an opportunity for us. I would say that manufacturing unlike T&L is kind of underpenetrated for us, that there's an opportunity for us. And we've got new solutions within manufacturing, so like a machine vision, robotics automation, our demand planning strengthens our offering there as those markets recover. \n So -- and we've also shifted additional sales resources through this to manufacturing. So I think that we expected retail was the first to decline. It's the first to recover. T&L and manufacturing will follow. I would say we've got strong relationships across T&L, but lots of opportunities there when it does recover. And manufacturing will continue to be a focus area for us because we see it as an opportunity longer term. \nBrian Drab: Okay. And then I wonder if I could ask a question this way. You have that good slide that you used where you talk about the core and the adjacencies and expansion markets and growing expected longer-term mid-single, high single and low double digit, respectively. I'm just wondering, in your outlook for the next year, can you frame it in terms of those 3 categories, what you're expecting for growth in those 3 categories? \nWilliam Burns: I'd say overall that it's hard to predict where each is going to end up. I would say, overall, the core and mobile computing has become -- is recovering first. I think each has a different dynamic. So I think that things like tablets and others in the expansion categories will be closely connected to things like mobile computing. RFIDs in that category, and that will continue to be an opportunity.\n I would say, if you think of the kind of last circle to that, software and our services business had a positive quarter in Q1 overall. So I think that's more recurring revenue-based. Machine vision has been challenged in the short term with areas like semiconductor and manufacturing being down. So I think it varies by each segment. I think there's gives and takes in each. \n I think the core mobile computing first, the others still down, but will recover. I think in the adjacencies, RFID and others will be bright spots. And I think software was a bright spot, but machine vision challenge in the short term, robotics still rate at its infancy. So I think kind of mixed across those, but I think that it's going to be -- all will recover over time. It's just different time frames for each. \nOperator: The next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. \nMeta Marshall: I think you alluded to this in kind of the replacement cycle question earlier in the call. But just any trends between kind of mobile computing and printing as we think about kind of some of these renewal cycles coming up? \n And then maybe a second, you haven't touched on the health care market. That's clearly been an area of expansion for you guys. Just any investment or kind of progress that's been made on that opportunity? \nWilliam Burns: Yes. I'd say that as we talked about mobile computing clearly showing the first signs of recovery as expected, and we talked through that a fair amount. I would say that in printing, we saw kind of broad-based declines, but has stabilized now in Q1. There was a difficult compare in Q1 for both printing and DCS as a year ago, first quarter '23, we saw supply chain challenges abate in both those areas. So we shipped a lot of printers and scanners in the quarter a year ago. So the compares were pretty tough. \n I would say that in printing specifically, clearly still challenged by the softer macroeconomic conditions and then particularly by manufacturing, but I would say stabilized overall. We'd expect that recovery in printing and scanning would follow mobile computing as we kind of talked about. Specific to health care, I would say that impacted by the same trends, the broader market overall, clearly tighter budgets in margins within health care, we would see that we continue to drive productivity solutions within health care which allows health care providers to be more efficient, which is certainly appealing to them on tight margins and clearly to enhance patient safety. \n We see home health care is an opportunity for us. So we're clearly seeing some of our partners address that market. So think of tablets as an example around home health care opportunities. So I think we see optimism. We were at the HIMSS trade show, which was well attended in Q1. The largest retail show as we mentioned in the script earlier. But I think that we've seen optimism on the point of our partners and our customers just like the other verticals in manufacturing and T&L, we'd like to see more of that optimism turn into real orders like we're seeing in retail. \nOperator: The next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. \nRobert Mason: Bill, you've touched on it a couple of times, just the run rate business, you haven't necessarily seen signs of recovery there yet. I would just want to see if you could put a finer point on the expectations there for the year, just in the context of your overall guide -- sales guide up 1% to 5% relative to the -- maybe the large deal side of the business? \nWilliam Burns: Yes, I would say that our thought is probably relatively flat. I think we expected large deals to recover first. We expect mid-tier in run rate to recover after as we've talked about already. I think there's been a lot of optimism on the part of our partners and our distributors in this area, and we just want to see more progression, I think, more than anything else. That's kind of where we're at. \n We typically -- large deals are the first to decline and then followed by mid-tier and run rate because run rate is kind of the longer tail. And I think we're going to see that same thing in recovery. We haven't seen it yet. So I think that, that's the challenge we're seeing. I wish the visibility was better through the year. \n And I think consequent with our guide, is that we're kind of guiding to what we see from a visibility perspective, and we just haven't seen the recovery in mid-tier or run rate yet. And the optimism is out there, the opportunities seem to be there, everybody wants to go after it. We just need to see more of it really happen and turn the worse. \nNathan Winters: Yes. I think, Rob, you said that play when you say the flat, right kind of Q1 to 2 to 3 in terms of overall revenue. Flat, just because that's what we see in terms of the trajectory across all the different categories of business without seeing an inflection point of a dramatic uptick. Again, that's how we feel it. That was the appropriate guide based on what we're seeing today across all those different categories. \nRobert Mason: Yes. Understood. And then just as a follow-up, Nathan, could you tell us what the placeholder you have slotted into the guidance for debt reduction is for the year? \nNathan Winters: I would assume that the vast majority of the cash -- the $600 million of free cash flow will either go to debt pay down, maybe a little bit in terms of held in cash at some modest interest rate, but the vast majority would go to debt pay. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Newman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nKenneth Newman: Most of my questions have been asked, but I just wanted to ask a longer-term higher-level question. Obviously, you've got some very significant operating leverage implied for the back half, and I think that's mostly just on easier comparisons on the volume side.\n As we think about maybe returning more towards a normalized operating environment, how do you think about the run rate operating leverage or the run rate incremental EBITDA margins, just given all the cost-out initiatives that you've executed on? Would you think that structurally higher than what we've seen in past cycles? Or is that still too early to tell? \nNathan Winters: Yes. As we mentioned, obviously, the volume leverage or the margin expansion in the second half is highly correlated with the increased volume along with -- coupled with the restructuring actions we took throughout last year. And really, for us, the target was to get back to above 20% as the baseline so that we can grow and scale from there. And I think still too early to tell in terms of what exactly that framework looks like. \n I'd say historically, we've going to look at 30% incremental decrementals in a normal quarter, quarter in, quarter out. Fundamentally, the business hasn't changed in terms of what you would expect. Over time, we'd expect that to be a little bit greater as we scale some of these new emerging markets like machine vision or software that have inherently higher gross margin. \n But I think that's probably the best way to think about it now until the dust settles and we get to some normalcy both from a year-on-year as well as a sequential perspective. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Burns for any closing remarks. \nWilliam Burns: Yes. I'd like to thank our employees and partners for the stronger-than-expected start to the year and positioning Zebra to return to growth in the second half of the year. We look forward to seeing analysts and investors at our Innovation Day in 2 weeks. Have a great day, everyone. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "William Burns",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. As expected, our first quarter performance was impacted by continued broad-based softness across our end markets and regions, which we began to experience in the second quarter of last year, resulting in a double-digit decline in sales and profitability. However, we are beginning to see a modest recovery in demand as we saw sequential improvement from the fourth quarter. We are particularly encouraged by the better-than-expected large order activity, which drove the upside for the quarter. That said, we are not yet seeing a broad-based recovery. And as a result, we continue to take an agile approach to navigating the current environment.  \n We also delivered another quarter of sequential improvement in profitability as a result of our restructuring actions and improved gross margin. Services and software were a bright spot in the quarter with improved sales and profitability, helping to offset the year-on-year sales declines across all product categories.  \n For the quarter, we realized sales of $1.2 billion, a 16.8% decline from the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%, a 150 basis point decrease and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.84, a 28% decrease from the prior year. We are pleased with the progress we have made on our previously announced actions to improve profitability and drive sales growth as our end markets recover. Our restructuring plans to deliver $120 million of net annualized operating savings is on track to be completed midyear. \n On the supply front, we made substantial improvement in our working capital driven by our renegotiation of long-term supply commitments and ongoing work to drive down component inventories with our contract manufacturers. We have also driven both tactical and strategic sales initiatives, including reallocation of resources to accelerate growth. Given the progress on our actions, we are raising our full year outlook for sales, margin and free cash flow.  \n I will now turn the call over to Nathan to review our Q1 financial results and discuss our revised 2024 outlook. Thank you, Nathan. As we look longer term, we continue to be well positioned to benefit from secular trends to digitize and automate workflows for our customers. We remain focused on elevating Zebra as a premier solutions provider through a comprehensive portfolio of innovative solutions and our go-to-market ecosystem. Zebra empowers workers to execute test more effectively by navigating constant change in real time through advanced capabilities, including intelligent automation, machine learning, prescriptive analytics and artificial intelligence.  \n As you see on Slide 11, our customers leverage our solutions to optimize workflows across a broad range of end markets. We empower enterprises to increase collaboration and productivity and better serve their customers, shoppers and patients. In March, at the MODEX Manufacturing and Supply Chain trade show, Zebra, along with our partners, showcase our expanded portfolio of solutions that are modernizing workflows across the broader supply chain.  \n Managing operations has become complex with increased consumer expectations for inventory visibility and same-day deliveries. The event provided an opportunity to demonstrate how we improve key outcomes such as production quality, supply chain agility and capacity utilization. Machine vision was one of the many solutions we featured where we have enhanced our capabilities to address emerging use cases. We continue to build our market presence with a few notable wins.  \n A large state-owned European logistics company recently invested in thousands of Zebra machine vision cameras to enhance the speed and efficiency of inspections of government bonds and transaction documents. Additionally, an Asian manufacturer incorporate our machine vision cameras and frame grabbers, into their product sorting and quality control processes. This solution is significantly faster and more accurate than the previous manual approach.\n At HIMSS, the leading Global Healthcare Conference, Zebra and our partners demonstrated how our solutions improve the patient journey from check-in to bedside point-of-care as well as medical equipment track and trace. Additionally, the University of Maryland Health System shared how they are utilizing our clinical communications platform, which includes our mobile computers and work cloud software.  \n I'd also like to call out a win with a North America hospital network, who recently implemented thousands of Zebra printers, specifically enhancing its specimen tracking and labeling processes. These printers integrate with the electronic health record system facilitating noticeable organizational improvements across departments. Zebra's reputation for ease of use helps secure this win.  \n Recent wins in retail, demonstrate how customers are driving productivity, improving asset visibility, enhancing the experience for associates and shoppers. The European retailer selected thousands of Zebra mobile computers to replace their legacy devices from a competitor. The customer plans to pair our new mobile computers with their Zebra mobile printers to improve their price markdown, labeling and online order-picking processes.  \n The North America-based retail department store chain enhanced thousands of Zebra mobile computers by incorporating our device tracking software. Prior deployment of this software, the retailer experienced issues with misplaced devices in stores and fulfillment centers, resulting in wasted time and resources. Additionally, a North American grocer has expanded their installed base of Zebra mobile computers with thousands of additional units and implemented our work cloud software. The solution is expected to enhance operational efficiency among associates, improve employee communication and streamline inventory management within their stores.  \n On Slide 12, we highlight secular trends that we expect to support long-term growth for Zebra as we drive value for our customers. These include labor and resource constraints, real-time supply chain visibility, track and trace mandates and increased consumer expectations. We are hosting an innovation day on May 14 at our headquarters near Chicago where Nathan and I will be joined by other members of our leadership team to discuss how we digitize and automate workflows to drive positive business outcomes for customers across our end markets.  \n In closing, as we look forward to a long-term opportunity for Zebra, our conviction in the business remains strong. We continue to elevate our strategic role with our customers through our innovative portfolio of solutions while our cost and go-to-market actions are positioning us well for profitable growth as our end markets recover.  \n I will now hand it back to Mike. Yes. I'd say overall in Q1 and into -- as we entered '24, we've really seen demand stabilize and we've seen modest improvement in large order activity overall. And it's been particularly in mobile computing, and it's been specific to retail as they've kind of wrapped up their year. So we're certainly encouraged by the better-than-expected sales results in Q1 as a result. And we'd expect modest improvement in demand as we continue to progress throughout the year. \n However, H2 is -- the growth there is primarily driven by lapping through the prior destocking activity that we've seen. So overall, I think as we anticipated, mobile computing is the first place that we're seeing recovery. We're seeing it in retail. Both of those were the first to be impacted coming through the cycle with COVID. And what we'd like to see is more visibility and momentum in order activity beyond what we've seen so far.  \n And I think we'd like to see it move from retail to T&L and manufacturing in other verticals before we'd call it kind of a broad-based recovery. Yes. I mean, Keith, it's Bill. I think that overall, the Q1 performance was continued to impact by soft demand across all of the regions. So I think we start there. I think that as we've said, the relative outperformance was really in mobile computing, and we saw some bright spots in services and software clearly in the quarter. \n I would say the regions pretty much look the same, except Asia was, as you said, impacted probably more through the declines in China. I would say that we see Asia overall having China continued to a longer recovery for the China market. We've seen some bright spots again, in retail, again, in larger orders in Australia and New Zealand. So that was a positive for the Asia market.  \n I think we continue to see opportunities outside of China. So Southeast Asia and India with the investments in manufacturing there. We continue to see Japan as the longer-term opportunity for us as we're making investments there, and we have lower share there than other places. But I think we expect that China continue to remain a challenging moving forward. Yes. I would say that overall, retail relatively outperformed, as we've talked about already. And we're seeing encouraging signs, right? We saw some modest year-end retail spending across Q4 and Q1. Some customers clearly have absorbed the capacity and it begin to buy again, as you've kind of referenced, Tommy. \n We've also seen some of the pushouts that took place in last year and really over the last 18 months or so, begin to come back. So we've seen those projects as we expected and we talked about for a long time, those projects will come back. What we've seen mostly is initiating of really Phase 1 of those projects and the customers not quite ready to commit to the full deployment.  \n So we've seen deployments that in the past would have been larger, even larger orders and full rollouts immediately, now a more conservative, let's start with that project, but roll it out over time and complete the deployment kind of later in the year. So we have confidence that there'll continue to be a recovery. I think we anticipated retail would recover first, followed by T&L and manufacturing and health care, and we're seeing that play out.  \n And we also anticipated, it would be mobile computing first as well, and that's what we're seeing. So the bright spots are really mobile computing and retail, retail and e-commerce. That capacity is being used off, retailers are beginning to bring those projects back, but they're doing it in a very measured way. And I think what we want to see is, retail, T&L, manufacturing, more of the vertical markets come back and more of that order activity, even more than we're seeing today and the uptick in orders before we call a broad-based recovery. I'd say that overall, we'd expect orders -- customer orders that continued to resume overall. I think that as I just talked about with Tommy's question, we've seen customers absorbing the capacity that's previously been built out. That's been more, again, focused on retail and e-commerce as opposed to the other verticals so far. I would say that the macroeconomy, kind of the uncertainty around that abating will certainly help as well. We're viewed as a trusted partner of our customers, and we're staying close to them across each of the verticals as we would see this order momentum picking up across other verticals as we progress through the year. \n We've got a large installed base, right? We're growing solutions. So we're continuing to work with our customers as well. Kind of on new solutions and new use cases. So overall, I would say that we anticipated large deployments kind of starting to come back. We anticipated in retail. We want to see more of that across manufacturing and T&L.  \n As I said, we'd like to see more of it to in kind of different size deals, so mid-tier and run rate deals come back a bit. But I would say, overall, we're -- our engagement with customers have been encouraging. There's certainly uncertainty remains around timing of some of the projects. I think Nate covered that earlier. And I think it's reflected in our year-end outlook overall. I would say that year-end spending across retailers that their years and differently, whether it's the truly year-end or into first quarter. So I think we typically see orders that bridge both on an annual basis. So I don't think there was much that move between Q4 and Q1 as much as just customers need product before they have their year-end from a retail perspective. \n And again, I think those are all encouraging signs, whether it was Q4 or Q1 to us, the retailer start beginning to buy again. And I think we continue to want to see more of that momentum. I would say that even those orders are measured. You know what I mean, so it's -- it was year-end spending, but it was the first phase of a project, and we want to see those continued projects moving forward, and we believe they will. \n So I would say nothing really in movement of Q4, Q1 as much as just normal activity around that, where some customers in retail ended the true year-end, December 31 and others in the first quarter. I would say that SMB would fall kind of in this mid-tier to run rate business. And I think we've seen, again, more recovery in large opportunities. I think we're seeing optimism clearly on the part of our partners and our distributors. That business will continue to progress and get better through the second half year. \n But I think at the moment, we have not seen the uptick we've seen in large orders across mid in run rate business, which really falls in this SMB category. So I'd say not yet. I would say there's optimism on the part of our partners, but I think that we want to see more of that. As large orders typically are the first to decline or the first to recover, retail was the first to pull back, and now we're seeing it first to recover.  \n And I think that SMB, call it, mid-tier and run rate business will follow. Yes. I would say RFID, clearly, we see as an opportunity in across multiple verticals now, not just retail and retail apparel, where it was originally focused and we're clearly seeing opportunities across track and trace and supply chain. You mentioned parcel tracking with the transportation logistics, airports and airlines with baggage tracking inside manufacturing work in progress in tools and over. So a whole series of different applications we're seeing, quick-serve restaurants. \n Clearly, the move ahead of large retailers like Walmart or UPS smart package initiatives are causing others to continue to look at what they're doing in RFID and move things along across multiple industries and verticals. Zebra has the broadest and deepest set of RFID solutions in the market today. So whether it's fixed or handheld readers, industrial and mobile printers, our software that we utilized to -- for reads and locates and then our labels printed through our printers.\n So we've seen strong growth across the portfolio over the past few years. We continue to see the drivers being the fact that the technologies continue to improve with greater rerate accuracy across the development of new tag types that make that more efficient in the reading of the tags. I think we're seeing more software applications being available today of serving these different markets. \n We're -- clearly, overall, the idea that the number of tags, I think what excites all of us is the fact that readers follow tags, right? So from our perspective, that the adoption of tags and source tagging of items at that point of manufacturing, the number of tags being sold is certainly going to allow more applications of those tags in customer environment. \n So we remain excited about this space overall, and I think we're going to continue to see growth across RFID. I think overall that the EMC clearly, across mobile computing is really what you're talking about in kind of large refresh cycles. And as I've said a couple of times already, we're seeing that as the first signs of recovery. And really in retail to start, I think that the customers in have begun to absorb their capacity, certainly in e-commerce. We'd like to see that happen across T&L as those customers build out a lot of capacity as well during the pandemic.\n And we'd like to see manufacturing be a bit more healthy in the idea that moving from a services-based economy to more goods-based economy overall. I'd say that the refresh cycle, our sales teams are focused on that with our customers. And ultimately, mobile computing -- mobile computers are essential that are operation, they have worked with us across multiple generations of products. We've got a healthy pipeline of opportunities, but we'd want to see those move ahead through this year and into next year, as you described.\n So clearly, there is a refresh cycle out there. The embedded base is larger than it's ever been that's people that deployed more applications for mobile devices in their environment. So the installed base is larger. So those will continue to refresh and every customer is on a different cycle. So I think that whether you're talking about a postal environment in a specific country or a G&L provider or a larger retailer. \n What we have seen is that even in retail, these larger orders have been more measured as I talked about, so haven't been large scale, as Nate described in kind of mega deals, they've been smaller in size and rolling out over time. We'd expect probably that same thing will happen in places like T&L. So I think it will be a measured overall recovery. And I think we feel that we've got a strong base to continue to refresh, but it's going to take time. Yes, I'll take that, Nate. I would say that organic growth continues to be our first priority overall. I think our M&A philosophy really hasn't changed much. We're clearly targeting assets that are clearly adjacent and synergistic to our portfolio today, as you've seen us acquiring kind of these adjacent and expansion areas. We have a strong balance sheet, obviously, that could support that over time here.\n I think in the short term, there's clearly a higher bar as -- given the macro environment and the debt leverage that we're at today. So I think we'll continue to be inquisitive and look what's out there. I think we see it as an opportunity to be strategic and add to our portfolio, products and solutions that we have in the marketplace. And I think that in the short term, I think it's just a higher hurdle. Yes, I would say that we're not seeing it there yet. I would say that the T&L customers are clearly still absorbing capacity built out during the pandemic and that they're continuing to take actions to optimize their operations overall. I would say that manufacturing is impacted by the broader market trends of uncertainty.\n And clearly, still a services-based economy versus a goods-based economy. But I think overall, our value proposition remains strong in both markets. We've got strong relationship across T&L. And I think that we'll see them continue to buy again once the capacity is built out. I would say manufacturing is an opportunity for us. Overall, as customers continue to buy again, they are -- will invest in automation and things like traceability and resilient supply chains. \n Those themes haven't gone away, but we've seen just a conservative nature of spending based on the uncertainty. So that represents an opportunity for us. I would say that manufacturing unlike T&L is kind of underpenetrated for us, that there's an opportunity for us. And we've got new solutions within manufacturing, so like a machine vision, robotics automation, our demand planning strengthens our offering there as those markets recover. \n So -- and we've also shifted additional sales resources through this to manufacturing. So I think that we expected retail was the first to decline. It's the first to recover. T&L and manufacturing will follow. I would say we've got strong relationships across T&L, but lots of opportunities there when it does recover. And manufacturing will continue to be a focus area for us because we see it as an opportunity longer term. I'd say overall that it's hard to predict where each is going to end up. I would say, overall, the core and mobile computing has become -- is recovering first. I think each has a different dynamic. So I think that things like tablets and others in the expansion categories will be closely connected to things like mobile computing. RFIDs in that category, and that will continue to be an opportunity.\n I would say, if you think of the kind of last circle to that, software and our services business had a positive quarter in Q1 overall. So I think that's more recurring revenue-based. Machine vision has been challenged in the short term with areas like semiconductor and manufacturing being down. So I think it varies by each segment. I think there's gives and takes in each. \n I think the core mobile computing first, the others still down, but will recover. I think in the adjacencies, RFID and others will be bright spots. And I think software was a bright spot, but machine vision challenge in the short term, robotics still rate at its infancy. So I think kind of mixed across those, but I think that it's going to be -- all will recover over time. It's just different time frames for each. Yes. I'd say that as we talked about mobile computing clearly showing the first signs of recovery as expected, and we talked through that a fair amount. I would say that in printing, we saw kind of broad-based declines, but has stabilized now in Q1. There was a difficult compare in Q1 for both printing and DCS as a year ago, first quarter '23, we saw supply chain challenges abate in both those areas. So we shipped a lot of printers and scanners in the quarter a year ago. So the compares were pretty tough. \n I would say that in printing specifically, clearly still challenged by the softer macroeconomic conditions and then particularly by manufacturing, but I would say stabilized overall. We'd expect that recovery in printing and scanning would follow mobile computing as we kind of talked about. Specific to health care, I would say that impacted by the same trends, the broader market overall, clearly tighter budgets in margins within health care, we would see that we continue to drive productivity solutions within health care which allows health care providers to be more efficient, which is certainly appealing to them on tight margins and clearly to enhance patient safety. \n We see home health care is an opportunity for us. So we're clearly seeing some of our partners address that market. So think of tablets as an example around home health care opportunities. So I think we see optimism. We were at the HIMSS trade show, which was well attended in Q1. The largest retail show as we mentioned in the script earlier. But I think that we've seen optimism on the point of our partners and our customers just like the other verticals in manufacturing and T&L, we'd like to see more of that optimism turn into real orders like we're seeing in retail. Yes, I would say that our thought is probably relatively flat. I think we expected large deals to recover first. We expect mid-tier in run rate to recover after as we've talked about already. I think there's been a lot of optimism on the part of our partners and our distributors in this area, and we just want to see more progression, I think, more than anything else. That's kind of where we're at. \n We typically -- large deals are the first to decline and then followed by mid-tier and run rate because run rate is kind of the longer tail. And I think we're going to see that same thing in recovery. We haven't seen it yet. So I think that, that's the challenge we're seeing. I wish the visibility was better through the year. \n And I think consequent with our guide, is that we're kind of guiding to what we see from a visibility perspective, and we just haven't seen the recovery in mid-tier or run rate yet. And the optimism is out there, the opportunities seem to be there, everybody wants to go after it. We just need to see more of it really happen and turn the worse. Yes. I'd like to thank our employees and partners for the stronger-than-expected start to the year and positioning Zebra to return to growth in the second half of the year. We look forward to seeing analysts and investors at our Innovation Day in 2 weeks. Have a great day, everyone. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Let's start with the P&L on Slide 6. In Q1, sales decreased 16.8% with declines across our regions, major product categories and customers of all sizes. Services as a Software were a bright spot in the quarter, with growth driven by increased units under support contract and retail software wins. Our Asset Intelligence & Tracking segment declined 25.3% primarily driven by printing.  \n Enterprise Visibility & Mobility segment sales declined 11.8% with relative outperformance in mobile computing. Our Asia Pacific region saw the steepest sales declines led by continued weakness in China. From a sequential perspective, total Q1 sales were 16% higher than Q4 as distributors had completed their destocking process by year-end and we realized modest improvement in demand.  \n Adjusted gross margin increased 60 basis points to 48.1% supported by higher services and software margins and cycling premium supply chain costs in the prior year, all of which were partially offset by expense deleveraging from lower sales volumes. Adjusted operating expenses delevered 230 basis points as a percent of sales. The impact was mitigated by approximately $25 million of incremental net savings in the quarter from our restructuring actions. This resulted in first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%, a 150 basis point decrease versus the prior year and a 450 basis point sequential improvement from Q4.  \n Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.84, a 28% year-over-year decrease. Interest expense contributed to the decline, offset by a lower adjusted tax rate. Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 7. We generated $111 million of free cash flow as we begin to realize benefits from reducing inventory levels. We ended the quarter at 2.6x net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which is slightly above the top end of our target range. And we had approximately $1.3 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility as of quarter end, providing ample flexibility.  \n Let's now turn to our outlook. For Q2, we expect sales to decrease between 1% and 5% compared to the prior year. We entered the second quarter with a solid backlog and pipeline of opportunities, particularly for mobile computing in retail and e-commerce. This outlook assumes a modest improvement in demand trends across our major product categories, with mobile computing and the EVM segment returning to growth as we cycle easier compares.  \n We anticipate Q2 adjusted EBITDA margin to be slightly above 19% driven by expense deleveraging from lower sales volume with the benefit from restructuring actions and lower premium supply chain costs, offset by normalized incentive compensation expense. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.90. We have raised our guide for the full year, reflecting our progress on actions to drive sales and profitability as our end markets have stabilized. \n Although there is optimism from partners and customers regarding recovery in the second half of the year, we would like to see additional momentum in large orders before factoring in a broader recovery. We now expect sales growth between 1% and 5% for the year, with adjusted EBITDA margin now expected to be approximately 20%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $11.25 to $12.25. And we now expect our free cash flow for the year to be at least $600 million, including the impact of our final $45 million settlement payment in the quarter.  \n We have been making progress rightsizing inventory in our balance sheet and improving cash conversion and have been prioritizing debt paydown in the near term. Please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on Slide 8. With that, I will turn the call back to Bill. Yes. So, Jamie, I'll take that. So if you look for the -- particularly the freight in Q1, it was about 1 point year-on-year improvement just given the cycling through, now that we fully neutralize the premium supply chain costs between the operational actions and the price increases. So year-on-year, that was about 1 point of benefit in the quarter.  \n Yes, I'd say the other drivers for the relative strength in Q1 was both from the slightly higher volume as well as some favorable mix. Along with the service and software profitability and the strength we saw there, which is primarily in EVM, which is, I think, driving the benefit both sequentially as well as relative to our guide in the quarter. Yes. I think as we stated, we've seen some improvement in demand, particularly in mobile computing and retail, which drove the beat in Q1 as well as what we're expecting to see come through for the remainder of the year, driving the raise for the full year from 1% to 3%.  \n And so the way we think about the full year was we'd expect Q3 to look very similar to Q2, which looks similar to Q1, just in terms of run rate and trajectory, which as they maintain that relative strength in some of the large orders we've seen come through in the first quarter. But I would separate that from what we have yet to see, I'd say what's still kind of waiting to look at is the larger mega deals, mega deployments, that's still not coming through. The deal sizes are still in the, let's say, $1 million to $5 million range, some of the initial phases of the deployment.  \n So that's what you see carry through for the remainder of the year and inflected in the guide, but not that uptick in terms of the larger deployments. Yes, I'd say the -- as I mentioned earlier, really the second half, I would call it, grounded and based on what we see today, both in terms of the orders velocity, what we're seeing in terms of being sold out through the channel as well as the conversion rates that we've experienced now over the last 2 quarters.  \n I'd say still lower conversion rates on our pipeline than we would have historically assumed based on what we experienced in the second half. But again, aligned with what we've experienced over the past 2 quarters. I think the big difference is, we're not assuming, we're making an assumption around a mega deployment just given that we've yet to see kind of firm commitments from our customers. There's a lot of optimism, discussions around those. \n But in terms of committing to move forward those projects or ensuring that they have the budget available in the year, that really remains the uncertainty and the way you look and see the second half look very similar to the first half because that's what we're experiencing and what we're seeing play out in the market. We think that's appropriate for the guide for the year. Keith, as you mentioned, our Q2 guide slightly above 19%, so down from the 19.9% in Q1. That's entirely driven by the seasonality of our retail software business, which you probably recall, but is seasonally higher in Q1 at accretive margins, just given the timing of retailers when they've performed their cycle counts and physical inventories, which is where that platform really focuses.  \n So that's the adjustment from Q1 to Q2. And the way I'd characterize it is the Q2 guide is fairly in line with how we've structured the full year going into it. I think Q1 was benefited by some of the cost actions coming in earlier, giving us confidence in the remainder of the year as well as some of the benefits in just a bit of -- a little bit better mix and revenue start of the year.  \n So -- but then Q2 in line with where we expected the year to play out and the sequential decline is entirely driven by the seasonality of our retail software business. Yes, Tom, I think ending the Q1, somewhat to exit in Q4 that the global channel inventories measure that on a days-on-hand basis is normalized to support the current demand. So I'd say within the range that we'd expect on a global basis, there's puts and takes if you go by region and product families. So I think a nice improvement from where we were just 6 to 9 months ago.  \n And as you said, I think, no meaningful impact in the quarter or assumed in the full year guide in terms of changes -- relative changes in the distribution inventory levels. You see it in the pipeline in terms of where the deals are at in the deal stage. So you qualify versus where we'd like to see them more in the validate secure. So earlier stages of the funnel, particularly in the second half, than where we'd like to see it at this point in the year or relative to what we've maybe seen in prior years. Yes. As you mentioned, we finished the quarter at a little over 2.5x leverage ratio, so slightly above the target range. That begins to move back within the range, particularly as we roll through Q3 of last year. Today, we feel like we have ample flexibility with the revolver. As you mentioned, we are prioritizing debt paydown just given the debt leverage ratios and the current interest rate environment, but we do plan to reassess buybacks as the year progresses, particularly in the second half. Yes. No, you're absolutely right. So the comment on Q3 similar to Q2 was on -- from a revenue perspective, we do expect an uptick in margin as we go through the year. Some of that just similar to what we talked about in the last call, which is phasing of some of the incremental cost actions that will be coming through late this quarter and early part of Q3 as well as our, say just normal project timing between things, like payroll taxes and just the typical funding cycle with -- as you get into Q3, Q4, you get into holidays, so it tends to be a little bit of a downtick in terms of just seasonal spend. \n So I think there's no magic bullet there in terms of the actions we need to take in order to deliver that sequential improvement from Q3 -- into Q3 and Q4. Yes. I think, Rob, you said that play when you say the flat, right kind of Q1 to 2 to 3 in terms of overall revenue. Flat, just because that's what we see in terms of the trajectory across all the different categories of business without seeing an inflection point of a dramatic uptick. Again, that's how we feel it. That was the appropriate guide based on what we're seeing today across all those different categories. I would assume that the vast majority of the cash -- the $600 million of free cash flow will either go to debt pay down, maybe a little bit in terms of held in cash at some modest interest rate, but the vast majority would go to debt pay. Yes. As we mentioned, obviously, the volume leverage or the margin expansion in the second half is highly correlated with the increased volume along with -- coupled with the restructuring actions we took throughout last year. And really, for us, the target was to get back to above 20% as the baseline so that we can grow and scale from there. And I think still too early to tell in terms of what exactly that framework looks like. \n I'd say historically, we've going to look at 30% incremental decrementals in a normal quarter, quarter in, quarter out. Fundamentally, the business hasn't changed in terms of what you would expect. Over time, we'd expect that to be a little bit greater as we scale some of these new emerging markets like machine vision or software that have inherently higher gross margin. \n But I think that's probably the best way to think about it now until the dust settles and we get to some normalcy both from a year-on-year as well as a sequential perspective."
