Let me start off by saying that we live in a time of unprecedented circumstances. The global spread of the COVID-19 virus has created an extreme health crisis and resulted in the disruption of the lives of billions of people. The first priority for MongoDB is the safety and wellbeing of our employees and our customers. And we have been managing the business to that effect. Michael will speak in more detail on how we expect this crisis to impact our financial performance. Our job as a management team is to keep steady amidst the turbulence while not losing sight of the long-term opportunity ahead of us. Let me now turn to our fourth quarter results. MongoDB delivered strong results, capping off an outstanding year for the Company. Our technology investments have further strengthened what was already the leading modern data platform. Our investments in sales and marketing have expanded our market reach to make MongoDB available to all customers of all sizes around the world. I'm proud of the performance of our team in fiscal 2020 and believe we are well on our way to establishing MongoDB as one of the primary winners as the database market moves to the cloud. Looking quickly at our fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $123.5 million, a 44% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. For the full year fiscal 2020, we generated $421.7 million in revenues, a 58% year-over-year increase and growth. We grew subscription revenue 46% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and 61% for the full year. Atlas revenue grew over 80% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and now represents 41% of revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 17,000 customers. We believe our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2020 results demonstrate that we have established ourselves as the modern data platform of choice. We continue to be pleased and encouraged by the breadth of adoption of our platform in terms of use cases, industry verticals and geographies. Our sales force is executing at a high level, and we saw meaningful productivity increases in both our enterprise and corporate channels. We also continued to be very pleased with the progress of a self-serve business, as evidenced by a record number of customer additions in Q4. And we continue to expand our self-serve operations to become a world class product-led growth engine. Entering fiscal 2021, we are pleased with our achievements in the two and a half years since becoming a public company, and we are more confident than ever about our long-term prospects. We are pursuing one of the largest and fastest growing markets in all the software. IDC projects the database market to be $71 billion in 2020, growing to $97 billion in 2023. We have less than 1% share of the global database market and a long runway for growth ahead of us. As we look ahead, we're keenly aware of the opportunity in front of us. We strongly believe that the database market is at the very beginning of a profound platform shift towards the cloud over the next decade. As the new and existing workloads migrate to the cloud, customers will be forced to examine and modernize their data architectures. Technology history teaches us that in times of such platform dislocation, new companies emerge as generational leaders. To this end, our belief is that the best way to maximize long-term shareholder value is to make key investments that will position us as one of those leaders. I want to spend more time today to explain how our platform strategy and the associated R&D investments are designed to drive our long-term growth. To start, let me provide some historical context. There have been two fundamental insights that have driven our business to-date. The first key insight that led to the founding of the Company was that the inflexibility and lack of scalability of relational databases were major impediments to organizations that desire to build modern apps quickly with performance and scale. MongoDB's document model and distributed data architecture address these problems, resulting in MongoDB's incredible popularity with developers everywhere. The second key insight was that the process of building modern apps was dramatically increasing the burden of undifferentiated work on development teams. As apps keep proliferating and apps themselves get decomposed into smaller distributed components due to the use of microservices, containers and other related technologies, the scope and complexity of managing apps and infrastructure grows exponentially. This undifferentiated work ends up crowding out the resources needed to invest in enhancing the application and ultimately the business. As a result, in 2012, we started building our tools to automate the provisioning, management and security led database. The logical progression was the introduction of Atlas in 2016, our fully managed databases service offerings that enabled organizations to avoid the hassle of managing distributed databases all together. Today, Atlas continues to be a huge success for us, growing over 80% year-over-year, representing 41% of our revenue in Q4 and is at a $200 million annualized revenue run rate. Thanks to these two insights, we are the only modern database that is considered to be a true general purpose database, has been adopted by millions of developers around the world, and has generated meaningful commercial success, affording us the opportunity to sustain strong growth rates for years to come. Our success has enabled us to acquire over 15,000 Atlas customers in the past 3.5 years, giving us a unique perspective on how we can provide an even greater value to customers in the future. The productivity and economic benefits of the cloud such as real time provisioning, almost unlimited scale and usage based pricing are at this point well-known. However, we also see the challenges that the movement to the cloud has created. In the first decade, the cloud ecosystem largely involved moving existing technology stacks onto the new infrastructure paradigm. These forced developers to deal with a fragmented set of apps and infrastructure tied to discrete use cases, multiple APIs and data spread across many disparate silos. Developer productivity is impeded as they're unable to seamlessly leverage data for different needs. And these problems will only escalate as customers move more workloads to the cloud. This experience led us to a third key insight, the one that is informing our data platform strategy that the apps of the future will dramatically expand in their functionality and scope. Future applications will enable continuous engagement and access to massive amounts of real time data among key constituents, be it users, customers, partners or suppliers. Availability of instantaneous operational data along with insight in that data will increasingly drive business decisions. That means traditional operational workloads will need to incorporate additional functionality, such as real time analytics. In addition, as data on the edge continues to explode due to the increasing use of mobile and IoT apps, future applications will require the ability to effortlessly synchronize data between the edge and the core. Finally, rather than dealing with a large number of complex interfaces, developers will require one unified interface, designed to bring together data at massive scale to build these new applications more quickly and efficiently. We believe MongoDB is incredibly well-positioned to benefit from this emerging trend. We are an operational database, which puts us both at the core of the application we support and makes us a source of its real time mission critical data. We believe developers will credibly expect their core operational database to extend into a full data platform that provides the additional capabilities they need to expand an application scope and functionality. Many of the exciting product announcements we have made over the past year demonstrate how we are already evolving our data platform for applications with greater functionality and scope. Atlas Data Lake brings transactional and analytical use cases together by allowing customers to query both operational and archive data. Atlas Search brings the previously separate search functionality into the operational database. Finally, the integration of Realm and Stitch will address the issue of edge to core data synchronization. These and other future products will leverage our powerful API to access large amounts of data easily to provide an unparalleled developer experience. We know that every enterprise\u2019s future will be increasingly powered by software and that apps of the future will leverage data in even more sophisticated ways. Consequently, we're confident these investments designed to address even more complex use cases will further extend our position as the leading modern data platform and put us in an even better positioned to deliver strong long-term growth. Now, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the fourth quarter. Square Enix producers of Tomb Raider, Dragon Quest, and Final Fantasy video games chose MongoDB to support online suite of asynchronous multiplayer features across a wide range of video games. The company continues to invest in MongoDB Atlas for game production to provide the scalability needed for its growing global player base. Atlas allows Square Enix to scale elastically to meet the demands of the game regardless of the number of concurrent players. Software AG\u2019s Cumulocity IoT, a leading IoT platform hung a shift to a truly connected world, chose MongoDB Enterprise Advanced as its operational data store. As data is the key to driving actual insights into an IoT-enabled business, MongoDB plays a critical role in helping Software AG customers transform connected device data into immediate value in a scalable and reliable manner. Unqork, a no-code application platform that helps large enterprises, healthcare providers, and government agencies build complex custom software faster, selected MongoDB Atlas as its primary cloud database platform in 2017. The company expanded its use of MongoDB last quarter because they wanted a data platform provider that was cloud agnostic, highly scalable, enterprise security ready and trusted by the Fortune 500 customers. Location-aware data infrastructure company Radar Labs chose MongoDB Atlas to power its geolocation platform, which currently runs on more than 25 million devices around the globe, processing billions of location data points each week. And an early member of MongoDB for startups program, the company continues to make big bets in MongoDB to help scale the delivery of its rich geolocation services, so its developers can focus on the Company's goal of making every app on every device contextually aware. In summary, we are encouraged by attraction as evidenced by our strong Q4 results. The success and our track record of execution give us confidence to aggressively pursue our long-term opportunities. We believe the market is evolving ways that will increasingly play to our core strengths and further establish MongoDB as a modern data platform of choice for developers. Before I turn over the call to Michael, I want to take this opportunity to personally thank our co-founder and CTO, Eliot Horowitz for his vision and technical leadership for over almost 13 years. I talked today about the foundational insight that Eliot and the co-founders had, namely that legacy database technology was not designed to address the needs of modern applications. Out of that insight came the document model, a query language, and the tremendous popularity of MongoDB in the developer community. Thanks to Eliot's vision and leadership, today MongoDB is the world's most popular modern database platform. It will cross $0.5 billion in revenues this year, has over 90 million downloads and over 17,000 customers all around the world. The Company and in particular, the team assembled by Eliot has never been in better shape. And there's strong and deep leadership -- there's a strong and deep leadership team ready to take the baton to further vision of improving developers\u2019 lives by making it so easy to work with data. We're excited that Eliot will continue to stay involved and become a technical adviser to MongoDB after leaving his full time role. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael to review our financial results.\nMichael Gordon: [Technical Difficulty] our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2021. First, I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $123.5 million, up 44% year-over-year; subscription revenue was $117.8 million, up 46% year-over-year; and professional services revenue was $5.7 million, up 17% year-over-year. Our strong performance in the quarter benefited from broad-based strength on both Atlas and Enterprise Advanced. It is worth noting that one large multiyear Enterprise Advanced deal with a Fortune 50 customer drove $3.5 million of our outperformance. As a reminder, due to revenue recognition mechanics associated with ASC 606, we generally recognize the term license revenue for all the contract years upfront, not just the initial year. The rapid adoption of Atlas continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew over 80% in the quarter and now represents 41% of total revenue compared to 32% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and 40% last quarter. Atlas continues to benefit from strength at both our self-service and direct sales channels while experiencing a growth headwind from historical mLab customer base, which we anniversaried in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, we grew our customer base by over 1,100 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 17,000, which is up from over 13,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 2,000 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,750 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 15,400 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 11,400 in a year-ago period. The sequential growth in total customers includes growth in our Enterprise Advanced customers, as well as new Atlas customers. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer base reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. We also continue to see healthy expansion from our customers, which is a key component of our growth strategy. Our net AR expansion rate in the fourth quarter remained above 120%. We ended the quarter with 751 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 557 in the year-ago period. We also ended the year with 62 customers with at least $1 million in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 39 in the year-ago period. Moving down the P&L, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Please note that we have provided additional disclosures in our earnings release, showing the non-GAAP reconciliation of the individual OpEx line items to help you with your understanding and modeling of the business. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $91.2 million, representing a gross margin of 74% compared to 72% last quarter, and 71% in the year-ago period. Gross Margin benefited from the large multiyear EA license revenue associated with the Fortune 50 customers we mentioned earlier. Overall, we are pleased with our gross margin performance, which reflects greater efficiency and scale in our Atlas business. However, we continue to expect we'll see some modest reduction in overall gross margin as Atlas continues to become a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $12 million or negative 10% operating margin for the fourth quarter compared to a negative 11% margin in the year-ago period. Net loss in the fourth quarter was $14.5 million or $0.25 a share, based on 56.9 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.17 per share on 53.8 million shares outstanding in the year ago period outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $987 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was negative $8.6 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.3 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $10.9 million in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $12.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2021. First, our guidance includes our current best estimate for the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on results. Obviously, the situation is evolving rapidly, but we felt that it was important to attempt to incorporate some impact, despite all of the uncertainty. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $119 million to $121 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $14 million to $12 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.22, based on 57.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2021, we expect revenues to be in the range of $510 million to $530 million. For the full fiscal year 2021, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $78 million to $68 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.23 per share, based on 57.9 million weighted average shares outstanding. Let me provide some additional color to our guidance by discussing and attempting to quantify the potential impact of the COVID-19 virus on our business. Like many global organizations, we believe our operations will likely be impacted by the slowdown in economic activity that is occurring globally. Our fiscal \u201821 planning was completed before the recent acceleration in the spread of the virus. But the current and rapidly evolving realities in the ground led us to decide to update our current forecast. Our current assumption is that the disruption caused by COVID-19 will impact Q1 revenues by approximately $1 million to $2 million and fiscal \u201821 revenues by approximately $15 million to $25 million due to anticipated weaker bookings in the first half of the year. To be clear, at this point, we are seeing minimal impact across our sales channels around the world, including closing transactions in the first quarter, even in the countries hardest hit by COVID-19. However, as a management team, we believe that it is now prudent and responsible to incorporate that into our outlook that we expect what could be a much more challenging economic environment in the coming weeks and months. Our guidance assumes a more normalized business environment in the second half of the year. Obviously, the situation regarding COVID-19 is changing rapidly, and we will continue to evaluate its potential impact on our business. With respect to our overall investment cadence, we have made the decision before the COVID-19 outbreak that we want to continue investing in the business aggressively to pursue our market opportunity. We're funding high-priority projects across the organization, including, first growing our sales capacity globally, which still remains in its early stages from a scale perspective. For context, even in the United States, we still do not have coverage in roughly a quarter of the NFL cities and only have two or fewer reps in half of the NFL cities. Given our strong historic productivity, we believe that the primary governor in productive capacity should be organizational capacity. Second, continue investing in our marketing organization, particularly our product lead growth team, in order to continue to drive our self-service Atlas business and overall Atlas adoption. Finally, as Dev described in his remarks, continuing with robust R&D investments to both deliver on our data platform vision and to further enhance our core products. Given the attractive long-term opportunity we have in front of us, we think it continues to be important and appropriate to keep investing in these high-return areas. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent fourth quarter results, our focus on executing on our product roadmaps and expanding our go-to-market reach is driving high levels of growth at scale. The steps we\u2019ve taken to establish MongoDB as the modern general purpose data platform of choice positions us for continued long-term success. While we expect to see an impact to our business from the COVID-19 situation in the short term, we remain committed to strong execution in order to capture our long-term market opportunity. With that, we\u2019d like to open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nSanjit Singh: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. And congrats to the team on another strong year, really great to see the strong results coming out of Q4. And Michael, thank you for framing the guidance. That was very helpful. I was wondering if you could just sort of take us behind the curtains a little bit in terms of how you sort of came up with the $1 million to $2 million impact in Q1, the $15 million to $25 million for the full year? Specifically how to expect this to potentially impact the business, are they going to be more on the sales sold side part of the business, the self-serve or maybe on the professional services? And how -- and to what extent do you assume, like lower close rates? Any sort of color that you could give us to contextualize the guidance would be helpful.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, great. Thank you for the question. Happy to provide the guidance. Obviously, it's a rapidly evolving situation. So, it's hard to capture it all with a point estimate. But, what we tried to do is we tried to look at the landscape and say, what are some potential outcomes that might be appropriate to incorporate into our guidance? And so, fundamentally, what we did is we said, let's imagine that in the first half of the year, we see a slowdown and overall economic activity in the way that would flow through is through sales activity and bookings activity. I think that's specifically for the direct sales side of the business. I think, it is less likely that we would see that on the self-service side. And so, what we tried to do is we tried to look at the regions that were most affected and run some sensitivity analysis around what different scenarios might look like. We have assumed -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have assumed a normalization of activity in the second half of the year. So, obviously, if things persist or prolonged, we of course would have to reevaluate that approach. But fundamentally, I think, we're exceptionally well-positioned in the market overall. We haven't seen any meaningful impact in the business to date. We have the benefit of having a wide diversification of customers and geographies and industries that we serve. There's certainly some industries that are harder hit and other industries that are actually benefiting. And that diverse portfolio is certainly working for us. But, we wanted to try and do our best to sort of call it out, recognizing how the situation continues to evolve.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you, Michael. That was super clear. So, my follow-up maybe for Development. One of the things I\u2019ve been trying to think through is self hosted Enterprise Advanced and what's sort of the outlook for that? And clearly, this quarter with that large Fortune 50 deal, seems to underscore that this is going to continue to be a growth category, even as Atlas continued to post sort of leading growth in the company. Can you sort of give us your view on sort of positioning and the growth opportunity within Enterprise Advanced going forward?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Sure, Sanjit. We believe that the growth of EA will continue to be strong. Why? Because there are many customers who want to consume MongoDB on their own in terms of maintaining and managing their own database infrastructure, either because they have a lot of sunk costs, or there's regulatory requirements that require them to run EA on their premises or in certain datacenters that they\u2019re allowed to do businesses in. So, one of our value propositions -- one of our key value propositions to our customers is the ability to run and use MongoDB anywhere. And so, we don't force fit every customer to consume it as a service in Atlas. And so -- and customers like that choice. And we have many customers who both procure EA as well as continue to invest in Atlas.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. \nRaimo Lenschow: Congress on the quarter, but also congrats for trying to kind of put an impact on the COVID situation for the business. Well done on that one. The two quick questions. So, first one is, can you talk a little bit about Atlas? The growth this quarter, if I look organic, came down a little bit, but I do seem to remember that last year, we had not at mLab but I think there was some other factors in the fourth quarter. Could you just remind us because we're trying to understand like the underlying, growth run rate a little bit better? And then, the follow-up is like, what's the trigger points that you guys are looking for in terms of like changing, in terms of maybe the investment cadence as this kind of situation unfolds around COVID-19. Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, sure. So, it was another strong quarter. Thanks for the question Raimo. It was another quarter for Atlas. To your point, I think the two things that are worth calling out are it was the first quarter where we had mLab in the base. And we have talked about the different growth profiles and those cohorts are contracting as we indicated and called out at the time of the acquisition. And also, you're correct that in fiscal '19 fourth quarter, we did come up specific over a consumption that was not seasonally related, but was typically related to the lifecycle of a couple of large apps that were in deployment. And so, I think we just start to neutralize or normalize for both of those. It was, another very strong Atlas quarter. So, I think overall, we feel quite good about that. And then, in terms of the second question, in terms of investment, I think maybe just trying to take a step back from an overall perspective, we as a management team, have a very long-term orientation. We're very, very early on in the stages of trying to capitalize on our opportunity. We will continue to invest as we see good rates of return on the investments that we're making. We see that in both the R&D side, as well as in the sales and marketing side. Certainly if there were to be macroeconomic factors that would change or other sides that sort of eroded or degraded, those investment opportunities we would modulate the levels of investment appropriately. And we've done that throughout the last many, several years. And so, we'll just continue to do that as we think about our role is sort of balancing, maximizing the long-term potential, but also making sure that it's not a growth at all cost mindset, but instead sort of being prudent allocators of capital.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you so much. And hopefully all of your families are doing well. So, wishing you guys the best through this. Just had a couple of questions. The first -- thank you, Dev. The first on the direct business. And again, thank you, as everyone said, for trying to clarify -- or quantify something that I know is probably impossible to do right now. But is there anything you could share with us about kind of the linearity over a typical quarter? Like what typically -- and on average, how much comes in month one versus month three? And I'm thinking on your enterprise business, where you typically have deferreds associated with that. Just so we can think about how that -- how the sales run through not the revenue. So I know that's radical. And then also, just if you can share with us Michael. Atlas, you said less likely to be impacted. Is there anything you can share with us about what the profile is of an Atlas customer that may make them less susceptible to what's going on from a macro standpoint? Thank you very much.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. So I'll -- maybe I'll take the first one. So I've been in enterprise software now for almost 20 years, and the lesson learned is that customers are trained to obviously try and get as much leverage as possible. And in every business I've been involved with, the quarters do tend to be back end loaded. Obviously there's nothing different about MongoDB. I would tell you that one of the things that really differentiates us is that we have a very, very rigorous culture of qualification and our sales process.  So, the forecast that roll up to Michael and me, we have a lot of confidence in based on the rigor that the sales team puts in, in terms of forecast for business. So our confidence in the forecast is a measure of the quality of the qualification process. And as you know, for 2.5 years as a public company, we've done a really good job. Michael, you want to handle the second question?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I think just on the second question, just to sort of make sure there's not any confusion. My comments about the likely impact on the business, at least from what we hypothesized \u2026 \nHeather Bellini : Self-serve. \nMichael Gordon: Yes, it\u2019s self-serve. Obviously, Atlas or EA, there\u2019s sort of the direct sales side of things. But when you think about some of the potential impacts on a direct sales model of not being able to go to customer sites, people being quarantined or cities being in virtual lockdown, that shouldn't really affect the self-service side of the business as much. Obviously, it's not immune to macroeconomic outcomes, but some of those sort of specific things that we're starting to see rollout across the geographies have much more potential to directly affect -- to affect the direct sales side of things.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBrad Reback : Dev, you just alluded to your obviously decades of experience in software and the fact that you lived through '08 and '09. Any lessons from that experience that you think are applicable to the situation we're in now and how you might -- or how you sort of position the business or the organization? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so well, I'm old enough Brad to tell you that I also lived through 2000-2001. So I was a public company officer then and I was a public company officer in 2008-2009. And so, I would tell you that we believe that while sentiment can change quickly, the underlying trends don't change as fast. So deals in progression typically still happen, it\u2019s maybe deals who start early in the sales cycle that may have -- end up having more approvals required and so sales cycles may start lengthening.  As we said in the prepared remarks, we see minimal impact right now. But prudence dictated that based on our judgment experience, and having seen this before that some impact given the macroeconomic environment was warranted.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nBrent Bracelin: I guess Dev, I wanted to kind of go back to the Atlas business and really try to understand, how economically sensitive that business is obviously in the [downtrend] databases, work usage based cloud models. And so how are you thinking about just this business, are there unique characteristics of cloud databases and modern applications where maybe there won't be a lot of variability but the new business -- the new Atlas potential business could be at risk? Anyway you could kind of frame Atlas given again, it is new, we really didn't have usage based transactional revenue streams in the last downturn. And any insights specifically to how you're thinking about the Atlas impact potentially, will be super helpful? And there was one quick follow-up for Michael, if I could. \nDev Ittycheria: Sure. So I would just tell you, the Atlas business is consistent with data business as a whole. And that database software is incredibly sticky. Obviously, the database is the heart of every software application, and people are not going to shut down existing applications, existing services, existing websites, because they still have to come back to business. And so on top of that, with Atlas, they\u2019ve essentially handed off the ongoing management of their database infrastructure to us. So in times when people may want to do a little bit of belt tightening, it's very unlikely that they'll decide to bring those workloads back in house. In fact, they will like the variable cost model associated with Atlas.  On top of that it's -- most workloads we see have a pretty predictable usage pattern. It's only a few workloads, like games or some very seasonal workloads related to say the Q4, retail environment et cetera, or some e-commerce environment, say on Mother's Day et cetera. And so those kinds of events, you see some spike in usage. So in fact, we are seeing spikes in usage in -- with customers who are in the cryptocurrency business, we're seeing spikes in usage with gaming companies. Obviously a lot of people home playing online games. We're seeing a lot of spikes in usage in terms of telcos and cable companies and their usage is going up.  So I would say in general, though, the usage patterns tend to be fairly predictable. And on top of that, with the fact that people handed off the management of their database to us through Atlas, those workloads tend to be very, very sticky.\nBrent Bracelin: Super helpful. And then just as a follow-up for Michael. You did talk about a large EA deal with a Fortune 50 customer. Could you just give us a little more color, was that a kind of data base replacement opportunity, was it tied to kind of new application build? Any color there on why you won the deal, how competitive it was? And kind of the proof points that fits to the scale on your [favorite] there?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So we wouldn't normally like over indexed on talking about any one customer but just given the magnitude, in fact, there was a long-term deal that has impacted the numbers, we just wanted to put that in context. We've had a long-term relationship with this customer, but this is a meaningful expansion. And effectively, we\u2019re the platform going forward for non-relational workloads. And typically what we would see is that there would be a mix of both new applications as well as migrations and scenarios like that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Hey, thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask a couple on $1 million customers, which I think grew almost [60%] year-over-year. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about some of the common use cases you're seeing. When you get to that type of a deal, are you seeing more legacy replacement? I mean if you could give us a sense for how much of kind of those incremental $1 million customers are coming from EA versus Atlas and just how to think about $1 million customers on Atlas going forward? Thank you. \nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Just to be clear, our $1 million account went from 39 to 62 just for everyone's benefit, and it's incredibly diversified set of customers. So I would not say there's any one predictable set of use cases. And even in those particular customers, we have a land and expand business model. So invariably, those customers are deploying MongoDB for more and more applications and different types of workloads. So it's not one app per se that's growing very, very quickly. And so we're very, very encouraged by -- and we've been talking about this ever since we've been a public company that our business is a land and expand, and the durability of our business is that it's not tied to any one specific app but over time people end up standardizing on MongoDB. And as they get more and more valued at MongoDB they start using us for more and more different workloads. So I wouldn't say there\u2019s any one particular use case or any common theme across this $1 million accounts, except the fact that it's -- most of them are our classic land and expand accounts.\nTyler Radke: And do you have a sense just on the second part of the question around how much of those customers are on Atlas versus EA and maybe just what you'd expect that to look like going forward? \nDev Ittycheria: That's also frankly a very healthy mix of both. So there's no one any concentration of both EA or -- either EA customers or Atlas customers. And so we've seen customers invest very, very aggressively in EA. But we're also seeing a lot of other customers invest aggressively in Atlas. And again, because an earlier question, frankly we have customers that do both. So we got the best of both worlds, some workloads they want to maintain in house and other workloads that make more sense to use a fully managed service like Atlas.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Jack Andrews with Needham. Please go ahead. \nJack Andrews: I was wondering if you could just provide an update to trends you're seeing around legacy migrations, especially since you announced some new partnerships that look to accelerate that trend?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So we are seeing a lot of interest. Customers are trying to replatform legacy database infrastructure. One of the challenges for people is that they ultimately have to not just move the work -- the data but then potentially have to rewrite the application. And so we\u2019ve talked in the past about using our SI partners in that and now we\u2019ve announced some other partnerships where we\u2019re offering customers migrating toolkits to our partners to frankly reduce the amount of work and heavy lifting required to migrate off relational workloads to MongoDB. And so the degree to which we can make that easier and easier for customers to do so and reduce the friction to do so, I think will only accelerate the amount of migrations we see from legacy workloads to MongoDB.\nJack Andrews: Okay, thanks. And then just as a quick follow up, could you touch on your auto scaling capability and how that may be impacting your own business and whether that's a source of margin leverage for you over time?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. I mean, so auto scaling is basically enabling customers to not worry. I mean, the whole premise for building MongoDB is to really get the database out of the way. And one of the classic challenges is doing capacity planning with the database, because you want to ensure that you offer good service and good predictable performance to your end users. And so, with auto scaling, we basically take that to next level. As the performance demands of your application grow, the database scales elastically. And so this gives customers peace of mind in terms of not having to worry about having any degradation of performance for the users, customers or partners with ability to auto scale. And typically we find that this is also a win-win for customers, because they don't have to pay for some fixed utilization costs, when -- a fixed costs when the utilization drops. And so it's a win-win for both customers and for us. And so it means, can lead more upscaling and also sometimes a little bit downscaling. But in general, it's a win-win and it allows us to build really healthy long-term relationship with customers. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Walravens: Great. And let me add my congratulations to trying to estimate the COVID-19 impact. I think you're the first ones to do it. Yes. So Dev, the -- what sorts of tools -- and I'll give you an example in a second. But what sorts of tools do you have to manage the business maybe a little differently if we are heading into a real economic slowdown? And as an example, we hosted a call with Salesforce this morning and they talked about how. In the last downturn, one of the things that any office really focused was making sure they maintain the customer relationship even if it meant. So keep the contract even if it means it says lower pricing or significantly lower contract value, the theory being that when you come out the other side, it's easier to expand in existing customers and to time up again. So just in any kind of tools like that, that you guys have, like what the other thing might be?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So I would say that there's a couple of things that we do. One is, we put a lot of rigor, as I mentioned, to an earlier question in our forecasting process, because to us a revenue forecast is by definition also an expense forecast. And so the more fidelity we have in our forecast, the better sense we have in terms of how to really size the capacity of the business relative to that forecast. And so we put enormous amounts of rigor on the -- on our forecasting process and we feel really good about the quality of the forecast that we get from sales force which -- so that's point number one.  Point number 2 is, we obviously spend or invest a lot of time with customers. And with Atlas, we got even higher levels of data and instrumentation of how customers are using our platform. And so that gives us a sense about like, are they using it properly? Are they running into any issues? Have they configured their database correctly? Are they seeing any performance degradation, et cetera. And again, the database is the heart of every application. And so people care very quickly if there's any issues. And so we spend a lot of time focusing on making sure that we're getting a lot of satisfaction and delight from both MongoDB and from Atlas.  And so I would say in general, we don't see today any real impact on the business. But we do again, prudently think that there will be some impact, which is why we gave a guide that we did. And we're obviously going to monitor this very, very carefully, both in terms of our pipeline -- our sales pipeline. We're also tracking obviously our self-service funnel, that funnel was also very, very strong. And -- but if we see any changes, we can respond very, very quickly.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Richard Davis with Canaccord. Please go ahead.\nRichard Davis: I'm thinking, in a tough environment, one of the catches, if I was a salesman for you guys is I could offer kind of a hard dollar ROI. And I think you can pretty much offer that, just make sure I'm not mistaken. But can I walk in and go with it, you can get rid of your old systems and it's not like one of these companies that say we're going to save everyone two minutes a day. Like, I don't even know what that means. Is that a fair assessment of the business model there? Thanks. \nDev Ittycheria: Oh! Absolutely. One of the compelling benefits of MongoDB and Atlas and the fact that you don't have to manage databases, the total cost of ownership of MongoDB is so much lower than legacy technology.\nRichard Davis: And then the second quick follow-up. When you guys go up against all there, there are a bunch of other NoSQL database companies, you\u2019re not bound to take that phrase but we\u2019ll use it. Is it oftentimes, is it performance benchmarking, or is it -- is this a business where developer mindshare, and market share kind of matters? I mean obviously, if I'm used to the UI, and I've moved from one company to another, I'll take your system with me or recommend it. Is it -- can you tell which one is more important, or may reach a tipping point of one side or the other? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, I would tell you that it's much more the latter than the former. There\u2019s -- in databases, it's historically, there's been a lot of benchmarks used, but a lot of the benchmarks are Jerry-rigged with certain criteria or certain tests that make one vendor look better than another vendor. And customers and developers have particularly become wise to that. What it is, is really all about making a developer's life easier. And one of the real hallmarks of MongoDB is -- and the reason why we are the most popular modern database in the world, is that we can get customers and developers up and running very, very quickly. The document model, our query language, the fact that our database scales very, very easily, the fact that they can consume it as a service, the fact that they can use it for almost every -- any particular use case, because it's true general purpose platform, not some mixed solution, makes us a very, very compelling solution, which is why our business has grown so quickly, and it's all development led.  And we're investing a lot in the business. We've made a lot of investments in expanding our developer relations, capabilities to engage with the developers and given everyone is now working virtually, we're going to see do a lot more online seminars and education to get developers up to speed on all the latest features and benefits of MongoDB. And on top of that, we continue to invest a lot in our self-serve business, where developers -- either developers sitting in the garage or developers from a large Fortune 500 organization can engage with MongoDB and get going very, very quickly.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. please go ahead.\nRishi Jaluria: Two quick ones. And let me echo my colleagues and appreciate the hard work, you're trying to put a national dollar figure and the impact of COVID in your guidance. I think it's a great lesson that a lot of other enterprise software companies might not be able to follow your lead on this. First, just wanted to maybe understand with MongoDB World turning virtual this year, how should we be thinking about the potential impact to be add on new bookings on lead generation or any kind of effect? And then today, with Eliot stepping down, obviously brought a lot of kind of vision, it\u2019s great, but he's been on in a little bit of an advisory role. Just what would you be looking for in Eliot's -- or person as CTO if you are in fact looking for one? Thanks. \nDev Ittycheria: Sure. So let me take both questions. On the first question on World, I want to be clear, World was never designed to be a pipeline acceleration conference. This is really designed to be an education conference for our community. And in fact, the more [meetings] and technical and in depth the content, the better. And so obviously there's a big investment by organization, especially on the engineers who are actually building our capabilities. That's where the developers want to spend time or they want to meet the people who are writing the code, ask technical -- deep technical questions, spend time with the experts. So there was never really a pipeline acceleration conference. Obviously, around that conference, you may arrange meetings with more senior level stakeholders. But if you look at the content from prior years, it was really, really focused on serving the needs of the technical community of MongoDB. So we don't see any potential impact on making MongoDB World a virtual conference. On the -- and candidly frankly, now that\u2019s virtual I shouldn't mention in fact reimagining the conference and frankly trying to make -- since it\u2019s virtual, appealing, it's being able to reach many more developers at one time. Because we only used to broadcast the keynotes where we had 10,015 people listen to the keynotes. But the individual conference were not broadcast or video streamed. And so we remanaged the conference so that more people can get access and hear the latest and greatest about MongoDB.  With regards to Eliot, obviously we're incredibly grateful for his contributions and his leisure for the last 13 years. He has really assembled an incredibly strong team. Two of his key lieutenants have been with the company for more than seven plus years. And they're stepping up with in a bigger role. And Sahir, our Chief Product officer was put in place a couple of quarters ago. And so that was also part of setting up the transition for this move. And so we've really, really got a strong deep bench under Eliot. There's no plans to recruit a CTO from the outside at this point. And I couldn't be prouder of the team that's here because I feel that we have a massive opportunity in front of us and a world class team to help us get there.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dev Ittycheria for any closing remarks.\nDev Ittycheria: Well, again, I am very grateful for all of you who are able to listen to the conference, obviously my thoughts and prayers to all of you and those affected by COVID-19. We hope we will get through this quickly. And obviously, we're focused as a business on serving the needs of our customers and employees. And we'll talk to you at our next earnings call. Thank you. \nMichael Gordon: Thank you.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "[Technical Difficulty] our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2021. First, I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $123.5 million, up 44% year-over-year; subscription revenue was $117.8 million, up 46% year-over-year; and professional services revenue was $5.7 million, up 17% year-over-year. Our strong performance in the quarter benefited from broad-based strength on both Atlas and Enterprise Advanced. It is worth noting that one large multiyear Enterprise Advanced deal with a Fortune 50 customer drove $3.5 million of our outperformance. As a reminder, due to revenue recognition mechanics associated with ASC 606, we generally recognize the term license revenue for all the contract years upfront, not just the initial year. The rapid adoption of Atlas continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew over 80% in the quarter and now represents 41% of total revenue compared to 32% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and 40% last quarter. Atlas continues to benefit from strength at both our self-service and direct sales channels while experiencing a growth headwind from historical mLab customer base, which we anniversaried in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, we grew our customer base by over 1,100 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 17,000, which is up from over 13,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 2,000 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,750 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 15,400 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 11,400 in a year-ago period. The sequential growth in total customers includes growth in our Enterprise Advanced customers, as well as new Atlas customers. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer base reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. We also continue to see healthy expansion from our customers, which is a key component of our growth strategy. Our net AR expansion rate in the fourth quarter remained above 120%. We ended the quarter with 751 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 557 in the year-ago period. We also ended the year with 62 customers with at least $1 million in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 39 in the year-ago period. Moving down the P&L, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Please note that we have provided additional disclosures in our earnings release, showing the non-GAAP reconciliation of the individual OpEx line items to help you with your understanding and modeling of the business. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $91.2 million, representing a gross margin of 74% compared to 72% last quarter, and 71% in the year-ago period. Gross Margin benefited from the large multiyear EA license revenue associated with the Fortune 50 customers we mentioned earlier. Overall, we are pleased with our gross margin performance, which reflects greater efficiency and scale in our Atlas business. However, we continue to expect we'll see some modest reduction in overall gross margin as Atlas continues to become a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $12 million or negative 10% operating margin for the fourth quarter compared to a negative 11% margin in the year-ago period. Net loss in the fourth quarter was $14.5 million or $0.25 a share, based on 56.9 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.17 per share on 53.8 million shares outstanding in the year ago period outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $987 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was negative $8.6 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.3 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $10.9 million in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $12.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2021. First, our guidance includes our current best estimate for the anticipated impact of COVID-19 on results. Obviously, the situation is evolving rapidly, but we felt that it was important to attempt to incorporate some impact, despite all of the uncertainty. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $119 million to $121 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $14 million to $12 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.22, based on 57.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2021, we expect revenues to be in the range of $510 million to $530 million. For the full fiscal year 2021, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $78 million to $68 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.23 per share, based on 57.9 million weighted average shares outstanding. Let me provide some additional color to our guidance by discussing and attempting to quantify the potential impact of the COVID-19 virus on our business. Like many global organizations, we believe our operations will likely be impacted by the slowdown in economic activity that is occurring globally. Our fiscal \u201821 planning was completed before the recent acceleration in the spread of the virus. But the current and rapidly evolving realities in the ground led us to decide to update our current forecast. Our current assumption is that the disruption caused by COVID-19 will impact Q1 revenues by approximately $1 million to $2 million and fiscal \u201821 revenues by approximately $15 million to $25 million due to anticipated weaker bookings in the first half of the year. To be clear, at this point, we are seeing minimal impact across our sales channels around the world, including closing transactions in the first quarter, even in the countries hardest hit by COVID-19. However, as a management team, we believe that it is now prudent and responsible to incorporate that into our outlook that we expect what could be a much more challenging economic environment in the coming weeks and months. Our guidance assumes a more normalized business environment in the second half of the year. Obviously, the situation regarding COVID-19 is changing rapidly, and we will continue to evaluate its potential impact on our business. With respect to our overall investment cadence, we have made the decision before the COVID-19 outbreak that we want to continue investing in the business aggressively to pursue our market opportunity. We're funding high-priority projects across the organization, including, first growing our sales capacity globally, which still remains in its early stages from a scale perspective. For context, even in the United States, we still do not have coverage in roughly a quarter of the NFL cities and only have two or fewer reps in half of the NFL cities. Given our strong historic productivity, we believe that the primary governor in productive capacity should be organizational capacity. Second, continue investing in our marketing organization, particularly our product lead growth team, in order to continue to drive our self-service Atlas business and overall Atlas adoption. Finally, as Dev described in his remarks, continuing with robust R&D investments to both deliver on our data platform vision and to further enhance our core products. Given the attractive long-term opportunity we have in front of us, we think it continues to be important and appropriate to keep investing in these high-return areas. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent fourth quarter results, our focus on executing on our product roadmaps and expanding our go-to-market reach is driving high levels of growth at scale. The steps we've taken to establish MongoDB as the modern general purpose data platform of choice positions us for continued long-term success. While we expect to see an impact to our business from the COVID-19 situation in the short term, we remain committed to strong execution in order to capture our long-term market opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Yes, great. Thank you for the question. Happy to provide the guidance. Obviously, it's a rapidly evolving situation. So, it's hard to capture it all with a point estimate. But, what we tried to do is we tried to look at the landscape and say, what are some potential outcomes that might be appropriate to incorporate into our guidance? And so, fundamentally, what we did is we said, let's imagine that in the first half of the year, we see a slowdown and overall economic activity in the way that would flow through is through sales activity and bookings activity. I think that's specifically for the direct sales side of the business. I think, it is less likely that we would see that on the self-service side. And so, what we tried to do is we tried to look at the regions that were most affected and run some sensitivity analysis around what different scenarios might look like. We have assumed -- as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have assumed a normalization of activity in the second half of the year. So, obviously, if things persist or prolonged, we of course would have to reevaluate that approach. But fundamentally, I think, we're exceptionally well-positioned in the market overall. We haven't seen any meaningful impact in the business to date. We have the benefit of having a wide diversification of customers and geographies and industries that we serve. There's certainly some industries that are harder hit and other industries that are actually benefiting. And that diverse portfolio is certainly working for us. But, we wanted to try and do our best to sort of call it out, recognizing how the situation continues to evolve. Yes, sure. So, it was another strong quarter. Thanks for the question Raimo. It was another quarter for Atlas. To your point, I think the two things that are worth calling out are it was the first quarter where we had mLab in the base. And we have talked about the different growth profiles and those cohorts are contracting as we indicated and called out at the time of the acquisition. And also, you're correct that in fiscal '19 fourth quarter, we did come up specific over a consumption that was not seasonally related, but was typically related to the lifecycle of a couple of large apps that were in deployment. And so, I think we just start to neutralize or normalize for both of those. It was, another very strong Atlas quarter. So, I think overall, we feel quite good about that. And then, in terms of the second question, in terms of investment, I think maybe just trying to take a step back from an overall perspective, we as a management team, have a very long-term orientation. We're very, very early on in the stages of trying to capitalize on our opportunity. We will continue to invest as we see good rates of return on the investments that we're making. We see that in both the R&D side, as well as in the sales and marketing side. Certainly if there were to be macroeconomic factors that would change or other sides that sort of eroded or degraded, those investment opportunities we would modulate the levels of investment appropriately. And we've done that throughout the last many, several years. And so, we'll just continue to do that as we think about our role is sort of balancing, maximizing the long-term potential, but also making sure that it's not a growth at all cost mindset, but instead sort of being prudent allocators of capital. Yes. I think just on the second question, just to sort of make sure there's not any confusion. My comments about the likely impact on the business, at least from what we hypothesized ... Yes, it's self-serve. Obviously, Atlas or EA, there's sort of the direct sales side of things. But when you think about some of the potential impacts on a direct sales model of not being able to go to customer sites, people being quarantined or cities being in virtual lockdown, that shouldn't really affect the self-service side of the business as much. Obviously, it's not immune to macroeconomic outcomes, but some of those sort of specific things that we're starting to see rollout across the geographies have much more potential to directly affect -- to affect the direct sales side of things. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. Let me start off by saying that we live in a time of unprecedented circumstances. The global spread of the COVID-19 virus has created an extreme health crisis and resulted in the disruption of the lives of billions of people. The first priority for MongoDB is the safety and wellbeing of our employees and our customers. And we have been managing the business to that effect. Michael will speak in more detail on how we expect this crisis to impact our financial performance. Our job as a management team is to keep steady amidst the turbulence while not losing sight of the long-term opportunity ahead of us. Let me now turn to our fourth quarter results. MongoDB delivered strong results, capping off an outstanding year for the Company. Our technology investments have further strengthened what was already the leading modern data platform. Our investments in sales and marketing have expanded our market reach to make MongoDB available to all customers of all sizes around the world. I'm proud of the performance of our team in fiscal 2020 and believe we are well on our way to establishing MongoDB as one of the primary winners as the database market moves to the cloud. Looking quickly at our fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $123.5 million, a 44% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. For the full year fiscal 2020, we generated $421.7 million in revenues, a 58% year-over-year increase and growth. We grew subscription revenue 46% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and 61% for the full year. Atlas revenue grew over 80% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and now represents 41% of revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 17,000 customers. We believe our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2020 results demonstrate that we have established ourselves as the modern data platform of choice. We continue to be pleased and encouraged by the breadth of adoption of our platform in terms of use cases, industry verticals and geographies. Our sales force is executing at a high level, and we saw meaningful productivity increases in both our enterprise and corporate channels. We also continued to be very pleased with the progress of a self-serve business, as evidenced by a record number of customer additions in Q4. And we continue to expand our self-serve operations to become a world class product-led growth engine. Entering fiscal 2021, we are pleased with our achievements in the two and a half years since becoming a public company, and we are more confident than ever about our long-term prospects. We are pursuing one of the largest and fastest growing markets in all the software. IDC projects the database market to be $71 billion in 2020, growing to $97 billion in 2023. We have less than 1% share of the global database market and a long runway for growth ahead of us. As we look ahead, we're keenly aware of the opportunity in front of us. We strongly believe that the database market is at the very beginning of a profound platform shift towards the cloud over the next decade. As the new and existing workloads migrate to the cloud, customers will be forced to examine and modernize their data architectures. Technology history teaches us that in times of such platform dislocation, new companies emerge as generational leaders. To this end, our belief is that the best way to maximize long-term shareholder value is to make key investments that will position us as one of those leaders. I want to spend more time today to explain how our platform strategy and the associated R&D investments are designed to drive our long-term growth. To start, let me provide some historical context. There have been two fundamental insights that have driven our business to-date. The first key insight that led to the founding of the Company was that the inflexibility and lack of scalability of relational databases were major impediments to organizations that desire to build modern apps quickly with performance and scale. MongoDB's document model and distributed data architecture address these problems, resulting in MongoDB's incredible popularity with developers everywhere. The second key insight was that the process of building modern apps was dramatically increasing the burden of undifferentiated work on development teams. As apps keep proliferating and apps themselves get decomposed into smaller distributed components due to the use of microservices, containers and other related technologies, the scope and complexity of managing apps and infrastructure grows exponentially. This undifferentiated work ends up crowding out the resources needed to invest in enhancing the application and ultimately the business. As a result, in 2012, we started building our tools to automate the provisioning, management and security led database. The logical progression was the introduction of Atlas in 2016, our fully managed databases service offerings that enabled organizations to avoid the hassle of managing distributed databases all together. Today, Atlas continues to be a huge success for us, growing over 80% year-over-year, representing 41% of our revenue in Q4 and is at a $200 million annualized revenue run rate. Thanks to these two insights, we are the only modern database that is considered to be a true general purpose database, has been adopted by millions of developers around the world, and has generated meaningful commercial success, affording us the opportunity to sustain strong growth rates for years to come. Our success has enabled us to acquire over 15,000 Atlas customers in the past 3.5 years, giving us a unique perspective on how we can provide an even greater value to customers in the future. The productivity and economic benefits of the cloud such as real time provisioning, almost unlimited scale and usage based pricing are at this point well-known. However, we also see the challenges that the movement to the cloud has created. In the first decade, the cloud ecosystem largely involved moving existing technology stacks onto the new infrastructure paradigm. These forced developers to deal with a fragmented set of apps and infrastructure tied to discrete use cases, multiple APIs and data spread across many disparate silos. Developer productivity is impeded as they're unable to seamlessly leverage data for different needs. And these problems will only escalate as customers move more workloads to the cloud. This experience led us to a third key insight, the one that is informing our data platform strategy that the apps of the future will dramatically expand in their functionality and scope. Future applications will enable continuous engagement and access to massive amounts of real time data among key constituents, be it users, customers, partners or suppliers. Availability of instantaneous operational data along with insight in that data will increasingly drive business decisions. That means traditional operational workloads will need to incorporate additional functionality, such as real time analytics. In addition, as data on the edge continues to explode due to the increasing use of mobile and IoT apps, future applications will require the ability to effortlessly synchronize data between the edge and the core. Finally, rather than dealing with a large number of complex interfaces, developers will require one unified interface, designed to bring together data at massive scale to build these new applications more quickly and efficiently. We believe MongoDB is incredibly well-positioned to benefit from this emerging trend. We are an operational database, which puts us both at the core of the application we support and makes us a source of its real time mission critical data. We believe developers will credibly expect their core operational database to extend into a full data platform that provides the additional capabilities they need to expand an application scope and functionality. Many of the exciting product announcements we have made over the past year demonstrate how we are already evolving our data platform for applications with greater functionality and scope. Atlas Data Lake brings transactional and analytical use cases together by allowing customers to query both operational and archive data. Atlas Search brings the previously separate search functionality into the operational database. Finally, the integration of Realm and Stitch will address the issue of edge to core data synchronization. These and other future products will leverage our powerful API to access large amounts of data easily to provide an unparalleled developer experience. We know that every enterprise's future will be increasingly powered by software and that apps of the future will leverage data in even more sophisticated ways. Consequently, we're confident these investments designed to address even more complex use cases will further extend our position as the leading modern data platform and put us in an even better positioned to deliver strong long-term growth. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the fourth quarter. Square Enix producers of Tomb Raider, Dragon Quest, and Final Fantasy video games chose MongoDB to support online suite of asynchronous multiplayer features across a wide range of video games. The company continues to invest in MongoDB Atlas for game production to provide the scalability needed for its growing global player base. Atlas allows Square Enix to scale elastically to meet the demands of the game regardless of the number of concurrent players. Software AG's Cumulocity IoT, a leading IoT platform hung a shift to a truly connected world, chose MongoDB Enterprise Advanced as its operational data store. As data is the key to driving actual insights into an IoT-enabled business, MongoDB plays a critical role in helping Software AG customers transform connected device data into immediate value in a scalable and reliable manner. Unqork, a no-code application platform that helps large enterprises, healthcare providers, and government agencies build complex custom software faster, selected MongoDB Atlas as its primary cloud database platform in 2017. The company expanded its use of MongoDB last quarter because they wanted a data platform provider that was cloud agnostic, highly scalable, enterprise security ready and trusted by the Fortune 500 customers. Location-aware data infrastructure company Radar Labs chose MongoDB Atlas to power its geolocation platform, which currently runs on more than 25 million devices around the globe, processing billions of location data points each week. And an early member of MongoDB for startups program, the company continues to make big bets in MongoDB to help scale the delivery of its rich geolocation services, so its developers can focus on the Company's goal of making every app on every device contextually aware. In summary, we are encouraged by attraction as evidenced by our strong Q4 results. The success and our track record of execution give us confidence to aggressively pursue our long-term opportunities. We believe the market is evolving ways that will increasingly play to our core strengths and further establish MongoDB as a modern data platform of choice for developers. Before I turn over the call to Michael, I want to take this opportunity to personally thank our co-founder and CTO, Eliot Horowitz for his vision and technical leadership for over almost 13 years. I talked today about the foundational insight that Eliot and the co-founders had, namely that legacy database technology was not designed to address the needs of modern applications. Out of that insight came the document model, a query language, and the tremendous popularity of MongoDB in the developer community. Thanks to Eliot's vision and leadership, today MongoDB is the world's most popular modern database platform. It will cross $0.5 billion in revenues this year, has over 90 million downloads and over 17,000 customers all around the world. The Company and in particular, the team assembled by Eliot has never been in better shape. And there's strong and deep leadership -- there's a strong and deep leadership team ready to take the baton to further vision of improving developers' lives by making it so easy to work with data. We're excited that Eliot will continue to stay involved and become a technical adviser to MongoDB after leaving his full time role. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael to review our financial results. Yes. Sure, Sanjit. We believe that the growth of EA will continue to be strong. Why? Because there are many customers who want to consume MongoDB on their own in terms of maintaining and managing their own database infrastructure, either because they have a lot of sunk costs, or there's regulatory requirements that require them to run EA on their premises or in certain datacenters that they're allowed to do businesses in. So, one of our value propositions -- one of our key value propositions to our customers is the ability to run and use MongoDB anywhere. And so, we don't force fit every customer to consume it as a service in Atlas. And so -- and customers like that choice. And we have many customers who both procure EA as well as continue to invest in Atlas. Sure. So I'll -- maybe I'll take the first one. So I've been in enterprise software now for almost 20 years, and the lesson learned is that customers are trained to obviously try and get as much leverage as possible. And in every business I've been involved with, the quarters do tend to be back end loaded. Obviously there's nothing different about MongoDB. I would tell you that one of the things that really differentiates us is that we have a very, very rigorous culture of qualification and our sales process.  So, the forecast that roll up to Michael and me, we have a lot of confidence in based on the rigor that the sales team puts in, in terms of forecast for business. So our confidence in the forecast is a measure of the quality of the qualification process. And as you know, for 2.5 years as a public company, we've done a really good job. Michael, you want to handle the second question? Yes, so well, I'm old enough Brad to tell you that I also lived through 2000-2001. So I was a public company officer then and I was a public company officer in 2008-2009. And so, I would tell you that we believe that while sentiment can change quickly, the underlying trends don't change as fast. So deals in progression typically still happen, it's maybe deals who start early in the sales cycle that may have -- end up having more approvals required and so sales cycles may start lengthening.  As we said in the prepared remarks, we see minimal impact right now. But prudence dictated that based on our judgment experience, and having seen this before that some impact given the macroeconomic environment was warranted. Sure. So I would just tell you, the Atlas business is consistent with data business as a whole. And that database software is incredibly sticky. Obviously, the database is the heart of every software application, and people are not going to shut down existing applications, existing services, existing websites, because they still have to come back to business. And so on top of that, with Atlas, they've essentially handed off the ongoing management of their database infrastructure to us. So in times when people may want to do a little bit of belt tightening, it's very unlikely that they'll decide to bring those workloads back in house. In fact, they will like the variable cost model associated with Atlas.  On top of that it's -- most workloads we see have a pretty predictable usage pattern. It's only a few workloads, like games or some very seasonal workloads related to say the Q4, retail environment et cetera, or some e-commerce environment, say on Mother's Day et cetera. And so those kinds of events, you see some spike in usage. So in fact, we are seeing spikes in usage in -- with customers who are in the cryptocurrency business, we're seeing spikes in usage with gaming companies. Obviously a lot of people home playing online games. We're seeing a lot of spikes in usage in terms of telcos and cable companies and their usage is going up.  So I would say in general, though, the usage patterns tend to be fairly predictable. And on top of that, with the fact that people handed off the management of their database to us through Atlas, those workloads tend to be very, very sticky. Yes. So we wouldn't normally like over indexed on talking about any one customer but just given the magnitude, in fact, there was a long-term deal that has impacted the numbers, we just wanted to put that in context. We've had a long-term relationship with this customer, but this is a meaningful expansion. And effectively, we're the platform going forward for non-relational workloads. And typically what we would see is that there would be a mix of both new applications as well as migrations and scenarios like that. Yes. Just to be clear, our $1 million account went from 39 to 62 just for everyone's benefit, and it's incredibly diversified set of customers. So I would not say there's any one predictable set of use cases. And even in those particular customers, we have a land and expand business model. So invariably, those customers are deploying MongoDB for more and more applications and different types of workloads. So it's not one app per se that's growing very, very quickly. And so we're very, very encouraged by -- and we've been talking about this ever since we've been a public company that our business is a land and expand, and the durability of our business is that it's not tied to any one specific app but over time people end up standardizing on MongoDB. And as they get more and more valued at MongoDB they start using us for more and more different workloads. So I wouldn't say there's any one particular use case or any common theme across this $1 million accounts, except the fact that it's -- most of them are our classic land and expand accounts. That's also frankly a very healthy mix of both. So there's no one any concentration of both EA or -- either EA customers or Atlas customers. And so we've seen customers invest very, very aggressively in EA. But we're also seeing a lot of other customers invest aggressively in Atlas. And again, because an earlier question, frankly we have customers that do both. So we got the best of both worlds, some workloads they want to maintain in house and other workloads that make more sense to use a fully managed service like Atlas. Yes. So we are seeing a lot of interest. Customers are trying to replatform legacy database infrastructure. One of the challenges for people is that they ultimately have to not just move the work -- the data but then potentially have to rewrite the application. And so we've talked in the past about using our SI partners in that and now we've announced some other partnerships where we're offering customers migrating toolkits to our partners to frankly reduce the amount of work and heavy lifting required to migrate off relational workloads to MongoDB. And so the degree to which we can make that easier and easier for customers to do so and reduce the friction to do so, I think will only accelerate the amount of migrations we see from legacy workloads to MongoDB. Yes. I mean, so auto scaling is basically enabling customers to not worry. I mean, the whole premise for building MongoDB is to really get the database out of the way. And one of the classic challenges is doing capacity planning with the database, because you want to ensure that you offer good service and good predictable performance to your end users. And so, with auto scaling, we basically take that to next level. As the performance demands of your application grow, the database scales elastically. And so this gives customers peace of mind in terms of not having to worry about having any degradation of performance for the users, customers or partners with ability to auto scale. And typically we find that this is also a win-win for customers, because they don't have to pay for some fixed utilization costs, when -- a fixed costs when the utilization drops. And so it's a win-win for both customers and for us. And so it means, can lead more upscaling and also sometimes a little bit downscaling. But in general, it's a win-win and it allows us to build really healthy long-term relationship with customers. Yes. So I would say that there's a couple of things that we do. One is, we put a lot of rigor, as I mentioned, to an earlier question in our forecasting process, because to us a revenue forecast is by definition also an expense forecast. And so the more fidelity we have in our forecast, the better sense we have in terms of how to really size the capacity of the business relative to that forecast. And so we put enormous amounts of rigor on the -- on our forecasting process and we feel really good about the quality of the forecast that we get from sales force which -- so that's point number one.  Point number 2 is, we obviously spend or invest a lot of time with customers. And with Atlas, we got even higher levels of data and instrumentation of how customers are using our platform. And so that gives us a sense about like, are they using it properly? Are they running into any issues? Have they configured their database correctly? Are they seeing any performance degradation, et cetera. And again, the database is the heart of every application. And so people care very quickly if there's any issues. And so we spend a lot of time focusing on making sure that we're getting a lot of satisfaction and delight from both MongoDB and from Atlas.  And so I would say in general, we don't see today any real impact on the business. But we do again, prudently think that there will be some impact, which is why we gave a guide that we did. And we're obviously going to monitor this very, very carefully, both in terms of our pipeline -- our sales pipeline. We're also tracking obviously our self-service funnel, that funnel was also very, very strong. And -- but if we see any changes, we can respond very, very quickly. Oh! Absolutely. One of the compelling benefits of MongoDB and Atlas and the fact that you don't have to manage databases, the total cost of ownership of MongoDB is so much lower than legacy technology. Yes, I would tell you that it's much more the latter than the former. There's -- in databases, it's historically, there's been a lot of benchmarks used, but a lot of the benchmarks are Jerry-rigged with certain criteria or certain tests that make one vendor look better than another vendor. And customers and developers have particularly become wise to that. What it is, is really all about making a developer's life easier. And one of the real hallmarks of MongoDB is -- and the reason why we are the most popular modern database in the world, is that we can get customers and developers up and running very, very quickly. The document model, our query language, the fact that our database scales very, very easily, the fact that they can consume it as a service, the fact that they can use it for almost every -- any particular use case, because it's true general purpose platform, not some mixed solution, makes us a very, very compelling solution, which is why our business has grown so quickly, and it's all development led.  And we're investing a lot in the business. We've made a lot of investments in expanding our developer relations, capabilities to engage with the developers and given everyone is now working virtually, we're going to see do a lot more online seminars and education to get developers up to speed on all the latest features and benefits of MongoDB. And on top of that, we continue to invest a lot in our self-serve business, where developers -- either developers sitting in the garage or developers from a large Fortune 500 organization can engage with MongoDB and get going very, very quickly. Sure. So let me take both questions. On the first question on World, I want to be clear, World was never designed to be a pipeline acceleration conference. This is really designed to be an education conference for our community. And in fact, the more [meetings] and technical and in depth the content, the better. And so obviously there's a big investment by organization, especially on the engineers who are actually building our capabilities. That's where the developers want to spend time or they want to meet the people who are writing the code, ask technical -- deep technical questions, spend time with the experts. So there was never really a pipeline acceleration conference. Obviously, around that conference, you may arrange meetings with more senior level stakeholders. But if you look at the content from prior years, it was really, really focused on serving the needs of the technical community of MongoDB. So we don't see any potential impact on making MongoDB World a virtual conference. On the -- and candidly frankly, now that's virtual I shouldn't mention in fact reimagining the conference and frankly trying to make -- since it's virtual, appealing, it's being able to reach many more developers at one time. Because we only used to broadcast the keynotes where we had 10,015 people listen to the keynotes. But the individual conference were not broadcast or video streamed. And so we remanaged the conference so that more people can get access and hear the latest and greatest about MongoDB.  With regards to Eliot, obviously we're incredibly grateful for his contributions and his leisure for the last 13 years. He has really assembled an incredibly strong team. Two of his key lieutenants have been with the company for more than seven plus years. And they're stepping up with in a bigger role. And Sahir, our Chief Product officer was put in place a couple of quarters ago. And so that was also part of setting up the transition for this move. And so we've really, really got a strong deep bench under Eliot. There's no plans to recruit a CTO from the outside at this point. And I couldn't be prouder of the team that's here because I feel that we have a massive opportunity in front of us and a world class team to help us get there. Well, again, I am very grateful for all of you who are able to listen to the conference, obviously my thoughts and prayers to all of you and those affected by COVID-19. We hope we will get through this quickly. And obviously, we're focused as a business on serving the needs of our customers and employees. And we'll talk to you at our next earnings call. Thank you."

MongoDB continued to deliver terrific financial and operational results that further strengthened our position as the most popular modern data platform in the world. Our performance is driven by the unique capabilities of our technology and our go-to-market strategy that enables customers of all sizes to consume MongoDB how they see fit. We are in the early stages of a once-in-a-generation shift in database technology and we remain confident in our ability to capture a meaningful share of the $64 billion global database software market. Looking quickly at our third quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $109.4 million, a 52% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 56% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew more than 185% year-over-year and now represents 40% of revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 15,900 customers. This was another outstanding quarter for Atlas, which is now $175 million revenue run rate business, just over 3 years from launch, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. Atlas is driving change across our entire business as we increasingly become a cloud-first company.  I would like to showcase 3 ways in which Atlas is making us a better company. As our business shifts towards the cloud, we are able to increase our pace of innovation with new products, features and capabilities. Cloud services give us better insight into how customers use our products, and cloud services enable us to expand the different ways we go to market, increasing our ability to pursue a larger variety of customers around the world. All 3 together create a flywheel effect for our business. First, since we deliver MongoDB as a cloud service through Atlas, we can deploy new features continuously rather than on an annual release cadence of an on-premise product. Furthermore, since new products are initially built for the cloud, our product teams can work quickly and independently to introduce new products and features, increasing the pace of innovation and providing more value to our customers more quickly. A great example of our continuous innovation is the recent introduction of auto scaling on Atlas, which we announced in September. This feature brings automated capacity management to Atlas.  When enabled, Atlas will now attract key resource utilization metrics in real time and autonomously adjust instant sizes, up or down, as needed by using predictive modeling and proven management practices developed from matching tens of thousands of MongoDB deployments. With this feature, Atlas now efficiently and elastically scales the customers' deployment to match their business needs without the need for manual intensive monitoring, analysis and intervention. Early customer feedback provides a great validation for this feature, and in the future, it will influence how we introduce this capability for private clouds. Second, with Atlas, we also get granular visibility to future adoption and user behavior. This continuous and data-driven feedback loop allows us to understand what features customers find most valuable, where in the product they may get stuck or where they're not taking advantage of all the capabilities available. This enables us to iterate more often and more intelligently, ensuring that our product teams are focused on the most important opportunities. As a result, we can identify in real time ways we can help customers optimize their MongoDB deployments with more timely and relevant assistance. For example, we realized that a premier global financial institution was running an internal HR application without mission-critical scalability and security features, which negatively impacted the application performance and created significant risk.  By proactively identifying these issues and sharing best practices, we developed a deep and trusted relationship with this large customer. As another example, through database usage metrics, such as increased IO throughput or turning on backup, we can infer when an application is likely to go into production. These types of insights allow us to scalably engage with our customers at key moments when they are likely to increase the complexity and criticality of their MongoDB deployment. Moreover, when -- we learn a great deal from how beta customers interact with our new cloud products, including Atlas Data Lake and, Full-Text Search. And we expect the same benefits when we introduce future products, such as the public beta of the revamped Realm product. Our confidence in the successful GA rollout of these new products will only increase after learnings from beta customers. We regularly incorporate these learnings into our enterprise advanced release, improving the value of our on-premises product as well. Consequently, we're looking to further invest in technology and data science to harness these types of signals to build even stronger relationships and find more opportunities to win more business. Ultimately, this positive feedback cycle gives us greater confidence in the returns on the R&D investments and the durability of our customer relationships. Finally, Atlas is broadening our reach into the global database market. MongoDB is not only one of the most popular databases but Atlas also enables customers anywhere in the world to easily use MongoDB through our free tier and self-service offerings, whether they're start-ups or development teams in large organizations. Since Atlas is available and one of the three largest cloud providers outside of Mainland China, AWS, Azure and GCP, it is the most widely available managed cloud database service in the world. By having relationships with all 3 cloud providers, we benefit from access to their customers and geographic reach, and we are seeing positive results with all three. The third quarter was the first full quarter of our expanded partnership with GCP, and we are encouraged by the number of deals closed and the level of pipeline activity. As the latest example of our successful partners strategy, we announced a new partnership with Alibaba Cloud. Together, we are providing the first authorized MongoDB as a service in Mainland China. Partnering with the largest tech company in China extends our reach into one of the largest markets in software and validates the value of our IT and the strength of the SSPL licensing model. Thanks to these types of partnerships, we continue to propel MongoDB as a leading data platform around the world. I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the third quarter. We continue to see an increasing wide array of customers choosing MongoDB to run mission-critical applications. Axiata, one of the leading telecom groups in Asia, selected MongoDB Atlas and Enterprise Advanced to power Axiata's digital key fintech application. MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility and how cost-effective it was compared to the company's legacy Oracle database. MongoDB provides the high performance, availability and scalability that the application needs to bring cashless convenience to the fingertips of both consumers and merchants throughout Malaysia.  The Washington Post has chosen MongoDB to provide mission-critical support for its primary digital content management platform, Arc Publishing. MongoDB Enterprise Advanced serves as the backbone for its more than 750 million unique visitors a month and helps content teams power their businesses through innovation, better customer experiences and storytelling on an integrated suite of tools. MongoDB gives them the flexibility to run both on-premises and in the cloud. Foursquare, a location technology platform dedicated to powering business solutions and consumer products through a deep understanding of locations, chose MongoDB Atlas to power all of its B2B enterprise location services. These services, which include tools for developers, location analytics, advertising, targeting, measurement and more, have been chosen by more than 50% of the Fortune 100. As Foursquare completes the digital transformation, MongoDB will continue to scale with them in the cloud. Keller Williams Realty, one of the world's largest real estate franchises, selected MongoDB Atlas as the core database to power its new game-changing real estate mobile app. The app gives Keller Williams' real estate brokers a competitive advantage by using AI to reveal the most relevant information to potential buyers at the right time. Netskope is a next-generation cloud security platform that helps customers manage evolving security needs driven by digital transformation. They chose MongoDB to provide security and scale they needed to expand internationally. MongoDB gives Netskope the critical data ingestion and visualization capabilities to provide unrivaled visibility, real-time data and threat protection when accessing cloud services, websites and private applications. To summarize, MongoDB's third quarter performance was strong across the board. We are executing well on our strategic priorities and believe we are well positioned to continue gaining share in the global database market. Before I transition to Michael, I want to add that we are thrilled to welcome Frank D'Souza, the co-founder and former CEO of Cognizant to our Board. Frank scaled Cognizant from inception to a $16 billion global professional services company. His experience and insight, in particular, massively scaling a technology company will be invaluable to us given our long-term aspirations. With that, let me now turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dave. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the third quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2020. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $109.4 million, up 52% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $103.8 million, up 56% year-over-year, and professional services revenue was $5.6 million, up 8% year-over-year. Our performance in the quarter benefited from broad-based strengths from both Atlas and Enterprise Advanced as well as positive demand trends in all major regions. We continue to benefit from an attractive combination of new logo additions and continued strength in up-sell activity, which we believe positions us well going forward. The rapid adoption of Atlas continues to be the largest contributor to our growth.  Atlas grew over 185% in the quarter and now represents 40% of total revenue compared to 21% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 37% last quarter. Atlas' continued strong growth and an increasing scale reflects a strong product market fit and a clear market shift amongst customers of all sizes for the fully managed global database offer -- cloud database offering. We are confident that these positive market trends, coupled with the operational initiatives Dave mentioned earlier, can drive continued strong growth in Atlas for the foreseeable future. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by over 900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 15,900, which is up from over 8,300 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 1,900 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,700 in the year ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 14,200 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 6,200 in the year ago period. The sequential growth in total customers includes growth in our Enterprise Advanced customers as well as new Atlas customers. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB, in addition to existing Enterprise Advanced customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We also continue to see healthy expansion from existing customers, which is a key component of our growth strategy. Our net AR expansion rate in the third quarter remained above 120% for the 20th consecutive quarter. We ended the quarter with 688 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 490 in the year ago period. Moving down the P&L, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $79.3 million, representing a gross margin of 72% compared to 72% last quarter and 77% in the year ago period. As a reminder, the year ago period benefited from the larger license mix from multiyear Enterprise Advanced transactions, and the current period margin is impacted by the mLab acquisition. Overall, we are pleased with our gross margin performance, which reflects greater efficiency and scale in our Atlas business. However, we continue to expect that we will see some modest reduction in overall gross margin as Atlas continues to become a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $14.3 million or negative 13% operating margin for the third quarter compared to a negative 11% margin in the year ago period. Given the size and early stage of our market opportunity and our demonstrated product market fit, our primary focus will to be -- continue to be on investing in the business. Net loss in the third quarter was $14.6 million or $0.26 per share, based on 56.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.13 per share on 52.7 million shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $426.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was negative $11.5 million. After taking into consideration approximately $1.6 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $13.1 million in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $9.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. As a reminder, the continuing growth of Atlas as a percentage of our overall business impacts our reported financial results in several ways. First, Atlas revenue is recorded on a consumption basis, whereas Enterprise Advanced includes a term license component that is recognized upfront. So for a comparable dollar-sized contract, both Enterprise Advanced and Atlas will recognize the same amount over the contract term, but the Atlas contract will generate less initial revenue, and as Atlas grows as a percentage of our revenue over time, this timing impact is greater.  Second, Atlas has a lower overall gross margin than Enterprise Advanced because of its infrastructure component. That said, on an apples-to-apples functionality basis, Atlas is accretive to dollars of gross profit.  Finally, self-service Atlas customers and a growing portion of our direct sales Atlas customers pay us monthly in arrears versus annually upfront for Enterprise Advanced. We would expect the percentage of customers paying monthly in arrears to grow over time as we increase our focus on driving adoption of Atlas. We believe that facilitating the ease of consumption will ultimately maximize long-term revenues and cash flow. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $109 million to $111 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $16.5 million to $15.5 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.27 based on 56.8 million weighted average shares outstanding. As a reminder, we anniversaried the acquisition of mLab on November 1. For the full fiscal year 2020, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $407 million to $409 million compared to our previous guidance of $390 million to $395 million. For the full fiscal year 2020, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $58 million to $57 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.02 per share based on 55.9 million weighted average shares outstanding.  To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent third quarter results. Our focus on executing on our product road map and expanding our go-to-market reach is driving high levels of growth at scale. The steps we have taken to establish MongoDB as the modern general data platform of choice positions us for continued success. And with that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Congratulations on another strong quarter. Dave, first question for you and one for Mike. We obviously had big AWS conference last week, and I'm just wondering like what was interesting there is just the lack of, kind of, focus from the competing product, they kind of launched. Can you just talk a little bit about like how the last year has played out for you in terms of, like, initially some noise and now it looks like it's kind of somewhat going away? Like what are you seeing in the market in terms of customers understanding really the advantages of going with kind of Mongo rather than some kind of duplication of that? And then for Mike, since billing, if I listened to you correctly, then billing it's probably -- it's going to have more and more noise in there. Have you thought about giving us different metrics? Or how should we think about the future of the business if we want to kind of analyze that?\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Raimo. So with regards to DocumentDB, I think it was January of this year that Amazon officially launched DocumentDB. And I know there was some trepidation with investors about the potential impact on our business. And as you can -- as you've seen now for the last 4 quarters, our business has performed really, really well. I think there's been a number of reasons for that. One, this market is truly massive. It's one of the largest markets in enterprise software and I think there's room for a lot of people. Two, unlike lot of other open source technologies, we have a strong moat around our business, especially our own IP. So it's very difficult. Actually, it's illegal for a cloud provider to take our native code and wrap it into their platform and offer it as a service.  So what Amazon did was basically try to emulate MongoDB through a different architecture, which has severe performance and feature trade-offs. Last count DocumentDB failed about 65% of the correctives, the test, compatibility test against MongoDB. So for those customers who have primitive requirements, DocumentDB could work. But for most customers, who have mission-critical requirements and want the breadth of use cases that MongoDB supports, MongoDB is by far the best choice, and I think you see that reflected in our numbers. And you're right, we didn't see any real news about DocumentDB. We just heard a lot of other announcements, and so we feel quite good about our position in the marketplace.\nMichael Gordon: And then, Raimo, on your kind of billings-related question, yes, I think from the very beginning and outside of our life as a public company, we've highlighted how that's not a metric that we use internally or one that we focus on. I, obviously, understand that it's a popular one that investors and other folks look at. We tend to focus on the revenue, specifically, in the business. I think the other piece that's particularly challenging about billings, which we've talked about is, we're looking at sort of the revenue plus the change in deferred; historically, the change in deferred has really been the place where people have chosen to -- or people have a chance to outperform in recurring revenue subscription businesses, and I think Atlas sort of changes that. And so looking at deferreds in isolation, in particular, we've heavily discouraged people from billing.  We also are going to be, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, continuing to focus on driving ease of adoption and ease of use of adopting Atlas, and that will continue to most likely involve a higher percentage of Atlas-related customers paying monthly for invoicing in arrears rather than signing big, large commitments upfront and paying for those, which would generate incremental deferred revenue. So I think while it's not a metric that we've ever focused on, I think you're correct it's of decreasing value or insight relative to understanding the business. We have looked at other metrics to try to discern or determine if there are other metrics that are useful. Unfortunately, we haven't found anything that actually provides an incrementally helpful view of the world, but we'll continue to look.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: Another great quarter from you guys. Dave, I wanted to talk a little bit about Atlas. From my perspective, this is one of the stronger Atlas quarters and that one has been strong for quite some time, but it really felt like this quarter was even stronger than we expected. And I was wondering if you could sort of break out the strengths between the self-service part of the business on Atlas and what you're seeing on the enterprise expansion side? Any details there?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Thanks, Sanjit. I would just say that I think we saw broad performance and good performance across the board. I think we're feeling really good about sales sold Atlas. Our sales teams, as you know, have really found a lot of success with Atlas with both midsized and large enterprises and that business -- and that channel is doing very well with Atlas. And we're also seeing increasing success in our self-serve business. We continue to increase the velocity of experimentation, to test and test in terms of like search and paid search and organic search. We're looking -- we're expanding our business more and more overseas, and we're seeing a lot of similarities in terms of needs.  We're seeing registration from corporate accounts increase, well, nicely for us, so that these are sometimes development teams in large organizations who are -- or testing Atlas maybe as a precursor to doing a big deployment. And we're also getting better at using our data and analytics to get more insight into our business. So our self-serve business is also very iterative, but we feel really good about that channel and the sales sold channels. I wouldn't say there's only one channel that outperformed the other.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. You mentioned in your script about the traction you're seeing across the 3 major public cloud providers. I was wondering if you could contextualize the opportunity with the Alibaba partnership, in terms of what did sort of MongoDB traction look like historically in China? And what do you see the opportunity? If you could sort of frame out the opportunity with Alibaba going forward in the Chinese market.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So we have seen, just through downloads, that China be -- is a very, very big and popular market for MongoDB. And I've been to China multiple times. We have a number of large enterprise customers there. When we run our user conferences, they tend to be packed. So we know that there's lot of interest and appetite for using MongoDB for a wide variety of applications, use cases. The challenge we've had in China is that due to the regulations there, we could not offer Atlas directly in China because there's rules about owning data centers directly, and obviously, we did not until recently have any relationships with any local entities.  And candidly, we've been in discussions with Alibaba for some time and -- but there was clearly interest on both sides to do something. One, Alibaba recognized the value of working with us, recognized the value of getting -- working with a team that's building the code and also getting another level of support. And we wanted to, frankly, work with the largest tech company in China because they obviously have massive reach in that market. And so I would say, we're very excited about the opportunity. It's still very early days. We just had some people in China 2 weeks ago doing some events there, and the interest level and activity level is very, very high.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs.\nDaniel Church: This is Dan Church on for Heather Bellini. Earlier this year in MongoDB World, you guys announced a number of new products and features, like Data Lake, Full-Text Search. Can you give us an update on the traction you're seeing and what the early feedback has been? And for something like Full-Text Search, how are you thinking about the potential uplift in customer spend?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Thanks for the question. So just to remind everyone, so we announced Atlas Data Lake and Full-Text Search at MongoDB World this past summer. It's still in beta. So we're engaging with hundreds of customers who are right now using the product. We expect it to go GA next year at our World Conference around the May timeframe. And the feedback has been really, really positive. We're really excited about the feedback because it helps us sharpen the product, understand how customers are using the product, understand potentially details around user experience as well as the full feature and functionality and the use cases that people may be using, and we're very excited. And just to remind everyone, Atlas Data Lake really enables customers to use the same semantics with MongoDB to basically query off-line data as they do with online data.  So it's a very easy product to use, adds immediate value. It's a pay-as-you-go model. So the upfront investment or there's very low entry-level of cost, and the ROI is very compelling, and we're really excited about that product. Full-Text Search is basically a request that customers have asked, making of us for some time, because rather than using disparate systems, they'd rather use one platform. And so we're excited about that opportunity as well, and the feedback there has also been incredibly positive. And so it's hard for me to tell you what the uplift will be, but we're feeling very bullish about both products.\nDaniel Church: Helpful. And then last quarter, I believe you called out a tough comp coming up in 4Q, just based on a handful of Atlas customers that were consuming in excess of the run rate. I was just wondering if you could put a little context or commentary as to the size and what you're seeing in terms of utilization today? And then how the pipeline looks as we get into 4Q and out into fiscal '21?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I think there are three things to keep in mind in terms of the difficult compare that we have in Q4. First is, this is the first quarter where we'll have the anniversary of mLab as the base period and recall that the mLab cohorts are declining. So that's sort of the first point to make sure that you keep in mind. Secondly, we did call out last year that we did have a handful of accounts who are overconsuming relative to their commitment levels, and we don't have any reason to believe that, that's seasonal or anything else related to that. So I think we should look at that as sort of not reproducible or replicatable. And then third, it was just a really great quarter, frankly, last year. And so while we're eager to have more good quarters, we don't want to count on all of them looking like that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel.\nBrad Reback: So some of our customer work has shown that some large customers out there are beginning to take existing Enterprise Advanced installs and move them over to Atlas. So maybe you can give us a sense of what type of opportunity that is for you from a financial standpoint?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So Brad, thanks for the question. I would say that the scenario you outlined is still one that's, I would say, more of a exception than the rule that tends to happen less frequently. And that's really more driven by the fact that customers have decided that rather than managing their own infrastructure, they'd rather consume MongoDB as a service. And we still believe in the value of offering an on-prem product because there are many customers who either have a lot of sunk cost and want to preserve those investments or they are in certain regulated industries that prevent them from using cloud services or, frankly, are just taking a more conservative approach to the cloud and are on a slower path to moving to the cloud.  And what MongoDB does is just enable them to use MongoDB in whatever -- wherever they are in that journey from on-prem to the cloud. And so while there are definitely some customers who may be migrating their Enterprise Advanced implementation on-premise to the cloud that's driven typically by their own needs, the desire to maybe move to the cloud themselves, desire to reduce the amount of investments in their own infrastructure and maybe the ability to iterate and innovate more quickly, but it's not driven by us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin of Piper Jaffrey.\nBrent Bracelin: One for Dave and a follow-up for Michael, if I could. Dave, I wanted to go back to the prepared remarks. I mean we heard a lot of talk around your now cloud-first strategy, very similar to the commentary we heard at MongoDB World where you're now adding features to the cloud version, Atlas version of Mongo here first. My question is really around the customer response to that. As you look at your pipeline, are you seeing a greater mix of customers and a customer appetite to also go cloud first? Just trying to understand as you make this pivot, as you make a broader narrative around your own cloud for a strategy, is that really customer-driven? Or is there a variance in customer appetite around Enterprise Advanced and Atlas?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, great question. I would say that we tend to be very customer-centric or customer-obsessed organization. So we tend to listen to our customers very, very carefully. And it's no secret that many customers do desire to move to the cloud. The pay-as-you-go model, the low-entry costs, the ability to elastically scale are all compelling reasons to move to the cloud. And so -- and what's also interesting is smaller customers and early-stage customers tend to prefer to go to the cloud as fast as possible because that allows them to avoid and having to invest in their own infrastructure and really allows them to focus their limited resources on the work that really differentiates their business. And so what Atlas has done is really open the aperture of the customers we can go after, and frankly, monetize.  And so as you may remember, with Atlas, we can monetize every interaction with every customer, depending if they're an early stage start-up in a garage or a large-scale enterprise in the Fortune 500. And so -- and what Atlas does is basically enable them to start in whatever scale they want to start and then grow from there. And what we find is customers may just have one app and then that app grows. But more typically, we find as soon as they launch one app, they very quickly start launching other apps because they find the value of Atlas so compelling. And so our growth and expansion of Atlas is very, very strong.\nBrent Bracelin: And then just quick follow-up here for Michael. As we think about Enterprise Advanced, we have that modeled about 15% growth this quarter. I know it was a tough compare. You have 606. Next quarter, we have implied growth closer to 5%. Should we think about this as being the new norm for kind of Enterprise Advanced with the customer appetite shifting to Atlas? Should we think about Enterprise Advanced as kind of a lower growth type business, just given the mix shift going on? Any color there would be helpful.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I think the key thing to think about Enterprise Advanced is unfortunately it relies in the 606 accounting. It's very much driven by the components of the term license revenue, which is driven off of when the subscription start date is. And as we've talked about previously, it can also be influenced by the mix of multiyear contracts or not, which certainly affects the Q3 base period, as we previously indicated. So I think it's much more an indicator of sort of the variability that we'll see quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year that make those kinds of comparisons either sequentially or annually, very difficult to make just as a result of the 606 accounting.\nBrent Bracelin: Got it. So more noise than anything else.\nMichael Gordon: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Radke of Citi.\nTyler Radke: Dave, I was hoping you could talk about just how looking back maybe on the last 3, 4 years of Atlas, just how the customer use cases have evolved? Maybe how the quality of customer, quality of revenue has evolved? And then maybe for Michael. You talked about potentially a higher mix of customers paying in arrears. Just how are you thinking about that from a guidance perspective? Because obviously, if you're having less of that Atlas revenue come from deferred, I presume it makes it a little bit more difficult to guide?\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. Thanks, Tyler. So just to be clear, we launched Atlas about a little over 3 years ago, and so -- the summer of 2016. And so the first year was really driven predominantly by self-service, where we had a lot of demand, organic demand, from developers around the world who really wanted to leverage MongoDB as a service. It took us about a good year to really enable our sales force to know how to sell a cloud service because historically that all they had been doing was selling enterprise product. And then the sales force kicks in, in the second year, and that's when we really started seeing penetration in large and small-to-medium accounts.  I would actually say that our traction was first in small-to-medium market, where those cohort customers really saw the value of Atlas because they had very little interest in investing in their own operational infrastructure. And slowly, we started to pick away use cases and workloads with the very large enterprise customers. And now we're kind of seeing a healthy mix across all 3 channels. And so that's essentially how that business has evolved.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. Then just on the guidance, I would say, the key thing is where we guide to really is on the income statement, so the revenue and the net loss position. And whether -- given that Atlas is all consumption-based as opposed to Enterprise Advanced, which has that term license component. Given that Atlas is all consumption based, whether it's signed for in an annual contract with an annual commitment that's paid upfront, that would generate that deferred revenue or whether or not it's monthly invoicing in arrears, the revenue recognition is consumption based. So it doesn't really impact or affect our guidance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jack Andrews of Needham.\nJon Andrews: Dave, I was wondering if you could give us an update on maybe the depth and breadth of strategic C-level conversations you're having these days. To the extent that you're having them, are they still more all about digital transformations or are there some other drivers that are happening there? And just how does that translate into your -- how do these conversations translate into your business? Should we be thinking about potentially larger deal sizes over time?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So as I had mentioned in the past, we have tended to go a lot higher organization than historically we've ever done as a company. But we also spend a lot of time focused on the developer community, driving awareness and making sure that they're fully updated on all our products and services. I would say, over the last, I would say, 18 months or so, one of the big themes with the senior level stakeholders and key accounts is the increasing awareness of multi-cloud. Customers are obviously very sensitive about being locked into any one platform. They also value the ability to arbitrage between one cloud provider and other cloud provider, and they also want the opportunity to maybe have certain access to different capabilities and strengths of each of the different cloud providers, and so that's been a big theme. I would say the other big theme is obviously being able to drive developer productivity. Every organization is under tremendous pressure to innovate quickly, either disrupt or be disrupted. And so using MongoDB to drive developer throughput and developer velocity has also become very, very important. The rise of mobile, the rise of new use cases, like IOT, machine learning, deep learning, et cetera, are also top of mind of these customers. And then obviously analytics. That's an area that they're always very interested in because they want to gain deeper insights in their business, so something like Atlas Data Lake becomes very, very interesting to them because they can leverage the existing investments they've made in their people and get the value of a deep analytics platform to basically run analytics on both your online and off-line data. So I would say, obviously, every customer has own unique requirements and priorities, but those are some of the themes that we hear from senior stakeholders in these organizations.\nJon Andrews: I appreciate the color. And just as a quick follow-up, are you seeing any change in appetite for just the whole legacy application modernization opportunities? Is there any inflection in demand on those types of use cases?\nDev Ittycheria: That's going in full force. We see legacy monetization as one of the key drivers to our business, the move to the cloud as another. That could be tied to some legacy modernization initiative, but it could be also just a desire to get more and more of their infrastructure off-premise and into the cloud. So those are huge, huge initiatives for us. And a lot of times, we're helping customers think through which applications to modernize first and where we can be most helpful, and so those are some of the conversations we're having.\nJon Andrews: Congratulations on the results.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria of D.A. Davidson.\nRishi Jaluria: First, I just wanted to maybe follow-up and thinking about China. I appreciate it's obviously a huge opportunity. But maybe can you help us understand from the licensing perspective, what gives you the confidence in SSPL being able to protect you and not having a situation where the code is either replicated or emulated to a heavy extent? And then I've got a follow-up.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Well, thanks for your question. I mean one, China is obviously a massive market. It's got a huge number of developers. There's a big focus in China to using software to drive a lot of innovation. We are an open source company, so our source code is available to all. And as we said, when we introduced our new SSPL licensing. In certain parts of the world, it's very hard to adjudicate those issues. But Alibaba felt it was important for them to have a direct relationship with us to get access to the latest features, to get access to engineers and our support infrastructure because they see such a big opportunity for MongoDB in that market.  And so I want to be clear, it is -- the Alibaba relation is not Atlas. It's a separate OEM relationship. It's based on some minimums that we expect every year, and then we will have true-ups on an annual basis, and it will not be counted as Atlas revenue. And so -- but it is a way to access the Chinese market in a way that we've never been able to do before by having the largest tech company in China partner with you. And we think that's a very compelling reason to go into partnership with Alibaba.\nRishi Jaluria: All right. I appreciate that. And then just if we were to think about -- you're clearly seeing strength in both Atlas as well as Enterprise Advanced, and then you've put up 20 quarters of 120% plus net expansion rate. I think just directionally, if we were to think about -- how would expansion rates look like with Enterprise Advanced customers versus with those using Atlas, anything direction, I think, would be helpful?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So what we've talked about before is the number that we give is really done by channels, so that's the direct sales channel. It's not really done by product, is the way to think about it. So we see strong expansion in enterprise customers, whether it's Enterprise Advanced and then staying with Enterprise Advanced, whether it's Enterprise Advanced and adding Atlas workloads, or whether the relation starts up with Atlas and expands either to more Atlas or then Enterprise Advanced for certain workloads, sort of, regardless of sort of what the trajectory is because there's not one common monolithic pattern or a typical consistent pattern that people fall into.  What we have publicly said is, if you separately look at the self-service cohort and the self-service behavior of customers who are signing up for Atlas, the net ARR expansion of those cohorts is even greater than the net ARR expansion we see in the direct sales channel. And so I think that sort of speaks to the incredibly strong product market fit that we see in Atlas, both in the direct channel as well as self-serve, but hopefully, that gives a little bit of incremental color that we shared.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pat Walravens of JMP Securities.\nPatrick Walravens: Congratulations. So Dave, the venture community seems to be advising their portfolio companies more and more to use a product-led growth strategy for their go-to-market as opposed to sales or marketing led? Is that basically what you're talking about here in terms of how Atlas is changing the business? And then I have a follow-up.\nDev Ittycheria: I would say that -- yes, this is a product-like growth is clearly a new trend in terms of how people drive top line growth. I would say, a company that has done that well was Atlassian. And so -- and clearly, that's something that we're doing here, especially on the self-serve side of the business, where we're looking for data signals in terms of how people are using the product. And as I shared in my prepared remarks, there are certain signals that tell us if you're doing something really, really important. And we want to be there -- we want to know that in advance and know that as soon as that happens, because we want to be there with the customer so that we can help them through those important moments of their application, whether it's going to production or they're expanding their capacity or expanding geographically, et cetera, or -- and so those are the kind of signals that we use to help drive our business.  And so those signals tell us if a customer is expanding. Another example would be, if for some reason, we suddenly see a spike in utilization, we don't automatically assume that's a good thing. That could be that they have misconfigured their MongoDB implementation and we could actually have a very grumpy customer. And identifying that customer quickly, making sure that they know what they're doing. And in many cases, they're very grateful that we quickly identify those issues, help them solve any misconfigurations because that builds only a deeper and more trusted relation with our customer. So those are examples of how we're using product signals to drive growth. And as you can imagine, [Technical Difficulty] data science because we have lots of customers around the world so you can do this manually. And obviously, we add a lot of human resources, especially for larger customers and even some midsize customers.\nPatrick Walravens: That's super helpful. And then, Michael, for you, 52% growth of scale is obviously awesome. But one question I get a lot is, the business has decelerated a couple of quarters, PAT, where does that stop and even out? And I don't know if that's something that you would be willing to address or at least maybe how to think about it?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I think when you look at the Q4 guidance, I'd say, overall, we feel really good about the guidance. And clearly, when we gave our Q3 guidance and full year guidance on the September call, there was some implied or embedded Q4 guidance implied in that number. And clearly, we've raised that when you do the math. So I think that shows that we're feeling quite good. I would reiterate what we've talked about in terms of the Q4, just remembering the mLab impact, both in terms of it being the first time that we've hit the anniversary of that as well as those cohorts decelerating. But in general, I think we feel really good about where we are.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vinod Srinivasaraghavan of Oppenheimer.\nVinod Srinivasaraghavan: Congrats on the strong quarter. I have a question on Atlas first. You had mentioned that expansion rates were strong with both self-serve and direct customers, but are you seeing new self-serve and direct sales lands come on board who are spending much more now within their first year compared to when you IPO'ed?\nDev Ittycheria: No question. As Atlas becomes more popular, as we add new features and capabilities, as we add more coverage around the world, as customers themselves get more comfortable, the word-of-mouth and virality of the usage, we're clearly seeing deal sizes go up in Atlas.\nMichael Gordon: And I think you can see that not just in the sales sold side of things, which of sort of the two channels within Atlas is actually the fastest-growing channel but also you can see increasing spend for self-service customer, which at this point is most -- the vast majority of which is Atlas related, and we report that level of detail in the Qs, and so you can see that there.\nVinod Srinivasaraghavan: Okay. Great. And one more. Can you just give us an update on some of the sales capacity investments you've been making. How is your hiring new sales reps progressing?\nDev Ittycheria: It's progressing well. Obviously, this is something that we focus a lot on, because a big vector for our growth is the amount of feet on the street that we have. And so we spend a lot of time recruiting the right people, and then spending a lot of time investing in them and developing those people to ultimately get them to produce results and produce results consistently over time. And so that's a big part of the attention of the management's bandwidth, is just about how we scale infrastructure. As you can imagine, not just hiring salespeople, but sales leadership, technical presales to complement our salespeople in the field, partner resources in different parts of the world, so that's all part and parcel of our formula in terms of how we scale the business.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over Dev Ittycheria for any closing remarks.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you. Thanks, everyone -- to everyone for joining us today. Again, just to reiterate, we feel really good about our business. We think we had a terrific quarter, and we look forward to speaking to some of you in the next couple of days. I know that Michael and Serge will be at a couple of investor conferences. So I suspect some of you will be there as well. Talk to you soon. Take care. Bye-bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the third quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2020. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $109.4 million, up 52% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $103.8 million, up 56% year-over-year, and professional services revenue was $5.6 million, up 8% year-over-year. Our performance in the quarter benefited from broad-based strengths from both Atlas and Enterprise Advanced as well as positive demand trends in all major regions. We continue to benefit from an attractive combination of new logo additions and continued strength in up-sell activity, which we believe positions us well going forward. The rapid adoption of Atlas continues to be the largest contributor to our growth.  Atlas grew over 185% in the quarter and now represents 40% of total revenue compared to 21% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 37% last quarter. Atlas' continued strong growth and an increasing scale reflects a strong product market fit and a clear market shift amongst customers of all sizes for the fully managed global database offer -- cloud database offering. We are confident that these positive market trends, coupled with the operational initiatives Dave mentioned earlier, can drive continued strong growth in Atlas for the foreseeable future. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by over 900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 15,900, which is up from over 8,300 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 1,900 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,700 in the year ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 14,200 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 6,200 in the year ago period. The sequential growth in total customers includes growth in our Enterprise Advanced customers as well as new Atlas customers. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB, in addition to existing Enterprise Advanced customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We also continue to see healthy expansion from existing customers, which is a key component of our growth strategy. Our net AR expansion rate in the third quarter remained above 120% for the 20th consecutive quarter. We ended the quarter with 688 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 490 in the year ago period. Moving down the P&L, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $79.3 million, representing a gross margin of 72% compared to 72% last quarter and 77% in the year ago period. As a reminder, the year ago period benefited from the larger license mix from multiyear Enterprise Advanced transactions, and the current period margin is impacted by the mLab acquisition. Overall, we are pleased with our gross margin performance, which reflects greater efficiency and scale in our Atlas business. However, we continue to expect that we will see some modest reduction in overall gross margin as Atlas continues to become a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $14.3 million or negative 13% operating margin for the third quarter compared to a negative 11% margin in the year ago period. Given the size and early stage of our market opportunity and our demonstrated product market fit, our primary focus will to be -- continue to be on investing in the business. Net loss in the third quarter was $14.6 million or $0.26 per share, based on 56.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.13 per share on 52.7 million shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $426.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was negative $11.5 million. After taking into consideration approximately $1.6 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $13.1 million in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $9.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. As a reminder, the continuing growth of Atlas as a percentage of our overall business impacts our reported financial results in several ways. First, Atlas revenue is recorded on a consumption basis, whereas Enterprise Advanced includes a term license component that is recognized upfront. So for a comparable dollar-sized contract, both Enterprise Advanced and Atlas will recognize the same amount over the contract term, but the Atlas contract will generate less initial revenue, and as Atlas grows as a percentage of our revenue over time, this timing impact is greater.  Second, Atlas has a lower overall gross margin than Enterprise Advanced because of its infrastructure component. That said, on an apples-to-apples functionality basis, Atlas is accretive to dollars of gross profit.  Finally, self-service Atlas customers and a growing portion of our direct sales Atlas customers pay us monthly in arrears versus annually upfront for Enterprise Advanced. We would expect the percentage of customers paying monthly in arrears to grow over time as we increase our focus on driving adoption of Atlas. We believe that facilitating the ease of consumption will ultimately maximize long-term revenues and cash flow. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $109 million to $111 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $16.5 million to $15.5 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.27 based on 56.8 million weighted average shares outstanding. As a reminder, we anniversaried the acquisition of mLab on November 1. For the full fiscal year 2020, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $407 million to $409 million compared to our previous guidance of $390 million to $395 million. For the full fiscal year 2020, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $58 million to $57 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.02 per share based on 55.9 million weighted average shares outstanding.  To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent third quarter results. Our focus on executing on our product road map and expanding our go-to-market reach is driving high levels of growth at scale. The steps we have taken to establish MongoDB as the modern general data platform of choice positions us for continued success. And with that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? And then, Raimo, on your kind of billings-related question, yes, I think from the very beginning and outside of our life as a public company, we've highlighted how that's not a metric that we use internally or one that we focus on. I, obviously, understand that it's a popular one that investors and other folks look at. We tend to focus on the revenue, specifically, in the business. I think the other piece that's particularly challenging about billings, which we've talked about is, we're looking at sort of the revenue plus the change in deferred; historically, the change in deferred has really been the place where people have chosen to -- or people have a chance to outperform in recurring revenue subscription businesses, and I think Atlas sort of changes that. And so looking at deferreds in isolation, in particular, we've heavily discouraged people from billing.  We also are going to be, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, continuing to focus on driving ease of adoption and ease of use of adopting Atlas, and that will continue to most likely involve a higher percentage of Atlas-related customers paying monthly for invoicing in arrears rather than signing big, large commitments upfront and paying for those, which would generate incremental deferred revenue. So I think while it's not a metric that we've ever focused on, I think you're correct it's of decreasing value or insight relative to understanding the business. We have looked at other metrics to try to discern or determine if there are other metrics that are useful. Unfortunately, we haven't found anything that actually provides an incrementally helpful view of the world, but we'll continue to look. Yes. I think there are three things to keep in mind in terms of the difficult compare that we have in Q4. First is, this is the first quarter where we'll have the anniversary of mLab as the base period and recall that the mLab cohorts are declining. So that's sort of the first point to make sure that you keep in mind. Secondly, we did call out last year that we did have a handful of accounts who are overconsuming relative to their commitment levels, and we don't have any reason to believe that, that's seasonal or anything else related to that. So I think we should look at that as sort of not reproducible or replicatable. And then third, it was just a really great quarter, frankly, last year. And so while we're eager to have more good quarters, we don't want to count on all of them looking like that. Yes. I think the key thing to think about Enterprise Advanced is unfortunately it relies in the 606 accounting. It's very much driven by the components of the term license revenue, which is driven off of when the subscription start date is. And as we've talked about previously, it can also be influenced by the mix of multiyear contracts or not, which certainly affects the Q3 base period, as we previously indicated. So I think it's much more an indicator of sort of the variability that we'll see quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year that make those kinds of comparisons either sequentially or annually, very difficult to make just as a result of the 606 accounting. Yes. Yes. Then just on the guidance, I would say, the key thing is where we guide to really is on the income statement, so the revenue and the net loss position. And whether -- given that Atlas is all consumption-based as opposed to Enterprise Advanced, which has that term license component. Given that Atlas is all consumption based, whether it's signed for in an annual contract with an annual commitment that's paid upfront, that would generate that deferred revenue or whether or not it's monthly invoicing in arrears, the revenue recognition is consumption based. So it doesn't really impact or affect our guidance. Yes. So what we've talked about before is the number that we give is really done by channels, so that's the direct sales channel. It's not really done by product, is the way to think about it. So we see strong expansion in enterprise customers, whether it's Enterprise Advanced and then staying with Enterprise Advanced, whether it's Enterprise Advanced and adding Atlas workloads, or whether the relation starts up with Atlas and expands either to more Atlas or then Enterprise Advanced for certain workloads, sort of, regardless of sort of what the trajectory is because there's not one common monolithic pattern or a typical consistent pattern that people fall into.  What we have publicly said is, if you separately look at the self-service cohort and the self-service behavior of customers who are signing up for Atlas, the net ARR expansion of those cohorts is even greater than the net ARR expansion we see in the direct sales channel. And so I think that sort of speaks to the incredibly strong product market fit that we see in Atlas, both in the direct channel as well as self-serve, but hopefully, that gives a little bit of incremental color that we shared. Yes. I think when you look at the Q4 guidance, I'd say, overall, we feel really good about the guidance. And clearly, when we gave our Q3 guidance and full year guidance on the September call, there was some implied or embedded Q4 guidance implied in that number. And clearly, we've raised that when you do the math. So I think that shows that we're feeling quite good. I would reiterate what we've talked about in terms of the Q4, just remembering the mLab impact, both in terms of it being the first time that we've hit the anniversary of that as well as those cohorts decelerating. But in general, I think we feel really good about where we are. And I think you can see that not just in the sales sold side of things, which of sort of the two channels within Atlas is actually the fastest-growing channel but also you can see increasing spend for self-service customer, which at this point is most -- the vast majority of which is Atlas related, and we report that level of detail in the Qs, and so you can see that there."

            "name": "Dev Ittycheria",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today to review our third quarter results. MongoDB continued to deliver terrific financial and operational results that further strengthened our position as the most popular modern data platform in the world. Our performance is driven by the unique capabilities of our technology and our go-to-market strategy that enables customers of all sizes to consume MongoDB how they see fit. We are in the early stages of a once-in-a-generation shift in database technology and we remain confident in our ability to capture a meaningful share of the $64 billion global database software market. Looking quickly at our third quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $109.4 million, a 52% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 56% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew more than 185% year-over-year and now represents 40% of revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 15,900 customers. This was another outstanding quarter for Atlas, which is now $175 million revenue run rate business, just over 3 years from launch, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. Atlas is driving change across our entire business as we increasingly become a cloud-first company.  I would like to showcase 3 ways in which Atlas is making us a better company. As our business shifts towards the cloud, we are able to increase our pace of innovation with new products, features and capabilities. Cloud services give us better insight into how customers use our products, and cloud services enable us to expand the different ways we go to market, increasing our ability to pursue a larger variety of customers around the world. All 3 together create a flywheel effect for our business. First, since we deliver MongoDB as a cloud service through Atlas, we can deploy new features continuously rather than on an annual release cadence of an on-premise product. Furthermore, since new products are initially built for the cloud, our product teams can work quickly and independently to introduce new products and features, increasing the pace of innovation and providing more value to our customers more quickly. A great example of our continuous innovation is the recent introduction of auto scaling on Atlas, which we announced in September. This feature brings automated capacity management to Atlas.  When enabled, Atlas will now attract key resource utilization metrics in real time and autonomously adjust instant sizes, up or down, as needed by using predictive modeling and proven management practices developed from matching tens of thousands of MongoDB deployments. With this feature, Atlas now efficiently and elastically scales the customers' deployment to match their business needs without the need for manual intensive monitoring, analysis and intervention. Early customer feedback provides a great validation for this feature, and in the future, it will influence how we introduce this capability for private clouds. Second, with Atlas, we also get granular visibility to future adoption and user behavior. This continuous and data-driven feedback loop allows us to understand what features customers find most valuable, where in the product they may get stuck or where they're not taking advantage of all the capabilities available. This enables us to iterate more often and more intelligently, ensuring that our product teams are focused on the most important opportunities. As a result, we can identify in real time ways we can help customers optimize their MongoDB deployments with more timely and relevant assistance. For example, we realized that a premier global financial institution was running an internal HR application without mission-critical scalability and security features, which negatively impacted the application performance and created significant risk.  By proactively identifying these issues and sharing best practices, we developed a deep and trusted relationship with this large customer. As another example, through database usage metrics, such as increased IO throughput or turning on backup, we can infer when an application is likely to go into production. These types of insights allow us to scalably engage with our customers at key moments when they are likely to increase the complexity and criticality of their MongoDB deployment. Moreover, when -- we learn a great deal from how beta customers interact with our new cloud products, including Atlas Data Lake and, Full-Text Search. And we expect the same benefits when we introduce future products, such as the public beta of the revamped Realm product. Our confidence in the successful GA rollout of these new products will only increase after learnings from beta customers. We regularly incorporate these learnings into our enterprise advanced release, improving the value of our on-premises product as well. Consequently, we're looking to further invest in technology and data science to harness these types of signals to build even stronger relationships and find more opportunities to win more business. Ultimately, this positive feedback cycle gives us greater confidence in the returns on the R&D investments and the durability of our customer relationships. Finally, Atlas is broadening our reach into the global database market. MongoDB is not only one of the most popular databases but Atlas also enables customers anywhere in the world to easily use MongoDB through our free tier and self-service offerings, whether they're start-ups or development teams in large organizations. Since Atlas is available and one of the three largest cloud providers outside of Mainland China, AWS, Azure and GCP, it is the most widely available managed cloud database service in the world. By having relationships with all 3 cloud providers, we benefit from access to their customers and geographic reach, and we are seeing positive results with all three. The third quarter was the first full quarter of our expanded partnership with GCP, and we are encouraged by the number of deals closed and the level of pipeline activity. As the latest example of our successful partners strategy, we announced a new partnership with Alibaba Cloud. Together, we are providing the first authorized MongoDB as a service in Mainland China. Partnering with the largest tech company in China extends our reach into one of the largest markets in software and validates the value of our IT and the strength of the SSPL licensing model. Thanks to these types of partnerships, we continue to propel MongoDB as a leading data platform around the world. I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the third quarter. We continue to see an increasing wide array of customers choosing MongoDB to run mission-critical applications. Axiata, one of the leading telecom groups in Asia, selected MongoDB Atlas and Enterprise Advanced to power Axiata's digital key fintech application. MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility and how cost-effective it was compared to the company's legacy Oracle database. MongoDB provides the high performance, availability and scalability that the application needs to bring cashless convenience to the fingertips of both consumers and merchants throughout Malaysia.  The Washington Post has chosen MongoDB to provide mission-critical support for its primary digital content management platform, Arc Publishing. MongoDB Enterprise Advanced serves as the backbone for its more than 750 million unique visitors a month and helps content teams power their businesses through innovation, better customer experiences and storytelling on an integrated suite of tools. MongoDB gives them the flexibility to run both on-premises and in the cloud. Foursquare, a location technology platform dedicated to powering business solutions and consumer products through a deep understanding of locations, chose MongoDB Atlas to power all of its B2B enterprise location services. These services, which include tools for developers, location analytics, advertising, targeting, measurement and more, have been chosen by more than 50% of the Fortune 100. As Foursquare completes the digital transformation, MongoDB will continue to scale with them in the cloud. Keller Williams Realty, one of the world's largest real estate franchises, selected MongoDB Atlas as the core database to power its new game-changing real estate mobile app. The app gives Keller Williams' real estate brokers a competitive advantage by using AI to reveal the most relevant information to potential buyers at the right time. Netskope is a next-generation cloud security platform that helps customers manage evolving security needs driven by digital transformation. They chose MongoDB to provide security and scale they needed to expand internationally. MongoDB gives Netskope the critical data ingestion and visualization capabilities to provide unrivaled visibility, real-time data and threat protection when accessing cloud services, websites and private applications. To summarize, MongoDB's third quarter performance was strong across the board. We are executing well on our strategic priorities and believe we are well positioned to continue gaining share in the global database market. Before I transition to Michael, I want to add that we are thrilled to welcome Frank D'Souza, the co-founder and former CEO of Cognizant to our Board. Frank scaled Cognizant from inception to a $16 billion global professional services company. His experience and insight, in particular, massively scaling a technology company will be invaluable to us given our long-term aspirations. With that, let me now turn the call over to Michael. Thanks, Raimo. So with regards to DocumentDB, I think it was January of this year that Amazon officially launched DocumentDB. And I know there was some trepidation with investors about the potential impact on our business. And as you can -- as you've seen now for the last 4 quarters, our business has performed really, really well. I think there's been a number of reasons for that. One, this market is truly massive. It's one of the largest markets in enterprise software and I think there's room for a lot of people. Two, unlike lot of other open source technologies, we have a strong moat around our business, especially our own IP. So it's very difficult. Actually, it's illegal for a cloud provider to take our native code and wrap it into their platform and offer it as a service.  So what Amazon did was basically try to emulate MongoDB through a different architecture, which has severe performance and feature trade-offs. Last count DocumentDB failed about 65% of the correctives, the test, compatibility test against MongoDB. So for those customers who have primitive requirements, DocumentDB could work. But for most customers, who have mission-critical requirements and want the breadth of use cases that MongoDB supports, MongoDB is by far the best choice, and I think you see that reflected in our numbers. And you're right, we didn't see any real news about DocumentDB. We just heard a lot of other announcements, and so we feel quite good about our position in the marketplace. Yes. Thanks, Sanjit. I would just say that I think we saw broad performance and good performance across the board. I think we're feeling really good about sales sold Atlas. Our sales teams, as you know, have really found a lot of success with Atlas with both midsized and large enterprises and that business -- and that channel is doing very well with Atlas. And we're also seeing increasing success in our self-serve business. We continue to increase the velocity of experimentation, to test and test in terms of like search and paid search and organic search. We're looking -- we're expanding our business more and more overseas, and we're seeing a lot of similarities in terms of needs.  We're seeing registration from corporate accounts increase, well, nicely for us, so that these are sometimes development teams in large organizations who are -- or testing Atlas maybe as a precursor to doing a big deployment. And we're also getting better at using our data and analytics to get more insight into our business. So our self-serve business is also very iterative, but we feel really good about that channel and the sales sold channels. I wouldn't say there's only one channel that outperformed the other. Yes. So we have seen, just through downloads, that China be -- is a very, very big and popular market for MongoDB. And I've been to China multiple times. We have a number of large enterprise customers there. When we run our user conferences, they tend to be packed. So we know that there's lot of interest and appetite for using MongoDB for a wide variety of applications, use cases. The challenge we've had in China is that due to the regulations there, we could not offer Atlas directly in China because there's rules about owning data centers directly, and obviously, we did not until recently have any relationships with any local entities.  And candidly, we've been in discussions with Alibaba for some time and -- but there was clearly interest on both sides to do something. One, Alibaba recognized the value of working with us, recognized the value of getting -- working with a team that's building the code and also getting another level of support. And we wanted to, frankly, work with the largest tech company in China because they obviously have massive reach in that market. And so I would say, we're very excited about the opportunity. It's still very early days. We just had some people in China 2 weeks ago doing some events there, and the interest level and activity level is very, very high. Yes. Thanks for the question. So just to remind everyone, so we announced Atlas Data Lake and Full-Text Search at MongoDB World this past summer. It's still in beta. So we're engaging with hundreds of customers who are right now using the product. We expect it to go GA next year at our World Conference around the May timeframe. And the feedback has been really, really positive. We're really excited about the feedback because it helps us sharpen the product, understand how customers are using the product, understand potentially details around user experience as well as the full feature and functionality and the use cases that people may be using, and we're very excited. And just to remind everyone, Atlas Data Lake really enables customers to use the same semantics with MongoDB to basically query off-line data as they do with online data.  So it's a very easy product to use, adds immediate value. It's a pay-as-you-go model. So the upfront investment or there's very low entry-level of cost, and the ROI is very compelling, and we're really excited about that product. Full-Text Search is basically a request that customers have asked, making of us for some time, because rather than using disparate systems, they'd rather use one platform. And so we're excited about that opportunity as well, and the feedback there has also been incredibly positive. And so it's hard for me to tell you what the uplift will be, but we're feeling very bullish about both products. Yes. So Brad, thanks for the question. I would say that the scenario you outlined is still one that's, I would say, more of a exception than the rule that tends to happen less frequently. And that's really more driven by the fact that customers have decided that rather than managing their own infrastructure, they'd rather consume MongoDB as a service. And we still believe in the value of offering an on-prem product because there are many customers who either have a lot of sunk cost and want to preserve those investments or they are in certain regulated industries that prevent them from using cloud services or, frankly, are just taking a more conservative approach to the cloud and are on a slower path to moving to the cloud.  And what MongoDB does is just enable them to use MongoDB in whatever -- wherever they are in that journey from on-prem to the cloud. And so while there are definitely some customers who may be migrating their Enterprise Advanced implementation on-premise to the cloud that's driven typically by their own needs, the desire to maybe move to the cloud themselves, desire to reduce the amount of investments in their own infrastructure and maybe the ability to iterate and innovate more quickly, but it's not driven by us. Yes, great question. I would say that we tend to be very customer-centric or customer-obsessed organization. So we tend to listen to our customers very, very carefully. And it's no secret that many customers do desire to move to the cloud. The pay-as-you-go model, the low-entry costs, the ability to elastically scale are all compelling reasons to move to the cloud. And so -- and what's also interesting is smaller customers and early-stage customers tend to prefer to go to the cloud as fast as possible because that allows them to avoid and having to invest in their own infrastructure and really allows them to focus their limited resources on the work that really differentiates their business. And so what Atlas has done is really open the aperture of the customers we can go after, and frankly, monetize.  And so as you may remember, with Atlas, we can monetize every interaction with every customer, depending if they're an early stage start-up in a garage or a large-scale enterprise in the Fortune 500. And so -- and what Atlas does is basically enable them to start in whatever scale they want to start and then grow from there. And what we find is customers may just have one app and then that app grows. But more typically, we find as soon as they launch one app, they very quickly start launching other apps because they find the value of Atlas so compelling. And so our growth and expansion of Atlas is very, very strong. Sure. Thanks, Tyler. So just to be clear, we launched Atlas about a little over 3 years ago, and so -- the summer of 2016. And so the first year was really driven predominantly by self-service, where we had a lot of demand, organic demand, from developers around the world who really wanted to leverage MongoDB as a service. It took us about a good year to really enable our sales force to know how to sell a cloud service because historically that all they had been doing was selling enterprise product. And then the sales force kicks in, in the second year, and that's when we really started seeing penetration in large and small-to-medium accounts.  I would actually say that our traction was first in small-to-medium market, where those cohort customers really saw the value of Atlas because they had very little interest in investing in their own operational infrastructure. And slowly, we started to pick away use cases and workloads with the very large enterprise customers. And now we're kind of seeing a healthy mix across all 3 channels. And so that's essentially how that business has evolved. Yes. So as I had mentioned in the past, we have tended to go a lot higher organization than historically we've ever done as a company. But we also spend a lot of time focused on the developer community, driving awareness and making sure that they're fully updated on all our products and services. I would say, over the last, I would say, 18 months or so, one of the big themes with the senior level stakeholders and key accounts is the increasing awareness of multi-cloud. Customers are obviously very sensitive about being locked into any one platform. They also value the ability to arbitrage between one cloud provider and other cloud provider, and they also want the opportunity to maybe have certain access to different capabilities and strengths of each of the different cloud providers, and so that's been a big theme. I would say the other big theme is obviously being able to drive developer productivity. Every organization is under tremendous pressure to innovate quickly, either disrupt or be disrupted. And so using MongoDB to drive developer throughput and developer velocity has also become very, very important. The rise of mobile, the rise of new use cases, like IOT, machine learning, deep learning, et cetera, are also top of mind of these customers. And then obviously analytics. That's an area that they're always very interested in because they want to gain deeper insights in their business, so something like Atlas Data Lake becomes very, very interesting to them because they can leverage the existing investments they've made in their people and get the value of a deep analytics platform to basically run analytics on both your online and off-line data. So I would say, obviously, every customer has own unique requirements and priorities, but those are some of the themes that we hear from senior stakeholders in these organizations. That's going in full force. We see legacy monetization as one of the key drivers to our business, the move to the cloud as another. That could be tied to some legacy modernization initiative, but it could be also just a desire to get more and more of their infrastructure off-premise and into the cloud. So those are huge, huge initiatives for us. And a lot of times, we're helping customers think through which applications to modernize first and where we can be most helpful, and so those are some of the conversations we're having. Yes. Well, thanks for your question. I mean one, China is obviously a massive market. It's got a huge number of developers. There's a big focus in China to using software to drive a lot of innovation. We are an open source company, so our source code is available to all. And as we said, when we introduced our new SSPL licensing. In certain parts of the world, it's very hard to adjudicate those issues. But Alibaba felt it was important for them to have a direct relationship with us to get access to the latest features, to get access to engineers and our support infrastructure because they see such a big opportunity for MongoDB in that market.  And so I want to be clear, it is -- the Alibaba relation is not Atlas. It's a separate OEM relationship. It's based on some minimums that we expect every year, and then we will have true-ups on an annual basis, and it will not be counted as Atlas revenue. And so -- but it is a way to access the Chinese market in a way that we've never been able to do before by having the largest tech company in China partner with you. And we think that's a very compelling reason to go into partnership with Alibaba. I would say that -- yes, this is a product-like growth is clearly a new trend in terms of how people drive top line growth. I would say, a company that has done that well was Atlassian. And so -- and clearly, that's something that we're doing here, especially on the self-serve side of the business, where we're looking for data signals in terms of how people are using the product. And as I shared in my prepared remarks, there are certain signals that tell us if you're doing something really, really important. And we want to be there -- we want to know that in advance and know that as soon as that happens, because we want to be there with the customer so that we can help them through those important moments of their application, whether it's going to production or they're expanding their capacity or expanding geographically, et cetera, or -- and so those are the kind of signals that we use to help drive our business.  And so those signals tell us if a customer is expanding. Another example would be, if for some reason, we suddenly see a spike in utilization, we don't automatically assume that's a good thing. That could be that they have misconfigured their MongoDB implementation and we could actually have a very grumpy customer. And identifying that customer quickly, making sure that they know what they're doing. And in many cases, they're very grateful that we quickly identify those issues, help them solve any misconfigurations because that builds only a deeper and more trusted relation with our customer. So those are examples of how we're using product signals to drive growth. And as you can imagine, [Technical Difficulty] data science because we have lots of customers around the world so you can do this manually. And obviously, we add a lot of human resources, especially for larger customers and even some midsize customers. No question. As Atlas becomes more popular, as we add new features and capabilities, as we add more coverage around the world, as customers themselves get more comfortable, the word-of-mouth and virality of the usage, we're clearly seeing deal sizes go up in Atlas. It's progressing well. Obviously, this is something that we focus a lot on, because a big vector for our growth is the amount of feet on the street that we have. And so we spend a lot of time recruiting the right people, and then spending a lot of time investing in them and developing those people to ultimately get them to produce results and produce results consistently over time. And so that's a big part of the attention of the management's bandwidth, is just about how we scale infrastructure. As you can imagine, not just hiring salespeople, but sales leadership, technical presales to complement our salespeople in the field, partner resources in different parts of the world, so that's all part and parcel of our formula in terms of how we scale the business. Thank you. Thanks, everyone -- to everyone for joining us today. Again, just to reiterate, we feel really good about our business. We think we had a terrific quarter, and we look forward to speaking to some of you in the next couple of days. I know that Michael and Serge will be at a couple of investor conferences. So I suspect some of you will be there as well. Talk to you soon. Take care. Bye-bye."

MongoDB continued to perform at a very high level, driven by broad-based strength in all geographies and industries. Our results continue to demonstrate that MongoDB has clearly established itself as the most popular modern database platform of choice in the world. Our success is being driven by our strong product market fit and the sophistication of our go-to-market strategy. We're confident that we'll be able to continue to capitalize on our long-term opportunity in the 64 billion global database software market. Looking quickly at our second quarter financial results. We generated revenue of $99.4 million, up 67% year-over-year increase and above the high-end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 71% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew more than 240% year-over-year and now represents 30% of revenue, and we had another strong quarter of customer growth ending the quarter with over 15,000 customers. Our strong results begin with our best-in-class product offering. We made several significant product announcements that represent notable progress on our long-term product vision to make data stunningly easy to work with. In June, we held our annual user conference MongoDB World in New York and attendance set another record. During the conference, we unveiled a number of exciting products and features, including the MongoDB version 4.2 with key features such as distributed asset transactions and client-side field level encryption. We believe this latest release further cements our positioning as the modern general purpose database of choice and underscores our capability to support the most mission critical applications. MongoDB Atlas Data Lake allows customers to quickly Query data on S3 in any format using the MongoDB Query Language. We believe that other solutions in the analytics markets have been plagued by high upfront investments, complex implementations and a need for specialized skills. By contrast with Atlas Data Lake, our customers can leverage their existing MongoDB expertise and incur no upfront costs to quickly derive value from their data. MongoDB Full-Text Search gives end users the flexibility to filter, rank and sort their data to quickly service the most relevant search results. Importantly, they can implement this functionality without incurring the effort and cost of pairing their database with an external search engine. Developers can leverage the functionality to build sophisticated search queries within applications, saving them significant amount of time, effort and money. Finally, we announced our plan to integrate our newly acquired mobile database Realm with our serverless platform Stitch. Realm's Synchronization Protocol will connect with MongoDB's Atlas Global Cloud Database on the back-end, making Realm Sync a powerful way for developers to connect data to the devices running their applications. As part of MongoDB, Realm is positioned to become the default database for mobile developers and the easiest way to build real-time mobile applications. These product announcements are formed by a long-term vision and ground by feedback from our customers on the strategic value they can achieve by leveraging MongoDB for a broader set of use cases across their organization. Our second quarter results also demonstrate our investments in expanding and extending our go-to-market capabilities that are paying off. Given the size of the market in front of us, we have built an increasingly sophisticated three-pronged go-to-market strategy that allows us to pursue the entire database market. The first component is our field sales organization, which drove strong broad-based performance in all our major regions in the second quarter. Our success with field sales is driven by our ability to recruit and develop outstanding sales personnel and strategically engage our customers from developers up to CXOs.  Second, our inside sales channel focuses on the mid-market, where deals are smaller with shorter sales cycles. These customers, who prefer a low touch sales model with a high degree of automation, have less interest in managing their own infrastructure and therefore see compelling value in Atlas. The third component of our go-to-market strategy is our self-serve channel which has grown significantly as a percentage of revenue over the past year. Starting last year, we significantly increased our investment in this channel to build a world class developer focused product led growth marketing organization. This is a multiyear journey, but we are encouraged by the progress we are making. We also see increasingly a synergy across these go-to-market motions. For example, we have observed developers and large enterprises frequently start evaluating and using Atlas via our self-serve channel, which can lead to large opportunities for our direct sales force. We've also seen fast-growing self service customers who can grow even faster when they interact with our customer-facing teams. Moreover, we have observed highly sophisticated mid-market customers, some of whom have built their entire business on MongoDB, who need a level of engagement typical of large enterprises. One of the key competitive differentiators is the freedom to run anywhere, and our cloud partnerships enable customers that choose MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the benefits of each major cloud provider as they see it fit. We're off to a strong start with our partnership with GCP. We expanded our relation with Microsoft by launching the availability of Atlas on Microsoft Azure Marketplace, which will simplify billing for joint customers. Furthermore, we have joined Microsoft Strategic Partner reported ACR co-sell program, and this was yet another record quarter for Atlas on AWS. I like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer vignettes. We are increasingly seeing a wide array of customers choosing MongoDB to run mission critical applications. The following is a small selection of customer wins and interesting use cases from the second quarter. MongoDB is a valued partner to Venmo. Venmo has experienced tremendous growth over the past few years and has decided to partner with MongoDB because of our ability to provide the scale they needed for their growing platform. Venmo is leveraging MongoDB's Enterprise Advanced offering to streamline operations and to drive automation. Halliburton Energy Services, a leading oilfield services company, is adopting MongoDB to modernize its high performance rig technology. The Halliburton Edge platform connects digital operations of the field, orchestrating multiple inbound and outbound data streams and applications to optimize execution. The ease of use and flexible scheme of MongoDB enabled the developers to quickly iterate and drive innovation and modernization at the rig site. An important example of MongoDB's international reach. Technology leader Hitachi signed an agreement to embed MongoDB in their new products. After evaluating several other database platforms, they chose MongoDB for a consistent reputation for reliability, scalability and performance. Dreamus, a subsidiary of SK Telecom, the number one telco in Korea recently replaced MySQL with MongoDB for their new mobile music service flow. Dreamus made the decision to switch to MongoDB, because of the limitations of its relational database to scale and MongoDB's flexible scheme of data model as well as their future plans for a managed cloud service. Conrad Electric, a European retailer of electronic products based in Germany and one of Europe's top 10 online shops, was self managing MongoDB community in the cloud, but recently decided to move their MongoDB environment to Atlas. They're not only saving on overall infrastructure cost, but can also focus their developers time on high value tasks instead of database management. The breadth and depth of MongoDB's deployments around the world demonstrates our success as the modern data platform of choice. To summarize MongoDB continues to perform at a very high level. We believe the increasing sophistication of go-to-market strategy and expanded product portfolio position us well to continue delivering high revenue growth rates for the foreseeable future. We're focused on executing against our strategic priorities and ensuring we capitalize on our market opportunity. With that, let me now turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we're very pleased with our second quarter performance. I'll begin with a detailed review of our second quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2020. First, I'll turn to our second quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $99.4 million, up 67% year-over-year, subscription revenue was $94.2 million, up 71% year-over-year and professional services revenue was $5.2 million, up 15% year-over-year. While we performed well above our expectations in the quarter, we would like to note that our results also benefited from a few meaningful Enterprise Advanced transactions that we had expected to close in the third quarter. Under ASC 606, we were required to recognize the upfront term license revenue from these contracts in Q2, when we have expected to realize them originally in Q3. Our second quarter performance reflected positive contributions from every region and strong adoption of both Enterprise Advanced and Atlas. The combination of healthy new logo additions and continued strength in up-sell activities provides us with multiple vectors to sustain high levels of growth. We continue to see rapid adoption of Atlas, which grew over 240% in the quarter and now represents 37% of total revenue compared to 18% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and 35% last quarter. Atlas has now reached a nearly $150 million annualized revenue run rate only three years since its launch, which reflects the popularity of MongoDB and the growing interest that customers of all sizes have in a fully managed Cloud Database offering. As a reminder, our second quarter results include the impact of mLab, which we acquired in November of 2018. At the time of the mLab acquisition, we said that we expected the mLab business to decline as we transition their customer base to the Atlas platform. Revenue from mLab customers performed in line with our expectations for a modest sequential decline, which we expect will continue in the second half of fiscal 2020, as planned. Excluding mLab, we were very pleased with the organic growth of the business overall, which drove the outperformance relative to the guidance. During the second quarter, we grew our customer base by over 800 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 15,000, which is up from over 7,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count over 1,850 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,600 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 13,200 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 5,300 in the year ago period. The sequential growth in total customers includes growth in our Enterprise Advanced customers as well as new Atlas customers. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We also continue to see healthy expansion from existing customers, which is a key component of our growth strategy. Our net ARR expansion rate in the first quarter remained above 120% for the 18 consecutive quarter. We ended the quarter with 622 customers, with at least 100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 438 in the year-ago period. Moving down the P&L, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the second quarter was $71.1 million, representing a gross margin of 72%, compared to 74% in the year-ago period. We are pleased with the efficiencies we're generating in our organic Atlas business as it scales. In addition, we're starting to see improvements in mLab, as mLab benefits from Atlas's scale and as we're starting to transition mLab customers onto the Atlas platform. However, we continue to expect that we will see some modest reduction in overall company gross margin, as Atlas continues to be a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $14.8 million or a negative 15% operating margin for the second quarter compared to a negative 30% margin in the year-ago period. The more than 1,500 basis points improvement in operating margin is particularly impressive, given our growth profile and the investments we are making in our business. Given our strong first half revenue and profitability performance and the numerous growth opportunities we are targeting, our intention is to make incremental investments in sales and marketing and R&D in the second half of fiscal 2020. Net loss in the second quarter was $14.7 million or $0.26 per share based on 55.6 million weighted-average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.34 per share on 51.2 million shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $436.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was negative $12.6 million. After taking into consideration approximately $1.2 million in capital expenditures, free cash flow is negative $13.8 million for the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $18 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We are pleased with our cash flow performance year-to-date, but expect to burn cash in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as we continue to make significant investments in the business. Also given this year's stronger than expected Q2 cash flow performance, Q2 may not be our peak quarter for negative cash flow, as is typically the case. As a reminder, the continuing growth of Atlas as a percent of our overall business impacts our reported financials in several ways. First, Atlas revenues recorded on a consumption basis, whereas Enterprise Advanced includes a term license component that has recognized upfront. Second, Atlas has a lower overall gross margin Enterprise Advanced because of its infrastructure component. That said, on an apples-to-apples functionality basis, Atlas is accretive to dollars of gross profit. Finally, self-service at Atlas customers and a growing portion of our direct sales Atlas customers pay us monthly in arrears versus annually upfront for Enterprise Advanced. In other words, a growing percentage of Atlas which is an increasing portion of our overall business, does not involve an upfront cash payment nor does it impact our deferred revenue balances. We believe that offering customers the ability to pay as they go is a key benefit of the cloud model. More broadly, we believe that continuing to find ways to facilitate the ease of consumption will ultimately maximize long-term revenues and cash flow. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2020. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $98 million to $100 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be negative $16.5 million to negative $15.5 million and a non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of negative $0.29 to negative $0.27 per share based on 56.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. As we have mentioned on previous calls, our third quarter outlook reflects a notably large compare from the third quarter of fiscal 2019, when we signed a higher than usual number of multiyear Enterprise Advanced contracts. As a reminder, under ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license portion of a multiyear contract at the outset, resulting in no recognition of additional term license revenue at the beginning of each new subscription year of the contract. Also, as discussed earlier, our results in the second quarter also benefited from a few meaningful Enterprise Advanced transactions that moved from Q3 to Q2. For the full fiscal year 2020, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $390 million to $395 million compared to our previous guidance of $375 million to $381 million. Please recall the fourth quarter will be the first quarter, where we'll have mLab in the base period. And as we've described before, we expect continued deterioration in the revenue from former mLab customers, both sequentially as well as year-over-year. This is all in line with our original investment thesis. For the full fiscal year 2020, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be negative $62 million to negative $59 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of negative $1.11 to negative $1.06 per share based on 55.9 million weighted average shares outstanding. As mentioned previously, we see our strong start to fiscal 2020 as another indication of the size the opportunity ahead of us and we will invest incrementally across our business in the second half to further pursue that opportunity. To summarize MongoDB delivered excellent second quarter results. We're executing well on our product and go-to-market strategies, which is generating impressive growth at scale. We believe our clear leadership is the modern general purpose data platform of choice will enable us to continue delivering strong growth going forward. And with that, we'd like to open up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And first from Barclays, we have Raimo Lenschow.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey congrats from me. Two questions, if I may. First, Dev can you talk, it doesn't happen often in software that kind of deals get kind of pulled in or large deals are getting pulled in early. Can you just talk a little bit about momentum in the quarter and linearity, I mean, given that everyone is nervous, this sounds like the opposite of it. Just talk to that, please.\nDev Ittycheria: I would say that this quarter was much like most other quarters. There wasn't any changes in linearity. We typically put a lot of rigor in our forecasting process. And so we have a pretty good sense of how the quarter is looking. And obviously the close to the quarter we get to the more \u2013 even more visibility we have, and I would say, our sales organization is quite effective at closing deals and giving customers reasons for why they should engage with us now versus later. And we feel really good about that execution.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Well done. And then on Atlas, can you talk a little bit about what you see on the different platforms like now that you're kind of on the \u2013 what does it mean that you're now on the Microsoft Marketplace? You talked about early, good momentum around Google. Like, just help us understand what's the difference between like being there versus being on the marketplace, et cetera?\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. And just for everyone's benefit. We started in 2016 on AWS first and then a year later we added GCP and Azure. I would say that \u2013 obviously, I would say Atlas, the deployments of Atlas in some ways mirrors the broader market share of the larger cloud providers. That being said, I would say that we've been really pleased with the traction we're getting with Google and that's really starting to accelerate even though the partnership we announced in May has not had a lot of time to gestate. But activity level is very strong and we've closed a number of deals with Google and the announcement we made with Microsoft basically incentivizes their salespeople to basically get paid on Atlas deals. Moreover, customers can get a unified bill when they buy Atlas via the marketplace and they can apply their Azure commitments towards Atlas, which means that they don't have to go find other dollars to fund the workload on Atlas. So all know, it's a win-win for the customer, win-win for Microsoft salespeople and absolute win-win for us.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Congrats. Thank you.\nOperator: And moving on, we will take Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats Dev and Michael on an excellent first half. I wanted to pick up from MongoDB World debut. You elicited a very ambitious vision around MongoDB data platform. Could you speak to what needs to happen in terms of evangelizing that type of story in terms of like the sales motion specifically, typically in the database market we've seen customers go for point functionality for specific capabilities. What would be \u2013 what needs to happen to sort of funnel that demand to more of a consolidated play when we think about some of the things that you're going after around data visualization search and those types of \u2013 and more analytical workloads on the MongoDB platform. What needs to happen to trigger those buying pattern?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So I would say that while there have been a lot of point solutions build for particular use cases, we increasingly hear from customers that they just can't use a net new technology for every net new workload, it doesn't scale, it's hard to get everyone to learn all these new technologies, support and maintain all of them, and it just adds a lot more costs. So the degree to which that they can consolidate their infrastructure under not necessarily only one platform, but a small number of platforms that becomes more compelling to the customer. So I would say, for example, our Full-Text Search capability basically obviates the need for a customer to buy a disparate search engine to complement their functionality on the database to basically provide search functionality on their application. Conversely, for the Data Lake capabilities, rather than having to learn a new technology, make some big upfront investment, hire a very specialized group of people, you can leverage the experience and expertise of people that have on MongoDB and basically use the Data Lake functionality to Query data on S3, which is where most people are storing their data today. So it really allows people to \u2013 it gives reason for people to use MongoDB for a broader and broader set of use cases. And remember, the database is the heart of every application. So unlike search, where there's some vendors in the search space who have contemplated becoming a database, they quickly realize that that was not something that was very easy to do. They're now trending more towards the op space and going after the systems managing market, where I think with the database being the center of gravity, it's much more natural for us to expand from the database to broaden our set of use cases. And that's why we think as MongoDB becomes an obvious choice for modern applications, our ability to expand our use cases will get better over time. And you see these investments in the products that we're making.\nSanjit Singh: Great. That's very helpful. And Mike, maybe one just quick follow-up for you in terms of the pull forward impact of Enterprise Advanced. Is there any way you can quantify what the impact that was in terms of revenue or billings in the quarter?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. Not specifically in terms of a number, but I think the key point here is, this ties to what we've talked about \u2013 ever since we adopted 606, it sort of increased variability and reduced comparability quarter-to-quarter. And so I think what we wanted to do is just have people understand that we had a couple that sort of fell on the earlier side of the ledger relative to where we were forecasting, and that helps put sort of Q3 in context.\nSanjit Singh: Fair enough. Thank you for taking the question.\nOperator: And moving on, we have Brad Reback with Stifel.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thank you very much. Dev, as you think about the three-pronged go-to-market strategy you've laid out. How much bigger do you think self-service can get than where it is today?\nDev Ittycheria: We think we're just in the early innings of our self-serve journey. If you remember, we really started this business with the launch of Atlas and then we accumulated more expertise to the mLab acquisition, because they built their business entirely through self-serve. We finally feel that we have \u2013 in making investments to really understand the levers that what drives self-serve. We have \u2013 now with lots of customers, over 13,000 customers at Atlas. We have a lot more understanding and sophistication on product signals in terms of what customers may be right for up-sell or cross-sell. But we still feel that we're on the early innings of our journey there.\nBrad Reback: Great, and then just one quick follow-up also on the go-to-market side. Last quarter, you talked about very aggressive recruiting efforts on the sell side. Can you tell us how the hiring process is going? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: We've been very pleased. We've been hiring like mad. We have a high bar and we will continue to be hiring because as I think I've mentioned on many calls, given the size of the market, we are constrained by the reach that we have. And in many markets, we have very limited coverage. And so but just hiring salespeople is not enough, you have to hire and make sure you have the sales management leadership in place and you need to make sure you have your recruiting infrastructure in place and that once you hire them, you can ramp them and get them productive as fast as possible. That's a big priority for us. We are very happy with the number of people we recruited in the last quarter, but there's a big push to do a lot of recruiting in Q3 and Q4.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Moving on, we have Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.\nDaniel Church: Hi, this is Dan Church on for Heather Bellini. Thanks for taking my question. Last quarter, I think you mentioned roughly about two-thirds of Atlas revenue is not reflected in deferred revenue. I was just wondering how stable is that number been over time? And do you expect that mix to change as you see increasing enterprise adoption of Atlas?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So I think the key thing there is we're trying to give a point in time estimate for folks as opposed to quarterly metric that we'd read out on. But I think in general, the direction will be more of as we \u2013 as I kind of shared in the prepared remarks. More and more of Atlas will be on a monthly in arrears basis both because of the self-serve growth as well as trying to make sure that we are reducing any possible barriers to consumption and making consumption as easy as possible, including monthly invoicing for arrears for some enterprise customers for whom that's important. So I think in general, you'll continue to see that be a relevant consideration and therefore some of the deferreds in other ways that you tend to look at some companies being increasingly less relevant, as it relates to analyzing us.\nDaniel Church: Thanks, helpful. Thank you. And as a quick follow-up, just I believe last quarter you talked about some investments you are making and expanding the channel ecosystem specifically with system integrators. So any update or progress on traction there and then strategic investments or priorities for investment as we get into the back half of the year?\nMichael Gordon: No things are remain the course. We're doing a lot of business with the SIs. I think we have relations with a number of them. In fact, I just did a video testimonial with Infosys that was published on LinkedIn. And we have relations with Accenture, with Cap Gemini, a bunch of boutique players and other large systems integrators. And obviously each system integrator has certain expertise either in a particular geography or an industry or they have specific account control and so we work well with them. And the synergy there is that, in many cases, as we all know lot of customers are constrained on development capacity and so where the systems really can add value as being the development arm, leveraging MongoDB and a more modern stack to help customers drive innovation faster in the organization. And so we're spending a lot of time enabling these integrators both at the corporate level and at the field level and building more and more proof points. And in some cases, you also see integrators themselves build their own specific products, embedding MongoDB in their technology. And so it's a multipronged effort.\nDaniel Church: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Next from Citi, we have Tyler Radke.\nTyler Radke: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Could you talk about the \u2013 what you're seeing in terms of enterprise adoption of Atlas? It sounds like you're not necessarily seeing enterprises come in and to pay for a full-year upfront necessarily, but maybe to some comment on the use cases or traction that you're seeing in terms of enterprise in Atlas? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: I would say that we're seeing actually strong demand for Atlas in the enterprise. And in some cases, they'll actually commit upfront for a certain amount of spend in a particular year over a multiyear period and that's driven by either new workloads that they're building and they want to just run in the cloud because of a particular use case reasons or they're migrating, say, a community workload on-premise to the cloud because the cost benefit of Atlas is that much more compelling. And so we're seeing a lot of interest from very, very large organizations. I think previously we talked about banks, insurance companies, tech companies and so on so forth, all very, very interested in Atlas. And we're really, really excited about the interest level. And one of the other things that really surfaces in our discussions with these large enterprises is our ability to run Atlas on multiple clouds. So either they want to leverage specific expertise or services or capabilities with a particular cloud provider or they want to make sure that they have a diversity of workloads across different cloud providers. And so running that on Atlas preserves their optionality because they can do that very easily without having to rewrite the application.\nTyler Radke: Thank you. And maybe a follow-up for Michael. I appreciate all the color around the moving parts of Q3 guidance, including the multiyear deal that closed here in Q2 instead of Q3. Maybe as we just think about the rest of the year, it does obviously look like you're guiding Q3 to have revenue decelerate quite a bit from Q2, which makes sense given the tough comp, but as we think about Q4, is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of a tough compare for multiyear deals or just anything to call out, because the guidance does look like the decel is kind of continuing into Q4? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, sure, yes. So we had flagged this at the very beginning of the year that the back half both Q3 and Q4 had tough compare. So you're exactly correct. The Q3 compare was particularly driven by some multiyear deals which we talked about, but the Q4 compare was also very challenging Q4, fiscal 2019 was an exceptionally good quarter. So it's not appropriate to guide to replicating that. We also called out at that time just to remind everyone that there had been some customers on Atlas that were consuming in excess of their run rate. We don't have enough data or enough history on Atlas to know if that's kind of truly seasonal behavior. And so we're not counting on that either. But I think fundamentally, Q2 was very strong. We're obviously raising our guidance more than the beat and it really reflects the underlying health of the business. And then the last thing that we've talked about consistently for the last couple of quarters. We just want to underscore is, Q4 is the first time we hit the mLab anniversary. And while that business is performing well relative to our investment thesis, the underlying cohorts are declining. And so that obviously creates sort of a year-over-year headwind when you look at sort of the growth comparison.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And next, we move on to Jason Ader with William Blair.\nJason Ader: Yes, thank you. Hi, guys. Just wanted to address the competitive landscape, if you would. Specifically relative to Amazon and any feedback you're hearing from customers on document DB? And then maybe any other comments on win rates against legacy guys and what you're seeing just broadly speaking competitively?\nDev Ittycheria: We feel really good about the business. I mean obviously, Amazon has a large reach, but I think as we spent time on previous calls, they've tried to emulate MongoDB using a very different architecture. So that has severe consequences in terms of both features as well as performance, and we've heard in many situations where customers have tried to use document DB and it has really been right for their use case. And so we don't see any headwinds in terms of competition. It is a big market. There's a lots of people out there. But we feel really good about a competitive differentiation, as evidenced by our growth rates, as evidenced by some of the most sophisticated customers in the world are choosing MongoDB for some very, very mission critical workloads. And they don't have lack of access to options. And then \u2013 and we feel really good about our positioning.\nJason Ader: Okay, great. And then a quick follow-up for Michael, you just talked about the Enterprise Advanced deals that you had in the quarter. I'm assuming these were larger companies. Do you have any metric that you track in terms of how much of your business is, let's say, with Global 2000 customers or something to that effect?\nMichael Gordon: That's not something that we have that we sort of publicly report on. I'm trying to figure if there was anything that we have that would be useful that that we have disclosed. But I'll try and keep it\u2026\nJason Ader: Do you have a rough idea of how much of your business is let's call it, enterprise versus more mid-market?\nMichael Gordon: So certainly, if you separate the business into the self sold-side and self-service side, within the self-sold side, the majority is coming from larger enterprises. The mid-market team is newer and we've been scaling that more recently. The product market fit within Atlas is particularly strong on that team, and that's actually the area that my comments earlier about sort of ease of adoption and less comfortable making annual payments advances, much more to mid-market that we see that. And so that's been growing. But the majority is on the large enterprise side within self-sold.\nJason Ader: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. And moving on, we have Pat Walravens from JMP Securities.\nJoey Marincek: Hi, this is Joey on for Pat. Thank you for taking our question. We are wondering about the difference between selling more databases into an existing customer compared to selling apps and how specifically does that manifest itself in a net dollar expansion rate? Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Well, I'm not sure I completely understood the details of your question. But let me try and take a stab at answering it. So unlike an app say like Workday or Salesforce, if you add more employees and more salespeople, the cost of sale is quite low because the customer will just say, hey, I need X number of new seats or licenses for these additional people that I've hired. Whereas for database software, while we have some applications that grow very quickly organically, most of the growth in an account is by adding new workflows or new apps, and so there may be a different team, a different decision maker and so on and so forth involved in those decisions. Obviously, as the more momentum we have in account, the easier the next workload becomes. But that tends to be a different buying cycle than just someone adding seats or licenses for expanding an existing application. And so the benefit is that we're never locked out of account. So it's not like SAP versus Workday, where someone has made a big commitment to SAP, the Workday salesperson says, \u201cwhat I'm not going to be able to sell anything to this customer for the next three years.\u201d That's \u2013 so this is not a winner take home market. And in terms of our net expansion rates, our net expansion rates are really strong, because once we get into an account, I think we've talked at the IPO and in every quarter, we have a land expand business. And so once we get into an account, database software is very sticky and they see value in it. They typically find other reasons to use our software for other use cases. But as I said, the buying motion is a little different.\nMichael Gordon: I think the other thing just to sort of get to the last part of the question is because the market is so large, the expand portion sort of goes on longer, and so that's very additive to the net ARR expansion rates. And so if you think about very simplistically, we talked about this in the context of the IPO, the Fortune 100, which obviously we're addressing a much larger universe than that. But just illustratively it's helpful to understand, we had just over half of the Fortune 100 customers. So the best we could do in terms of raw customer count is sort of not quite double within that universe of customers and directionally we had less than 1% of their spend, right? So the upside on the expand part was quite significant given what a small wallet share we have relative to the very large TAM. So that puts it somewhat in context.\nJoey Marincek: Yes. That's really helpful. Thank you so much and congrats on the quarter.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we have Jack Andrews with Needham.\nKhanh Ngo: Hi, gentlemen. It's Khanh Ngo for Jack this afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. MongoDB World, you mentioned that some customers could see an increase in customer size due to Full-Text Search. Can you provide an update on the changes you're seeing in customer size due to this feature? And what's the potential TAM of existing customers that may end up using Full-Text Search?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. I should remind you that we're still in a beta rollout. So the product is not technically GA. But we have a number of customers who are now using or testing or trialing Full-Text Search and the feedback has been quite positive. I think it's a little early to start giving you some sense of like what the incremental growth is of each customer. It really depends on the application. And in terms of the applicability of Full-Text Search in our market is very high. So if you think about it what application today doesn't have some embedded search functionality in it? So we think the cross-sell opportunities are quite large.\nKhanh Ngo: Thanks, that's helpful. And how should we think about today like featuring the displacement opportunity for like a cloud-based Hadoop system and where are some of the benefits of using your Atlas Data Lake versus other systems?\nDev Ittycheria: Right. So I would say the \u2013 we think that the Atlas Data Lake is awesome solution for people who have contemplated using HADOOP technologies because as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's not a huge upfront investment required. There's not a need to hire some specialized skills. And the time to value is not very long. In fact you can get up and running very, very quickly because you can just very easily query and parse the data that you've stored in S3 and so we think the opportunity there is incredibly high. And I think the advantage also is that if you already have existing MongoDB skills, there's not new technology that you have to learn. So it becomes very easy for developers and others to basically query data using a semantic language that they're very comfortable in using. And so in terms of competitive offerings, we feel like \u2013 we think about the most common data format today for modern data is JSON, who better to really query and manage JSON data than MongoDB, which is \u2013 architecture is built around supporting JSON. And so we think we're very well positioned to go after this market, given our expertise in managing modern data.\nKhanh Ngo: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nClarke Jeffries: Hi. This is Clarke on for Brent. Just going to the comments about the mid-market customers that are really building their business around MongoDB. Is there any kind of description you could kind of qualify what those customers look like? Are they very digital first? Are they conducting their business primarily through an e-commerce channel? Just some sort of way to understand what that kind of business and what those customers look like today?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, sure. I mean, they're clearly digital first companies. They're potentially a startup that's grown into a kind of a mid-market state, but growing very, very quickly. They're very technology savvy and the business is very technology intensive. It could be e-commerce. It could be gaming. It could be new business models and they are basically potentially in the machine learning and the AI space. So those companies, if their business is really taking off, they can \u2013 their needs in terms of support and service tend to look much like a potentially a large enterprise, just given the sophistication and complexity of their environment. And so the advantage we have is that, we just haven't built a mid-market channel. We build also high-end enterprise channel. And so depending on that customer's needs, we can mix and match the right channel for the right customer, and that gives us real flexibility in terms of how to service these very sophisticated customers.\nClarke Jeffries: Great. And are you seeing them \u2013 or would you anticipate those to be probably target customers for these add-on offerings for parsing the JSON data because they might have more of their core operations within MongoDB. Just trying to understand whether you're seeing early signs of they're not going to another vendor for analytical extra operational understanding of their business. They're keeping it all with an ecosystem and that's what you think. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, they're definitely great candidates and some of them may have already implemented some third-party solution, but they're still great candidates for us to talk to. These customers always tend to be evaluating different options. And so \u2013 but it's again quite early for our Data Lake product and our Full-Text Search product they're still in beta, but we're very, very pleased with the kind of enthusiastic response we're seeing.\nOperator: Okay. And moving on to the next question, from Oppenheimer we have Vinod Srinivasaraghavan.\nVinod Srinivasaraghavan: Hi, how are you guys? I have two questions. First, I want to dig into the expansion rate dynamics a bit. Has your expansion rate moved up or down materially, sequentially?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So it's consistently been, I think it's now 18 quarters that we've said, that it's over 120%. Quarter-to-quarter, there's some quarters where you see more new logo activity relative to expansion from existing customers and other quarters where you see it slightly tip the other way. But I would say we've very consistently had both strong new logo growth and expansion of existing customers.\nVinod Srinivasaraghavan: Okay. And just one more. How many customers are above $1 million in ARR now?\nMichael Gordon: So we haven't given that number since the \u2013 we give that number typically annually I think when we ended Q4 of last year, that was at 39 million \u2013 39 customers over $1 million, excuse me, 39 customers over $1 million. But that's not a number we update quarterly.\nVinod Srinivasaraghavan: Got it. All right. Congrats on the quarter.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks.\nOperator: All right, ladies and gentlemen, it does appear that that does conclude our question-and-answer session of the call. I'd like to turn the floor back to CEO, Dev Ittycheria, for additional or closing remarks.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you again for joining our second quarter earnings call. We really appreciate the interest and the support. And as I mentioned upfront, we're really pleased about the quarter, and we feel like we're well positioned to go after a big opportunity. Thank you.\nOperator: Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we're very pleased with our second quarter performance. I'll begin with a detailed review of our second quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2020. First, I'll turn to our second quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $99.4 million, up 67% year-over-year, subscription revenue was $94.2 million, up 71% year-over-year and professional services revenue was $5.2 million, up 15% year-over-year. While we performed well above our expectations in the quarter, we would like to note that our results also benefited from a few meaningful Enterprise Advanced transactions that we had expected to close in the third quarter. Under ASC 606, we were required to recognize the upfront term license revenue from these contracts in Q2, when we have expected to realize them originally in Q3. Our second quarter performance reflected positive contributions from every region and strong adoption of both Enterprise Advanced and Atlas. The combination of healthy new logo additions and continued strength in up-sell activities provides us with multiple vectors to sustain high levels of growth. We continue to see rapid adoption of Atlas, which grew over 240% in the quarter and now represents 37% of total revenue compared to 18% in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and 35% last quarter. Atlas has now reached a nearly $150 million annualized revenue run rate only three years since its launch, which reflects the popularity of MongoDB and the growing interest that customers of all sizes have in a fully managed Cloud Database offering. As a reminder, our second quarter results include the impact of mLab, which we acquired in November of 2018. At the time of the mLab acquisition, we said that we expected the mLab business to decline as we transition their customer base to the Atlas platform. Revenue from mLab customers performed in line with our expectations for a modest sequential decline, which we expect will continue in the second half of fiscal 2020, as planned. Excluding mLab, we were very pleased with the organic growth of the business overall, which drove the outperformance relative to the guidance. During the second quarter, we grew our customer base by over 800 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 15,000, which is up from over 7,400 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count over 1,850 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,600 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 13,200 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 5,300 in the year ago period. The sequential growth in total customers includes growth in our Enterprise Advanced customers as well as new Atlas customers. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We also continue to see healthy expansion from existing customers, which is a key component of our growth strategy. Our net ARR expansion rate in the first quarter remained above 120% for the 18 consecutive quarter. We ended the quarter with 622 customers, with at least 100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 438 in the year-ago period. Moving down the P&L, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the second quarter was $71.1 million, representing a gross margin of 72%, compared to 74% in the year-ago period. We are pleased with the efficiencies we're generating in our organic Atlas business as it scales. In addition, we're starting to see improvements in mLab, as mLab benefits from Atlas's scale and as we're starting to transition mLab customers onto the Atlas platform. However, we continue to expect that we will see some modest reduction in overall company gross margin, as Atlas continues to be a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $14.8 million or a negative 15% operating margin for the second quarter compared to a negative 30% margin in the year-ago period. The more than 1,500 basis points improvement in operating margin is particularly impressive, given our growth profile and the investments we are making in our business. Given our strong first half revenue and profitability performance and the numerous growth opportunities we are targeting, our intention is to make incremental investments in sales and marketing and R&D in the second half of fiscal 2020. Net loss in the second quarter was $14.7 million or $0.26 per share based on 55.6 million weighted-average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.34 per share on 51.2 million shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $436.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was negative $12.6 million. After taking into consideration approximately $1.2 million in capital expenditures, free cash flow is negative $13.8 million for the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $18 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. We are pleased with our cash flow performance year-to-date, but expect to burn cash in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as we continue to make significant investments in the business. Also given this year's stronger than expected Q2 cash flow performance, Q2 may not be our peak quarter for negative cash flow, as is typically the case. As a reminder, the continuing growth of Atlas as a percent of our overall business impacts our reported financials in several ways. First, Atlas revenues recorded on a consumption basis, whereas Enterprise Advanced includes a term license component that has recognized upfront. Second, Atlas has a lower overall gross margin Enterprise Advanced because of its infrastructure component. That said, on an apples-to-apples functionality basis, Atlas is accretive to dollars of gross profit. Finally, self-service at Atlas customers and a growing portion of our direct sales Atlas customers pay us monthly in arrears versus annually upfront for Enterprise Advanced. In other words, a growing percentage of Atlas which is an increasing portion of our overall business, does not involve an upfront cash payment nor does it impact our deferred revenue balances. We believe that offering customers the ability to pay as they go is a key benefit of the cloud model. More broadly, we believe that continuing to find ways to facilitate the ease of consumption will ultimately maximize long-term revenues and cash flow. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2020. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $98 million to $100 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be negative $16.5 million to negative $15.5 million and a non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of negative $0.29 to negative $0.27 per share based on 56.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. As we have mentioned on previous calls, our third quarter outlook reflects a notably large compare from the third quarter of fiscal 2019, when we signed a higher than usual number of multiyear Enterprise Advanced contracts. As a reminder, under ASC 606, we recognized the entire term license portion of a multiyear contract at the outset, resulting in no recognition of additional term license revenue at the beginning of each new subscription year of the contract. Also, as discussed earlier, our results in the second quarter also benefited from a few meaningful Enterprise Advanced transactions that moved from Q3 to Q2. For the full fiscal year 2020, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $390 million to $395 million compared to our previous guidance of $375 million to $381 million. Please recall the fourth quarter will be the first quarter, where we'll have mLab in the base period. And as we've described before, we expect continued deterioration in the revenue from former mLab customers, both sequentially as well as year-over-year. This is all in line with our original investment thesis. For the full fiscal year 2020, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be negative $62 million to negative $59 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of negative $1.11 to negative $1.06 per share based on 55.9 million weighted average shares outstanding. As mentioned previously, we see our strong start to fiscal 2020 as another indication of the size the opportunity ahead of us and we will invest incrementally across our business in the second half to further pursue that opportunity. To summarize MongoDB delivered excellent second quarter results. We're executing well on our product and go-to-market strategies, which is generating impressive growth at scale. We believe our clear leadership is the modern general purpose data platform of choice will enable us to continue delivering strong growth going forward. And with that, we'd like to open up to questions. Operator? Yes. Not specifically in terms of a number, but I think the key point here is, this ties to what we've talked about \u2013 ever since we adopted 606, it sort of increased variability and reduced comparability quarter-to-quarter. And so I think what we wanted to do is just have people understand that we had a couple that sort of fell on the earlier side of the ledger relative to where we were forecasting, and that helps put sort of Q3 in context. Yes. So I think the key thing there is we're trying to give a point in time estimate for folks as opposed to quarterly metric that we'd read out on. But I think in general, the direction will be more of as we \u2013 as I kind of shared in the prepared remarks. More and more of Atlas will be on a monthly in arrears basis both because of the self-serve growth as well as trying to make sure that we are reducing any possible barriers to consumption and making consumption as easy as possible, including monthly invoicing for arrears for some enterprise customers for whom that's important. So I think in general, you'll continue to see that be a relevant consideration and therefore some of the deferreds in other ways that you tend to look at some companies being increasingly less relevant, as it relates to analyzing us. No things are remain the course. We're doing a lot of business with the SIs. I think we have relations with a number of them. In fact, I just did a video testimonial with Infosys that was published on LinkedIn. And we have relations with Accenture, with Cap Gemini, a bunch of boutique players and other large systems integrators. And obviously each system integrator has certain expertise either in a particular geography or an industry or they have specific account control and so we work well with them. And the synergy there is that, in many cases, as we all know lot of customers are constrained on development capacity and so where the systems really can add value as being the development arm, leveraging MongoDB and a more modern stack to help customers drive innovation faster in the organization. And so we're spending a lot of time enabling these integrators both at the corporate level and at the field level and building more and more proof points. And in some cases, you also see integrators themselves build their own specific products, embedding MongoDB in their technology. And so it's a multipronged effort. Yes, sure, yes. So we had flagged this at the very beginning of the year that the back half both Q3 and Q4 had tough compare. So you're exactly correct. The Q3 compare was particularly driven by some multiyear deals which we talked about, but the Q4 compare was also very challenging Q4, fiscal 2019 was an exceptionally good quarter. So it's not appropriate to guide to replicating that. We also called out at that time just to remind everyone that there had been some customers on Atlas that were consuming in excess of their run rate. We don't have enough data or enough history on Atlas to know if that's kind of truly seasonal behavior. And so we're not counting on that either. But I think fundamentally, Q2 was very strong. We're obviously raising our guidance more than the beat and it really reflects the underlying health of the business. And then the last thing that we've talked about consistently for the last couple of quarters. We just want to underscore is, Q4 is the first time we hit the mLab anniversary. And while that business is performing well relative to our investment thesis, the underlying cohorts are declining. And so that obviously creates sort of a year-over-year headwind when you look at sort of the growth comparison. That's not something that we have that we sort of publicly report on. I'm trying to figure if there was anything that we have that would be useful that that we have disclosed. But I'll try and keep it... So certainly, if you separate the business into the self sold-side and self-service side, within the self-sold side, the majority is coming from larger enterprises. The mid-market team is newer and we've been scaling that more recently. The product market fit within Atlas is particularly strong on that team, and that's actually the area that my comments earlier about sort of ease of adoption and less comfortable making annual payments advances, much more to mid-market that we see that. And so that's been growing. But the majority is on the large enterprise side within self-sold. I think the other thing just to sort of get to the last part of the question is because the market is so large, the expand portion sort of goes on longer, and so that's very additive to the net ARR expansion rates. And so if you think about very simplistically, we talked about this in the context of the IPO, the Fortune 100, which obviously we're addressing a much larger universe than that. But just illustratively it's helpful to understand, we had just over half of the Fortune 100 customers. So the best we could do in terms of raw customer count is sort of not quite double within that universe of customers and directionally we had less than 1% of their spend, right? So the upside on the expand part was quite significant given what a small wallet share we have relative to the very large TAM. So that puts it somewhat in context. Yes. So it's consistently been, I think it's now 18 quarters that we've said, that it's over 120%. Quarter-to-quarter, there's some quarters where you see more new logo activity relative to expansion from existing customers and other quarters where you see it slightly tip the other way. But I would say we've very consistently had both strong new logo growth and expansion of existing customers. So we haven't given that number since the \u2013 we give that number typically annually I think when we ended Q4 of last year, that was at 39 million \u2013 39 customers over $1 million, excuse me, 39 customers over $1 million. But that's not a number we update quarterly. Thanks."

            "name": "Dev Ittycheria",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Thanks to everyone for joining us to review our second quarter results. MongoDB continued to perform at a very high level, driven by broad-based strength in all geographies and industries. Our results continue to demonstrate that MongoDB has clearly established itself as the most popular modern database platform of choice in the world. Our success is being driven by our strong product market fit and the sophistication of our go-to-market strategy. We're confident that we'll be able to continue to capitalize on our long-term opportunity in the 64 billion global database software market. Looking quickly at our second quarter financial results. We generated revenue of $99.4 million, up 67% year-over-year increase and above the high-end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 71% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew more than 240% year-over-year and now represents 30% of revenue, and we had another strong quarter of customer growth ending the quarter with over 15,000 customers. Our strong results begin with our best-in-class product offering. We made several significant product announcements that represent notable progress on our long-term product vision to make data stunningly easy to work with. In June, we held our annual user conference MongoDB World in New York and attendance set another record. During the conference, we unveiled a number of exciting products and features, including the MongoDB version 4.2 with key features such as distributed asset transactions and client-side field level encryption. We believe this latest release further cements our positioning as the modern general purpose database of choice and underscores our capability to support the most mission critical applications. MongoDB Atlas Data Lake allows customers to quickly Query data on S3 in any format using the MongoDB Query Language. We believe that other solutions in the analytics markets have been plagued by high upfront investments, complex implementations and a need for specialized skills. By contrast with Atlas Data Lake, our customers can leverage their existing MongoDB expertise and incur no upfront costs to quickly derive value from their data. MongoDB Full-Text Search gives end users the flexibility to filter, rank and sort their data to quickly service the most relevant search results. Importantly, they can implement this functionality without incurring the effort and cost of pairing their database with an external search engine. Developers can leverage the functionality to build sophisticated search queries within applications, saving them significant amount of time, effort and money. Finally, we announced our plan to integrate our newly acquired mobile database Realm with our serverless platform Stitch. Realm's Synchronization Protocol will connect with MongoDB's Atlas Global Cloud Database on the back-end, making Realm Sync a powerful way for developers to connect data to the devices running their applications. As part of MongoDB, Realm is positioned to become the default database for mobile developers and the easiest way to build real-time mobile applications. These product announcements are formed by a long-term vision and ground by feedback from our customers on the strategic value they can achieve by leveraging MongoDB for a broader set of use cases across their organization. Our second quarter results also demonstrate our investments in expanding and extending our go-to-market capabilities that are paying off. Given the size of the market in front of us, we have built an increasingly sophisticated three-pronged go-to-market strategy that allows us to pursue the entire database market. The first component is our field sales organization, which drove strong broad-based performance in all our major regions in the second quarter. Our success with field sales is driven by our ability to recruit and develop outstanding sales personnel and strategically engage our customers from developers up to CXOs.  Second, our inside sales channel focuses on the mid-market, where deals are smaller with shorter sales cycles. These customers, who prefer a low touch sales model with a high degree of automation, have less interest in managing their own infrastructure and therefore see compelling value in Atlas. The third component of our go-to-market strategy is our self-serve channel which has grown significantly as a percentage of revenue over the past year. Starting last year, we significantly increased our investment in this channel to build a world class developer focused product led growth marketing organization. This is a multiyear journey, but we are encouraged by the progress we are making. We also see increasingly a synergy across these go-to-market motions. For example, we have observed developers and large enterprises frequently start evaluating and using Atlas via our self-serve channel, which can lead to large opportunities for our direct sales force. We've also seen fast-growing self service customers who can grow even faster when they interact with our customer-facing teams. Moreover, we have observed highly sophisticated mid-market customers, some of whom have built their entire business on MongoDB, who need a level of engagement typical of large enterprises. One of the key competitive differentiators is the freedom to run anywhere, and our cloud partnerships enable customers that choose MongoDB Atlas to take advantage of the benefits of each major cloud provider as they see it fit. We're off to a strong start with our partnership with GCP. We expanded our relation with Microsoft by launching the availability of Atlas on Microsoft Azure Marketplace, which will simplify billing for joint customers. Furthermore, we have joined Microsoft Strategic Partner reported ACR co-sell program, and this was yet another record quarter for Atlas on AWS. I like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer vignettes. We are increasingly seeing a wide array of customers choosing MongoDB to run mission critical applications. The following is a small selection of customer wins and interesting use cases from the second quarter. MongoDB is a valued partner to Venmo. Venmo has experienced tremendous growth over the past few years and has decided to partner with MongoDB because of our ability to provide the scale they needed for their growing platform. Venmo is leveraging MongoDB's Enterprise Advanced offering to streamline operations and to drive automation. Halliburton Energy Services, a leading oilfield services company, is adopting MongoDB to modernize its high performance rig technology. The Halliburton Edge platform connects digital operations of the field, orchestrating multiple inbound and outbound data streams and applications to optimize execution. The ease of use and flexible scheme of MongoDB enabled the developers to quickly iterate and drive innovation and modernization at the rig site. An important example of MongoDB's international reach. Technology leader Hitachi signed an agreement to embed MongoDB in their new products. After evaluating several other database platforms, they chose MongoDB for a consistent reputation for reliability, scalability and performance. Dreamus, a subsidiary of SK Telecom, the number one telco in Korea recently replaced MySQL with MongoDB for their new mobile music service flow. Dreamus made the decision to switch to MongoDB, because of the limitations of its relational database to scale and MongoDB's flexible scheme of data model as well as their future plans for a managed cloud service. Conrad Electric, a European retailer of electronic products based in Germany and one of Europe's top 10 online shops, was self managing MongoDB community in the cloud, but recently decided to move their MongoDB environment to Atlas. They're not only saving on overall infrastructure cost, but can also focus their developers time on high value tasks instead of database management. The breadth and depth of MongoDB's deployments around the world demonstrates our success as the modern data platform of choice. To summarize MongoDB continues to perform at a very high level. We believe the increasing sophistication of go-to-market strategy and expanded product portfolio position us well to continue delivering high revenue growth rates for the foreseeable future. We're focused on executing against our strategic priorities and ensuring we capitalize on our market opportunity. With that, let me now turn the call over to Michael. I would say that this quarter was much like most other quarters. There wasn't any changes in linearity. We typically put a lot of rigor in our forecasting process. And so we have a pretty good sense of how the quarter is looking. And obviously the close to the quarter we get to the more \u2013 even more visibility we have, and I would say, our sales organization is quite effective at closing deals and giving customers reasons for why they should engage with us now versus later. And we feel really good about that execution. Sure. And just for everyone's benefit. We started in 2016 on AWS first and then a year later we added GCP and Azure. I would say that \u2013 obviously, I would say Atlas, the deployments of Atlas in some ways mirrors the broader market share of the larger cloud providers. That being said, I would say that we've been really pleased with the traction we're getting with Google and that's really starting to accelerate even though the partnership we announced in May has not had a lot of time to gestate. But activity level is very strong and we've closed a number of deals with Google and the announcement we made with Microsoft basically incentivizes their salespeople to basically get paid on Atlas deals. Moreover, customers can get a unified bill when they buy Atlas via the marketplace and they can apply their Azure commitments towards Atlas, which means that they don't have to go find other dollars to fund the workload on Atlas. So all know, it's a win-win for the customer, win-win for Microsoft salespeople and absolute win-win for us. Yes. So I would say that while there have been a lot of point solutions build for particular use cases, we increasingly hear from customers that they just can't use a net new technology for every net new workload, it doesn't scale, it's hard to get everyone to learn all these new technologies, support and maintain all of them, and it just adds a lot more costs. So the degree to which that they can consolidate their infrastructure under not necessarily only one platform, but a small number of platforms that becomes more compelling to the customer. So I would say, for example, our Full-Text Search capability basically obviates the need for a customer to buy a disparate search engine to complement their functionality on the database to basically provide search functionality on their application. Conversely, for the Data Lake capabilities, rather than having to learn a new technology, make some big upfront investment, hire a very specialized group of people, you can leverage the experience and expertise of people that have on MongoDB and basically use the Data Lake functionality to Query data on S3, which is where most people are storing their data today. So it really allows people to \u2013 it gives reason for people to use MongoDB for a broader and broader set of use cases. And remember, the database is the heart of every application. So unlike search, where there's some vendors in the search space who have contemplated becoming a database, they quickly realize that that was not something that was very easy to do. They're now trending more towards the op space and going after the systems managing market, where I think with the database being the center of gravity, it's much more natural for us to expand from the database to broaden our set of use cases. And that's why we think as MongoDB becomes an obvious choice for modern applications, our ability to expand our use cases will get better over time. And you see these investments in the products that we're making. We think we're just in the early innings of our self-serve journey. If you remember, we really started this business with the launch of Atlas and then we accumulated more expertise to the mLab acquisition, because they built their business entirely through self-serve. We finally feel that we have \u2013 in making investments to really understand the levers that what drives self-serve. We have \u2013 now with lots of customers, over 13,000 customers at Atlas. We have a lot more understanding and sophistication on product signals in terms of what customers may be right for up-sell or cross-sell. But we still feel that we're on the early innings of our journey there. We've been very pleased. We've been hiring like mad. We have a high bar and we will continue to be hiring because as I think I've mentioned on many calls, given the size of the market, we are constrained by the reach that we have. And in many markets, we have very limited coverage. And so but just hiring salespeople is not enough, you have to hire and make sure you have the sales management leadership in place and you need to make sure you have your recruiting infrastructure in place and that once you hire them, you can ramp them and get them productive as fast as possible. That's a big priority for us. We are very happy with the number of people we recruited in the last quarter, but there's a big push to do a lot of recruiting in Q3 and Q4. I would say that we're seeing actually strong demand for Atlas in the enterprise. And in some cases, they'll actually commit upfront for a certain amount of spend in a particular year over a multiyear period and that's driven by either new workloads that they're building and they want to just run in the cloud because of a particular use case reasons or they're migrating, say, a community workload on-premise to the cloud because the cost benefit of Atlas is that much more compelling. And so we're seeing a lot of interest from very, very large organizations. I think previously we talked about banks, insurance companies, tech companies and so on so forth, all very, very interested in Atlas. And we're really, really excited about the interest level. And one of the other things that really surfaces in our discussions with these large enterprises is our ability to run Atlas on multiple clouds. So either they want to leverage specific expertise or services or capabilities with a particular cloud provider or they want to make sure that they have a diversity of workloads across different cloud providers. And so running that on Atlas preserves their optionality because they can do that very easily without having to rewrite the application. We feel really good about the business. I mean obviously, Amazon has a large reach, but I think as we spent time on previous calls, they've tried to emulate MongoDB using a very different architecture. So that has severe consequences in terms of both features as well as performance, and we've heard in many situations where customers have tried to use document DB and it has really been right for their use case. And so we don't see any headwinds in terms of competition. It is a big market. There's a lots of people out there. But we feel really good about a competitive differentiation, as evidenced by our growth rates, as evidenced by some of the most sophisticated customers in the world are choosing MongoDB for some very, very mission critical workloads. And they don't have lack of access to options. And then \u2013 and we feel really good about our positioning. Well, I'm not sure I completely understood the details of your question. But let me try and take a stab at answering it. So unlike an app say like Workday or Salesforce, if you add more employees and more salespeople, the cost of sale is quite low because the customer will just say, hey, I need X number of new seats or licenses for these additional people that I've hired. Whereas for database software, while we have some applications that grow very quickly organically, most of the growth in an account is by adding new workflows or new apps, and so there may be a different team, a different decision maker and so on and so forth involved in those decisions. Obviously, as the more momentum we have in account, the easier the next workload becomes. But that tends to be a different buying cycle than just someone adding seats or licenses for expanding an existing application. And so the benefit is that we're never locked out of account. So it's not like SAP versus Workday, where someone has made a big commitment to SAP, the Workday salesperson says, \u201cwhat I'm not going to be able to sell anything to this customer for the next three years.\u201d That's \u2013 so this is not a winner take home market. And in terms of our net expansion rates, our net expansion rates are really strong, because once we get into an account, I think we've talked at the IPO and in every quarter, we have a land expand business. And so once we get into an account, database software is very sticky and they see value in it. They typically find other reasons to use our software for other use cases. But as I said, the buying motion is a little different. Thank you. Yes. I should remind you that we're still in a beta rollout. So the product is not technically GA. But we have a number of customers who are now using or testing or trialing Full-Text Search and the feedback has been quite positive. I think it's a little early to start giving you some sense of like what the incremental growth is of each customer. It really depends on the application. And in terms of the applicability of Full-Text Search in our market is very high. So if you think about it what application today doesn't have some embedded search functionality in it? So we think the cross-sell opportunities are quite large. Right. So I would say the \u2013 we think that the Atlas Data Lake is awesome solution for people who have contemplated using HADOOP technologies because as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's not a huge upfront investment required. There's not a need to hire some specialized skills. And the time to value is not very long. In fact you can get up and running very, very quickly because you can just very easily query and parse the data that you've stored in S3 and so we think the opportunity there is incredibly high. And I think the advantage also is that if you already have existing MongoDB skills, there's not new technology that you have to learn. So it becomes very easy for developers and others to basically query data using a semantic language that they're very comfortable in using. And so in terms of competitive offerings, we feel like \u2013 we think about the most common data format today for modern data is JSON, who better to really query and manage JSON data than MongoDB, which is \u2013 architecture is built around supporting JSON. And so we think we're very well positioned to go after this market, given our expertise in managing modern data. Yes, sure. I mean, they're clearly digital first companies. They're potentially a startup that's grown into a kind of a mid-market state, but growing very, very quickly. They're very technology savvy and the business is very technology intensive. It could be e-commerce. It could be gaming. It could be new business models and they are basically potentially in the machine learning and the AI space. So those companies, if their business is really taking off, they can \u2013 their needs in terms of support and service tend to look much like a potentially a large enterprise, just given the sophistication and complexity of their environment. And so the advantage we have is that, we just haven't built a mid-market channel. We build also high-end enterprise channel. And so depending on that customer's needs, we can mix and match the right channel for the right customer, and that gives us real flexibility in terms of how to service these very sophisticated customers. Yes, they're definitely great candidates and some of them may have already implemented some third-party solution, but they're still great candidates for us to talk to. These customers always tend to be evaluating different options. And so \u2013 but it's again quite early for our Data Lake product and our Full-Text Search product they're still in beta, but we're very, very pleased with the kind of enthusiastic response we're seeing. Thank you. Thank you again for joining our second quarter earnings call. We really appreciate the interest and the support. And as I mentioned upfront, we're really pleased about the quarter, and we feel like we're well positioned to go after a big opportunity. Thank you."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Brian. And thanks to all of you for joining us today to review our first quarter results. We are very pleased with our performance for the first quarter. Our great start in fiscal 2020 reflects strong execution by the MongoDB team and continued momentum across all aspects of our business. We also are benefiting from the previous product and go-to-market investments we made to ensure we fully capitalize on one of the largest market opportunities in software. In fact, IDC recently updated its forecast and expects the worldwide database software market to grow from $64 billion in 2019 to approximately $98 billion in 2023. We believe that much of this incremental $34 billion will come from modern applications and new workloads, which we are well positioned to capitalize on. Looking quickly at our first quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $89.4 million, a 78% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 82% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew more than 340% year-over-year and now represents 35% of revenue. We had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 14,200 customers. These results are a powerful indication of how MongoDB continues to benefit from a number of positive market trends. First, for a new platform to succeed, it has to be embraced by the developer community, given the disproportionate influence developers have regarding technology decisions. Our developer mindshare and financial results demonstrate that MongoDB has clearly established itself as the most popular modern database platform in the world. Second is the growing recognition that, because working with data is so critical in building applications, using a modern general purpose database platform enables businesses across every industry to innovate faster and respond more quickly to new market opportunities. Customers are increasingly choosing MongoDB for their mission-critical workloads to drive innovation. Third is the increasing importance of being able to easily move applications across any compute environment. Customers want the flexibility to run applications on-premise, in a private cloud and in the public clouds without being locked in with any cloud vendor.  Moreover, we see a significant portion of our customers gravitating towards hybrid environments with a mix of workloads on premise and in the cloud. With MongoDB, customers can run applications anywhere, in any compute environment, on the same data platform and feature set without having to rewrite any code. We are at the early stages of the largest platform shift in history with the move to the cloud. Customers are still figuring out this transition and there are a number of approaches being taken. MongoDB provides complete optionality for customers to make this transition without locking themselves into a course of action and gives them the ability to make continuous adjustments. In short, customers can confidently future-proof themselves by choosing MongoDB. At MongoDB, we're always looking ahead of what's next and how the needs of our customers will evolve. To accelerate our mobile efforts, we recently acquired Realm, one of the most popular mobile database and synchronization platforms. Data synchronization is the single biggest challenge in building compelling mobile applications and Realm has developed a comprehensive synchronization platform that is a natural complement to MongoDB Atlas and Stitch. Realm reinforces our run anywhere strategy and, like MongoDB, is focused on giving developers a far more flexible, intuitive and comprehensive way to work with data. We will be providing more details about our future plans for Realm and how to create value for customers at MongoDB World later this month. Our growing popularity has made MongoDB an attractive partner for many companies. Expanding our partner ecosystem is a strategic priority and an area we have been investing additional resources. We had our strongest performance ever with partners in the first quarter, which reflects the healthy returns on the investments we have made. Some highlights include our biggest quarter ever with systems integrators. We are seeing strong traction with these strategic partners in almost every region. Much of the deals SIs bring to us would most likely have involved longer sales cycles and smaller initial deals without their involvement. Their trusted relationships give those customers the confidence to sign larger initial deals with us and to include MongoDB at the core of their digital transformation initiatives. We believe there is a significant opportunity to further deepen our relationships with SIs.  We also signed several large deals through our IBM relationship, including a substantial win with one of the world's largest insurance companies. Last, but not least, we were excited to recently announce an expanded partnership with Google, who will now be offering MongoDB Atlas as a first class service on their Google Cloud Platform. Being offered as a first class service means Atlas will be integrated directly within the GCP console and marketplace providing a unified user experience by tightly coupling Atlas with GCP's identity and access management, logging and monitoring Kubernetes and Tensorflow. GCP customers will also be able to purchase and pay for Atlas the same way as any other GCP service and apply Atlas towards their spending commitments. We are moving forward with joint go-to-market efforts and Google salespeople are highly incentivized to sell MongoDB Atlas, further extending our market reach. We believe this partnership is a clear indication that Google recognizes that, to provide the best customer experience, it is important to integrate with the best-in-class products like MongoDB in the marketplace. I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer vignettes. The need to innovate and to provide a compelling user experience has become an imperative for companies in every industry around the world. We believe companies that are not leveraging a modern data platform, like MongoDB, for mission-critical applications are increasingly at risk of being at a competitive disadvantage. The following are a small sample of the customer wins and interesting use cases from the first quarter. When Splunk needed robust handling for non-relational data to complement their extensive IP, they naturally chose MongoDB. When Splunk needed robust handling for non-relational data to complement our extensive IP they naturally chose MongoDB. Splunk embeds MongoDB into the search head component of every deployment of MongoDB's Splunk Enterprise to store application state and configuration data. TIM, formally Telecom Italia, a leading telecommunications provider in Italy, is adopting MongoDB for their customer usage data, which was traditionally stored on a relational database. MongoDB is also used within their new service delivery platform as one of the fast data layers to guarantee quick access to information. Renewable energy provider, Enphase Energy, is a global energy technology company and the world's leading provider of solar microinverters. They decided to migrate from DynamoDB to MongoDB Atlas. Atlas will provide Enphase with the ability to reduce risk, automate processes, scale elasticities and meet their future global availability needs. Auto Trader UK, the UK and Ireland's largest digital automotive marketplace, has been using MongoDB since 2011. They recently made an internal decision to move to the cloud and saw immense value in using MongoDB Atlas for removing the operational overhead of their existing deployment. Everbridge, a leader in critical event management and enterprise safety software applications, utilizes MongoDB as the core data platform within their suite of products. MongoDB underpins their high availability strategy, which enables them to move data globally without sacrificing scalability or performance. As Everbridge continues to expand geographically and deal with ever-growing regulatory requirements, MongoDB is the key component enabling flexibility within their application architecture. FanFight, a fantasy cricket league based in India, built their business on MongoDB to accommodate the dramatic fluctuation in concurrent users anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 depending on their team or the match. They chose MongoDB Atlas to get a better insight into real-time monitoring, improve their scalability, low response times and take their platform to the next level. To be clear, customers are increasingly turning to MongoDB to increase their pace of innovation and improve business performance. Innovation is the core of what we do at MongoDB. From the very beginning, we are focused on creating a better way for customers to work with data to improve their business performance. We were pleased to have been named a leader in the 2019 Forrester Wave for Big Data NoSQL where they gave us top marks for our ease of use, simplified model, on-demand elastic scale, multi-cloud support and comprehensive tooling. We were also named a leader in the most recent Forrester Wave for database-as-a-service where we received top marks for high availability, disaster recovery, multi-model support, automation, user access, roadmap and six other categories. I will note that the only other vendors to be named a leader in this category were AWS, Google, Microsoft and Oracle. We look forward to sharing our vision and many specific product announcements at MongoDB World, our annual user conference taking place in New York on June 18th, and hope to see many of you there. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I wanted to provide an update on some changes we made to our board of directors. Kevin Ryan, our current board chairman and one of our co-founders, will not be continuing as a director after our annual meeting of stockholders on July 10th, 2019.  From working with our other co-founders, Eliot Horowitz and Dwight Merriman, to create the document database model to helping raise capital in the company's early years to his wise strategic counsel as our board chairman, Kevin has had a big impact on MongoDB over the last 11 years. Kevin will be devoting his time to the number of other early stage companies he's incubated and developed over the past few years. On behalf of everybody at MongoDB, I want to thank Kevin for everything he's done for the company and wish him all the best in the future. I'm excited to announce that our board has named Tom Killalea as its next chairman to takeover when Kevin's term as director expires. A member of our board since 2015, Tom is one of the world's foremost cloud computing experts and one of the original executives in-charge of creating and scaling AWS. Tom is a visionary with a deep understanding of how companies are looking to leverage technology and, in particular, the cloud to transform their business. Tom has been a terrific asset to our board and I would like to congratulate him on this new role. Finally, we anticipate that the board will be appointing Archana Agarwal as a director later this summer. She's currently the Head of Enterprise and Cloud Marketing at Atlassian where she leads global marketing for all products. Prior to this role, Archana served as Atlassian's Head of Data Science and Growth Marketing where she helped build and scale their analytics capabilities for the high velocity, self-serve, go-to market model. We are excited to welcome Archana to the board. To summarize, MongoDB got off to a great start in fiscal 2020. Our market position continues to strengthen and customers are increasingly turning to MongoDB as one of their strategic vendors. We are confident we have a long runway to drive high levels of growth for years to come. With that, let me now turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Gordon : Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we're very pleased with our first quarter performance which reflects best-in class growth at meaningful scale. I'll begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2020. As a reminder, starting this quarter, we are only reporting our current and historical financial results on an ASC 606 basis. In addition, for convenience, we have also included in our earnings release an additional table with our historical customer count data. I'll now turn to our first quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $89.4 million, up 78% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $84 million, up 82% year-over-year and professional services revenue was $5.4 million, up 33% year-over-year. As a reminder, our first quarter results include the impact of mLab which we acquired in November 2018 and performed in line with our expectations. Excluding mLab, the organic growth in the business remained very strong, consistent with the last few quarters, and we are very pleased with our first quarter results. The strength in the quarter was broad based across geographies, industries and use cases. We're pleased with the increasingly strategic nature of our customer wins, which is driving larger new logo additions and continued strength in upsell activity. We're also seeing rapid adoption of Atlas, which grew over 340% in the quarter and now represents 35% of total revenue compared to 14% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 32% last quarter. During the first quarter, we grew our customer base by over 800 customers, bringing our total customer count to over 14,200, which is up from over 6,600 in the year-ago period.  Of our total customer count, over 1,800 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,550 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 12,300 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 11,400 at the end of the fourth quarter. The sequential growth in total customers includes growth in our enterprise advanced customers as well as new Atlas customers. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing enterprise advanced customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We also continue to see healthy expansions from existing customers, which is a key component of our growth strategy. Our net AR expansion rate in the first quarter remained above 120% for the 17th consecutive quarter. We ended the quarter with 598 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 394 in the year-ago period. Moving down the P&L, I will be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $62.8 million, representing a gross margin of 70% compared to 74% in the year-ago period. As expected, the biggest impact on gross margin in the quarter was the increased revenue share from Atlas in addition to the acquisition of mLab, which has a lower gross margin than Atlas revenue. We expect the impact from mLab to dissipate by the end of fiscal 2020 as we migrate mLab customers to Atlas. We continue to see gross margin improvement of organic Atlas as this business scales. However, we continue to expect that we will see some modest reduction in overall company gross margins as Atlas continues to be a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $12.6 million or a negative 14% operating margin for the first quarter compared to a negative 38% margin in the year-ago period. The more than 2,300 basis points in improvement in operating margin is particularly impressive given our growth profile and the investments we are making in the business. Net loss in the first quarter was $12.1 million or $0.22 per share based on 54.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.37 per share on 50.4 million shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $476.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired Realm for $39 million. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was positive $3.2 million, driven in part by the collection from strong fourth quarter bookings. After taking into consideration approximately $400,000 in capital expenditures, free cash flow was positive $2.8 million in the quarter. We are pleased to have generated positive free cash flow for the first time as a public company. Of note, this occurred earlier than we had expected and reflects the scalability of our business model. As a reminder, we would expect the second quarter to be our largest cash burn quarter due to seasonally-lower first quarter bookings and incremental expenses related to our MongoDB World event. Despite the strong Q1, we continue to expect that we will burn cash in full fiscal year 2020 as we continue to invest significantly in the business. Short-term deferred revenue was $128.3 million, up 47% year-over-year, while total deferred revenue of $143.7 million is up 39% year-over-year. Please note that the adoption of 606 materially impacts our deferred revenue balance and quarter-to-quarter comparisons of deferred revenue can also have some level of variability due to timing. As Atlas is a usage-based model, it generates less deferred revenue than Enterprise Advanced. As a reminder, the majority of Atlas revenue is billed monthly in arrears versus the annual, in advance billing terms we see with our Enterprise Advanced customers. For example, currently, approximately two-thirds of Atlas revenue is not reflected in deferred revenue. Given these invoicing dynamics and Atlas' increasing share of our overall business, we believe looking at growth in deferred revenue is becoming even less relevant in evaluating our business. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2020. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $90 million to $92 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be negative $16.5 million to negative $15.5 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of negative $0.29 to negative $0.27 based on 55.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2020, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $375 million to $381 million compared to our previous guidance of $363 million to $371 million. As a reminder, year-over-year growth comparisons and quarter-to-quarter results will likely be more variable under 606 due in part \u2013 due to the timing of multi-year contract signings. As an example, and as we have described before, we are facing noticeably larger comparison in the second half of fiscal 2020, particularly in the third quarter. In addition, the fourth quarter will be the first quarter where we will have mLab in the base period. And as we have described before, we have expected some deterioration in the revenue from former mLab customers. For the full fiscal year 2020, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be negative $63 million to negative $59 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of negative $1.11 to $1.04 per share based on 55.6 million weighted average shares outstanding. Please note that our updated earnings guidance reflects the impact of the Realm acquisition, which we completed in early May. Realm will have a de minimis impact on revenue. There are two factors to call out in our operating loss outlook. Better-than-expected performance in the core business, more than offset by the additional expense associated with Realm. To summarize, MongoDB continues to perform at a very high level. We are delivering growth at scale that few companies can match. We're disrupting one of the largest markets in software and we are well positioned to drive high levels of growth for the foreseeable future. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Well, thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats for a great quarter.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Raimo.\nRaimo Lenschow: Dev, I apologize for the question already, but can you talk a little bit about Realm because \u2013 so when we talk to the guys in the field, they were super excited about it because they see like, look, mobile is a really important part of what's going on, but I'm not quite sure I fully get it. Could you just talk me through that? And then, I have a follow-up for Mike.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah, sure. So, much like the founders of MongoDB, the Realm founders came from Nokia. So, they had a lot of experience building databases for mobile devices, especially for featured phones, and they saw all the challenges with those legacy solutions. So, they've built a database optimized for the mobile device, including very sophisticated data synchronization protocol to basically synchronize data back and forth from the mobile device to the back-end server and vice versa, especially dealing with slow or intermittent connections. Moreover, they built a very sophisticated API, so as data changes, the UI would be updated in real time. And the trend now is to build these very rich mobile applications that represent data in real time. And data is the biggest challenge with mobile. And so, we were very attractive to Realm because of the developer mindshare they have. Much like MongoDB, their data model is very similar to ours, and so they had a lot of developer traction. And we will be making some specific product announcements at MongoDB World about how we're integrating Realm into the larger MongoDB platform.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. That helps. And then, a follow-up for Mike. Mike, as you said, two-thirds of Atlas revenue is not in deferred. Is there a way to think about like maybe ARR, something to kind of give us more visibility or what's the best way you suggest for us to kind of track the progress?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So, I think as we've talked about before, it continues to be \u2013 revenue is the core way of looking at it. We're trying to provide sort of additional slices, given both the self-serve nature as well as the sale/sold [ph] nature. But as we've talked about before, specifically looking at deferreds really winds up missing the picture, which is why we wanted to provide the incremental sense for like the order of magnitude of how much of Atlas currently is not flowing through deferreds.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you. Congrats.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Raimo.\nMichael Gordon: Thank you.\nOperator: And next will be Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on another excellent quarter. Dev, maybe I want to start\u2026\nDev Ittycheria: Hi, Sanjit.\nSanjit Singh: Hi, Dev. How are you?\nDev Ittycheria: I'm well.\nSanjit Singh: Maybe just to start off on, and a follow-up to Raimo's question, on server-less, can you give us a sense of where server-less adoption in terms of workloads are versus maybe like containers in the Kubernetes movement, is it lagging by a year or two? What's the uptake on server-less? And probably outside of AWS, is that beginning to start to gain some traction as well?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah, we're seeing \u2013 obviously, server-less got a lot of hype couple of years ago. And I would say, we're just starting to see customers really start adopting server-less. It's still very, very early days. Frankly, our announcement of Stitch was our version of server-less, which is a much more sophisticated version than, say, Lambda with the capabilities we had in terms of providing data access and being able to integrate to other third-party services. And I would say that it is a trend that we foresee in the future, an increasing trend in terms of how applications are built, and that's something that we're planning for.\nSanjit Singh: Excellent. And then, maybe just to sort of mark-to-market on some of the trends around MongoDB overall and Atlas, and I remember sort of, at the time of IPO, we were talking about most of the use cases around the document model supporting transactional applications, but there was a potential opportunity to get more analytical workloads and maybe graph database workloads. Where are we in terms of that multi-modal adoption as customers sort of are subsuming multiple use cases on to the databases platform? Any sort of color there?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So, we believe that the document model is a superset of the relational and the key value stores. So, for example, we support Joins. We have far more functionality than a key value store, though we can mimic a key value store especially with the tunability of our consistency model. And then, in terms of analytics, in fact, we've recently announced, on Atlas, analytic nodes where you basically have now read-only secondaries where you can use our BI connector to run reports on your production workloads without impacting user performance. This is something that other databases just cannot do. So, that is something that we support. And you're going to see analytics continue to be a big part of the MongoDB story going forward.\nSanjit Singh: Excellent. Looking forward to Analyst Day.\nDev Ittycheria: Cool. We look forward to seeing you then.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: Yes. Hi, Dev. I was wondering \u2013 there's been a lot of, I guess, challenges in the overall infrastructure software market and, obviously, predominantly the on-premise vendors over the last couple of trends that we've seen over the last few weeks. I was wondering if you could share with us kind of anything you're noticing from a deal closing environment or just kind of commentary on overall IT spending that you could share with us that you're hearing from customers. And also, if there is anything that you could share with us just about how you've seen customers respond. It doesn't seem like AWS is offering \u2013 is gaining much traction, but just kind of, if you've seen \u2013 if you've heard from many customers about feedback and if it comes up in any customer conversations at all? Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So, on the infrastructure spending environment, we feel very good about the environment. In fact, we just finished up our QBRs with our sales teams around the world and a big push is to recruit more aggressively because we see a very big market opportunity in front of us. And so, we feel very good about our positioning. We feel very good about our competitive advantage against all the alternatives and substitutes out there. We're seeing more and more customers adopt us for mission-critical workloads and it's not just a North American phenomena. We're seeing that in EMEA, LatAm and Asia-Pacific region. So, we feel really good about the trends that we see. And part of that reason is that, if you think about what's happening in the macro environment, the way apps are being built and the decomposition of MongoDB Atlas into micro services, the move to the cloud, and the need for a hybrid environment, the desire to consume infrastructure-as-a-service, the desire to support a multi-cloud environment all play to our strengths. And I think the recognition that the document model is the easiest way to work with data. So, we feel really good about that. And while this is a big market, obviously, it attracts a lot of big competitors. We don't see any changes in the competitive environment. And I must remind you that this is not a winner-take-all market. So, other vendors don't have to die for us to win and we feel very good about the market trends and the opportunity in front of us.\nHeather Bellini: And then, I just had a follow-up, if you don't mind. Atlas now is \u2013 I think you said it was 35% of total revenue. If you look out three years, like, what do you expect that to be? How do you see that growth trajectory on a percentage of revenue basis kind of continuing?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. It's hard to answer that question with any level of specificity. But I'll tell you directionally that we definitely believe the future is in offering cloud services. As we've mentioned in the past, a few quarters ago, Atlas and Enterprise Advanced were at feature parity. Now, we are leading with new features on Atlas itself. So, you actually see new features introduced on the Atlas platform before it gets incorporated back into our on-premise product. And so, we're big believers in the move to the cloud. We are big believers in the fact that customers will not want to put all their workloads in one basket. So, multi-cloud model will be important. And for larger customers who made large investments in their own infrastructure that are sunk costs, they'll want to also have a hybrid environment of an on-prem cloud environment. So, we think we're well-positioned there as well.\nHeather Bellini: Great, thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Heather.\nOperator: And next will be Brad Reback with Stifel.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Dev, maybe sticking with Atlas first, can you give us a sense of what the net expansion rate looks like in that business versus the overall business maybe on a cohort perspective?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. The net expansion rate is definitely higher than our overall blended business. We don't publish that number, but it's just a function of the fact that customers can consume infrastructure more quickly. They don't have to go provision more internal capacity or deal with any of the operational issues of provisioning more capacity. And so, we find that the net expansion rates are higher than our blended rate that we've disclosed, which is, for the 17 quarters in a row, has been over 120%.\nBrad Reback: Great. And then, just following up on your commentary around the SIs and the strong traction you're seeing there, are there any commonalities around use cases, verticals, geographies? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So, I would say, the commonality is that customers are increasingly using SIs as their application development arm and they're, obviously, at the forefront in terms of how applications are being built. And so, there's a natural synergy between us and them because, as they build apps and they choose MongoDB, that drives revenue for us and, obviously, drives meaningful application development revenue for them. So, there's a natural synergy between us and the larger SIs, and we're working with a number of them. People like Accenture, Capgemini, Infosys, TCS, Cognizant and a bunch of boutique vendors all around the world. And the use cases are quite varied. Some SIs are focused on the financial services sector or the healthcare sector. Others are more horizontal. Others have a more of a geographic focus. So, it really depends on the partner. And so, we typically try and work with a partner that's best positioned in a particular customer account. And then, we have, obviously, some strategic relationships that span all theaters and it just depends on the situation of who we partner with.\nBrad Reback: Excellent. Thanks very much.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: Next will be Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nClarke Jeffries: Hi. This is Clarke Jeffries on the call for Brent. Maybe, Dev, for you, as you start to invest in these technologies and maybe outside of the core document database, what are the core considerations that you're mulling over as you choose technology? What do you see as having the lasting benefit to the developer? Do you see there being plenty of opportunity to be tactical on just really the pain points of the legacy technology?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. Our vision is that we want MongoDB to be the best platform to build modern data applications, and so that's our overriding strategy. I will tell you that I don't want to steal our thunder from MongoDB World, but we'll be making some very interesting announcements there. As I mentioned, we'll be talking about how we plan to integrate Realm into the core platform and a bunch of other new announcements. But it's all in the spirit of making MongoDB truly the best platform to build modern applications.\nClarke Jeffries: Great. And then, Michael, just given the relative strength of maybe the Enterprise Advanced business and deferred revenue, were there any significant multi-year deals signed in the quarter that may have been a benefit to revenue? And then, sort of as you look at the full year, is that 5% contribution to this year changing at all? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Sure. Yeah. No, I think as we said in the prepared remarks, and as we've seen pretty consistently over the last several quarters, the performance is quite broad-based. And so, whether that be by geography or product line or channel, however you want to think about it, it's really been quite broad-based and enterprise advanced had yet another good strong quarter as well. There were no \u2013 there was not a disproportionate amount of multi-year deals relative to what we would have expected in this quarter. And I don't know what the 5% that you're talking about is. I don't know what that reference is.\nClarke Jeffries: Just last quarter commentary on maybe multi-year contribution to revenue being about 5% for the full year?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So, the 5%, just to be clear, was just \u2013 it wasn't multi-year. It was just simply the impact of 606 relative to 605. So, it wasn't a multi-year comment in general, but it was just the impact of including the term license component as opposed to have everything be ratable.\nClarke Jeffries: Yeah, understood.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So, I certainly don't \u2013 we haven't seen anything that would have us alter that view.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question will come from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.\nVinod Srinivasaraghavan: Hi. This is Vinod Srinivasaraghavan on for Ittai. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to talk about the SSPL for a second. How are your talks with industry stakeholders going? And can you comment on any future licensing changes at this time? Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So, just to make sure everyone is up to speed, all our products today are licensed under SSPL. We did withdraw ratification of the SSPL with the OSI because we thought it'd be best to just work with them on coming up with a license that would basically meet our needs, but as well as let the OSI help drive the formulation of a new license. So, if it's consistent and principal to what SSPL is, we will end up potentially adopting that new license. I should note that we've already seen a number of other vendors come out with their own licenses that are somewhat consistent with the spirit of SSPL. I think just dealing with the challenges of building open source business in the cloud era. And so, I expect this trend to continue. And in terms of our discussions with other people, for customers, it's been a complete non-event. Our partners have been very supportive. And we feel very good about the defensibility of our IP.\nVinod Srinivasaraghavan: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Rishi Jaluria.\nHannah Rudoff: Hi, guys. This is Hannah on for Rishi. Thank you for taking my questions. Just starting off, I know, last quarter, you were talking about adding sales capacity in the field and growing the self-serve business. And I was just wondering if you could give an update on that and any new initiatives you've [indiscernible] on that.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So, we are definitely trying to add a lot of sales capacity. We're actively recruiting in all theaters around the world. We've added leadership capacity, which is a precursor to adding field capacity. And we're spending a lot of time, not just on recruiting, but also on the on-boarding program, so our new reps can \u2013 the ramp to productivity is as short as possible. We're spending a lot of time on training and other development activities, not just for reps, but also for our leadership. And in terms of self-serve, that's also a big push. There's a lot of focus on our self-serve business. We've added a number of resources to that team. It's a big part of the senior management's attention and focus. And you'll expect us to add more capacity in that group. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Archana Agarwal, who's going to be joining our board in August, she ran and built the self-serve capabilities at Atlassian. And the reason her experience is very relevant because that was a developer-focused product. Their business is predominantly self-serve, and so her experience \u2013 and she has, obviously, worked in a very high growth, rapid growth environment. So, that experience will be very relevant to what we're doing here and we're excited to get her assistance and counsel as we scale our business.\nHannah Rudoff: Okay, great. That's really helpful. And then, second, I was wondering if you had any commentary around churn you're seeing from the mLab customers?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So, what we've talked about is it's less about churn as we gave our forecast and our guidance, but it's more about sort of price compression as resulting of the fact that we offer different pricing plans and our philosophy has been to be customer-friendly. And if they had a lower plan previously, they will get the benefit of lower plan. And if the Atlas plan represents a price reduction, they will get the benefit of the Atlas price reduction. And so far, the integration has gone smoothly. We're only a couple of quarters into it and most of the migrations will take place in the latter half of this year. And so, I don't think there's anything material to report there. But so far, we've been very pleased with how things have gone and the performance of mLab and the integration steps that we've made over these first two quarters.\nHannah Rudoff: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Dev Ittycheria for any additional or closing remarks.\nDev Ittycheria: In summary, we are really pleased with the start to fiscal 2020 with our Q1 performance. We believe the investments we're making in both the product and go-to-market areas are yielding high returns and we're really excited about the future. And so, we thank you for your time and we hope to see many of you at MongoDB World in New York City on June 18th, 2019. Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Thank you.\nOperator: Well, thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we're very pleased with our first quarter performance which reflects best-in class growth at meaningful scale. I'll begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2020. As a reminder, starting this quarter, we are only reporting our current and historical financial results on an ASC 606 basis. In addition, for convenience, we have also included in our earnings release an additional table with our historical customer count data. I'll now turn to our first quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $89.4 million, up 78% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $84 million, up 82% year-over-year and professional services revenue was $5.4 million, up 33% year-over-year. As a reminder, our first quarter results include the impact of mLab which we acquired in November 2018 and performed in line with our expectations. Excluding mLab, the organic growth in the business remained very strong, consistent with the last few quarters, and we are very pleased with our first quarter results. The strength in the quarter was broad based across geographies, industries and use cases. We're pleased with the increasingly strategic nature of our customer wins, which is driving larger new logo additions and continued strength in upsell activity. We're also seeing rapid adoption of Atlas, which grew over 340% in the quarter and now represents 35% of total revenue compared to 14% in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 32% last quarter. During the first quarter, we grew our customer base by over 800 customers, bringing our total customer count to over 14,200, which is up from over 6,600 in the year-ago period.  Of our total customer count, over 1,800 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,550 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 12,300 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 11,400 at the end of the fourth quarter. The sequential growth in total customers includes growth in our enterprise advanced customers as well as new Atlas customers. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing enterprise advanced customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We also continue to see healthy expansions from existing customers, which is a key component of our growth strategy. Our net AR expansion rate in the first quarter remained above 120% for the 17th consecutive quarter. We ended the quarter with 598 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 394 in the year-ago period. Moving down the P&L, I will be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $62.8 million, representing a gross margin of 70% compared to 74% in the year-ago period. As expected, the biggest impact on gross margin in the quarter was the increased revenue share from Atlas in addition to the acquisition of mLab, which has a lower gross margin than Atlas revenue. We expect the impact from mLab to dissipate by the end of fiscal 2020 as we migrate mLab customers to Atlas. We continue to see gross margin improvement of organic Atlas as this business scales. However, we continue to expect that we will see some modest reduction in overall company gross margins as Atlas continues to be a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $12.6 million or a negative 14% operating margin for the first quarter compared to a negative 38% margin in the year-ago period. The more than 2,300 basis points in improvement in operating margin is particularly impressive given our growth profile and the investments we are making in the business. Net loss in the first quarter was $12.1 million or $0.22 per share based on 54.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.37 per share on 50.4 million shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $476.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired Realm for $39 million. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was positive $3.2 million, driven in part by the collection from strong fourth quarter bookings. After taking into consideration approximately $400,000 in capital expenditures, free cash flow was positive $2.8 million in the quarter. We are pleased to have generated positive free cash flow for the first time as a public company. Of note, this occurred earlier than we had expected and reflects the scalability of our business model. As a reminder, we would expect the second quarter to be our largest cash burn quarter due to seasonally-lower first quarter bookings and incremental expenses related to our MongoDB World event. Despite the strong Q1, we continue to expect that we will burn cash in full fiscal year 2020 as we continue to invest significantly in the business. Short-term deferred revenue was $128.3 million, up 47% year-over-year, while total deferred revenue of $143.7 million is up 39% year-over-year. Please note that the adoption of 606 materially impacts our deferred revenue balance and quarter-to-quarter comparisons of deferred revenue can also have some level of variability due to timing. As Atlas is a usage-based model, it generates less deferred revenue than Enterprise Advanced. As a reminder, the majority of Atlas revenue is billed monthly in arrears versus the annual, in advance billing terms we see with our Enterprise Advanced customers. For example, currently, approximately two-thirds of Atlas revenue is not reflected in deferred revenue. Given these invoicing dynamics and Atlas' increasing share of our overall business, we believe looking at growth in deferred revenue is becoming even less relevant in evaluating our business. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2020. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $90 million to $92 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be negative $16.5 million to negative $15.5 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of negative $0.29 to negative $0.27 based on 55.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2020, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $375 million to $381 million compared to our previous guidance of $363 million to $371 million. As a reminder, year-over-year growth comparisons and quarter-to-quarter results will likely be more variable under 606 due in part \u2013 due to the timing of multi-year contract signings. As an example, and as we have described before, we are facing noticeably larger comparison in the second half of fiscal 2020, particularly in the third quarter. In addition, the fourth quarter will be the first quarter where we will have mLab in the base period. And as we have described before, we have expected some deterioration in the revenue from former mLab customers. For the full fiscal year 2020, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be negative $63 million to negative $59 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of negative $1.11 to $1.04 per share based on 55.6 million weighted average shares outstanding. Please note that our updated earnings guidance reflects the impact of the Realm acquisition, which we completed in early May. Realm will have a de minimis impact on revenue. There are two factors to call out in our operating loss outlook. Better-than-expected performance in the core business, more than offset by the additional expense associated with Realm. To summarize, MongoDB continues to perform at a very high level. We are delivering growth at scale that few companies can match. We're disrupting one of the largest markets in software and we are well positioned to drive high levels of growth for the foreseeable future. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Yes. So, I think as we've talked about before, it continues to be \u2013 revenue is the core way of looking at it. We're trying to provide sort of additional slices, given both the self-serve nature as well as the sale/sold [ph] nature. But as we've talked about before, specifically looking at deferreds really winds up missing the picture, which is why we wanted to provide the incremental sense for like the order of magnitude of how much of Atlas currently is not flowing through deferreds. Thank you. Sure. Yeah. No, I think as we said in the prepared remarks, and as we've seen pretty consistently over the last several quarters, the performance is quite broad-based. And so, whether that be by geography or product line or channel, however you want to think about it, it's really been quite broad-based and enterprise advanced had yet another good strong quarter as well. There were no \u2013 there was not a disproportionate amount of multi-year deals relative to what we would have expected in this quarter. And I don't know what the 5% that you're talking about is. I don't know what that reference is. Yeah. So, the 5%, just to be clear, was just \u2013 it wasn't multi-year. It was just simply the impact of 606 relative to 605. So, it wasn't a multi-year comment in general, but it was just the impact of including the term license component as opposed to have everything be ratable. Yeah.

            "name": "Dev Ittycheria",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. And thanks to all of you for joining us today to review our first quarter results. We are very pleased with our performance for the first quarter. Our great start in fiscal 2020 reflects strong execution by the MongoDB team and continued momentum across all aspects of our business. We also are benefiting from the previous product and go-to-market investments we made to ensure we fully capitalize on one of the largest market opportunities in software. In fact, IDC recently updated its forecast and expects the worldwide database software market to grow from $64 billion in 2019 to approximately $98 billion in 2023. We believe that much of this incremental $34 billion will come from modern applications and new workloads, which we are well positioned to capitalize on. Looking quickly at our first quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $89.4 million, a 78% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 82% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew more than 340% year-over-year and now represents 35% of revenue. We had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 14,200 customers. These results are a powerful indication of how MongoDB continues to benefit from a number of positive market trends. First, for a new platform to succeed, it has to be embraced by the developer community, given the disproportionate influence developers have regarding technology decisions. Our developer mindshare and financial results demonstrate that MongoDB has clearly established itself as the most popular modern database platform in the world. Second is the growing recognition that, because working with data is so critical in building applications, using a modern general purpose database platform enables businesses across every industry to innovate faster and respond more quickly to new market opportunities. Customers are increasingly choosing MongoDB for their mission-critical workloads to drive innovation. Third is the increasing importance of being able to easily move applications across any compute environment. Customers want the flexibility to run applications on-premise, in a private cloud and in the public clouds without being locked in with any cloud vendor.  Moreover, we see a significant portion of our customers gravitating towards hybrid environments with a mix of workloads on premise and in the cloud. With MongoDB, customers can run applications anywhere, in any compute environment, on the same data platform and feature set without having to rewrite any code. We are at the early stages of the largest platform shift in history with the move to the cloud. Customers are still figuring out this transition and there are a number of approaches being taken. MongoDB provides complete optionality for customers to make this transition without locking themselves into a course of action and gives them the ability to make continuous adjustments. In short, customers can confidently future-proof themselves by choosing MongoDB. At MongoDB, we're always looking ahead of what's next and how the needs of our customers will evolve. To accelerate our mobile efforts, we recently acquired Realm, one of the most popular mobile database and synchronization platforms. Data synchronization is the single biggest challenge in building compelling mobile applications and Realm has developed a comprehensive synchronization platform that is a natural complement to MongoDB Atlas and Stitch. Realm reinforces our run anywhere strategy and, like MongoDB, is focused on giving developers a far more flexible, intuitive and comprehensive way to work with data. We will be providing more details about our future plans for Realm and how to create value for customers at MongoDB World later this month. Our growing popularity has made MongoDB an attractive partner for many companies. Expanding our partner ecosystem is a strategic priority and an area we have been investing additional resources. We had our strongest performance ever with partners in the first quarter, which reflects the healthy returns on the investments we have made. Some highlights include our biggest quarter ever with systems integrators. We are seeing strong traction with these strategic partners in almost every region. Much of the deals SIs bring to us would most likely have involved longer sales cycles and smaller initial deals without their involvement. Their trusted relationships give those customers the confidence to sign larger initial deals with us and to include MongoDB at the core of their digital transformation initiatives. We believe there is a significant opportunity to further deepen our relationships with SIs.  We also signed several large deals through our IBM relationship, including a substantial win with one of the world's largest insurance companies. Last, but not least, we were excited to recently announce an expanded partnership with Google, who will now be offering MongoDB Atlas as a first class service on their Google Cloud Platform. Being offered as a first class service means Atlas will be integrated directly within the GCP console and marketplace providing a unified user experience by tightly coupling Atlas with GCP's identity and access management, logging and monitoring Kubernetes and Tensorflow. GCP customers will also be able to purchase and pay for Atlas the same way as any other GCP service and apply Atlas towards their spending commitments. We are moving forward with joint go-to-market efforts and Google salespeople are highly incentivized to sell MongoDB Atlas, further extending our market reach. We believe this partnership is a clear indication that Google recognizes that, to provide the best customer experience, it is important to integrate with the best-in-class products like MongoDB in the marketplace. I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer vignettes. The need to innovate and to provide a compelling user experience has become an imperative for companies in every industry around the world. We believe companies that are not leveraging a modern data platform, like MongoDB, for mission-critical applications are increasingly at risk of being at a competitive disadvantage. The following are a small sample of the customer wins and interesting use cases from the first quarter. When Splunk needed robust handling for non-relational data to complement their extensive IP, they naturally chose MongoDB. When Splunk needed robust handling for non-relational data to complement our extensive IP they naturally chose MongoDB. Splunk embeds MongoDB into the search head component of every deployment of MongoDB's Splunk Enterprise to store application state and configuration data. TIM, formally Telecom Italia, a leading telecommunications provider in Italy, is adopting MongoDB for their customer usage data, which was traditionally stored on a relational database. MongoDB is also used within their new service delivery platform as one of the fast data layers to guarantee quick access to information. Renewable energy provider, Enphase Energy, is a global energy technology company and the world's leading provider of solar microinverters. They decided to migrate from DynamoDB to MongoDB Atlas. Atlas will provide Enphase with the ability to reduce risk, automate processes, scale elasticities and meet their future global availability needs. Auto Trader UK, the UK and Ireland's largest digital automotive marketplace, has been using MongoDB since 2011. They recently made an internal decision to move to the cloud and saw immense value in using MongoDB Atlas for removing the operational overhead of their existing deployment. Everbridge, a leader in critical event management and enterprise safety software applications, utilizes MongoDB as the core data platform within their suite of products. MongoDB underpins their high availability strategy, which enables them to move data globally without sacrificing scalability or performance. As Everbridge continues to expand geographically and deal with ever-growing regulatory requirements, MongoDB is the key component enabling flexibility within their application architecture. FanFight, a fantasy cricket league based in India, built their business on MongoDB to accommodate the dramatic fluctuation in concurrent users anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 depending on their team or the match. They chose MongoDB Atlas to get a better insight into real-time monitoring, improve their scalability, low response times and take their platform to the next level. To be clear, customers are increasingly turning to MongoDB to increase their pace of innovation and improve business performance. Innovation is the core of what we do at MongoDB. From the very beginning, we are focused on creating a better way for customers to work with data to improve their business performance. We were pleased to have been named a leader in the 2019 Forrester Wave for Big Data NoSQL where they gave us top marks for our ease of use, simplified model, on-demand elastic scale, multi-cloud support and comprehensive tooling. We were also named a leader in the most recent Forrester Wave for database-as-a-service where we received top marks for high availability, disaster recovery, multi-model support, automation, user access, roadmap and six other categories. I will note that the only other vendors to be named a leader in this category were AWS, Google, Microsoft and Oracle. We look forward to sharing our vision and many specific product announcements at MongoDB World, our annual user conference taking place in New York on June 18th, and hope to see many of you there. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I wanted to provide an update on some changes we made to our board of directors. Kevin Ryan, our current board chairman and one of our co-founders, will not be continuing as a director after our annual meeting of stockholders on July 10th, 2019.  From working with our other co-founders, Eliot Horowitz and Dwight Merriman, to create the document database model to helping raise capital in the company's early years to his wise strategic counsel as our board chairman, Kevin has had a big impact on MongoDB over the last 11 years. Kevin will be devoting his time to the number of other early stage companies he's incubated and developed over the past few years. On behalf of everybody at MongoDB, I want to thank Kevin for everything he's done for the company and wish him all the best in the future. I'm excited to announce that our board has named Tom Killalea as its next chairman to takeover when Kevin's term as director expires. A member of our board since 2015, Tom is one of the world's foremost cloud computing experts and one of the original executives in-charge of creating and scaling AWS. Tom is a visionary with a deep understanding of how companies are looking to leverage technology and, in particular, the cloud to transform their business. Tom has been a terrific asset to our board and I would like to congratulate him on this new role. Finally, we anticipate that the board will be appointing Archana Agarwal as a director later this summer. She's currently the Head of Enterprise and Cloud Marketing at Atlassian where she leads global marketing for all products. Prior to this role, Archana served as Atlassian's Head of Data Science and Growth Marketing where she helped build and scale their analytics capabilities for the high velocity, self-serve, go-to market model. We are excited to welcome Archana to the board. To summarize, MongoDB got off to a great start in fiscal 2020. Our market position continues to strengthen and customers are increasingly turning to MongoDB as one of their strategic vendors. We are confident we have a long runway to drive high levels of growth for years to come. With that, let me now turn the call over to Michael. Thanks, Raimo. Yeah, sure. So, much like the founders of MongoDB, the Realm founders came from Nokia. So, they had a lot of experience building databases for mobile devices, especially for featured phones, and they saw all the challenges with those legacy solutions. So, they've built a database optimized for the mobile device, including very sophisticated data synchronization protocol to basically synchronize data back and forth from the mobile device to the back-end server and vice versa, especially dealing with slow or intermittent connections. Moreover, they built a very sophisticated API, so as data changes, the UI would be updated in real time. And the trend now is to build these very rich mobile applications that represent data in real time. And data is the biggest challenge with mobile. And so, we were very attractive to Realm because of the developer mindshare they have. Much like MongoDB, their data model is very similar to ours, and so they had a lot of developer traction. And we will be making some specific product announcements at MongoDB World about how we're integrating Realm into the larger MongoDB platform. Thanks, Raimo. Hi, Sanjit. I'm well. Yeah, we're seeing \u2013 obviously, server-less got a lot of hype couple of years ago. And I would say, we're just starting to see customers really start adopting server-less. It's still very, very early days. Frankly, our announcement of Stitch was our version of server-less, which is a much more sophisticated version than, say, Lambda with the capabilities we had in terms of providing data access and being able to integrate to other third-party services. And I would say that it is a trend that we foresee in the future, an increasing trend in terms of how applications are built, and that's something that we're planning for. Yeah. So, we believe that the document model is a superset of the relational and the key value stores. So, for example, we support Joins. We have far more functionality than a key value store, though we can mimic a key value store especially with the tunability of our consistency model. And then, in terms of analytics, in fact, we've recently announced, on Atlas, analytic nodes where you basically have now read-only secondaries where you can use our BI connector to run reports on your production workloads without impacting user performance. This is something that other databases just cannot do. So, that is something that we support. And you're going to see analytics continue to be a big part of the MongoDB story going forward. Cool. We look forward to seeing you then. Yeah. So, on the infrastructure spending environment, we feel very good about the environment. In fact, we just finished up our QBRs with our sales teams around the world and a big push is to recruit more aggressively because we see a very big market opportunity in front of us. And so, we feel very good about our positioning. We feel very good about our competitive advantage against all the alternatives and substitutes out there. We're seeing more and more customers adopt us for mission-critical workloads and it's not just a North American phenomena. We're seeing that in EMEA, LatAm and Asia-Pacific region. So, we feel really good about the trends that we see. And part of that reason is that, if you think about what's happening in the macro environment, the way apps are being built and the decomposition of MongoDB Atlas into micro services, the move to the cloud, and the need for a hybrid environment, the desire to consume infrastructure-as-a-service, the desire to support a multi-cloud environment all play to our strengths. And I think the recognition that the document model is the easiest way to work with data. So, we feel really good about that. And while this is a big market, obviously, it attracts a lot of big competitors. We don't see any changes in the competitive environment. And I must remind you that this is not a winner-take-all market. So, other vendors don't have to die for us to win and we feel very good about the market trends and the opportunity in front of us. Yeah. It's hard to answer that question with any level of specificity. But I'll tell you directionally that we definitely believe the future is in offering cloud services. As we've mentioned in the past, a few quarters ago, Atlas and Enterprise Advanced were at feature parity. Now, we are leading with new features on Atlas itself. So, you actually see new features introduced on the Atlas platform before it gets incorporated back into our on-premise product. And so, we're big believers in the move to the cloud. We are big believers in the fact that customers will not want to put all their workloads in one basket. So, multi-cloud model will be important. And for larger customers who made large investments in their own infrastructure that are sunk costs, they'll want to also have a hybrid environment of an on-prem cloud environment. So, we think we're well-positioned there as well. Thanks, Heather. Yeah. The net expansion rate is definitely higher than our overall blended business. We don't publish that number, but it's just a function of the fact that customers can consume infrastructure more quickly. They don't have to go provision more internal capacity or deal with any of the operational issues of provisioning more capacity. And so, we find that the net expansion rates are higher than our blended rate that we've disclosed, which is, for the 17 quarters in a row, has been over 120%. Yes. So, I would say, the commonality is that customers are increasingly using SIs as their application development arm and they're, obviously, at the forefront in terms of how applications are being built. And so, there's a natural synergy between us and them because, as they build apps and they choose MongoDB, that drives revenue for us and, obviously, drives meaningful application development revenue for them. So, there's a natural synergy between us and the larger SIs, and we're working with a number of them. People like Accenture, Capgemini, Infosys, TCS, Cognizant and a bunch of boutique vendors all around the world. And the use cases are quite varied. Some SIs are focused on the financial services sector or the healthcare sector. Others are more horizontal. Others have a more of a geographic focus. So, it really depends on the partner. And so, we typically try and work with a partner that's best positioned in a particular customer account. And then, we have, obviously, some strategic relationships that span all theaters and it just depends on the situation of who we partner with. Thanks, Brad. Yeah. Our vision is that we want MongoDB to be the best platform to build modern data applications, and so that's our overriding strategy. I will tell you that I don't want to steal our thunder from MongoDB World, but we'll be making some very interesting announcements there. As I mentioned, we'll be talking about how we plan to integrate Realm into the core platform and a bunch of other new announcements. But it's all in the spirit of making MongoDB truly the best platform to build modern applications. Yeah. So, just to make sure everyone is up to speed, all our products today are licensed under SSPL. We did withdraw ratification of the SSPL with the OSI because we thought it'd be best to just work with them on coming up with a license that would basically meet our needs, but as well as let the OSI help drive the formulation of a new license. So, if it's consistent and principal to what SSPL is, we will end up potentially adopting that new license. I should note that we've already seen a number of other vendors come out with their own licenses that are somewhat consistent with the spirit of SSPL. I think just dealing with the challenges of building open source business in the cloud era. And so, I expect this trend to continue. And in terms of our discussions with other people, for customers, it's been a complete non-event. Our partners have been very supportive. And we feel very good about the defensibility of our IP. Yeah. So, we are definitely trying to add a lot of sales capacity. We're actively recruiting in all theaters around the world. We've added leadership capacity, which is a precursor to adding field capacity. And we're spending a lot of time, not just on recruiting, but also on the on-boarding program, so our new reps can \u2013 the ramp to productivity is as short as possible. We're spending a lot of time on training and other development activities, not just for reps, but also for our leadership. And in terms of self-serve, that's also a big push. There's a lot of focus on our self-serve business. We've added a number of resources to that team. It's a big part of the senior management's attention and focus. And you'll expect us to add more capacity in that group. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Archana Agarwal, who's going to be joining our board in August, she ran and built the self-serve capabilities at Atlassian. And the reason her experience is very relevant because that was a developer-focused product. Their business is predominantly self-serve, and so her experience \u2013 and she has, obviously, worked in a very high growth, rapid growth environment. So, that experience will be very relevant to what we're doing here and we're excited to get her assistance and counsel as we scale our business. In summary, we are really pleased with the start to fiscal 2020 with our Q1 performance. We believe the investments we're making in both the product and go-to-market areas are yielding high returns and we're really excited about the future. And so, we thank you for your time and we hope to see many of you at MongoDB World in New York City on June 18th, 2019. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Denyeau from ICR. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrian Denyeau: Great. Thank you, Carl. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to review MongoDB\u2019s fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2021 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me on the call today are Dev Ittycheria, President and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB\u2019s COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, our financial guidance, our planned investments and anticipated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations as well as on our clients and the macroeconomic environment. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For discussion of the material risks and uncertainties could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release of the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our fourth quarter results before giving you a company update. Looking quickly at our fourth quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $171 million, a 38% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 39% year-over-year, Atlas revenue grew 66% year-over-year and now represents 49% of revenue and we had another strong quarter of customer growth ended the quarter with over 24,800 customers. I believe we will look back at 2020 as the year that put an exclamation point on the need for businesses to reinvent themselves using software and data. As the world increasingly becomes digital first, there\u2019s no off the shelf software that organizations can buy to differentiate themselves against their competition. To be blunt, you cannot buy a competitive advantage, you have to build it yourself. And to build your differentiated future using software and data, you have to maximize the productivity of your developers. Managing data is a developer\u2019s most challenging problem and the biggest drain on their productivity. Legacy platforms are not designed for how developers think and code, nor they designed for performance and scale. This problem only gets worse at the data intensity and performance requirements of modern applications increase. Consequently, developers spend an enormous amount of time working around the limitations of existing solutions versus spending time building better applications and user experiences that drive a competitive advantage. Moving to the cloud, held out the promise of reduced complexity and improved productivity, what many early cloud adopters have learned the hard way is that moving to the cloud often exacerbates the poor state of their data infrastructure. First, companies decided to lift and shift their existing on-prem relational workloads to the cloud, replicating their on-premise problems in the cloud. As a senior IT executive and one of the world\u2019s largest asset management firms recently told us, he doesn\u2019t know of a single one of his peers who didn\u2019t come to regret the lift and shift strategy. Second, given the known limitations of relational databases, cloud providers promoted a number of other single purpose databases to address more diverse requirements, which in turn create a larger number of data stores for customers to learn, manage and integrate. This dramatically increased complexity of their data architecture. Third, cloud providers encourage customers to go all in with their proprietary offerings across the IT stack. The overwhelming number of proprietary point solutions not only slows developers down, but also deepens cloud vendor lock-in. Given the failings of existing approaches, developers and enterprises are clamoring for a modern application data platform that accelerates innovation. To be effective, a modern platform must support a broad range of use cases, meet stringent requirements for resiliency, security and scalability and provide enterprises the flexibility to run applications wherever they want. Our FY2021 results indicate that MongoDB has clearly established itself as the world\u2019s preeminent application data platform for building the applications of today and tomorrow. We are becoming a more strategic partner to customers as they increase their sense of urgency to modernize their IT stacks. In a number of our largest accounts, we\u2019ve become an enterprise standard, which indicates a strategic importance and positions us to win more workloads. The journey from the first win to becoming a standard can take a number of years as we build trust with and support from a variety of different constituents within the enterprise, including C-suite.  While each customer story has its unique elements, we have observed that they tend to follow a similar path on the way to declaring MongoDB as standard. We usually land an account by identifying a specific pain point that cannot be addressed by existing technologies. In a Fortune 50 financial institution that is now a seven-figure customer, our early use cases leveraged the strength of the document model to efficiently capture a complex loan application with hundreds of entries. In the case of a global gaming leader developers first started using MongoDB for microservices that leveraged the rapid scalability of our technology. After establishing a presence with the customer, we leveraged the success of the initial workloads to expand across divisional and geographic boundaries within the account. A top 10 U.S. bank experienced a major data center outage a couple of years ago, and MongoDB outperformed all other databases in terms of performance and availability. At the time, our teams ceased on the performance of our platform to more broadly serve our customers needs, organizing teachings and hackathons with other app development teams across the company. Two years later that banks customers\u2019 website experience runs on MongoDB. And with other use cases, the bank has now an eight-figure \u2013 annual eight-figure customer. Depending on the size of the account the expansion phase can last many years. This is where we currently are with many of our customers today and it is the key driver of a consistently strong net expansion rates. Once we become widely deployed, we leverage our existing internal proof points to pursue becoming a standard for future app development. Here, we emphasize the versatility of the document model to address a wide variety of use cases, meaningfully simplifying their data architecture. Second, we illustrate the performance, security and scalability of our platform ensuring that MongoDB can be trusted for the most demanding requirements. And third, apps built on MongoDB can run on-premise on any cloud or across different cloud providers, which offers real platform independence, benefits no other alternative can provide. A CTO from a Fortune 100 business almost fell off his chair when we demonstrated how easily a customer can deploy a workload across two different cloud providers. He remarked, he was planning to have a 50 person team work on this and now one person can do this in a few hours. Platform independence is something the C-suite in particular cares a lot about. This strategy is working. We finished FY2021 with close to 1000 customers spending over a $100,000 a year on our platform and close to 100 customers who are spending an excess of $1 million a year with us. And almost 60% increase from a year ago. As excited as we are about these stats, we are only at the beginning stages of becoming an enterprise standard. Even within our largest customers, MongoDB typically represents a small fraction of their total database spend affording us the opportunity to meaningfully grow even in our biggest accounts. We also expanded our global reach through a new partnership with Tencent Cloud that allows customers to easily adopt and use MongoDB as a service across Tencent\u2019s global cloud infrastructure. With this partnership, the two largest cloud providers in China now provide authorized MongoDB managed service offerings, demonstrating both the popularity of MongoDB in one of the largest markets in the world and the strength of our intellectual property. Now I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the fourth quarter. Acxiom part of the Interpublic Group of Companies is a customer intelligence company that provides data-driven solutions to enable the world\u2019s best marketers to understand the customers create better experiences and fuel business growth. As part of its ongoing innovation in the area of real-time decision and capabilities, Acxiom chose MongoDB Atlas, Data Lake, Realm and now Charts to be a key part of its cutting edge cloud architecture. Acxiom has now reduced this time to deploy solution for new customers from two months to less than 20 minutes. 1199 Funds is one of the largest labor management funds in the United States providing comprehensive health and retirement benefits to more than 450,000 healthcare industry workers and family members. In response to COVID-19, the company accelerated a massive cloud transformation initiative after migrating from SQL Server to MongoDB Atlas on Google Cloud, it was able to modernize its enterprise data warehouse and leverage MongoDB Realm to deliver a COVID-19 health screening app, which capped health questionnaires from nearly 3,000 employees a day. From the start of the project to the go live date, the complete solution was deployed in just three weeks. Cox Automotive has 40,000 auto dealers across five continents aspiring to bridge the gap between consumers, manufacturers, dealers and lenders at every stage of the automotive experience. In response to COVID-19 the company\u2019s Mobile Car Care division RideKleen developed a mobile platform, enabling drivers to schedule and technicians to manage and perform on-site disinfection services with PureProtect. RideKleen turned to MongoDB Realm Sync for zero latency data retrieval, offline application functionality and bi-directional syncing of data between the Realm mobile database and MongoDB Atlas. The largest department of UK government, the Department for Work and Pensions distributes welfare, pensions and child support to UK citizens. It's reformed welfare program Universal Credit faced an unprecedented test when COVID-19 caused claims to skyrocket by 10X DWP Digital chose MongoDB to underpin a secure platform and scale it services across a distributed microservices architecture to support the huge increase in demand. PicPay Brazil's largest e-wallet has over 40 million users and is accepted at over 3 million stores throughout the country. After experiencing 126% growth in 2020, the company chose MongoDB Atlas because they needed a highly scalable cloud database with real-time performance and low TCO in order to achieve its ambitious growth goals. Enterprise security features like data encryption at rest, in-transit and data locality made it easy for PicPay to comply with GDPR and FSI regulations and continue to pride a best-in-class customer experience to its growing user base. Today, more than one in 10 new apartments in the United States are built using Latch IoT products. Latch delivers a full building enterprise SaaS platform that helps owners, residents, and third-parties experience the modern building to services like Smart Access, Smart Home and Sensor Controls and Connectivity. Latch chose MongoDB Atlas for enhanced security features and the ability to move to a microservices architecture. So the company scale quickly and protect its customers\u2019 data. In summary, we had an exceptional year amidst, unprecedented disruption and uncertainty, as I think back to our earnings call a year ago at the outset of COVID-19, I can't help, but marvel, how we exceeded our own expectations despite the pandemic being longer and more severe than we could have mentioned at the time. I'm incredibly proud of how our team executed given the unforeseen challenges. The past year reaffirmed our conviction, that we are attacking an enormous market where secular wins are increasingly at our back. We have a highly differentiated value proposition and our team knows how to execute and deliver results. In FY 2022, our goals remain unchanged as we singularly focused on the opportunity ahead of us. We will continue innovating to ensure that our application data platform remains the best way to build the applications of today and tomorrow. We will expand and evolve our go-to-market strategy to drive frictionless adoption of our platform, no matter how aware our customers choose to consume MongoDB, and we will remain focused on our people, processes and culture to ensure that we scale to fulfill our potential. Simply put, we're committed to innovating and investing to make the most of our opportunity and maximize a long-term value. With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the fourth quarter, both fiscal financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and then finished with our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2022. First, I'll start with the fourth quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $171 million up 38% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $163.9 million up 39% year-over-year and professional services revenue is $7.1 million up 24% year-over-year. As Dev mentioned, we're very proud of our execution in this difficult and uncertain environment. In particular, we had another stronger than expected quarter in terms of closing new business. Enterprises cannot afford to delay or slowdown innovation and for that reasons, customers continue to increase their investment in our application data platform. That said, despite our strong go-to-market execution, COVID-19 continues to have an impact on our quarterly performance. Overall Atlas's strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew 66% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 49% of total revenue, compared to 41% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and 47% last quarter. During the fourth quarter, we grew our customer base by over 2,200 customers sequentially. Bring our total customer count over 24,800, which is up from over 17,000 of the year ago period, of our total customer count over 3,000 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 2,000 in the year ago period. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform, as well as self-service customers with whom we now have established a direct sales relationship. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 23,300 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 15,400 in the year ago period. It is important to keep in mind the growth that our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB, in addition to existing enterprise advanced customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 975 customers with at least $1,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 751 in the year ago period. We ended the year with 98 customers, at least $1 million in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 62 in the year ago period. As Dev highlighted the continued strong growth in customers with $1 million or more in ARR is a clear indication that we are increasingly becoming a strategic partner and a database standard for our customers. Moving down the P&L, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $123.3 million representing a gross margin of 72%, which is consistent with our last quarter and down from 74% in the year ago period. Overall, we were pleased with our gross margin performance, which is negatively impacted by Atlas becoming a bigger portion of our revenue. As you know, Atlas has lower gross margins than Enterprise Advanced because of its infrastructure component. This downward pressure has been partially offset by the greater efficiency and scale that we've been able to generate as Atlas grows. We continue to expect that we'll see some modest reduction in overall company gross margin, as Atlas continues to grow as a percentage of our revenues. Our operating loss was $16 million or negative 9% operating margin for the fourth quarter, compared to a negative 10% margin in the year ago period. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was driven primarily by our revenue outperformance. Net loss in the fourth quarter was $19.9 million, of $0.33 per share, based on 60.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.25 per share on 56.9 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $958.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was negative $18.6 million after taking into consideration approximately $2 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow is negative $20.7 million in the quarter, this compares to negative free cash flow of $10.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2022. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $167 million to $170 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $21 million to $19 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.36, based on 61.2 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year of 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $745 million to $765 million. For the full fiscal year 2022, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $84 million to $74 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.39 per share based on 62.1 million weighted average shares outstanding. Let me provide some context behind our revenue outlook. Our expectation that the COVID-19 impact will continue to impact our new business activity in the near term, but that the business conditions will slowly improve as year goes on, and as global vaccination efforts positively impact the macroeconomic environment. More specifically for Q1, we expect to see a slight sequential revenue decline as Q1 is typically a lower new business quarter than Q4. As a reminder, revenue recognition under ASC 606 for our Enterprise Advanced product disproportionate affects in quarter performance due to the upfront term license. Let me now turn to our investment framework for fiscal 2022. As Dev mentioned, we were pleased both by our strong execution and the market's receptivity to our platform. We therefore continue to believe that the right posture is to invest for the long-term to pursue our market opportunity. In fiscal 2022, we'll continue funding high priority areas across the organization. First, we'll continue with robust R&D investments to further advance the breadth and depth of our application data platform. Second, we'll continue growing our sales capacity globally. We remain fractionally penetrated relative to the size of our opportunity. Given another year of strong productivity, we believe that the primary constraint of our productive capacity growth is how quickly we can effectively scale our operations. Third, we will continue investing as appropriate to ensure that we are efficiently scaling organization systems and processes as we pursue our long-term opportunity. Finally, it is worth noting that our COVID 19 outlook has implications for our OpEx as well as our revenues. As life slowly normalizes throughout fiscal 2022, we expect to incur incremental expenses, most notably related to our offices, travel and in-person events. Our current expectation is it will incur approximately $20 million to $25 million of incremental expense in this area compared to fiscal 2021, with most of that impact occurring in the second half of the year. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent fourth quarter results and full fiscal 2021 results, despite operating in an unprecedented environment. Our focus on executing against our product roadmap and expanding our go-to-market reach is driving high levels of growth in sale. And we were seeing attractive returns on those investments. The success that we were having establishing ourselves as the world's preeminent application data platform positions us for continued long-term success. With that, we'd like to open up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on a great fiscal year 2021 and a strong Q4, it was really great to see the Atlas accelerating the 66% growth. And so maybe the first question is to start on Atlas. Dev, could you sort of give us some of the trends you're seeing within Atlas, as it relates to growth coming from app modernization or relational \u2013 the relational displacements versus net new, how that sort of mix play out in Q4 versus what you've seen on for the balance of the year?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So Sanjit, I'd say a couple things. One, I would say that obviously, there's a big secular trend about the move to the cloud, but what's happening is that people are recognizing that just lift and shift is not the right approach and that I would more frame it as lifts and transform. And that's where MongoDB comes in. People recognize the benefits of our flexible data model through the document model. They recognize the benefits of running and using multiple use cases because of the versatility of the document model. They also appreciate the scalability and performance of our distributed architecture and even more pronounced because Atlas basically automates all that. What we're also seeing a new trend is the increasing importance of multi-cloud and customers are more and more interested in multi-cloud and being able to deliver a multi-cloud solution for either resiliency or other reasons. And so we see customers building new apps on Atlas and re-platforming existing apps on Atlas. So we've seen trends across the board making Atlas a very attractive definition for app development.\nSanjit Singh: That's really helpful. And then that's my follow-up, as I think about guidance for fiscal year 2022 and some of the things that could come online, I want to just get a status update on partners and which ones you think are the most material in terms of contributing to growth and which ones are more earlier stage as it relates to, you just sign on with Tencent, Alibaba, as couple of years in the making a closer relationship with Google, if you just sort of like walk through some of the progress with the strategic partners and which one you think is that more than material scale on that this juncture?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, I start with the hyperscale vendors. First, the U.S.-based ones, we have deep relationships with all three and we're doing well across the board. I think it's coming down to, one, MongoDB is incredibly popular on all the three platforms. Two, I think customers can separate the difference between some of the ambulation offerings versus MongoDB Atlas. Three, I think people are getting more and more comfortable with the \u2013 our document architecture and how versatile it is and how it really enables innovation to happen very, very quickly. And I would say that so that \u2013 so we're partnering a lot in the field with the cloud vendors where the Tencent relationship is fairly new. So I think that's going to take a little bit of time for it to take home. But the fact that we now have relationships in both Alibaba and Tencent and one of the largest markets in the world, we feel really good about. And then I would say the other partnerships in terms of the global systems integrators are also paving the way. We're seeing a lot of activity as they're bringing us into deals or we're using them or customers are using them as to augment their development capacity. And we're also working with some boutique asides. We have some real domain expertise for MongoDB to help accelerate customers\u2019 time to market for their needs. And so I would say, we're seeing \u2013 there's not one partner that's, I would say moving the needle more than anyone else. We're basically seeing broad-based help across the board, across our partnerships.\nSanjit Singh: Appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: And our question will come from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Maybe sticking with Atlas, the sequential acceleration in the business is pretty impressive even with acceleration of digital transformation out there. Were there any one-time items that positively impacted the quarter? Is this just normal usage trends?\nDev Ittycheria: No, I would describe it. It was a good quarter, Brad. Thanks for calling that out. We've talked about sort of some of the trends that we were seeing during COVID. We mentioned in Q3 that the cohorts were back to sort of pre-COVID expansion levels. We've continued to see that. And so I think there's nothing particularly worth calling out one-time. There are obviously always like one-time puts and takes in any quarter, but nothing sort of outside of the normal. It was a good quarter across the board, but particularly within Atlas, within self-serve, we saw some nice expansion, but overall, just really strong and not a lot of businesses that north of $300 million run rates growing north of 60%.\nBrad Reback: Impressive. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you, and good afternoon. I guess I wanted to talk a little bit about new customer lands. If I look at the last two quarters, I think you've added more customers in the last six months than you added all of last year, as you think about the momentum here, this a signal of just kind of broader Mongo to be brand awareness. Is this a sign that maybe there's an industry acceleration and the appetite to build new apps? And then just if you could just share, is the profile of new customers changing or is it still predominantly being led by developers? Any color that'd be helpful.\nDev Ittycheria: Right. So I mean I would say, it's \u2013 there's a few factors at play. One, I think it's become clear to everyone that MongoDB is a very viable, mission critical platform in contrast to and as a viable alternative to relational databases. And frankly, we don't hear anyone in our customer base is talking about growing the SQL server, Oracle or DB2 estates. So people are definitely moving off their legacy platforms. And then when they think about building on a new platform, they quickly understand the versatility and the flexibility of the document model. They also appreciate the performance and scalability of our architecture. And what's interesting now is, as I mentioned earlier, multi-cloud has become an increasingly important consideration. Some customers want a cloud provider resiliency in a single country where only \u2013 collaborator only has one region. Another reason for multi-cloud is that customers are often maybe acquire other companies. And so they start, beginning question is, should I put everything in one cloud? And then the third reason is that they want to take advantage of different capabilities offered by different cloud providers. And so we see a whole host of reasons why we're acquiring new customers. And I would say, a lot of it's just a function of MongoDB just emerging as truly the pre-eminent application data platform.\nMichael Gordon: Maybe just quickly, I'd add onto that to the second part of your question, Brent. Clearly, large market and we're early on in their penetration. So that's great to see. In terms of the customers and the customers that we're adding here and sort of how do they compare to historic customers? Maybe I'll just say a couple of quick things, first of all, obviously it's early, but we do have a couple quarters of data and I'd say the initial signs are certainly encouraging. Obviously, ultimately, the long-term quality will depend on the expansion over multiple years. But so far what we're seeing on an apples-to-apples basis is the cohorts are broadly in line from sizing growth characteristics versus the prior cohorts. I'd say, they're probably two important mix components to keep in mind though. The first is that some of the go-to-market optimizations that we've talked about in the last couple of calls that we've made \u2013 sort of made \u2013 reduce the friction, made it easier for customers to come on board, and disproportionately helped the mid-market, and the mid-market customer spend meaningful less on average than an enterprise customer, so just to keep that in mind. And then secondly some of the acceleration in direct sales customers are customers who are previously self-serve, who we've gotten better at identifying the signals for those \u2013 for whom we'd benefit from a direct relationship with. And that sort of is accretive to their future growth, but that's not net revenue change in the period. And that's not \u2013 that's shifting channels if you will, in terms of customer accounts. So those are probably two important mix things to keep in mind as you're kind of looking at or trying to extrapolate.\nBrent Bracelin: Super helpful there. I think even my dog got a little excited by. Thanks for the color.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Brent.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Mohit Gogia with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMohit Gogia: Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the really strong Q4. I just want to stay on that topic. So the land and expand motion wipes. So we saw the land motion really do well despite the pandemic and you discussed the drivers there. But if I look at the expansion rate and the expand motion looking ahead to fiscal quarter two, can you help us understand as to wave like \u2013 how do you think about, so obviously we are hopefully putting COVID in the background here, right? So and one of the headwinds on the business would having an expansion site, where maybe some applications that were in the pipeline would be put on hold, right? So I'm just curious as to how you're thinking about that trajectory of the expansion rate for fiscal 2022 and how have you factored that into guidance. And then I have another follow-up question. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Mohit, what I would say is, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, even in a large accounts, we still believe we have a very small percentage of their data \u2013 total database spend. Now I do want to make clear, MongoDB is not a product that you just buy and then start using. You have to actually build an application on top of it. So this is a certain rate and pace of app development, whether you're building new applications or replatforming existing applications. But what we've seen and as we mentioned, once we get into an account, we find it reasonably, easy to expand into adjacent opportunities. And the adjacent opportunities tend to be bigger than the initial deal. And so we don't see that they'll \u2013 we don't expect to be a meaningful change in that this coming year. And while the world may start opening up and people may be potentially building new apps faster. We think that that can only help our business, but right now we feel that we're really well positioned for the operations that we've already uncovered in these new customers. And we're still continuing to seek new customers going to this year, so that we continue to build a healthy pipeline of a large customer base.\nMohit Gogia: Thank you. And my follow-up question is on the go-to-market investment sides. So, I mean, this is typically the time of the year when companies sort of like evaluate all their sales motions and sales structures spend looking ahead. So as you scale the business, right, so obviously, very healthy growth at scale. As you scale, and as you make these go-to-market investments, is there anything you should be aware in terms of sales structure changes or anything of that sort? That's just on my end. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So I think we've talked about it in previous calls, but we've been very pleased with the success we've been seeing with our execution through our sales channels. And so we're essentially doubling down on what we did this past year, the sales organization and our marketing organization executed really, really well. And that \u2013 and we're also seeing benefits of a flywheel effect between our self-serve channel and on our sales channel. As Michael mentioned, our sales authorization is getting better and better at understanding product usage signals to figure out which customers would benefit from having a more direct relationship. And the self-serve channel becomes a very easy channel for us to acquire new customers. So that's paying dividends as well. So I think you'll see us continue to refine the model, but you're not going to see any major changes. We'll probably get more sophisticated around segmenting certain parts of the markets. And the certain parts of the market that we still have a very poor geographic coverage. They'll see us expand our sales reach in markets where we feel like that could benefit from adding more people in the region.\nMohit Gogia: Thanks guys.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your investing in FY2022. Obviously, the guidance implies that you're continuing to spend a lot on growing the business in FY2022. So curious where the biggest priorities areas are for you and then within the direct sales side, are you kind of investing more in the mid-market side, where you've may seen really nice kind of net adds there? Or is it more on the enterprise? Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So we see the bulk of investments going in two areas, one in product and the other is and go-to-market. Obviously, on the product side, we're really excited about the market opportunity we're going after. The market just seems to be bigger and bigger. The more we spent time in it. And we're clearly getting a lot of traction and our customers are asking for more and more capabilities. We talked about some of the new products, we launched last summer they're starting to get very healthy traction. And so that gives us even more confidence about other things that we want to build based on customer feedback, as well as our own strategic insight in terms of what we think the market needs. So and by the way, I think we have a first-class engineering and product organization. So it makes that decision that much easier. The second point, I'd make is to the earlier question, we've seen a lot of success in sales. So the classic thing is when you see success, you continue to invest. Our performance is broad-based and we're seeing performance \u2013 great performance, both in through our field organization, as well as our inside sales team. And you're going to see us invest aggressively in both areas. I think you can see us, as I said probably do a little bit more refinement of how we go-to-market a little bit more segmentation across the market, a little bit more focused on hunting versus farming. Perhaps even a little bit more focused in the mid market to what you implied. But it's all about just going out and capturing more of the market because the market is so large and leveraging all the lessons we learned so far in terms of how we build our sales processes, how we generate pipeline and how we prosecute deals.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up maybe for Michael, I wanted to kind of clarify one of the dynamics you referenced in terms of the Atlas \u2013 of the Atlas cohorts. So I think it's been about a year since you made the go-to-market changes to kind of reduce the friction in terms of new customers coming on board with a lower or no commit. But maybe just in \u2013 now that you look back at the past year, like, how has those spending levels trended relative to kind of the old approach, I think you might have noted that the spending levels were kind of consistent with the so-called old approach, but just wanted to clarify that. Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Absolutely. Yes. So I think it's important to look at sort of like kind customers. And so if you look meeting sort of a mid market versus an enterprise customer or something like that as opposed to comparing everyone to the average, because mixes do matter here. But yes, that's exactly right. If you look sort of like a kind of apples-to-apples basis, we're seeing fairly comfortable behavior from cohorts in terms of size and growth rates and expansion rates et cetera, et cetera. Obviously, we don't have years and years of data. So we'll have to see that, but certainly the initial signs are encouraging and consistent with the theories and the initial observations.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nRishi Jaluria: Dev and Michael, thanks so much for taking my questions and nice to see continued strong execution throughout the end of the year. Wanted to maybe start, Dev, with a comment that you made in your prepared remarks, which is, just how under-penetrated you are even in the existing customer base. What is it going to take to grow that footprint within the existing customers? Is that just a matter of capturing new workloads and new apps and there\u2019s just a natural mix that happens over time? Or is there anything that you\u2019re doing and can continue to do to accelerate the migrations and as you talked about the lift and transform strategy and then I\u2019ve got a follow-up.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So what I was trying to convey in my prepared remarks is that growing an account takes time, you go through a set of stages. The first stage is landing a deal. The second stage is using the early success of your initial when to expand into adjacent opportunities. And then as you get promulgated across the organization, you end up becoming declared a standard. What that really implies is when you become a standard, is that you\u2019re essentially giving the development teams free reign to use MongoDB for pretty much any use case. And so it becomes that much easier for the organization to deploy new workloads of MongoDB. But the act of actually building and writing an app and then running it, whether it\u2019s on-premise or in the cloud still takes time. It\u2019s not like these apps magically create themselves. So there\u2019s still, obviously some effort required from the development teams to build those applications. So there\u2019s a certain rate and pace by which you can expand the workloads on your platform. But by definition, as we grow, as people get more and more comfortable using MongoDB, as we have more and more proof points now with nearly 25,000 customers, we have proof points almost across every potential use case, every industry, every geography and so it gives customers a lot of confidence to better MongoDB. And so that becomes largely that much easier to win the next incremental workload. And so, but it does take some time. It\u2019s not like magically, you can replatform 1000 apps from MongoDB overnight.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Dev, thanks that\u2019s super helpful. And then I wanted to maybe ask a little bit about future opportunities for M&A. Obviously, Realm seems to be, have been a pretty successful product and technological expansion. Given the kind of cast balance you have and the dry powder you have to put to work, where should we be thinking about future opportunities for you to do more of those smaller technological acquisitions and expand the platform? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Given the nature of our application data platform, you typically will not see us do some major acquisition and kind of try and bolt-on some other solution onto our platform that becomes very hard to do. If you look at our history, what we have done is made some surgical acquisitions. You mentioned Realm, earlier we made an acquisition of WiredTiger, which really allowed us to deliver on some enhanced performance capabilities around right intensive use cases announced the underlying storage engine for our core database server. We also did an acquisition of mLab, which was kind of accelerated expansion into offering a MongoDB as a service offering. But there were I would say more surgical acquisitions. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see us go do some massive mega acquisition, but we will obviously, whenever if you see something that potentially allows us to accelerate our product roadmap in a certain way, I think you\u2019re right. We have the resources to go do those kinds of things, and we\u2019re constantly kind of talking to people in the marketplace.\nUnidentified Analyst: Wonderful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Good numbers guys. A couple for me, Dev, maybe I want to kind of double-click on Atlas a little bit and get a better understanding of the overlap between customer usage and your large customers. When you talk about the $1 million and $100,000 customers, what\u2019s the penetration of Atlas into those customers right now? And how do I think about the size of the Atlas deployments?\nDev Ittycheria: I would say a big percentage of our seven-figure accounts are already using Atlas, but there\u2019s definitely some seven-figure customers who are EA only. So there\u2019s a mix, but there\u2019s a broader base of Atlas customers. And as I said, we have a lot of customers who are moving more slowly to the cloud, but view MongoDB as a very attractive platform because they will never have to rewrite the application as they transitioned from on-prem to the cloud or from one cloud provider to another cloud provider, which makes it a very attractive future-proof platform for customers.\nIttai Kidron: Got it. And then Michael, just a follow-up for you. You\u2019ve talked about expansion rates kind of coming back to normal, but you also talked about COVID headwinds that still remain. So maybe you can fine tune for us exactly where and how do you still see impact from COVID on your business?\nMichael Gordon: Yes, sure, absolutely. I think the key thing in terms of COVID impact is just the new business environment. I think what we\u2019ve seen in terms of the Atlas cohorts is a resumption of the pre-COVID cohort behavior. So it\u2019s really more about new business and it\u2019s very consistent with what we talked about last quarter, which has sort of bigger deals, multi-year deals, getting extra scrutiny, that kind of stuff. The overall, just uncertainty of the background virus, does have an impact on new business.\nIttai Kidron: Okay. Well, you just had like great two record breaking quarters in new add, so I\u2019m just trying to understand it\u2019s just a number of new adds or they just start with a smaller side.\nMichael Gordon: I think as it relates to COVID specific, I think it\u2019s more about magnitude than quantity of account.\nIttai Kidron: Okay. Very good. Good luck guys. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jack Andrews with Needham. Please go ahead.\nJack Andrews: Thanks for taking my question. I want to see if you can provide an update in terms of some adoption trends you\u2019re seeing for your newer products, like Search and Data Lake. And how should we be thinking about any uplift in consumption rates for customers who are adopting these types of products?\nDev Ittycheria: Right. So again, just as a reminder for people, we had three products last summer Realm, Atlas, Data Lake, and Search. And let me go one by one. So we\u2019ve seen solid reception of Realm, especially now with the availability of Realm Sync, which really enables developers to build very sophisticated mobile applications and synchronize the data at the edge with data at the core that saves developers an enormous amount of time and effort. And it\u2019s something that\u2019s quite complicated. And so we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest there. And so we\u2019re quite pleased with the traction. I would say with Atlas Data Lake, one of the most popular use cases is data tiering, allowing customers to manage large volumes of data while retaining the ability to access and query that data. And emerging use cases, being able to do federated queries using ADL as a mechanism to transform data within our platform and then create across multiple databases and storage locations. And so that\u2019s really exciting. And then on Search, we\u2019ve made some enhancements, including a visual index builder, which has really accelerated adoption. And what we\u2019re seeing is customers like the fact that they don\u2019t have to use solar or elastic in conjunction with MongoDB, but that they can do everything in MongoDB. It really simplifies their life and their data architecture. And so we\u2019re quite excited about the traction of all three products. I do want to remind everyone that the revenue does not show up as individual skews, but as Atlas revenue and these products do have multi-year journeys and you\u2019ll see us continue to refine and enhance these products. And we expect them to have a strong ROI over the next coming years.\nJack Andrews: Great. Thanks and congratulations on the results.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nFred Havemeyer: Hey, thank you very much for this. I\u2019d like to ask during some of our work we\u2019ve been picking up that ISVs are incrementally interested in MongoDB Atlas, and that we\u2019ve seen a couple just in our work also scaling on top of it. So I would like to ask generally speaking, how do you see the ISV ecosystem around MongoDB and perhaps specifically MongoDB Atlas evolving. And where do you think that this stands in terms of maturity today?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, that\u2019s a great question. So we\u2019ve had ISVs since the early days of MongoDB build \u2013 use MongoDB as the underlying data store for their product. And obviously the early days is more front end applications, what\u2019s happening now is we\u2019re starting to see the vertical specific deepened our back office ISVs, financial services, insurance in telecom, et cetera, who are looking to replatform, obviously customer buying behaviors change. People want to consume software as a service. Those ISVs also want to stop paying the Oracle tax. And also ISVs are quite attracted by the flexibility and agility of the document model, as well as the scalability of our architecture. So it allows them to serve global needs quite easily. And so we\u2019ve actually have a small team focused on the ISVs. And there, it\u2019s almost like a two-step process where we are essentially selling to the CTOs, the VP product, sometimes the CEO, depending on the size of the ISV and then helping them, build or replatform their product on MongoDB, and then helping them generate the first set of customers. And I should also add that ISVs typically don\u2019t want to use a cloud proprietary database because by definition, that will limited them to only one cloud and customers do care about multi-cloud. And so the fact that MongoDB runs across all the major cloud vendors and the fact that they can offer capabilities in a multi-cloud environment makes MongoDB, even that much more attractive.\nFred Havemeyer: Thank you for that. And then I\u2019d like to follow up, I think touching on something you were also referencing in some of your prepared remarks around the multi-cloud cluster capabilities on MongoDB Atlas. Now it\u2019s something that is fairly to their unique in the database as a service marketplace to have essentially like one click multi-cloud deployments. So I\u2019m curious, you referenced one specific customer, but I\u2019m wondering if you could more broadly speak about how your customers are approaching the multi-cloud MongoDB Atlas capability and whether that\u2019s something that is bringing more customers to the table, or perhaps also bringing more of your enterprise customers also back in to speak to you about what Atlas can do.\nDev Ittycheria: Right. So in concept, platform, independence is something that customers care a lot about. In reality, the onus was on the customer to try and figure out how to make it work. They had to figure out how to extract all the differences between the different cloud providers, deal with all the integrations, deal with different authentication schemes and so on and so forth that made it quite challenging for customers to do it themselves. What MongoDB Atlas does is actually make that very easy. So when we show customers, we do demos for customers and show them that literally with a few clicks and a few minutes, they can provision clusters across two different cloud providers and do it very, very easily. They\u2019re shocked. And because they know how much effort it would take them to try and do that themselves. So the other point I would make, which is what I said in the prepared remarks. We increasingly find senior level stakeholders, they care a lot about platform independence not just for lock-in, but they want for resiliency. They want to be able to take advantage of different capabilities on different cloud providers. And so being able to use MongoDB to do that becomes very, very attractive. And so you\u2019re right, it is definitely bringing more enterprises to look at us as a very viable mission critical platform.\nFred Havemeyer: Great. Thank you for the color. I appreciate it.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Fred.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nJoey Marincek: Great. Thank you so much. This is Joey Marincek on for Pat. Just two from our end. So first, on those large customers, particularly the ones spending over $1 million, I\u2019m just wondering, how do those conversations evolve over time? And then secondly, how are you guys thinking about return to work? You view MangoDB as a work from home company, long-term. Thank you guys.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. So with regard to large customers most of our large customers start as small customers. They could be 500 or 600 customers, and then they evolve into seven-figure customers. On the rare occasion, we might have a customer that quickly becomes a seven-figure customer. And that\u2019s typically because they have one use case or one workload that grows very, very fast. But in most situations it\u2019s basically customers adding more workloads to the MongoDB platform. And so obviously it takes some time. As you said, once you get in and win a deal, depending on the size of the account, it could be multiple years as we are in the expansion phase of winning more and more business. And at some point in time, when you start talking to senior level stakeholders, they see how popular we are with their developers, they see how widely spread we are across the organization, and they want to build a more strategic relationship. And for us, we want to be declared a standard where by definition, a developer doesn\u2019t have to seek permission to use MongoDB. So it\u2019s really a function of leveraging our successes early on, proving out the scalability and flexibility of our platform. And then, really showing them that MongoDB can be truly a versatile application data platform, not just for on-premise but across all the major cloud providers as well. And then in terms of your second question, return to work. Yes, I mean, obviously today we\u2019re all working from home. What we have told our employees that we don\u2019t expect to be 100% remote organization. We do believe that there\u2019s value in our people coming together. There\u2019s value in coming together for team meetings, for planning sessions for the social benefit of connecting with people. We also believe that employees earlier in their career will benefit from more direct mentorship from the managers and more of a direct contact basis versus over some sort of remote environment. But we also believe that we\u2019ve learned a lot of lessons that you can run a business of our scale and size remotely. And so we\u2019re not going to force everyone to come back to the office. We\u2019re going to re-imagine our offices and create more multi-tenant environments where people can have a shared desk and come in maybe two, three days a week. Some people may have work remotely for 80%, 90% of time and maybe come to the office once in a while for key meetings. And so this also gives us more flexibility to look for talent and markets that we may naturally not have considered, because we now have seen how working remotely can be quite effective. And so we\u2019ll be more aggressive in sourcing talent from markets that we typically did not seek in the past.\nJoey Marincek: Super helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And our next question will comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBilly Fitzsimmons: Hey guys, this is Billy Fitzsimmons on for Jason Ader. Congrats on the solid quarter. Over the last several quarters, you\u2019ve expanded both new features and new add-on products, such as Realm, Realm Sync, Data Lake, Charts, multi-cloud functionality. I guess, are any of these standing out over others in terms of customer adoption or in terms of generating customer excitement? And then how would you think customer conversations have kind of evolved at recent quarters versus a year or two ago, both in regards to these new features or just how customer demand has changed recent quarters?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. I think what you should think about these new capabilities is really adding to the richness and competitive and comparative advantage of our platform versus like trying to be standalone products that we just position in markets independently. And so what it means is that people can run more and more use cases in MongoDB have a much more simplified architecture, rather than having a bunch of bespoke, implementations for every use case that they potentially want to implement. They can obviously create that data much more easily, manage their infrastructure more easily. The developers only have one interface to learn and essentially they can run those workloads anywhere. They can run on-premise as well as they can run it on any cloud or across clouds. So that\u2019s the real benefit of the expanding capabilities that we\u2019re adding. And we\u2019re seeing traction across the board. So I would say, again, all these products where at G8 last summer, we\u2019re still in the early days. But we\u2019re really excited and really proving out the platform strategy. And as we noted that we already have some nice set of customers are using the new products and they\u2019re very sophisticated customers as well. So we feel good about the reaction we\u2019re getting.\nBilly Fitzsimmons: Thanks, Dev, appreciate it.\nOperator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Dev Ittycheria for any closing remarks.\nDev Ittycheria: Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. I just want to make kind of summary, a couple of points. One, I think it\u2019s clear that enterprises everywhere are feeling an extraordinary sense of urgency to reinvent themselves and that to do that using software and data. Second, we\u2019re seeing great success in building more strategic partnerships with our customers as evidenced by the growth of our six and seven-figure accounts. And lastly, I would say that the accelerating secular trends and our track record of success give us increased conviction to aggressively invest in order to maximize our long-term potential. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Thank you for joining us. And we look forward to speak to you soon. Take care.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. At this time, you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the fourth quarter, both fiscal financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and then finished with our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2022. First, I'll start with the fourth quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $171 million up 38% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $163.9 million up 39% year-over-year and professional services revenue is $7.1 million up 24% year-over-year. As Dev mentioned, we're very proud of our execution in this difficult and uncertain environment. In particular, we had another stronger than expected quarter in terms of closing new business. Enterprises cannot afford to delay or slowdown innovation and for that reasons, customers continue to increase their investment in our application data platform. That said, despite our strong go-to-market execution, COVID-19 continues to have an impact on our quarterly performance. Overall Atlas's strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew 66% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 49% of total revenue, compared to 41% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and 47% last quarter. During the fourth quarter, we grew our customer base by over 2,200 customers sequentially. Bring our total customer count over 24,800, which is up from over 17,000 of the year ago period, of our total customer count over 3,000 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 2,000 in the year ago period. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform, as well as self-service customers with whom we now have established a direct sales relationship. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 23,300 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 15,400 in the year ago period. It is important to keep in mind the growth that our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB, in addition to existing enterprise advanced customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 975 customers with at least $1,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 751 in the year ago period. We ended the year with 98 customers, at least $1 million in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 62 in the year ago period. As Dev highlighted the continued strong growth in customers with $1 million or more in ARR is a clear indication that we are increasingly becoming a strategic partner and a database standard for our customers. Moving down the P&L, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $123.3 million representing a gross margin of 72%, which is consistent with our last quarter and down from 74% in the year ago period. Overall, we were pleased with our gross margin performance, which is negatively impacted by Atlas becoming a bigger portion of our revenue. As you know, Atlas has lower gross margins than Enterprise Advanced because of its infrastructure component. This downward pressure has been partially offset by the greater efficiency and scale that we've been able to generate as Atlas grows. We continue to expect that we'll see some modest reduction in overall company gross margin, as Atlas continues to grow as a percentage of our revenues. Our operating loss was $16 million or negative 9% operating margin for the fourth quarter, compared to a negative 10% margin in the year ago period. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was driven primarily by our revenue outperformance. Net loss in the fourth quarter was $19.9 million, of $0.33 per share, based on 60.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.25 per share on 56.9 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $958.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was negative $18.6 million after taking into consideration approximately $2 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow is negative $20.7 million in the quarter, this compares to negative free cash flow of $10.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2022. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $167 million to $170 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $21 million to $19 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.36, based on 61.2 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year of 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $745 million to $765 million. For the full fiscal year 2022, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $84 million to $74 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.39 per share based on 62.1 million weighted average shares outstanding. Let me provide some context behind our revenue outlook. Our expectation that the COVID-19 impact will continue to impact our new business activity in the near term, but that the business conditions will slowly improve as year goes on, and as global vaccination efforts positively impact the macroeconomic environment. More specifically for Q1, we expect to see a slight sequential revenue decline as Q1 is typically a lower new business quarter than Q4. As a reminder, revenue recognition under ASC 606 for our Enterprise Advanced product disproportionate affects in quarter performance due to the upfront term license. Let me now turn to our investment framework for fiscal 2022. As Dev mentioned, we were pleased both by our strong execution and the market's receptivity to our platform. We therefore continue to believe that the right posture is to invest for the long-term to pursue our market opportunity. In fiscal 2022, we'll continue funding high priority areas across the organization. First, we'll continue with robust R&D investments to further advance the breadth and depth of our application data platform. Second, we'll continue growing our sales capacity globally. We remain fractionally penetrated relative to the size of our opportunity. Given another year of strong productivity, we believe that the primary constraint of our productive capacity growth is how quickly we can effectively scale our operations. Third, we will continue investing as appropriate to ensure that we are efficiently scaling organization systems and processes as we pursue our long-term opportunity. Finally, it is worth noting that our COVID 19 outlook has implications for our OpEx as well as our revenues. As life slowly normalizes throughout fiscal 2022, we expect to incur incremental expenses, most notably related to our offices, travel and in-person events. Our current expectation is it will incur approximately $20 million to $25 million of incremental expense in this area compared to fiscal 2021, with most of that impact occurring in the second half of the year. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent fourth quarter results and full fiscal 2021 results, despite operating in an unprecedented environment. Our focus on executing against our product roadmap and expanding our go-to-market reach is driving high levels of growth in sale. And we were seeing attractive returns on those investments. The success that we were having establishing ourselves as the world's preeminent application data platform positions us for continued long-term success. With that, we'd like to open up to questions. Operator? Maybe just quickly, I'd add onto that to the second part of your question, Brent. Clearly, large market and we're early on in their penetration. So that's great to see. In terms of the customers and the customers that we're adding here and sort of how do they compare to historic customers? Maybe I'll just say a couple of quick things, first of all, obviously it's early, but we do have a couple quarters of data and I'd say the initial signs are certainly encouraging. Obviously, ultimately, the long-term quality will depend on the expansion over multiple years. But so far what we're seeing on an apples-to-apples basis is the cohorts are broadly in line from sizing growth characteristics versus the prior cohorts. I'd say, they're probably two important mix components to keep in mind though. The first is that some of the go-to-market optimizations that we've talked about in the last couple of calls that we've made \u2013 sort of made \u2013 reduce the friction, made it easier for customers to come on board, and disproportionately helped the mid-market, and the mid-market customer spend meaningful less on average than an enterprise customer, so just to keep that in mind. And then secondly some of the acceleration in direct sales customers are customers who are previously self-serve, who we've gotten better at identifying the signals for those \u2013 for whom we'd benefit from a direct relationship with. And that sort of is accretive to their future growth, but that's not net revenue change in the period. And that's not \u2013 that's shifting channels if you will, in terms of customer accounts. So those are probably two important mix things to keep in mind as you're kind of looking at or trying to extrapolate. Thanks, Brent. Absolutely. Yes. So I think it's important to look at sort of like kind customers. And so if you look meeting sort of a mid market versus an enterprise customer or something like that as opposed to comparing everyone to the average, because mixes do matter here. But yes, that's exactly right. If you look sort of like a kind of apples-to-apples basis, we're seeing fairly comfortable behavior from cohorts in terms of size and growth rates and expansion rates et cetera, et cetera. Obviously, we don't have years and years of data. So we'll have to see that, but certainly the initial signs are encouraging and consistent with the theories and the initial observations. Yes, sure, absolutely. I think the key thing in terms of COVID impact is just the new business environment. I think what we've seen in terms of the Atlas cohorts is a resumption of the pre-COVID cohort behavior. So it's really more about new business and it's very consistent with what we talked about last quarter, which has sort of bigger deals, multi-year deals, getting extra scrutiny, that kind of stuff. The overall, just uncertainty of the background virus, does have an impact on new business. I think as it relates to COVID specific, I think it's more about magnitude than quantity of account."

            "name": "Dev Ittycheria",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our fourth quarter results before giving you a company update. Looking quickly at our fourth quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $171 million, a 38% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 39% year-over-year, Atlas revenue grew 66% year-over-year and now represents 49% of revenue and we had another strong quarter of customer growth ended the quarter with over 24,800 customers. I believe we will look back at 2020 as the year that put an exclamation point on the need for businesses to reinvent themselves using software and data. As the world increasingly becomes digital first, there's no off the shelf software that organizations can buy to differentiate themselves against their competition. To be blunt, you cannot buy a competitive advantage, you have to build it yourself. And to build your differentiated future using software and data, you have to maximize the productivity of your developers. Managing data is a developer's most challenging problem and the biggest drain on their productivity. Legacy platforms are not designed for how developers think and code, nor they designed for performance and scale. This problem only gets worse at the data intensity and performance requirements of modern applications increase. Consequently, developers spend an enormous amount of time working around the limitations of existing solutions versus spending time building better applications and user experiences that drive a competitive advantage. Moving to the cloud, held out the promise of reduced complexity and improved productivity, what many early cloud adopters have learned the hard way is that moving to the cloud often exacerbates the poor state of their data infrastructure. First, companies decided to lift and shift their existing on-prem relational workloads to the cloud, replicating their on-premise problems in the cloud. As a senior IT executive and one of the world's largest asset management firms recently told us, he doesn't know of a single one of his peers who didn't come to regret the lift and shift strategy. Second, given the known limitations of relational databases, cloud providers promoted a number of other single purpose databases to address more diverse requirements, which in turn create a larger number of data stores for customers to learn, manage and integrate. This dramatically increased complexity of their data architecture. Third, cloud providers encourage customers to go all in with their proprietary offerings across the IT stack. The overwhelming number of proprietary point solutions not only slows developers down, but also deepens cloud vendor lock-in. Given the failings of existing approaches, developers and enterprises are clamoring for a modern application data platform that accelerates innovation. To be effective, a modern platform must support a broad range of use cases, meet stringent requirements for resiliency, security and scalability and provide enterprises the flexibility to run applications wherever they want. Our FY2021 results indicate that MongoDB has clearly established itself as the world's preeminent application data platform for building the applications of today and tomorrow. We are becoming a more strategic partner to customers as they increase their sense of urgency to modernize their IT stacks. In a number of our largest accounts, we've become an enterprise standard, which indicates a strategic importance and positions us to win more workloads. The journey from the first win to becoming a standard can take a number of years as we build trust with and support from a variety of different constituents within the enterprise, including C-suite.  While each customer story has its unique elements, we have observed that they tend to follow a similar path on the way to declaring MongoDB as standard. We usually land an account by identifying a specific pain point that cannot be addressed by existing technologies. In a Fortune 50 financial institution that is now a seven-figure customer, our early use cases leveraged the strength of the document model to efficiently capture a complex loan application with hundreds of entries. In the case of a global gaming leader developers first started using MongoDB for microservices that leveraged the rapid scalability of our technology. After establishing a presence with the customer, we leveraged the success of the initial workloads to expand across divisional and geographic boundaries within the account. A top 10 U.S. bank experienced a major data center outage a couple of years ago, and MongoDB outperformed all other databases in terms of performance and availability. At the time, our teams ceased on the performance of our platform to more broadly serve our customers needs, organizing teachings and hackathons with other app development teams across the company. Two years later that banks customers' website experience runs on MongoDB. And with other use cases, the bank has now an eight-figure \u2013 annual eight-figure customer. Depending on the size of the account the expansion phase can last many years. This is where we currently are with many of our customers today and it is the key driver of a consistently strong net expansion rates. Once we become widely deployed, we leverage our existing internal proof points to pursue becoming a standard for future app development. Here, we emphasize the versatility of the document model to address a wide variety of use cases, meaningfully simplifying their data architecture. Second, we illustrate the performance, security and scalability of our platform ensuring that MongoDB can be trusted for the most demanding requirements. And third, apps built on MongoDB can run on-premise on any cloud or across different cloud providers, which offers real platform independence, benefits no other alternative can provide. A CTO from a Fortune 100 business almost fell off his chair when we demonstrated how easily a customer can deploy a workload across two different cloud providers. He remarked, he was planning to have a 50 person team work on this and now one person can do this in a few hours. Platform independence is something the C-suite in particular cares a lot about. This strategy is working. We finished FY2021 with close to 1000 customers spending over a $100,000 a year on our platform and close to 100 customers who are spending an excess of $1 million a year with us. And almost 60% increase from a year ago. As excited as we are about these stats, we are only at the beginning stages of becoming an enterprise standard. Even within our largest customers, MongoDB typically represents a small fraction of their total database spend affording us the opportunity to meaningfully grow even in our biggest accounts. We also expanded our global reach through a new partnership with Tencent Cloud that allows customers to easily adopt and use MongoDB as a service across Tencent's global cloud infrastructure. With this partnership, the two largest cloud providers in China now provide authorized MongoDB managed service offerings, demonstrating both the popularity of MongoDB in one of the largest markets in the world and the strength of our intellectual property. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the fourth quarter. Acxiom part of the Interpublic Group of Companies is a customer intelligence company that provides data-driven solutions to enable the world's best marketers to understand the customers create better experiences and fuel business growth. As part of its ongoing innovation in the area of real-time decision and capabilities, Acxiom chose MongoDB Atlas, Data Lake, Realm and now Charts to be a key part of its cutting edge cloud architecture. Acxiom has now reduced this time to deploy solution for new customers from two months to less than 20 minutes. 1199 Funds is one of the largest labor management funds in the United States providing comprehensive health and retirement benefits to more than 450,000 healthcare industry workers and family members. In response to COVID-19, the company accelerated a massive cloud transformation initiative after migrating from SQL Server to MongoDB Atlas on Google Cloud, it was able to modernize its enterprise data warehouse and leverage MongoDB Realm to deliver a COVID-19 health screening app, which capped health questionnaires from nearly 3,000 employees a day. From the start of the project to the go live date, the complete solution was deployed in just three weeks. Cox Automotive has 40,000 auto dealers across five continents aspiring to bridge the gap between consumers, manufacturers, dealers and lenders at every stage of the automotive experience. In response to COVID-19 the company's Mobile Car Care division RideKleen developed a mobile platform, enabling drivers to schedule and technicians to manage and perform on-site disinfection services with PureProtect. RideKleen turned to MongoDB Realm Sync for zero latency data retrieval, offline application functionality and bi-directional syncing of data between the Realm mobile database and MongoDB Atlas. The largest department of UK government, the Department for Work and Pensions distributes welfare, pensions and child support to UK citizens. It's reformed welfare program Universal Credit faced an unprecedented test when COVID-19 caused claims to skyrocket by 10X DWP Digital chose MongoDB to underpin a secure platform and scale it services across a distributed microservices architecture to support the huge increase in demand. PicPay Brazil's largest e-wallet has over 40 million users and is accepted at over 3 million stores throughout the country. After experiencing 126% growth in 2020, the company chose MongoDB Atlas because they needed a highly scalable cloud database with real-time performance and low TCO in order to achieve its ambitious growth goals. Enterprise security features like data encryption at rest, in-transit and data locality made it easy for PicPay to comply with GDPR and FSI regulations and continue to pride a best-in-class customer experience to its growing user base. Today, more than one in 10 new apartments in the United States are built using Latch IoT products. Latch delivers a full building enterprise SaaS platform that helps owners, residents, and third-parties experience the modern building to services like Smart Access, Smart Home and Sensor Controls and Connectivity. Latch chose MongoDB Atlas for enhanced security features and the ability to move to a microservices architecture. So the company scale quickly and protect its customers' data. In summary, we had an exceptional year amidst, unprecedented disruption and uncertainty, as I think back to our earnings call a year ago at the outset of COVID-19, I can't help, but marvel, how we exceeded our own expectations despite the pandemic being longer and more severe than we could have mentioned at the time. I'm incredibly proud of how our team executed given the unforeseen challenges. The past year reaffirmed our conviction, that we are attacking an enormous market where secular wins are increasingly at our back. We have a highly differentiated value proposition and our team knows how to execute and deliver results. In FY 2022, our goals remain unchanged as we singularly focused on the opportunity ahead of us. We will continue innovating to ensure that our application data platform remains the best way to build the applications of today and tomorrow. We will expand and evolve our go-to-market strategy to drive frictionless adoption of our platform, no matter how aware our customers choose to consume MongoDB, and we will remain focused on our people, processes and culture to ensure that we scale to fulfill our potential. Simply put, we're committed to innovating and investing to make the most of our opportunity and maximize a long-term value. With that, I'll turn it over to Michael. Yes. So Sanjit, I'd say a couple things. One, I would say that obviously, there's a big secular trend about the move to the cloud, but what's happening is that people are recognizing that just lift and shift is not the right approach and that I would more frame it as lifts and transform. And that's where MongoDB comes in. People recognize the benefits of our flexible data model through the document model. They recognize the benefits of running and using multiple use cases because of the versatility of the document model. They also appreciate the scalability and performance of our distributed architecture and even more pronounced because Atlas basically automates all that. What we're also seeing a new trend is the increasing importance of multi-cloud and customers are more and more interested in multi-cloud and being able to deliver a multi-cloud solution for either resiliency or other reasons. And so we see customers building new apps on Atlas and re-platforming existing apps on Atlas. So we've seen trends across the board making Atlas a very attractive definition for app development. Well, I start with the hyperscale vendors. First, the U.S.-based ones, we have deep relationships with all three and we're doing well across the board. I think it's coming down to, one, MongoDB is incredibly popular on all the three platforms. Two, I think customers can separate the difference between some of the ambulation offerings versus MongoDB Atlas. Three, I think people are getting more and more comfortable with the \u2013 our document architecture and how versatile it is and how it really enables innovation to happen very, very quickly. And I would say that so that \u2013 so we're partnering a lot in the field with the cloud vendors where the Tencent relationship is fairly new. So I think that's going to take a little bit of time for it to take home. But the fact that we now have relationships in both Alibaba and Tencent and one of the largest markets in the world, we feel really good about. And then I would say the other partnerships in terms of the global systems integrators are also paving the way. We're seeing a lot of activity as they're bringing us into deals or we're using them or customers are using them as to augment their development capacity. And we're also working with some boutique asides. We have some real domain expertise for MongoDB to help accelerate customers' time to market for their needs. And so I would say, we're seeing \u2013 there's not one partner that's, I would say moving the needle more than anyone else. We're basically seeing broad-based help across the board, across our partnerships. No, I would describe it. It was a good quarter, Brad. Thanks for calling that out. We've talked about sort of some of the trends that we were seeing during COVID. We mentioned in Q3 that the cohorts were back to sort of pre-COVID expansion levels. We've continued to see that. And so I think there's nothing particularly worth calling out one-time. There are obviously always like one-time puts and takes in any quarter, but nothing sort of outside of the normal. It was a good quarter across the board, but particularly within Atlas, within self-serve, we saw some nice expansion, but overall, just really strong and not a lot of businesses that north of $300 million run rates growing north of 60%. Right. So I mean I would say, it's \u2013 there's a few factors at play. One, I think it's become clear to everyone that MongoDB is a very viable, mission critical platform in contrast to and as a viable alternative to relational databases. And frankly, we don't hear anyone in our customer base is talking about growing the SQL server, Oracle or DB2 estates. So people are definitely moving off their legacy platforms. And then when they think about building on a new platform, they quickly understand the versatility and the flexibility of the document model. They also appreciate the performance and scalability of our architecture. And what's interesting now is, as I mentioned earlier, multi-cloud has become an increasingly important consideration. Some customers want a cloud provider resiliency in a single country where only \u2013 collaborator only has one region. Another reason for multi-cloud is that customers are often maybe acquire other companies. And so they start, beginning question is, should I put everything in one cloud? And then the third reason is that they want to take advantage of different capabilities offered by different cloud providers. And so we see a whole host of reasons why we're acquiring new customers. And I would say, a lot of it's just a function of MongoDB just emerging as truly the pre-eminent application data platform. Yes. Mohit, what I would say is, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, even in a large accounts, we still believe we have a very small percentage of their data \u2013 total database spend. Now I do want to make clear, MongoDB is not a product that you just buy and then start using. You have to actually build an application on top of it. So this is a certain rate and pace of app development, whether you're building new applications or replatforming existing applications. But what we've seen and as we mentioned, once we get into an account, we find it reasonably, easy to expand into adjacent opportunities. And the adjacent opportunities tend to be bigger than the initial deal. And so we don't see that they'll \u2013 we don't expect to be a meaningful change in that this coming year. And while the world may start opening up and people may be potentially building new apps faster. We think that that can only help our business, but right now we feel that we're really well positioned for the operations that we've already uncovered in these new customers. And we're still continuing to seek new customers going to this year, so that we continue to build a healthy pipeline of a large customer base. Yes. So I think we've talked about it in previous calls, but we've been very pleased with the success we've been seeing with our execution through our sales channels. And so we're essentially doubling down on what we did this past year, the sales organization and our marketing organization executed really, really well. And that \u2013 and we're also seeing benefits of a flywheel effect between our self-serve channel and on our sales channel. As Michael mentioned, our sales authorization is getting better and better at understanding product usage signals to figure out which customers would benefit from having a more direct relationship. And the self-serve channel becomes a very easy channel for us to acquire new customers. So that's paying dividends as well. So I think you'll see us continue to refine the model, but you're not going to see any major changes. We'll probably get more sophisticated around segmenting certain parts of the markets. And the certain parts of the market that we still have a very poor geographic coverage. They'll see us expand our sales reach in markets where we feel like that could benefit from adding more people in the region. Thank you. Yes. So we see the bulk of investments going in two areas, one in product and the other is and go-to-market. Obviously, on the product side, we're really excited about the market opportunity we're going after. The market just seems to be bigger and bigger. The more we spent time in it. And we're clearly getting a lot of traction and our customers are asking for more and more capabilities. We talked about some of the new products, we launched last summer they're starting to get very healthy traction. And so that gives us even more confidence about other things that we want to build based on customer feedback, as well as our own strategic insight in terms of what we think the market needs. So and by the way, I think we have a first-class engineering and product organization. So it makes that decision that much easier. The second point, I'd make is to the earlier question, we've seen a lot of success in sales. So the classic thing is when you see success, you continue to invest. Our performance is broad-based and we're seeing performance \u2013 great performance, both in through our field organization, as well as our inside sales team. And you're going to see us invest aggressively in both areas. I think you can see us, as I said probably do a little bit more refinement of how we go-to-market a little bit more segmentation across the market, a little bit more focused on hunting versus farming. Perhaps even a little bit more focused in the mid market to what you implied. But it's all about just going out and capturing more of the market because the market is so large and leveraging all the lessons we learned so far in terms of how we build our sales processes, how we generate pipeline and how we prosecute deals. Yes. So what I was trying to convey in my prepared remarks is that growing an account takes time, you go through a set of stages. The first stage is landing a deal. The second stage is using the early success of your initial when to expand into adjacent opportunities. And then as you get promulgated across the organization, you end up becoming declared a standard. What that really implies is when you become a standard, is that you're essentially giving the development teams free reign to use MongoDB for pretty much any use case. And so it becomes that much easier for the organization to deploy new workloads of MongoDB. But the act of actually building and writing an app and then running it, whether it's on-premise or in the cloud still takes time. It's not like these apps magically create themselves. So there's still, obviously some effort required from the development teams to build those applications. So there's a certain rate and pace by which you can expand the workloads on your platform. But by definition, as we grow, as people get more and more comfortable using MongoDB, as we have more and more proof points now with nearly 25,000 customers, we have proof points almost across every potential use case, every industry, every geography and so it gives customers a lot of confidence to better MongoDB. And so that becomes largely that much easier to win the next incremental workload. And so, but it does take some time. It's not like magically, you can replatform 1000 apps from MongoDB overnight. Given the nature of our application data platform, you typically will not see us do some major acquisition and kind of try and bolt-on some other solution onto our platform that becomes very hard to do. If you look at our history, what we have done is made some surgical acquisitions. You mentioned Realm, earlier we made an acquisition of WiredTiger, which really allowed us to deliver on some enhanced performance capabilities around right intensive use cases announced the underlying storage engine for our core database server. We also did an acquisition of mLab, which was kind of accelerated expansion into offering a MongoDB as a service offering. But there were I would say more surgical acquisitions. I don't think you'll see us go do some massive mega acquisition, but we will obviously, whenever if you see something that potentially allows us to accelerate our product roadmap in a certain way, I think you're right. We have the resources to go do those kinds of things, and we're constantly kind of talking to people in the marketplace. I would say a big percentage of our seven-figure accounts are already using Atlas, but there's definitely some seven-figure customers who are EA only. So there's a mix, but there's a broader base of Atlas customers. And as I said, we have a lot of customers who are moving more slowly to the cloud, but view MongoDB as a very attractive platform because they will never have to rewrite the application as they transitioned from on-prem to the cloud or from one cloud provider to another cloud provider, which makes it a very attractive future-proof platform for customers. Right. So again, just as a reminder for people, we had three products last summer Realm, Atlas, Data Lake, and Search. And let me go one by one. So we've seen solid reception of Realm, especially now with the availability of Realm Sync, which really enables developers to build very sophisticated mobile applications and synchronize the data at the edge with data at the core that saves developers an enormous amount of time and effort. And it's something that's quite complicated. And so we're seeing a lot of interest there. And so we're quite pleased with the traction. I would say with Atlas Data Lake, one of the most popular use cases is data tiering, allowing customers to manage large volumes of data while retaining the ability to access and query that data. And emerging use cases, being able to do federated queries using ADL as a mechanism to transform data within our platform and then create across multiple databases and storage locations. And so that's really exciting. And then on Search, we've made some enhancements, including a visual index builder, which has really accelerated adoption. And what we're seeing is customers like the fact that they don't have to use solar or elastic in conjunction with MongoDB, but that they can do everything in MongoDB. It really simplifies their life and their data architecture. And so we're quite excited about the traction of all three products. I do want to remind everyone that the revenue does not show up as individual skews, but as Atlas revenue and these products do have multi-year journeys and you'll see us continue to refine and enhance these products. And we expect them to have a strong ROI over the next coming years. Thank you. Yes, that's a great question. So we've had ISVs since the early days of MongoDB build \u2013 use MongoDB as the underlying data store for their product. And obviously the early days is more front end applications, what's happening now is we're starting to see the vertical specific deepened our back office ISVs, financial services, insurance in telecom, et cetera, who are looking to replatform, obviously customer buying behaviors change. People want to consume software as a service. Those ISVs also want to stop paying the Oracle tax. And also ISVs are quite attracted by the flexibility and agility of the document model, as well as the scalability of our architecture. So it allows them to serve global needs quite easily. And so we've actually have a small team focused on the ISVs. And there, it's almost like a two-step process where we are essentially selling to the CTOs, the VP product, sometimes the CEO, depending on the size of the ISV and then helping them, build or replatform their product on MongoDB, and then helping them generate the first set of customers. And I should also add that ISVs typically don't want to use a cloud proprietary database because by definition, that will limited them to only one cloud and customers do care about multi-cloud. And so the fact that MongoDB runs across all the major cloud vendors and the fact that they can offer capabilities in a multi-cloud environment makes MongoDB, even that much more attractive. Right. So in concept, platform, independence is something that customers care a lot about. In reality, the onus was on the customer to try and figure out how to make it work. They had to figure out how to extract all the differences between the different cloud providers, deal with all the integrations, deal with different authentication schemes and so on and so forth that made it quite challenging for customers to do it themselves. What MongoDB Atlas does is actually make that very easy. So when we show customers, we do demos for customers and show them that literally with a few clicks and a few minutes, they can provision clusters across two different cloud providers and do it very, very easily. They're shocked. And because they know how much effort it would take them to try and do that themselves. So the other point I would make, which is what I said in the prepared remarks. We increasingly find senior level stakeholders, they care a lot about platform independence not just for lock-in, but they want for resiliency. They want to be able to take advantage of different capabilities on different cloud providers. And so being able to use MongoDB to do that becomes very, very attractive. And so you're right, it is definitely bringing more enterprises to look at us as a very viable mission critical platform. Thanks, Fred. Sure. So with regard to large customers most of our large customers start as small customers. They could be 500 or 600 customers, and then they evolve into seven-figure customers. On the rare occasion, we might have a customer that quickly becomes a seven-figure customer. And that's typically because they have one use case or one workload that grows very, very fast. But in most situations it's basically customers adding more workloads to the MongoDB platform. And so obviously it takes some time. As you said, once you get in and win a deal, depending on the size of the account, it could be multiple years as we are in the expansion phase of winning more and more business. And at some point in time, when you start talking to senior level stakeholders, they see how popular we are with their developers, they see how widely spread we are across the organization, and they want to build a more strategic relationship. And for us, we want to be declared a standard where by definition, a developer doesn't have to seek permission to use MongoDB. So it's really a function of leveraging our successes early on, proving out the scalability and flexibility of our platform. And then, really showing them that MongoDB can be truly a versatile application data platform, not just for on-premise but across all the major cloud providers as well. And then in terms of your second question, return to work. Yes, I mean, obviously today we're all working from home. What we have told our employees that we don't expect to be 100% remote organization. We do believe that there's value in our people coming together. There's value in coming together for team meetings, for planning sessions for the social benefit of connecting with people. We also believe that employees earlier in their career will benefit from more direct mentorship from the managers and more of a direct contact basis versus over some sort of remote environment. But we also believe that we've learned a lot of lessons that you can run a business of our scale and size remotely. And so we're not going to force everyone to come back to the office. We're going to re-imagine our offices and create more multi-tenant environments where people can have a shared desk and come in maybe two, three days a week. Some people may have work remotely for 80%, 90% of time and maybe come to the office once in a while for key meetings. And so this also gives us more flexibility to look for talent and markets that we may naturally not have considered, because we now have seen how working remotely can be quite effective. And so we'll be more aggressive in sourcing talent from markets that we typically did not seek in the past. Yes. I think what you should think about these new capabilities is really adding to the richness and competitive and comparative advantage of our platform versus like trying to be standalone products that we just position in markets independently. And so what it means is that people can run more and more use cases in MongoDB have a much more simplified architecture, rather than having a bunch of bespoke, implementations for every use case that they potentially want to implement. They can obviously create that data much more easily, manage their infrastructure more easily. The developers only have one interface to learn and essentially they can run those workloads anywhere. They can run on-premise as well as they can run it on any cloud or across clouds. So that's the real benefit of the expanding capabilities that we're adding. And we're seeing traction across the board. So I would say, again, all these products where at G8 last summer, we're still in the early days. But we're really excited and really proving out the platform strategy. And as we noted that we already have some nice set of customers are using the new products and they're very sophisticated customers as well. So we feel good about the reaction we're getting. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. I just want to make kind of summary, a couple of points. One, I think it's clear that enterprises everywhere are feeling an extraordinary sense of urgency to reinvent themselves and that to do that using software and data. Second, we're seeing great success in building more strategic partnerships with our customers as evidenced by the growth of our six and seven-figure accounts. And lastly, I would say that the accelerating secular trends and our track record of success give us increased conviction to aggressively invest in order to maximize our long-term potential. And that's what we're doing. Thank you for joining us. And we look forward to speak to you soon. Take care."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead.\nBrian Denyeau: Thank you, Eely [ph]. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review MongoDB's third quarter fiscal year 2021 financial results which we announced in our press release issued after the close of market today. Joining me on the call today are Dev Ittycheria, President and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements including statements related to our market opportunity and future growth, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, our financial guidance, and the anticipated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations as well as on our clients in the macroeconomic environment. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our SEC filings including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Brian and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a company update. Looking quickly at our third quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $150.8 million, a 38% year-over-year increase and above the high-end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 39% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew 61% year-over-year and now represents 47% of revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth ending the quarter with over 22,600 customers. We're very pleased by our third quarter performance against a difficult and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. We saw another record quarter of customer additions both in our direct sales and self-serve channels. As we discussed in the past, given the strong product market fit of Atlas, we decided to make a number of changes that make it easier for new customers to get on to our platform. We continued to reap the benefits of these adjustments in Q3 with record customer growth and strong net ARR expansion. On the self-serve side, our continued efforts to broaden our digital marketing funnel have resulted in over 2,000 net Atlas customer additions in Q3. As a reminder, our self-serve business is increasing not just an important revenue generator in its own right, but also a source of leads for our sales force. Strong self-serve net additions in Q3 indicates that this flywheel effect will continue in the future. I'd like to share some themes we have heard from senior level customers across a large swathe of industries and geographies. Customers are feeling more pressure than ever to innovate quickly to seize new opportunities and to respond to new threats, and 2020 has only exacerbated the need for speed meaningfully increasing the urgency to move to the cloud. When evaluating technologies, customers want solutions that provide a seamless migration path from on-premise to the cloud. They need mission-critical platforms that can massively scale and customers now recognize they have to simplify their tech stack to ensure agility and speed. Furthermore, the resiliency of the computing platforms and the ability to serve customers easily no matter where they are based has never been more important. As a result, customers are fundamentally rethinking their technology strategy and the debate is not if or when, but how to accelerate the modernization of their legacy applications as well as to build new apps to address the new business requirements. Consequently, it is clear the global pandemic is only accelerating the existing trends that are a significant catalyst for our business. These customers don't view us as just another database, but as a core platform to enable them to drive more innovation and growth for their business. Our Q3 results demonstrate that by helping our customers solve their most pressing challenges, our business continues to thrive during a challenging macro backdrop. So what is driving the success and how have we established ourselves as the leading modern general purpose database? Our differentiation comes down to three pillars. The first is technological. We believe that in the end, the best database wins. Databases are at the heart of applications and if the database is hard to use, has performance or scaling issues, the application itself will suffer and so will the business that invested in it. The foundation of our database is the document model, which maps to the way developers think and code and has proven to be the most productive way for developers to work with data. Moreover, our database was built from the ground up with a distributed architecture allowing applications to scale more easily and cost effectively while delivering outstanding performance. Our CTO, Mark Porter, has been in the database industry for over 30 years and he has tried many times in many different organizations to re-engineer relational databases into fault tolerant distributed databases. Due to the underlying limitations of the architecture of relational databases, this becomes a huge challenge to overcome. Instead, we've built a database that's incredibly easy to use, that is applicable for almost every conceivable use case, and is engineered for mission-critical workloads. A large banking customer recently remarked to us that employees steeped in decades of relational orthodoxy are at first curious about MongoDB, but within months become enthusiastic converts to the modern way of building and running applications. Our tech advantage clearly extends to the cloud. The most common go-to-market tactic cloud vendors use is lift and shift, moving on-prem relational workloads to an open source relational database service such as Postgres. After using this approach for a number of workloads, customers soon realized that the expected cost benefits from a cloud deployment are more than offset by the limitation of the underlying architectural constraints of relational databases. In other words, lift and shift is not the same as modernization and customers are increasingly coming to appreciate the distinction between the two. When it comes to customer satisfaction, we just closed the month of November with an NPS score of 74 for Atlas, a remarkably high number, particularly for our category and a clear indicator of how compelling our global cloud platform has become for our customers. We believe we have a fundamentally superior technology and customers are increasingly coming to the same conclusion. Our second pillar of differentiation is developer mind share. Over the course of time, alternative technologies have tried to replace relational databases, but they all failed because of a lack of developer adoption. The founders of MongoDB were developers themselves and intimately understood the challenges that developers faced working with relational databases, especially since a tabular approach bore little resemblance to how data is represented in application code, consequently making relational databases hard to use. Due to its ease of use and flexibility, the document model garnered incredible developer enthusiasm. By every objective measure, MongoDB is the most popular modern database in the world today. Our Community Server, the free to use product, has been downloaded over 130 million times and has been downloaded over 55 million times this year, which is more than the total number of downloads in the first 10 years of the company's history. The MongoDB community of developers is large and global and continues to grow every day. We have spent the last decade plus building that community and that is an asset that is difficult to replicate. Finally, the third pillar of competitive differentiation is increasingly structural and that is platform independence. Having a multi-cloud strategy is a strategic imperative for nearly every enterprise with 85% of enterprises today already using services from multiple cloud providers and the expectation is that this number will grow to 98% over the next three years. Not only do we provide an easy on-ramp to the cloud and run on all major cloud platforms, in the third quarter, we announced the general availability of multi-cloud clusters in Atlas, which enables customers to run an application across multiple public clouds simultaneously. With Atlas moving data, traditionally the hardest piece of an application stack to move, becomes far easier. Running an application across multiple clouds has a number of benefits. The application is more resilient as it is not subject to single-cloud outages, developers can easily leverage the unique capabilities of each cloud provider, and the applications can migrate between clouds with no downtime avoiding vendor lock in. Atlas is the first global cloud database that delivers a true multi-cloud solution. The combination of our unique value proposition and multi-faceted go-to-market model puts us in a great competitive position. We see our strong third quarter and year-to-date results in an unprecedented environment as an indication that our differentiation resonates in the marketplace. The strength in the quarter was broad based across geographies and customer segments. Our self-serve teams continue to rapidly experiment and launch programs to make it easier for customers to find and use MongoDB and our sales teams have remained disciplined about their rigorous pipeline generation and qualification process. We believe we're playing from an increasing position of strength and are well positioned to disproportionately benefit from the move to the cloud. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the third quarter. Celebrating its 100-year anniversary this year, Pitney Bowes has undergone a multi-year digital transformation resulting in a highly distributed cloud services for the mailing, shipping, and financing needs of its 750,000 plus global clients, including 90% of the Fortune 500. The global technology commerce giant recently standardized its business critical applications on MongoDB Atlas to support its 1 billion plus global e-commerce business. One of the largest telecom providers in the Middle East decided to migrate from Oracle to MongoDB to modernize its legacy mission critical customer loyalty application and deliver a more seamless experience to customers around the world. MongoDB helped the company upgrade its architecture to accommodate the huge volume of new data coming from its digital channels and increase the speed of its application release cycles by a factor of three. Anheuser-Busch InBev, home to several of the world's most recognizable beer brands, chose MongoDB Atlas as the primary database for a proprietary B2B application, BEES. The platform digitizes Anheuser-Busch's relationships with its customers offering convenience, seamless communication, and most importantly, enhanced business performance. The BEES app has been its core revenue driver since COVID-19 started and its user base increased by 40% last quarter. One of the world's largest car manufacturers expanded its usage of MongoDB Atlas to support continued modernization efforts for its North American business. The company was able to standardize its application development and accelerate time to market across all its divisions while scaling to accommodate growing demand across the United States and Canada. Current, a leading U.S. challenger bank serving the needs of people who have been overlooked by the traditional banking industry, has increased their investment in MongoDB Atlas on Google Cloud after a year of exponential growth. They chose MongoDB for our consistent data model, enterprise security with field-level encryption, and multi-document ACID transaction capabilities. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance in Q3. We are executing at a high level, acquiring new customers at a record pace, and deepening relationships with existing customers by building on our core competitive strengths of technical superiority, developer mind share, and platform independence. With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the third quarter both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $150.8 million, up 38% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $144.1 million, up 39% year-over-year and professional services was $6.7 million, up 19% year-over-year. To put our performance in the quarter into perspective, we thought it would be helpful to provide an update on how COVID-19 has impacted the growth of our business. First, let's talk about new business. Our ability to execute on new business opportunities with both new and existing customers continued to surpass our expectations in Q3 despite a difficult and uncertain macro environment. As Dev mentioned, customers are approaching digital transformation and cloud adoption with a heightened sense of urgency, which our go-to-market teams have capitalized on. I want to be clear, even though we performed better than our expectations in terms of new business, COVID-19 did have a negative impact on our quarterly performance. Second, the trend in existing Atlas customer spend has been steadily improving since the modest, but broad based slowdown we experienced in Q1 due to the impact of COVID-19. In Q3, the growth from existing Atlas customers has returned to our pre-COVID trends. Overall, Atlas' strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew over 61% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 47% of total revenue compared to 40% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and 44% last quarter. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by over 2,400 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 22,600, which is up from over 15,900 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 2,800 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,900 in the year ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 21,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 14,200 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 898 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 688 in the year ago period. The continued strong growth in customers with $100,000 or more in ARR is an indication of our success of our land and expand go-to-market strategy and the fact that we're increasingly becoming a strategic partner and a database standard for our customers. Moving down the P&L; I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $108.6 million, representing a gross margin of 72%, which is consistent with both last quarter and the year ago period. Overall, we're pleased with our gross margin performance, which reflects greater efficiency and scale in our Atlas business. However, we continue to expect that we'll see some modest reduction in overall company gross margin as Atlas continues to be a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $16 million or negative 11% operating margin for the third quarter compared to negative 13% margin in the year ago period. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was driven in part by our revenue outperformance. In addition, we had assumed a partial normalization of travel and facilities expenses due to the gradual reopening economy, but that normalization didn't occur in Q3 and doesn't seem likely in the near-term. While those pandemic related savings are benefiting our bottom line in fiscal '21, we don't expect this to be a sustained benefit. Net loss in the third quarter was $18.2 million or $0.31 per share based on 59.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.26 per share on 56.4 million shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $966.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was negative $8.1 million. After taking into consideration approximately $6.8 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $14.9 million in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $13.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year 2021. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $155 million to $157 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $23 million to $21 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.39 based on 60.2 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2021, we are increasing our revenue guidance to $574.4 million to $576.4 million. We are improving our profitability expectations and now expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $56.6 million to $54.6 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.04 based on 58.9 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our guidance incorporates an expectation that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will impact Q4 and likely continue into fiscal '22. Moreover, we believe that the recent measures implemented in Europe and the U.S. to fight the resurgence of the virus will add uncertainty and volatility to the business environment. Let me explain how this impact is captured in our business outlook. Starting with new business, well so far, we've outperformed our expectations due to strong customer engagement. We do expect to see similar headwinds to our new business activity in Q4. We also face a particularly tough year-over-year comparison in terms of new business because last Q4 was quite strong for our Enterprise Advanced product. Enterprise Advanced has a more immediate impact on revenue due to the fact that under ASC 606, we recognize the term license component upfront. Furthermore, our forecast reflects the compounding impact from the slower than historical growth from our existing Atlas customers that we experienced earlier in the year. Even though growth rates have returned to pre-COVID levels, we experienced several months of slightly lower growth that impacts the base of recurring revenue entering Q4. Lastly, customer cohort behavior and net ARR expansion rates continue to be strong despite the macro challenges as customers increase their investments in our platform. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent third quarter results. We're executing well despite operating in an unprecedented environment. We're investing in the business for the long haul and believe that we're well positioned for continued success. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, congratulations from me, a great quarter. One quick question, I see the really nice increase in new customers and congratulations, amazing what you're doing there, but I'm also then seeing a deceleration on growth on Atlas self-serves. Can you just help me understand like how this kind of links together, I assume it's a lower ASP that you are signing there, but just try to help me understand that a little bit. And then one for Michael as a follow-up, like if you think about next year and I think about kind of improvement around profitability, like how do you think about it because you had a lot of like kind of call it like one-off benefits this year with less travel, etcetera, like how should we think about modeling next year? Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Raimo, it's nice to talk you. With regards to your question on self-serve, actually, we feel really good about our self-serve business. What's happening there is that the self-serve is a great source of new customers that makes it just very easy for customers to engage with us in a very frictionless way and then quite a number of those customers end up being leads to our -- both our corporate or inside sales team as well as our field team. So that's what's happening there. It's not because we're seeing any slowdown in our self-serve business.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, I think on the second piece of the question, obviously, we'll get to our guide in fiscal '22 in the March call, but I think what we tried to be clear about is, we are definitely looking at the business from a long-term perspective and the guidance in Q4 includes pulling forward some of the hires and other investments that we would have made in fiscal '22 given that we are seeing some COVID-related savings and we talked in an earlier call about our intention and desire to reinvest those now and that continues to be the plan.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect, thank you. Congrats.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions and my congrats as well on another strong quarter. Dev, I guess my question sort of relates to the topic of machine learning and sort of the data management and data workflows supporting machine learning. There is definitely a growing ecosystem around that and in terms of the like -- in terms of the application development component where maybe there's a new generation of applications that are going to be more machine learning infused, MongoDB hasn't necessarily been a huge player in that core analytics market, but if you think about supporting this next generation of applications, what's the positioning for the document model in MongoDB specifically for this kind of next generation of applications that are emerging.\nDev Ittycheria: So one, I would tell you that we already have a number of customers who have built-in machine learning capability on top of MongoDB. So this has been happening for a number of years. So, two, the power and flexibly of the document model is even more profound as people want to do more and more sophisticated things with applications and keep in mind that MongoDB is a very scalable platform and so being able to have a platform that allows people to leverage the massive amounts of data to train the algorithms is incredibly helpful and just today, Amazon made an announcement around their SageMaker product where we were part of that announcement and our CTO, Mark Porter was quoted where we are, you know, allowing customers of SageMaker to basically leverage data sitting in MongoDB. So from an application development point of view, we're very well positioned. This is a natural path of people building more sophisticated applications and the document model is set up very nicely to help people build more and more sophisticated and complex applications just given the power of the model.\nSanjit Singh: Understood -- well, understood on the distinction there. So let's go back to the acceleration in new customers -- customer adds, it's been going on for a couple of quarters now. I think what also impresses me is the acceleration happening on the direct sales side as well. So you can sort of talk through whether it's the same sort of playbook that you're using to accelerate the self-service side and any sort of indications from these new cohorts that you're bringing on in terms of their profile. Is there any reason not to believe that these customers will expand in sort of the similar sort of trajectory as your prior cohorts before you really accelerate the initiative to increase your customer velocity?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, sure. On the direct side, we actually made a decision prior to COVID becoming front and center for all of us that we just saw last year a lot of friction where our sales people were incentivizing or trying to incentivize customers to make some sort of commitment typically at least an annual commitment because that's the way that they were paid and what we realized with a lot of these customers, sometimes these workloads were new and just didn't know what -- how much you know the kind of resources they would need on Atlas. They just -- didn't -- the friction of getting the approvals to sign a longer-term commitment was that much longer and they liked the flexibility of being able to basically just start using Atlas directly. And so we encouraged -- we saw the strong product market fit of Atlas and once people started using Atlas, the growth was quite profound and so we said, why don't we take away that friction. So, we changed the comp plans for this fiscal year to encourage our sales people to sign up customers more quickly and that has paid huge dividends. It's allowed us to engage customers more quickly and allowed us to acquire a lot more new customers.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. Appreciate it. Congrats, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon. One quick one for you, Dev and one for Michael. I mean, Dev, what type of customer cohort does multi-cloud functionality appeal the most to. Is it the start-ups you think or are there some large enterprises that have appeal there. And then for Michael, EA looked like it was a little stronger than we had expected. Was there a federal tailwind this quarter or were there other factors that kind of drove upside in EA? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So Brent, on the multi-cloud clusters, it actually can -- it just really depends on the sophistication of the organization and how broad a user base and customer base they are going after. For example, we already have customers for example in Canada who are trying to serve the Canadian market and are running their application across different cloud providers all in Canada because they want to leverage the reach -- the broad reach of being able to leverage all three cloud providers and they also wanted to have the benefits of resiliency in case one cloud provider goes down and there were some high profile outages right before Thanksgiving. They don't have to worry about their application going down, and that is, I wouldn't say is one of the -- is not a very large customer. Then, on the other hand, you could also have large enterprises who increasingly want to leverage the different capabilities of the different cloud providers. Each cloud provider is differentiating themselves across different dimensions of capabilities and so being able to do that reach. Again, some cloud providers have more presence in certain markets than others do and also just keeping the vendors honest is something that plays well especially with senior level decision makers who've lived the movie before about being held hostage by particular vendor. So it really ranges depending on the organization, but we think it's very applicable for very sophisticated early-stage companies as well as large enterprises.\nBrent Bracelin: Very interesting. And then, Michael on EA, any color there?\nMichael Gordon: Yes, so just quickly. So, not a Fed -- push or Fed impact. EA continues to be an important leg of the growth stool. I certainly understand that Atlas obviously steals a lot of limelight occasionally but EA continues to be quite important and relevant. It's very much a customer choice situation and we're just trying to make it easy for them to consume some MongoDB wherever they are vis-\u00e0-vis their cloud posture. Obviously, there'll be variability as we've talked about on EA given 606. I would say there's also variability kind of quarter-to-quarter as we've talked about in terms of relational migrations, but as you heard from Dev in the prepared remarks and some of the case studies, it was a good quarter from that perspective as well. So generally just good broad-based participation.\nBrent Bracelin: Good to hear. That's all I had. Thanks.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Brent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel.\nBrad Reback: Great, thanks very much. Dev, as you look at the Atlas self-service business, are there any constraints around how many customers you could add in a quarter?\nDev Ittycheria: There's clearly -- there's obviously some limits to how many we can actually add, but there is no natural constraint. It's not like we're constrained by having enough sales people in place. The sign-up process is automated. We can handle tons of volume. So, technically, we can add a lot of customers. What we're obviously continuing to hone is develop the marketing program and the experiments and use content marketing to go acquire new customers and we're getting more and more sophisticated in that. So our self-service pipeline continues to grow nicely.\nBrad Reback: Great. And then, just one quick follow-up. In the press release you talk about a DoD DevSecOps opportunity. As you look at that longer-term, do you think that gets fulfilled mainly via EA or Atlas? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. I think like many customers, I think every organization is in some way on some path to the cloud. We've talked about this in the past. Not only do we see this in the federal sector or even the state and local government sector, but clearly we see this even in the commercial sector where there are certain customers who are much more cautious, maybe because they are in the regulated industry or just culturally they are more cautious, but they are all moving in some way, shape or form towards the cloud. The benefit of using MongoDB is that we give them a very seamless migration path to the cloud and what I mean by that is they don't have to rewrite one line of code to move from an on-prem deployment to a cloud deployment. So that takes away a lot of risk. In some ways, we future-proof their applications. I think with this particular fed situation, I think much like in enterprises and other organizations, I think there's some workloads that are more naturally predisposed to stay on-prem and then obviously there is a big initiative obviously with FedRAMP where you have to certify yourselves against a bunch of criteria to be able to run in the fed -- in the clouds that the Fed's authorize and so that is work that we're already doing because we do see a huge amount of demand there and I should mention that the federal government has been long time users and customers of MongoDB even before I joined the company. So that is a segment that's been early in its adoption of MongoDB.\nBrad Reback: Great, thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair.\nJason Ader: Yes, thank you. Hey, guys, on the Postgres migration comments that you made, Dev, can you talk about some of the underlying limitations that customers are facing as they do that and how -- and what you guys bring to the table to help them in that modernization effort?\nDev Ittycheria: Sure, so there is a number of limitations. One with using a relational database, you basically have to stuff data into a tabular format into rows and columns and that's not the way developers think nor is it the way they code. So what MongoDB allows you to do is one, be able to think about your data much like -- in a much more natural way. So, for example, a customer record does not have to be disaggregated into a bunch of different tables. You can treat a customer holistically and keep everything about that one customer in a document. Second, making changes is that much easier because you can make changes on the fly without having to change all the documents for all the other assets you're tracking nor having to update a centralized catalog etc. So making changes in MongoDB is that much easier versus a relational database. Third is scalability. Relational databases were designed to be single node systems. MongoDB was a distributed -- was designed from the ground up to be a distributed database. So not only do we allow you to move quickly, but we'd like to scale, very, very fast, which is why lots of customers pick MongoDB because they have such high performance and scale requirements. The fourth issue is resiliency. By definition because it's a distributed architecture, we have multiple copies of the data. So if one node goes down, whether it's for a system or a network failure or some other failure, your application is still up and running. You have to do a lot of work on the relational database side to build in that level of fault tolerance and it can be quite expensive and still not really deliver on your requirements. So for all those reasons, people are recognizing that the document model is a very powerful way to model your data, it's the most natural and the most productive way for developers to work which is why we've become so popular.\nJason Ader: And just a quick follow-up on that. So understanding all of the advantages, is the issue just from an adoption standpoint that moving to kind of a similar model, relational database in the cloud is just easier and modernization is more of an effort on the part of the customer. Is that the main issue?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, the perception on many customers part, moving from a legacy relational database to an open source database in the cloud will require less work. So when someone is say under pressure to move off particular legacy contract because the contract is up for renewal, they may in their mind believe that moving to an open source relational database in the cloud is a better option. What we are spending time on -- what we are -- the analogy I use with our sales people is that we're selling a very powerful language and for some people, because it's a new language, they've been using the old language for 50 years, it can be a bit intimidating. So we have to educate them on the benefits of our language and when they get educated, they suddenly see the power of the document model, the power of our distributed architecture, the scalability of our platform. They basically just recognize the benefits of our platform and that's why they start moving to MongoDB. And so depending on where they are in their journey, I encourage our sales people to really educate our customers about the benefits of MongoDB and they don't have to sell very hard. As soon as they explain the benefits, customers get it. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we had this banking customer who remarked to us that a number of their people who were long time relational -- I could almost say bigots, just when they started learning about MongoDB became huge enthusiastic converts to MongoDB and we see that happening all over the place and we're seeing that happen now in all these accounts that we've been working in where more and more of the workloads are now coming towards MongoDB.\nJason Ader: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Hynes with Canaccord.\nDavid Hynes: Hey, thanks guys, congrats on the results. Dev. So, sales and marketing spend ticked back up as a percent of revs. You told us that would likely happen and you're clearly seeing some nice yield from that spend, what's the plan from here? Is it more of the same or do you think, does it feel like more spend could even yield faster customer growth?\nDev Ittycheria: I'm trying to grow -- I think we collected as a leadership team we're trying to grow our sales organization as fast as possible, but there's limits to how fast you can grow because you don't want to cut corners on quality, you don't want to cut corners on investing in ramping these sales people, giving them the right management support and the right technical support for them to set up for success, but I think we've talked about this in a number of earlier earnings calls. We still feel like we're vastly underpenetrated. There are a few slots of the market that we just don't have enough salespeople and so we are trying to grow our reach and expand our reach as fast as we can and that's not just in North America, but in Europe as well as in Asia and we're seeing great demand in all regions even Latin America as well and so for us it's really finding the right leadership team to invest in building a team around them and then scaling that over and over again is really the constraint in terms of growing our sales force.\nDavid Hynes: Okay. Yes, makes sense. And then Michael, a follow-up for you. So a more significant jump in the $100,000 plus cohort this quarter. Is that just timing that more happened across that threshold in Q3 or is there something more insightful happening there?\nMichael Gordon: Yes, I think it's really hard to get super precise in sort of the sequential changes or anything like that in that bucket. Sometimes, we've had quarters where it's been very large. Other times we've had quarters where it's been a little bit lower and all the growth was in people who are already above the threshold. So it's somewhat arbitrary threshold designed just to help people understand that people are making meaningful levels of investments, but I think it is when you get that many number of customers in the absolute who are spending above that level, I do think it's an indication that we're a meaningful part of their technology infrastructure.\nDavid Hynes: Yes, makes sense. Okay, congrats guys.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi guys, this is Hannah [ph] on for Rishi. Thank you for taking my questions. First, could you just talk about how traction with Realm is going and given it's a newer product, how do you think about your competitive positioning with that product specifically relative to mobile database offerings from other modern database providers?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So one, I should just remind you that we [indiscernible], Realm product earlier this summer. So we still believe we're in the very early days of this product and I would say the early traction has been really good and we're seeing really nice month-over-month increases in usage, but again, it's early and the revenue for Realm won't show up as a different SKU, it will show up as Atlas revenue because that will drive more consumption of Atlas. And in terms of adoption of Realm as the mobile database, we do recognize that when we acquired Realm, they had not really invested in kind of invigorating the developer community and so we're making investments in doing that as well. Excuse me. And that will also take some time, but we're very pleased in terms of our positioning. One of the killer features that and we will be announcing or we've announced, but will be available -- will be early next year, which is called Realm Sync, which will provide very sophisticated data synchronization capabilities between the client and the back-end. That is one of the hardest problems for developers to solve and automating that will make the platform that much more attractive for developers to build mobile apps on. And we're really bullish on the mobile space because with the advent of 5G and other related technologies, we see that mobile apps will become even mission critical, have much more rich features, streaming types of data and so forth that will require a very sophisticated platform to support.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, that's helpful. And then, how do you think about your ability to serve the world's most complex use cases. And what do you feel like technologically differentiates your platform relative to the other no-sequel more modern database providers.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So I would say, one, when I joined the company about six years ago, I would say that we were considered to be just in a basket of no-sequel vendors, it wasn't clear who the breakout company was going to be. I would say, six years later, I think we've proven that one, we had a significant technology advantage because -- even the size of our community at that time was far bigger than any of the other no-sequel providers. We were able to marry that technology advantage with really strong execution and we've grown our business faster, we delivered better financial performance, we've got more customers than any of the other no-sequel vendors and along the way, we've also done a lot of product innovation, more recently with multi-cloud clusters, earlier with multi-document ACID transactions and a bunch of other capabilities, that's really pushed the envelope. So MongoDB today is not what I'd call a no-sequel database, I would call it a modern general purpose database and we have some of the largest, most sophisticated, and savvy customers across almost every industry and geography using MongoDB to transform their business and we're very proud of that and we feel we're very well positioned to go after the most mission critical workloads no matter the use case.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: Hey, thanks very much. I wanted to ask you about the sequential improvement that you saw in Atlas. You added about $10 million of incremental revenue, which was up from the $7 million that you added a year ago and up from the $6 million that you added last quarter. I know you obviously saw record net adds and you're seeing some incremental improvement in Atlas expansion rate. I guess what do you kind of attribute the improvement and then the incremental revenue to the most and was there any kind of one-time items that you would caution us just kind of from a extrapolating the sequential growth in Atlas to future quarters?\nMichael Gordon: Sure, yes. Thanks, Tyler. I think the overall -- it was a very strong quarter really across the board, but including within Atlas, we saw obviously a lot of new customer additions, but those tend to be when a customer comes on tends to be smaller and they grow from there. So it's really, it's most of that growth in the expanding -- of the existing customer base. And as I mentioned, we saw both Q1 and then for Q2, we talked about in the various calls, that's slightly slower growth that really reverted more to normalized levels, pre-COVID, which is great to see and I think you see that showing up in the numbers. So, I think it's really kind of all the parts of the chain that you would expect strong additions, good underlying behavior, stickiness, kind of expansion within the customer base and generally the sort of very strong cohort dynamics that we have really just plying outside; so I wouldn't point out [ph]. It wasn't really any one thing in particular or any particular meaningful outliers worth calling out.\nTyler Radke: Okay, helpful. And then, just wanted to clarify, as you think about the factors impacting the Q4 guidance. Obviously, you called out a tough comp on the EA business, part of that's related to 606 accounting. Are you adding any kind of incremental caution just on the macro environment in Q4 relative to where you were a quarter ago. Obviously, the world is kind of -- it's really evolved to -- the world business environment is at a different place than people thought at the beginning of the year, but just kind of curious how your expectations are for Q4 versus [ph].\nMichael Gordon: Yes, I'd say a few things when looking at the Q4 guide. First of all, obviously, we significantly raised our outlook for Q4. So that clearly indicates our confidence despite the macroeconomic environment. That said and our Q3 strong results notwithstanding, we do expect to see a continued impact on new business. I think it's hard not to. We've seen great customer engagement, but there is plenty of macro uncertainty and I think you can see deals receiving more scrutiny given the current environment and so I think that's sort of captured and reflected. The second thing that I would add from a big picture perspective is we've talked about Atlas. It's great to see that the cohort dynamics and the behavior are back to pre-COVID levels, but we're entering Q4 with just a smaller recurring revenue base than we would have had we not had those COVID headwinds in the earlier half of the year. And then, the third thing I'd point out is just a tough compare which you referenced, which we had called out last year was about $3.5 million incremental of EA and again this has sort of impacted not just the denominator, but also the numerator given how 606 works.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay, great. Thank you. And let me add my congratulations. So, Dev. I'm wondering what your R&D priorities are right now and maybe an easy way for us to think about it is, what do you want your software to be able to do in the relatively near future that it can't do today?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, I think what I want MongoDB to be known for and I think we're on a path to get there is to be the best place to build modern applications and I believe that the ability to innovate using software and data will determine the company's competitive advantage long-term and that's going to be really, really important. I think the power of the document model, I think our really powerful but easy to use query language, our ability to handle any workload, any size of data all play to our strengths and I think we talked a little bit about, you know, the fact that we have a huge developer community that's only growing by the day and that we provide platform independence. So, I think we have all the ingredients to be a very viable if not compelling place for people to build all their modern applications and that's what we're striving to. Clearly, you're going to see us and we've talked about this in the past, you're seeing us expand from being a database to a data platform. We announced a whole bunch of new products. Those products will continue to grow and mature overtime, we'll probably announce new capabilities over time. So, we're just going to make it easier for developers to build very sophisticated applications, applications that span system of record, systems engagement and systems of insight and we think application of the future will embed all that functionality and we're really well positioned to be the premier place for people to build those applications.\nPatrick Walravens: Great. Is there one thing you can say you can't do now but that you're excited that's coming in the next year or two?\nDev Ittycheria: Obviously, we're a 13-year old company. So we have a lot of capability and I wouldn't say there's anything that prevents us. I mean, frankly, the one thing I think that really prevents us is awareness or perception of us from a company that we were six, seven years ago. So the more people learn about us, the more people are updated about our capabilities, the more people spend time learning about the technology, the quicker they become enthusiastic converts and that's a big part also of our go-to-market strategy.\nPatrick Walravens: All right, great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Hey guys, great quarter. Good stuff. Dev, want to start with you for some on Atlas. Clearly, very good progress over there. Can you talk about conceptually how a new Atlas user today is different from perhaps an Atlas user a year or two ago in the sense of who he is and what he or she are doing and how quickly they're growing their usage of the platform?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. I don't know, maybe a couple of years, maybe two, three years. I remember, Atlas was launched in 2016. So I would say our first cohort of customers were probably people who were kicking the tires, trying to really understand how to use the platform, not really put mission-critical workloads on Atlas and so they were probably early adopters. What we've seen now and it's clear is that enterprises are going very aggressively into the cloud. So we have very mature, very conservative organizations who are now using Atlas. What we're also seeing is actually small development teams sign up through self-serve who are parts of big organizations, but they just want to get going on Atlas, play with it, launch some applications on it, get a feel for it as a precursor to maybe a big deployment of Atlas. And then, the other thing that we've done is we just become much more sophisticated in terms of expanding the coverage of access to customers through our self-serve channels. So we're seeing a lot of people sign up for Atlas in other markets, markets in Asia, markets in Latin America and so and so forth that we don't necessarily have a lot of sales people in and that gives us a good way to go after those markets as we continue to build out our sales force. So that's where I would see how the market has or the customer base has changed overtime.\nIttai Kidron: That's great. Very helpful and then Michael, on, I want to kind of dig into a little bit into your return to pre-COVID levels. Could you be a little bit more specific on what you mean by that. Does that mean that expansion rate has bounced back up? ACV -- first deal ACV. Help me amend and what does that mean, if you could break that down for us?\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. You know very specifically in Q1, we had talked about how we saw a slowdown in the expansion rate of existing customers within Atlas and then that got a little bit better in Q2. So that's really what we're talking about. So think about the Atlas customers -- Atlas revenues is all consumption based. This is not about deal activity or commitments or things like that. We walked everyone through back then was clearly you can see the adds continue to be strong when we saw slightly slower expansion. One of the first questions was, was there any churn or increase in churn. We haven't seen any changes and that would sort of underscore the mission critical position that we occupy within a customer's environment and what we saw was, if it's not gross adds, if it's not churn, really it's about sort of the expansion dynamics within a customer, what we saw was a slight but broad based slowdown really starting kind of the second half of March in Q1 and continuing into Q2. The first hypothesis was that it was sort of industry driven right maybe industries that were particularly affected by COVID, hospitality, travel, things like that, but instead, it was really much more broad based and modest impact as opposed to a narrow number of customers are having a major impact. We talked about that in the September call that how we've seen some improvement, but not all the way back to historic levels. And so what we're saying here is that based on the data we've observed in Q3, those dynamics are now back to pre-COVID levels. So continued expansion without sort of slight decline that we'd seen. Obviously, continued strong adds and very sticky, which you can see in the overall numbers, but we wanted to try and disaggregate that a little bit for folks and sort of give an update based on the fact that had been a factor and the way it plays out in terms of the Q4 numbers is really, you wind up entering Q4, even though the expansion dynamics are sort of back to normal, you are beginning Q4 with a smaller recurring revenue base than you would normally have if you hadn't had slightly slower growth in Q1 and Q2, etcetera. So hopefully that helps people understand.\nIttai Kidron: Got it. Very good, thanks. Good luck, guys.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jack Andrews with Needham & Company.\nJack Andrews: Good afternoon and congratulations on the results. I want to see if we could dig in a little bit more into the legacy migration opportunity. It sounds like from your prepared remarks that there is a good appetite for these types of projects. I know you've announced some recent partnerships in this area. So who is really helping you go after this market opportunity today and who do you think can help you tackle this moving forward.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, sure. So just to make sure people understand why we see there's a big opportunity. The premium innovation has never been higher, because obviously what COVID has done has created both opportunities and risks for companies and people need to move very, very quickly to either seize opportunities or respond to new threats of the business. And so that means you need to innovate very fast. What that means is that you need to be able to and obviously innovation today means being able to use software and data to build new applications, to add new features, to add new capabilities etcetera and that means you need a database platform that enables you to do that. One of the challenges of relational databases is that as you add more and more capability, the data model becomes increasingly more and more brittle, so it becomes harder and harder to add those capabilities. So when you're in an environment where you need to move fast, you start saying do I want to stay on this on this brittle platform or do I want to move to a much more modern architecture where I can move very, very fast as well as change directions quickly and that's what's driving this demand to modernize our legacy application portfolio and so we feel that we're really well positioned for this opportunity. We're a proven technology, we have reference customers in almost every industry and so we think the legacy modernization or migration opportunity is really big and what we're seeing now is in terms of partnerships we've historically had a lots of SIs who worked with us because their business model is very complementary to ours. In some ways, they take on the development onus for the customer and so we just announced obviously people who are joining our program to help customers migrate off relational databases and these are some of the largest SIs in the world. We also work with some really interesting boutique SIs who have some real deep MongoDB expertise. The other players, actually the cloud providers themselves they work with us, they provide marketing space. We work with our sales people to help customers migrate off legacy platforms to the cloud and obviously running Atlas on their particular cloud. And then we also work with ISVs. A lot of these ISVs, some of them are legacy ISVs who are now realizing that rather deploying or offering an on-premise legacy solution, they have to be much more modern and offer a SaaS-based solution. So they are re-platforming their own product with MongoDB as the underlying data store. So, those are three examples of partnerships that we work with partners that we work with to help people migrate off legacy applications.\nJack Andrews: Got it. Thanks a lot for your perspective.\nDev Ittycheria: My pleasure.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back over to Dev Ittycheria for any closing remarks.\nDev Ittycheria: Well, I would like to thank everyone for joining us today. I'm really proud of the strong execution this quarter in a difficult macro environment. As we discussed, we're making continued investments in product innovation that further establishes MongoDB as the preeminent independent modern data platform, and our differentiated value prop is really best on best-in-class technology, developer mind share, and platform independence; and this is resonating with both, our existing as well as new customers, and we're looking forward to finishing the year. So, thank you for joining us, and we'll talk to you soon.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the third quarter both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $150.8 million, up 38% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $144.1 million, up 39% year-over-year and professional services was $6.7 million, up 19% year-over-year. To put our performance in the quarter into perspective, we thought it would be helpful to provide an update on how COVID-19 has impacted the growth of our business. First, let's talk about new business. Our ability to execute on new business opportunities with both new and existing customers continued to surpass our expectations in Q3 despite a difficult and uncertain macro environment. As Dev mentioned, customers are approaching digital transformation and cloud adoption with a heightened sense of urgency, which our go-to-market teams have capitalized on. I want to be clear, even though we performed better than our expectations in terms of new business, COVID-19 did have a negative impact on our quarterly performance. Second, the trend in existing Atlas customer spend has been steadily improving since the modest, but broad based slowdown we experienced in Q1 due to the impact of COVID-19. In Q3, the growth from existing Atlas customers has returned to our pre-COVID trends. Overall, Atlas' strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew over 61% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 47% of total revenue compared to 40% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and 44% last quarter. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by over 2,400 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 22,600, which is up from over 15,900 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 2,800 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,900 in the year ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 21,100 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 14,200 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 898 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 688 in the year ago period. The continued strong growth in customers with $100,000 or more in ARR is an indication of our success of our land and expand go-to-market strategy and the fact that we're increasingly becoming a strategic partner and a database standard for our customers. Moving down the P&L; I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $108.6 million, representing a gross margin of 72%, which is consistent with both last quarter and the year ago period. Overall, we're pleased with our gross margin performance, which reflects greater efficiency and scale in our Atlas business. However, we continue to expect that we'll see some modest reduction in overall company gross margin as Atlas continues to be a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $16 million or negative 11% operating margin for the third quarter compared to negative 13% margin in the year ago period. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was driven in part by our revenue outperformance. In addition, we had assumed a partial normalization of travel and facilities expenses due to the gradual reopening economy, but that normalization didn't occur in Q3 and doesn't seem likely in the near-term. While those pandemic related savings are benefiting our bottom line in fiscal '21, we don't expect this to be a sustained benefit. Net loss in the third quarter was $18.2 million or $0.31 per share based on 59.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.26 per share on 56.4 million shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $966.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was negative $8.1 million. After taking into consideration approximately $6.8 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $14.9 million in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $13.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year 2021. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $155 million to $157 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $23 million to $21 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.39 based on 60.2 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2021, we are increasing our revenue guidance to $574.4 million to $576.4 million. We are improving our profitability expectations and now expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $56.6 million to $54.6 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.04 based on 58.9 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our guidance incorporates an expectation that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will impact Q4 and likely continue into fiscal '22. Moreover, we believe that the recent measures implemented in Europe and the U.S. to fight the resurgence of the virus will add uncertainty and volatility to the business environment. Let me explain how this impact is captured in our business outlook. Starting with new business, well so far, we've outperformed our expectations due to strong customer engagement. We do expect to see similar headwinds to our new business activity in Q4. We also face a particularly tough year-over-year comparison in terms of new business because last Q4 was quite strong for our Enterprise Advanced product. Enterprise Advanced has a more immediate impact on revenue due to the fact that under ASC 606, we recognize the term license component upfront. Furthermore, our forecast reflects the compounding impact from the slower than historical growth from our existing Atlas customers that we experienced earlier in the year. Even though growth rates have returned to pre-COVID levels, we experienced several months of slightly lower growth that impacts the base of recurring revenue entering Q4. Lastly, customer cohort behavior and net ARR expansion rates continue to be strong despite the macro challenges as customers increase their investments in our platform. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent third quarter results. We're executing well despite operating in an unprecedented environment. We're investing in the business for the long haul and believe that we're well positioned for continued success. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Yes, I think on the second piece of the question, obviously, we'll get to our guide in fiscal '22 in the March call, but I think what we tried to be clear about is, we are definitely looking at the business from a long-term perspective and the guidance in Q4 includes pulling forward some of the hires and other investments that we would have made in fiscal '22 given that we are seeing some COVID-related savings and we talked in an earlier call about our intention and desire to reinvest those now and that continues to be the plan. Thanks. Yes, so just quickly. So, not a Fed -- push or Fed impact. EA continues to be an important leg of the growth stool. I certainly understand that Atlas obviously steals a lot of limelight occasionally but EA continues to be quite important and relevant. It's very much a customer choice situation and we're just trying to make it easy for them to consume some MongoDB wherever they are vis-a\u0300-vis their cloud posture. Obviously, there'll be variability as we've talked about on EA given 606. I would say there's also variability kind of quarter-to-quarter as we've talked about in terms of relational migrations, but as you heard from Dev in the prepared remarks and some of the case studies, it was a good quarter from that perspective as well. So generally just good broad-based participation. Thanks, Brent. Yes, I think it's really hard to get super precise in sort of the sequential changes or anything like that in that bucket. Sometimes, we've had quarters where it's been very large. Other times we've had quarters where it's been a little bit lower and all the growth was in people who are already above the threshold. So it's somewhat arbitrary threshold designed just to help people understand that people are making meaningful levels of investments, but I think it is when you get that many number of customers in the absolute who are spending above that level, I do think it's an indication that we're a meaningful part of their technology infrastructure. Thanks, David. Sure, yes. Thanks, Tyler. I think the overall -- it was a very strong quarter really across the board, but including within Atlas, we saw obviously a lot of new customer additions, but those tend to be when a customer comes on tends to be smaller and they grow from there. So it's really, it's most of that growth in the expanding -- of the existing customer base. And as I mentioned, we saw both Q1 and then for Q2, we talked about in the various calls, that's slightly slower growth that really reverted more to normalized levels, pre-COVID, which is great to see and I think you see that showing up in the numbers. So, I think it's really kind of all the parts of the chain that you would expect strong additions, good underlying behavior, stickiness, kind of expansion within the customer base and generally the sort of very strong cohort dynamics that we have really just plying outside; so I wouldn't point out [ph]. It wasn't really any one thing in particular or any particular meaningful outliers worth calling out. Yes, I'd say a few things when looking at the Q4 guide. First of all, obviously, we significantly raised our outlook for Q4. So that clearly indicates our confidence despite the macroeconomic environment. That said and our Q3 strong results notwithstanding, we do expect to see a continued impact on new business. I think it's hard not to. We've seen great customer engagement, but there is plenty of macro uncertainty and I think you can see deals receiving more scrutiny given the current environment and so I think that's sort of captured and reflected. The second thing that I would add from a big picture perspective is we've talked about Atlas. It's great to see that the cohort dynamics and the behavior are back to pre-COVID levels, but we're entering Q4 with just a smaller recurring revenue base than we would have had we not had those COVID headwinds in the earlier half of the year. And then, the third thing I'd point out is just a tough compare which you referenced, which we had called out last year was about $3.5 million incremental of EA and again this has sort of impacted not just the denominator, but also the numerator given how 606 works."

            "name": "Dev Ittycheria",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a company update. Looking quickly at our third quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $150.8 million, a 38% year-over-year increase and above the high-end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 39% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew 61% year-over-year and now represents 47% of revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth ending the quarter with over 22,600 customers. We're very pleased by our third quarter performance against a difficult and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. We saw another record quarter of customer additions both in our direct sales and self-serve channels. As we discussed in the past, given the strong product market fit of Atlas, we decided to make a number of changes that make it easier for new customers to get on to our platform. We continued to reap the benefits of these adjustments in Q3 with record customer growth and strong net ARR expansion. On the self-serve side, our continued efforts to broaden our digital marketing funnel have resulted in over 2,000 net Atlas customer additions in Q3. As a reminder, our self-serve business is increasing not just an important revenue generator in its own right, but also a source of leads for our sales force. Strong self-serve net additions in Q3 indicates that this flywheel effect will continue in the future. I'd like to share some themes we have heard from senior level customers across a large swathe of industries and geographies. Customers are feeling more pressure than ever to innovate quickly to seize new opportunities and to respond to new threats, and 2020 has only exacerbated the need for speed meaningfully increasing the urgency to move to the cloud. When evaluating technologies, customers want solutions that provide a seamless migration path from on-premise to the cloud. They need mission-critical platforms that can massively scale and customers now recognize they have to simplify their tech stack to ensure agility and speed. Furthermore, the resiliency of the computing platforms and the ability to serve customers easily no matter where they are based has never been more important. As a result, customers are fundamentally rethinking their technology strategy and the debate is not if or when, but how to accelerate the modernization of their legacy applications as well as to build new apps to address the new business requirements. Consequently, it is clear the global pandemic is only accelerating the existing trends that are a significant catalyst for our business. These customers don't view us as just another database, but as a core platform to enable them to drive more innovation and growth for their business. Our Q3 results demonstrate that by helping our customers solve their most pressing challenges, our business continues to thrive during a challenging macro backdrop. So what is driving the success and how have we established ourselves as the leading modern general purpose database? Our differentiation comes down to three pillars. The first is technological. We believe that in the end, the best database wins. Databases are at the heart of applications and if the database is hard to use, has performance or scaling issues, the application itself will suffer and so will the business that invested in it. The foundation of our database is the document model, which maps to the way developers think and code and has proven to be the most productive way for developers to work with data. Moreover, our database was built from the ground up with a distributed architecture allowing applications to scale more easily and cost effectively while delivering outstanding performance. Our CTO, Mark Porter, has been in the database industry for over 30 years and he has tried many times in many different organizations to re-engineer relational databases into fault tolerant distributed databases. Due to the underlying limitations of the architecture of relational databases, this becomes a huge challenge to overcome. Instead, we've built a database that's incredibly easy to use, that is applicable for almost every conceivable use case, and is engineered for mission-critical workloads. A large banking customer recently remarked to us that employees steeped in decades of relational orthodoxy are at first curious about MongoDB, but within months become enthusiastic converts to the modern way of building and running applications. Our tech advantage clearly extends to the cloud. The most common go-to-market tactic cloud vendors use is lift and shift, moving on-prem relational workloads to an open source relational database service such as Postgres. After using this approach for a number of workloads, customers soon realized that the expected cost benefits from a cloud deployment are more than offset by the limitation of the underlying architectural constraints of relational databases. In other words, lift and shift is not the same as modernization and customers are increasingly coming to appreciate the distinction between the two. When it comes to customer satisfaction, we just closed the month of November with an NPS score of 74 for Atlas, a remarkably high number, particularly for our category and a clear indicator of how compelling our global cloud platform has become for our customers. We believe we have a fundamentally superior technology and customers are increasingly coming to the same conclusion. Our second pillar of differentiation is developer mind share. Over the course of time, alternative technologies have tried to replace relational databases, but they all failed because of a lack of developer adoption. The founders of MongoDB were developers themselves and intimately understood the challenges that developers faced working with relational databases, especially since a tabular approach bore little resemblance to how data is represented in application code, consequently making relational databases hard to use. Due to its ease of use and flexibility, the document model garnered incredible developer enthusiasm. By every objective measure, MongoDB is the most popular modern database in the world today. Our Community Server, the free to use product, has been downloaded over 130 million times and has been downloaded over 55 million times this year, which is more than the total number of downloads in the first 10 years of the company's history. The MongoDB community of developers is large and global and continues to grow every day. We have spent the last decade plus building that community and that is an asset that is difficult to replicate. Finally, the third pillar of competitive differentiation is increasingly structural and that is platform independence. Having a multi-cloud strategy is a strategic imperative for nearly every enterprise with 85% of enterprises today already using services from multiple cloud providers and the expectation is that this number will grow to 98% over the next three years. Not only do we provide an easy on-ramp to the cloud and run on all major cloud platforms, in the third quarter, we announced the general availability of multi-cloud clusters in Atlas, which enables customers to run an application across multiple public clouds simultaneously. With Atlas moving data, traditionally the hardest piece of an application stack to move, becomes far easier. Running an application across multiple clouds has a number of benefits. The application is more resilient as it is not subject to single-cloud outages, developers can easily leverage the unique capabilities of each cloud provider, and the applications can migrate between clouds with no downtime avoiding vendor lock in. Atlas is the first global cloud database that delivers a true multi-cloud solution. The combination of our unique value proposition and multi-faceted go-to-market model puts us in a great competitive position. We see our strong third quarter and year-to-date results in an unprecedented environment as an indication that our differentiation resonates in the marketplace. The strength in the quarter was broad based across geographies and customer segments. Our self-serve teams continue to rapidly experiment and launch programs to make it easier for customers to find and use MongoDB and our sales teams have remained disciplined about their rigorous pipeline generation and qualification process. We believe we're playing from an increasing position of strength and are well positioned to disproportionately benefit from the move to the cloud. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the third quarter. Celebrating its 100-year anniversary this year, Pitney Bowes has undergone a multi-year digital transformation resulting in a highly distributed cloud services for the mailing, shipping, and financing needs of its 750,000 plus global clients, including 90% of the Fortune 500. The global technology commerce giant recently standardized its business critical applications on MongoDB Atlas to support its 1 billion plus global e-commerce business. One of the largest telecom providers in the Middle East decided to migrate from Oracle to MongoDB to modernize its legacy mission critical customer loyalty application and deliver a more seamless experience to customers around the world. MongoDB helped the company upgrade its architecture to accommodate the huge volume of new data coming from its digital channels and increase the speed of its application release cycles by a factor of three. Anheuser-Busch InBev, home to several of the world's most recognizable beer brands, chose MongoDB Atlas as the primary database for a proprietary B2B application, BEES. The platform digitizes Anheuser-Busch's relationships with its customers offering convenience, seamless communication, and most importantly, enhanced business performance. The BEES app has been its core revenue driver since COVID-19 started and its user base increased by 40% last quarter. One of the world's largest car manufacturers expanded its usage of MongoDB Atlas to support continued modernization efforts for its North American business. The company was able to standardize its application development and accelerate time to market across all its divisions while scaling to accommodate growing demand across the United States and Canada. Current, a leading U.S. challenger bank serving the needs of people who have been overlooked by the traditional banking industry, has increased their investment in MongoDB Atlas on Google Cloud after a year of exponential growth. They chose MongoDB for our consistent data model, enterprise security with field-level encryption, and multi-document ACID transaction capabilities. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance in Q3. We are executing at a high level, acquiring new customers at a record pace, and deepening relationships with existing customers by building on our core competitive strengths of technical superiority, developer mind share, and platform independence. With that, I'll turn it over to Michael. Thanks, Raimo, it's nice to talk you. With regards to your question on self-serve, actually, we feel really good about our self-serve business. What's happening there is that the self-serve is a great source of new customers that makes it just very easy for customers to engage with us in a very frictionless way and then quite a number of those customers end up being leads to our -- both our corporate or inside sales team as well as our field team. So that's what's happening there. It's not because we're seeing any slowdown in our self-serve business. So one, I would tell you that we already have a number of customers who have built-in machine learning capability on top of MongoDB. So this has been happening for a number of years. So, two, the power and flexibly of the document model is even more profound as people want to do more and more sophisticated things with applications and keep in mind that MongoDB is a very scalable platform and so being able to have a platform that allows people to leverage the massive amounts of data to train the algorithms is incredibly helpful and just today, Amazon made an announcement around their SageMaker product where we were part of that announcement and our CTO, Mark Porter was quoted where we are, you know, allowing customers of SageMaker to basically leverage data sitting in MongoDB. So from an application development point of view, we're very well positioned. This is a natural path of people building more sophisticated applications and the document model is set up very nicely to help people build more and more sophisticated and complex applications just given the power of the model. Yes, sure. On the direct side, we actually made a decision prior to COVID becoming front and center for all of us that we just saw last year a lot of friction where our sales people were incentivizing or trying to incentivize customers to make some sort of commitment typically at least an annual commitment because that's the way that they were paid and what we realized with a lot of these customers, sometimes these workloads were new and just didn't know what -- how much you know the kind of resources they would need on Atlas. They just -- didn't -- the friction of getting the approvals to sign a longer-term commitment was that much longer and they liked the flexibility of being able to basically just start using Atlas directly. And so we encouraged -- we saw the strong product market fit of Atlas and once people started using Atlas, the growth was quite profound and so we said, why don't we take away that friction. So, we changed the comp plans for this fiscal year to encourage our sales people to sign up customers more quickly and that has paid huge dividends. It's allowed us to engage customers more quickly and allowed us to acquire a lot more new customers. Yes. So Brent, on the multi-cloud clusters, it actually can -- it just really depends on the sophistication of the organization and how broad a user base and customer base they are going after. For example, we already have customers for example in Canada who are trying to serve the Canadian market and are running their application across different cloud providers all in Canada because they want to leverage the reach -- the broad reach of being able to leverage all three cloud providers and they also wanted to have the benefits of resiliency in case one cloud provider goes down and there were some high profile outages right before Thanksgiving. They don't have to worry about their application going down, and that is, I wouldn't say is one of the -- is not a very large customer. Then, on the other hand, you could also have large enterprises who increasingly want to leverage the different capabilities of the different cloud providers. Each cloud provider is differentiating themselves across different dimensions of capabilities and so being able to do that reach. Again, some cloud providers have more presence in certain markets than others do and also just keeping the vendors honest is something that plays well especially with senior level decision makers who've lived the movie before about being held hostage by particular vendor. So it really ranges depending on the organization, but we think it's very applicable for very sophisticated early-stage companies as well as large enterprises. There's clearly -- there's obviously some limits to how many we can actually add, but there is no natural constraint. It's not like we're constrained by having enough sales people in place. The sign-up process is automated. We can handle tons of volume. So, technically, we can add a lot of customers. What we're obviously continuing to hone is develop the marketing program and the experiments and use content marketing to go acquire new customers and we're getting more and more sophisticated in that. So our self-service pipeline continues to grow nicely. Yes. I think like many customers, I think every organization is in some way on some path to the cloud. We've talked about this in the past. Not only do we see this in the federal sector or even the state and local government sector, but clearly we see this even in the commercial sector where there are certain customers who are much more cautious, maybe because they are in the regulated industry or just culturally they are more cautious, but they are all moving in some way, shape or form towards the cloud. The benefit of using MongoDB is that we give them a very seamless migration path to the cloud and what I mean by that is they don't have to rewrite one line of code to move from an on-prem deployment to a cloud deployment. So that takes away a lot of risk. In some ways, we future-proof their applications. I think with this particular fed situation, I think much like in enterprises and other organizations, I think there's some workloads that are more naturally predisposed to stay on-prem and then obviously there is a big initiative obviously with FedRAMP where you have to certify yourselves against a bunch of criteria to be able to run in the fed -- in the clouds that the Fed's authorize and so that is work that we're already doing because we do see a huge amount of demand there and I should mention that the federal government has been long time users and customers of MongoDB even before I joined the company. So that is a segment that's been early in its adoption of MongoDB. Sure, so there is a number of limitations. One with using a relational database, you basically have to stuff data into a tabular format into rows and columns and that's not the way developers think nor is it the way they code. So what MongoDB allows you to do is one, be able to think about your data much like -- in a much more natural way. So, for example, a customer record does not have to be disaggregated into a bunch of different tables. You can treat a customer holistically and keep everything about that one customer in a document. Second, making changes is that much easier because you can make changes on the fly without having to change all the documents for all the other assets you're tracking nor having to update a centralized catalog etc. So making changes in MongoDB is that much easier versus a relational database. Third is scalability. Relational databases were designed to be single node systems. MongoDB was a distributed -- was designed from the ground up to be a distributed database. So not only do we allow you to move quickly, but we'd like to scale, very, very fast, which is why lots of customers pick MongoDB because they have such high performance and scale requirements. The fourth issue is resiliency. By definition because it's a distributed architecture, we have multiple copies of the data. So if one node goes down, whether it's for a system or a network failure or some other failure, your application is still up and running. You have to do a lot of work on the relational database side to build in that level of fault tolerance and it can be quite expensive and still not really deliver on your requirements. So for all those reasons, people are recognizing that the document model is a very powerful way to model your data, it's the most natural and the most productive way for developers to work which is why we've become so popular. Yes, the perception on many customers part, moving from a legacy relational database to an open source database in the cloud will require less work. So when someone is say under pressure to move off particular legacy contract because the contract is up for renewal, they may in their mind believe that moving to an open source relational database in the cloud is a better option. What we are spending time on -- what we are -- the analogy I use with our sales people is that we're selling a very powerful language and for some people, because it's a new language, they've been using the old language for 50 years, it can be a bit intimidating. So we have to educate them on the benefits of our language and when they get educated, they suddenly see the power of the document model, the power of our distributed architecture, the scalability of our platform. They basically just recognize the benefits of our platform and that's why they start moving to MongoDB. And so depending on where they are in their journey, I encourage our sales people to really educate our customers about the benefits of MongoDB and they don't have to sell very hard. As soon as they explain the benefits, customers get it. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we had this banking customer who remarked to us that a number of their people who were long time relational -- I could almost say bigots, just when they started learning about MongoDB became huge enthusiastic converts to MongoDB and we see that happening all over the place and we're seeing that happen now in all these accounts that we've been working in where more and more of the workloads are now coming towards MongoDB. I'm trying to grow -- I think we collected as a leadership team we're trying to grow our sales organization as fast as possible, but there's limits to how fast you can grow because you don't want to cut corners on quality, you don't want to cut corners on investing in ramping these sales people, giving them the right management support and the right technical support for them to set up for success, but I think we've talked about this in a number of earlier earnings calls. We still feel like we're vastly underpenetrated. There are a few slots of the market that we just don't have enough salespeople and so we are trying to grow our reach and expand our reach as fast as we can and that's not just in North America, but in Europe as well as in Asia and we're seeing great demand in all regions even Latin America as well and so for us it's really finding the right leadership team to invest in building a team around them and then scaling that over and over again is really the constraint in terms of growing our sales force. Yes. So one, I should just remind you that we [indiscernible], Realm product earlier this summer. So we still believe we're in the very early days of this product and I would say the early traction has been really good and we're seeing really nice month-over-month increases in usage, but again, it's early and the revenue for Realm won't show up as a different SKU, it will show up as Atlas revenue because that will drive more consumption of Atlas. And in terms of adoption of Realm as the mobile database, we do recognize that when we acquired Realm, they had not really invested in kind of invigorating the developer community and so we're making investments in doing that as well. Excuse me. And that will also take some time, but we're very pleased in terms of our positioning. One of the killer features that and we will be announcing or we've announced, but will be available -- will be early next year, which is called Realm Sync, which will provide very sophisticated data synchronization capabilities between the client and the back-end. That is one of the hardest problems for developers to solve and automating that will make the platform that much more attractive for developers to build mobile apps on. And we're really bullish on the mobile space because with the advent of 5G and other related technologies, we see that mobile apps will become even mission critical, have much more rich features, streaming types of data and so forth that will require a very sophisticated platform to support. Yes. So I would say, one, when I joined the company about six years ago, I would say that we were considered to be just in a basket of no-sequel vendors, it wasn't clear who the breakout company was going to be. I would say, six years later, I think we've proven that one, we had a significant technology advantage because -- even the size of our community at that time was far bigger than any of the other no-sequel providers. We were able to marry that technology advantage with really strong execution and we've grown our business faster, we delivered better financial performance, we've got more customers than any of the other no-sequel vendors and along the way, we've also done a lot of product innovation, more recently with multi-cloud clusters, earlier with multi-document ACID transactions and a bunch of other capabilities, that's really pushed the envelope. So MongoDB today is not what I'd call a no-sequel database, I would call it a modern general purpose database and we have some of the largest, most sophisticated, and savvy customers across almost every industry and geography using MongoDB to transform their business and we're very proud of that and we feel we're very well positioned to go after the most mission critical workloads no matter the use case. Well, I think what I want MongoDB to be known for and I think we're on a path to get there is to be the best place to build modern applications and I believe that the ability to innovate using software and data will determine the company's competitive advantage long-term and that's going to be really, really important. I think the power of the document model, I think our really powerful but easy to use query language, our ability to handle any workload, any size of data all play to our strengths and I think we talked a little bit about, you know, the fact that we have a huge developer community that's only growing by the day and that we provide platform independence. So, I think we have all the ingredients to be a very viable if not compelling place for people to build all their modern applications and that's what we're striving to. Clearly, you're going to see us and we've talked about this in the past, you're seeing us expand from being a database to a data platform. We announced a whole bunch of new products. Those products will continue to grow and mature overtime, we'll probably announce new capabilities over time. So, we're just going to make it easier for developers to build very sophisticated applications, applications that span system of record, systems engagement and systems of insight and we think application of the future will embed all that functionality and we're really well positioned to be the premier place for people to build those applications. Obviously, we're a 13-year old company. So we have a lot of capability and I wouldn't say there's anything that prevents us. I mean, frankly, the one thing I think that really prevents us is awareness or perception of us from a company that we were six, seven years ago. So the more people learn about us, the more people are updated about our capabilities, the more people spend time learning about the technology, the quicker they become enthusiastic converts and that's a big part also of our go-to-market strategy. Yes. I don't know, maybe a couple of years, maybe two, three years. I remember, Atlas was launched in 2016. So I would say our first cohort of customers were probably people who were kicking the tires, trying to really understand how to use the platform, not really put mission-critical workloads on Atlas and so they were probably early adopters. What we've seen now and it's clear is that enterprises are going very aggressively into the cloud. So we have very mature, very conservative organizations who are now using Atlas. What we're also seeing is actually small development teams sign up through self-serve who are parts of big organizations, but they just want to get going on Atlas, play with it, launch some applications on it, get a feel for it as a precursor to maybe a big deployment of Atlas. And then, the other thing that we've done is we just become much more sophisticated in terms of expanding the coverage of access to customers through our self-serve channels. So we're seeing a lot of people sign up for Atlas in other markets, markets in Asia, markets in Latin America and so and so forth that we don't necessarily have a lot of sales people in and that gives us a good way to go after those markets as we continue to build out our sales force. So that's where I would see how the market has or the customer base has changed overtime. Sure. You know very specifically in Q1, we had talked about how we saw a slowdown in the expansion rate of existing customers within Atlas and then that got a little bit better in Q2. So that's really what we're talking about. So think about the Atlas customers -- Atlas revenues is all consumption based. This is not about deal activity or commitments or things like that. We walked everyone through back then was clearly you can see the adds continue to be strong when we saw slightly slower expansion. One of the first questions was, was there any churn or increase in churn. We haven't seen any changes and that would sort of underscore the mission critical position that we occupy within a customer's environment and what we saw was, if it's not gross adds, if it's not churn, really it's about sort of the expansion dynamics within a customer, what we saw was a slight but broad based slowdown really starting kind of the second half of March in Q1 and continuing into Q2. The first hypothesis was that it was sort of industry driven right maybe industries that were particularly affected by COVID, hospitality, travel, things like that, but instead, it was really much more broad based and modest impact as opposed to a narrow number of customers are having a major impact. We talked about that in the September call that how we've seen some improvement, but not all the way back to historic levels. And so what we're saying here is that based on the data we've observed in Q3, those dynamics are now back to pre-COVID levels. So continued expansion without sort of slight decline that we'd seen. Obviously, continued strong adds and very sticky, which you can see in the overall numbers, but we wanted to try and disaggregate that a little bit for folks and sort of give an update based on the fact that had been a factor and the way it plays out in terms of the Q4 numbers is really, you wind up entering Q4, even though the expansion dynamics are sort of back to normal, you are beginning Q4 with a smaller recurring revenue base than you would normally have if you hadn't had slightly slower growth in Q1 and Q2, etcetera. So hopefully that helps people understand. Thanks. Yes, sure. So just to make sure people understand why we see there's a big opportunity. The premium innovation has never been higher, because obviously what COVID has done has created both opportunities and risks for companies and people need to move very, very quickly to either seize opportunities or respond to new threats of the business. And so that means you need to innovate very fast. What that means is that you need to be able to and obviously innovation today means being able to use software and data to build new applications, to add new features, to add new capabilities etcetera and that means you need a database platform that enables you to do that. One of the challenges of relational databases is that as you add more and more capability, the data model becomes increasingly more and more brittle, so it becomes harder and harder to add those capabilities. So when you're in an environment where you need to move fast, you start saying do I want to stay on this on this brittle platform or do I want to move to a much more modern architecture where I can move very, very fast as well as change directions quickly and that's what's driving this demand to modernize our legacy application portfolio and so we feel that we're really well positioned for this opportunity. We're a proven technology, we have reference customers in almost every industry and so we think the legacy modernization or migration opportunity is really big and what we're seeing now is in terms of partnerships we've historically had a lots of SIs who worked with us because their business model is very complementary to ours. In some ways, they take on the development onus for the customer and so we just announced obviously people who are joining our program to help customers migrate off relational databases and these are some of the largest SIs in the world. We also work with some really interesting boutique SIs who have some real deep MongoDB expertise. The other players, actually the cloud providers themselves they work with us, they provide marketing space. We work with our sales people to help customers migrate off legacy platforms to the cloud and obviously running Atlas on their particular cloud. And then we also work with ISVs. A lot of these ISVs, some of them are legacy ISVs who are now realizing that rather deploying or offering an on-premise legacy solution, they have to be much more modern and offer a SaaS-based solution. So they are re-platforming their own product with MongoDB as the underlying data store. So, those are three examples of partnerships that we work with partners that we work with to help people migrate off legacy applications. My pleasure. Well, I would like to thank everyone for joining us today. I'm really proud of the strong execution this quarter in a difficult macro environment. As we discussed, we're making continued investments in product innovation that further establishes MongoDB as the preeminent independent modern data platform, and our differentiated value prop is really best on best-in-class technology, developer mind share, and platform independence; and this is resonating with both, our existing as well as new customers, and we're looking forward to finishing the year. So, thank you for joining us, and we'll talk to you soon."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Denyeau with ICR. Please go ahead sir.\nBrian Denyeau: Great. Thank you, Chuck. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review MongoDB's second quarter fiscal year 2021 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me on the call today are Dev Ittycheria, President and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market opportunity and future growth, our financial guidance, and the anticipated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the result of operations. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed in this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Brian and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our second quarter results before giving you a product and go-to-market update. Looking quickly at our second quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $138.3 million or 39% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 41% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew 66% year-over-year and now represents 44% of revenue, and we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 20,200 customers. These would be strong results in any environment, but are particularly notable during the global health and economic crisis. I'm especially proud of how our employees across all facets of the business have adapted to working in a remote environment and execute at a high level. Their passion and commitment to our customers and to the business in this difficult time have been outstanding. Over the past five years, we have conducted detailed employee engagement survey semiannually to understand how our employees feel about the company. Tellingly, in our most recent survey conducted in this past July, the scores in employee engagement and on their confidence in the company's future prospects were the highest ever recorded. Every business is quickly becoming a software business, which means the value proposition of any business is increasingly enabled, delivered, or defined by software. Consequently, a key unit of productivity of a business becomes a developer, as developers create enhanced applications that lead to a competitive advantage. Since our inception 13 years ago, we put the developer at the center of our universe, and we introduced a new class of database based on the document model or JSON. JSON is a data format that's easy for developers to read and write and machines to parse. We have always believed that JSON is the best way to work with data. As tech-savvy companies around the world adopted the document model, the industry took note. First, Microsoft, then AWS, and most recently, Oracle tried to emulate what we have done. Oracle recently made public statements that acknowledge that JSON has become the main data model for new applications and that developers love JSON because it provides support for dynamic schemas, consequently making it easy to make changes. I believe, it's noteworthy that the industry now agrees with our fundamental premise, the document model is simply the best way to work with data. Our mission continues to make it stunningly easy for software developers to work with data, wherever it resides, to drive innovation and create value. At MongoDB.live, our user conference held in June, we made significant product announcements -- several significant product announcements that further advance our mission. With the introduction of MongoDB 4.4, we delivered a number of additional feature enhancements that push the envelope of what it means to be a modern database, with new capabilities in our query language, layered on the most flexible distributed systems architecture anywhere, developers can build the most sophisticated transactional and analytical applications securely at scale. MongoDB Atlas Data Lake is now generally available and allows teams to query and analyze the structured and unstructured data in the S3 buckets using the MongoDB query language. Atlas Data Lake also supports federated queries, which means teams can submit single query and analyze operational data and Atlas alongside their data in S3. We announced the beta of Atlas Online Archive, which completely changes the economics of large data sets, by allowing users to define rules that automatically archive data from their Atlas database to low-cost cloud object storage. Best of all, customers retain the ability to seamlessly query their archive data with no extra effort. The general availability of Atlas search allows developers to deliver rich search experiences on top of their data in the cloud without needing to deploy, learn and manage a separate search technology. Atlas search uses the MongoDB query language and is fully managed. And finally, we unveiled MongoDB Realm, it combines the popular Realm mobile database we acquired last year and the serverless data access, data movement and data manipulation services formerly known as MongoDB Stitch. Our core component of MongoDB Realm is Realm Sync, which is available in public beta. This edge-to-cloud data synchronization service between Realm, mobile database on the front end and MongoDB Atlas on the back end solves one of the most challenging data problems for mobile developers. Our recent product announcements enable customers to use MongoDB for a broad set of use cases and represent a significant step forward on our journey to deliver the preeminent modern data platform for the developer. Our strong second quarter results reflect the fact that our go-to-market organization executed exceptionally well under challenging circumstances. It is in difficult times when world-class go-to-market organizations separate themselves from the mediocre ones, and we are proud of our team and our sophisticated approach to growing our business. Our second quarter results also demonstrate the increasing efficiency of our go-to-market efforts, as we are driving increased synergy across our four sales channels: our field sales force; the inside sales team; our self-service channel; and our partner organization. Starting with the self-serve channel, where over the past two years, we assembled a strong growth marketing team, built out processes and the infrastructure to scale our self-service business, and implemented a way to rapidly experiment and launch programs to increase the size and quality of our pipeline. We are pleased by the traction we're seeing, particularly in terms of acquiring new Atlas customers, which have achieved a third consecutive quarter of record growth. As our sophistication managing the self-serve business grows, we are finding ways to accelerate the growth of the overall Atlas business. We do this by identifying self-serve customers based on product usage signals that benefit from direct engagement with our sales organization. With more attention, service and support, we see a significant acceleration in customer spend. As we have become better at identifying the self-service customers with high-growth prospects, it has given our sales teams a more efficient way to prospect our self-service customer base. The end result is a self-serve channel that generates significant value on multiple levels as an important revenue generator in its own right and as a source of excellent leads for our inside and field sales teams. Turning to our inside and field sales teams. Over the past year, we have also gained conviction that new Atlas customers irrespective of their size, when given proper resources and support at the outset, grow rapidly. This is true not only for customers who transitioned from self-serve, but also for customers launching brand-new applications on Atlas or migrating their self-managed instances of community server onto our platform. As a result, we have adjusted our approach to increase the velocity of acquiring new customers. This year, prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, we changed the incentives of our sales team to focus more on landing new customers onto our platform and less on the initial size of -- on size of the initial commitment. Moreover, we are using our professional services organization strategically to set up customers for success early to give them more confidence in using MongoDB. The result is a third consecutive quarter of record customer growth with notable strength in our inside sales channel. Lastly, the partner organization is sourcing or influencing a growing percentage of our business, especially with cloud providers. We have seen strong momentum on deal activity with all 3 major cloud providers, and each cloud provider is providing more marketing dollars, adding more incentives for their salespeople to work closely with MongoDB and dedicating more headcount to better support and grow the partnership.  Given the fundamental advantages of the document model and the breadth of our product offering, customers recognize that MongoDB is the clear choice for their digital transformation plans. The combination of our leading modern data platform and our sophisticated go-to-market efforts allow us to deliver consistently strong performance. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some of the customer wins and interesting use cases from the second quarter. One of the world's largest telecommunications providers is currently developing a next-generation location service that can pinpoint mobile locations with centimeter level accuracy. Their need for a flexible data model with rich indexing and translytical capabilities and a data platform that can scale quickly led them to choose Atlas this quarter. Adair Group, the world's third largest holding company in consumer goods for do-it-yourself in decoration with an international network of 14 brands across 13 countries moved to Atlas in order to standardize app development among the developers and accelerate time to market as e-commerce demands grew during COVID-19. Agero, a leader in the digitalization of driver system services, serving more than 2/3 of insurance companies in the U.S. chose MongoDB to help power its next-generation of software-enabled driver safety services and technology. MongoDB Atlas has allowed them to move from one monolithic application to micro services and provide a better digital experience for the 115 million drivers they protect each year. Highspot, the sales enablement platform that makes every conversation count, helps customers worldwide empower their remote sales efforts, which is now more crucial than ever because of COVID-19. They recently standardized on MongoDB Atlas to drive strategic growth and improve customer satisfaction. Symphony, the cloud messaging and collaboration platform for the financial services industry chose MongoDB Atlas to support the evolution of their architecture and faster efficiencies. Atlas will allow them to adhere to crucial security policies and provide the best and most reliable experience to the customers at scale.  Lastly, one of the world's largest cloud providers has built a security solution on MongoDB that provides rich visibility, control over data traffic and sophisticated analytics to identify and combat cyber threats across their cloud services. This cloud providers increased its commitment to MongoDB making us the primary technology for handling immense workload and highly flexible yet secure environment.  In summary, we are very pleased with our performance in Q2, while the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, we are executing well and remain focused on the enormous opportunity that lies ahead. We continue investing to capture this opportunity, and in particular, recruiting world-class talent to help us maximize our potential. To that end, in the past weeks, we welcomed several important additions to our senior management team. Mark Porter joined us as our Chief Technology Officer in July. Most recently, CTO of Core Technologies and Transport at Grab, Mark is a 30-year veteran of the database industry. He is an early member of the Oracle Database Kernel Group and later was a General Manager of the AWS RDS business. Mark originally joined MongoDB as a Board member earlier this year, but he got excited about the opportunity in front of MongoDB and wanted to be directly involved. Very few people understand the relational database technology and its limitations better than Mark. So we're excited that he voted with his seat and joined the world's most popular modern database company in a senior leadership role. In early August, we welcomed Harsha Jalihal as our new Chief People Officer. Harsha is a seasoned HR executive has been the forefront of scaling large tech companies as well as managing complex enterprises. Most recently, Harsha was the Vice President of HR, Unilever and was responsible for delivering end-to-end HR strategy and operations for the U.S. business. Prior to that, she was an HR executive of the Cognizant during its hyper growth phase. Finally, mid-August, Rishi Dave joined us as Chief Marketing Officer. Rishi is a veteran technology and marketing executive with more than two decades of experience most recently at Vonage, where he was the company's Chief Marketing Officer. Prior to that, Rishi was CMO, Dun & Bradstreet, a cloud data and analytics provider and earlier had a senior leadership role driving Dell's digital marketing strategy. Harsha, Mark and Rishi joined a talented and dedicated senior management team that is performing at a high level as our Q2 results clearly demonstrate. We are excited for what we can all accomplish together as we continue disrupting one of the largest markets in software. With that, I'll turn it over now to Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our second quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2021. First, I'll start with our second quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $138.3 million, up 39% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $132.5 million, up 41% year-over-year. And professional services revenue was $5.8 million, up 11% year-over-year. To put our performance in the quarter into perspective, we thought it would be helpful to provide an update on how COVID-19 has impacted the growth of our business. First, let's talk about new business. The negative impact of COVID-19 on new business in Q2 was less than we had expected. As Dev explained, our various go-to-market teams had executed well in the first fully remote quarter since the pandemic started. Second, in Q1, we noted that we observed a slowdown in the growth in spending from our existing Atlas customers, particularly in the self-serve channel. In mid Q2, as the economies around the world started the gradual process of reopening, we saw an improvement in the rate of growth of our existing Atlas customers. While the trend still remains below historic levels, the improvement we experienced in Q2 increases our confidence that the slower than historical growth is simply a macro phenomenon. Overall, Atlas' strong performance continued to be the biggest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew over 66% in the quarter and now represents 44% of total revenue compared to 37% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 42% last quarter. During the second quarter, we grew our customer base by over 1,800 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 20,200, which is up from over 15,000 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 2,500 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,850 in the year ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 18,800 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 13,200 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net AR expansion rate above 120%, despite the impact of the macroeconomic environment. We ended the quarter with 118 customers, at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 622 in the year ago period. Moving down the P&L, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the second quarter was $99.7 million, representing a gross margin of 72% compared to 73% last quarter and 72% in the year ago period. Overall, we are pleased with our gross margin performance, which reflects greater efficiency and scale in our Atlas business. However, we continue to expect that we'll see some modest reduction in overall company gross margin as Atlas continues to be a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $10.2 million or a negative 7% operating margin for the second quarter compared to negative 15% margin in the year ago period. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was in part driven by revenue outperformance, but also by the timing of certain expenses that we now expect to incur in the second half of the year. Net loss in the second quarter was $12.7 million or $0.22 per share based on 58.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.26 per share on 55.6 million shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $975.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was negative $10 million. After taking into consideration approximately $5 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $15 million in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $13.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. I'd like to turn now to our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2021. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $137 million to $139 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $27 million to $25 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.45 based on 59.1 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2021, we are increasing our revenue guidance to $549 million to $554 million. We are improving our profitability expectations and now expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $71 million to $66 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to in the range of $1.29 to $1.21 based on 58.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. Let me provide some incremental color on how we're seeing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacting our outlook for the rest of the year. As we did in our Q4 and Q1 calls, let me start off by updating you on our underlying view on the business environment that's driving our guidance. In March, we expected COVID-19 to have a material impact only in the first half of the year. By June, we understood the impact would extend into the second half of fiscal 2021. At this point, we clearly we clearly believe that the impact of pandemic will extend at least through the end of this fiscal year. Starting with new business, our strong Q2 results notwithstanding, we do expect to see an impact on new business in the second half of the year, while customer engagement continues to be high, we expect macro uncertainty to be a factor. Furthermore, our forecast assumes we're continuing experiencing slower than historic growth from our existing Atlas customers, consistent with our results in Q2. Finally, as you will recall, our fourth quarter last year was a particularly strong quarter for our Enterprise Advanced product. Enterprise Advanced has an immediate impact on revenue due to the fact that under ASC 606, we recognize the term license component upfront. That dynamic makes Q4, in particular, a tough compare for us. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent second quarter results. We're executing well on our product and go-to-market strategies, which is generating strong growth at scale. We believe our clear leadership as the modern data platform of choice will enable us to continue delivering strong growth going forward. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question, and congratulations on a very impressive quarter. Very impressive in terms of the momentum that you guys are keeping up is on both sort of the top line in terms of the nice growth that you saw there, as well as operationally in terms of those hires that you guys are able to get is both very impressive. One of the numbers in particular that I wanted to ask you about that really popped out news, the number of new customer additions that we saw in the quarter. It looks like over 1,800 new customers. And that's frankly, the biggest number that I have on my spreadsheet here, of you guys ever historically adding in what is admittedly a very difficult IT spending environment. So Dev, for you, is there any change in kind of like go-to-market or sort of a better motion like you're talking about in self service? Like what's driving that strength and sort of that upper momentum that we're seeing in those new customer adds?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Thanks, Keith. We're obviously very pleased with the customer additions for the quarter. I would tell you that, we made some changes to sales incentives at the beginning of the year prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, where we made a conscious decision that we just wanted to accelerate the acquisition of new customers this year. And we decided that because we saw how customers grew really, really quickly, once they got into our platform and, in particular, on Atlas. And because we saw that growth happen .We said, gosh, why we just focus more on acquiring new customers and they natural will grow more. And so before we would force -- force made a strong word, we would incentivize our salespeople to get upfront commitments and for many customers, they're not completely sure one of the platform to how quickly their workloads will grow, how much data they\u2019ll have, how many users they have. So it ended up being a bit of a adding a little bit more friction to the sales process, because you had to naturally -- they had to naturally try and convince the customer to make some form of commitment. Because we took that objection away, we've just seen, frankly, it's unleashed, the productivity of salespeople. It's cut down the cycle time of some deals because avoiding that negotiation allows them to get on the platform more quickly and allows us both on the direct side and even on the self-serve side to just add a lot more new customers.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. That makes a ton of sense. And then, Mike, a question for you, and this is related to the guidance. The implied -- like Q4 guide, if we take the full year, I mean, we subtract out to Q3, it looks for a pretty sharp slowdown in overall revenue growth. I just want to make sure, it sounds like a lot of that is kind of like the tough comp that you have from strong EA a year ago period. Is there a also sort of an aspect of mix shift in terms of the mix that you expect to be so much more on the subscription side and sort of the new business coming to Atlas versus that EA and that's also kind of impacting the year-on-year growth dynamic for total revenues as we get into Q4?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So thanks for the question, Keith. So overall, I think we have a very healthy outlook, despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. But as we've indicated, we certainly expect to continue to see or to see some impact on new business in the macroeconomic environment. We're also expecting to continue to see the Atlas consumption expansion at lower levels than we've had historically consistent with Q2. And obviously, as you go later in the year that also compounds. And the last factor, which you did call out is the tough compare. We called out last year in the Q4 that it was a particularly strong quarter for enterprise advance. And actually, even in that quarterly call, we talked about one large multiyear customer that represented about $3.5 million just from that one customer of Q4 of last year. And so just for those following the bouncing ball, not only do you lose that from the denominator or do you need to take that of the denominator, but you also don't get the benefit of that in this year in the numerator. But overall, I think we are liking the dialogues that we're seeing is an incredible relevance, but there is macroeconomic uncertainty in the back half of the year.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Thank you very much guys.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks Keith.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. One for Dev and a follow-up for Michael. Dev, I wanted to kind of drill down on the record number of new customers as well. And maybe take a slightly different spin here. On one hand, I certainly appreciate that the self-service kind of investments and focus there over the last year that you've made, that's clearly having an impact. It sounds like there's some incentives with the sales force that seems to be resonating and lowering some adoption kind of varies as well. But is there also an industry shift? My real question here is, is the product resonating in this current environment kind of post-COVID in ways you did necessarily expect? Or would you say most of the performance this quarter was all kind of internal execution? Just parse, how much of the industry is changing and the appetite for Mongo changing versus kind of just internal execution, which again was very strong?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, thanks for the question, Brent. I would say it's a bit of both. I would say that in general, what we're seeing is customers are really gravitating to modern technology stack that allows them to be very nimble, move quickly, innovate fast. And so obviously, MongoDB plays to that strength. Second; that they do want to focus on work that adds value to the business and basically outsource all the undifferentiated work, so managing a database is not exactly going to give them a competitive advantage. And third, given our platform offers them a lot of choice with offerings to allow them to run their workloads across the 3 different providers that gives them also more confidence in terms of betting on Atlas. So I think that's one clear dimension. And then we have actually, I think, as I said in the opening remarks, we put a lot of focus on our go-to-market efforts. In fact, I would say, as much thought and effort we put into our product, we do the same in our go-to-market efforts. And so, what I think you're seeing is, the strong execution on -- across our 4 channels. And as I indicated in the last question, we have slightly modified. This is just a tweak. It's not a major modification, slightly modified some of the incentives to really make it easy for customers to engage with us and get on the platform quickly. And that's really yielded the results that we've seen.\nBrent Bracelin: Certainly, some is working there and working well in the current environment. I guess Michael here just for you as a follow-up. You talked about kind of the COVID impact in the second half and gave a little more color on the tough compare on EA. But as you think about the pipeline, would you say the pipeline of new business looking out in the second half is also slightly kind of depressed? Or are you assuming just a lower close assumption in the second half pipeline, given all of the uncertainty out there? Just trying to parse out how much of your commentary on the business being impacted in the second half is tied to pipeline or just assumed close rates being lower given all the uncertainty out there?\nMichael Gordon: Yes, sure. No, totally understand. No, we feel very good about the engagement that we're seeing with customers. But I think in the face of the macroeconomic environment, it makes sense to factor that in. We've got one quarter under our belt fully remotely. And I think we feel really well about how the team has done. But the situation with COVID-19 and the overall kind of coordinated global slowdowns and openings and whole things is unprecedented. So I'm incredibly proud of how people have adapted. But this is not a playbook where you sort of said it, you've nailed it and then you forget it, there's a lot operationally to focus on. So very proud of what the team does, but -- and how that we've done. But I think when you look out at the second half of the year it's hard not to assume that the macro won't have an impact.\nBrent Bracelin: Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, congrats from me as well. Two quick questions; one for the -- if you look at -- like if you kind of start working with larger customers, there's obviously like there's an application that usually kind of sits there and then the Mongo database is the one that kind of powers it then. And what you see in terms of people's interest? There's a lot of talk about digital transformation, but then with COVID, you have like industries that obviously are not doing so well. Like what are you see in terms of like then that's kind of interest to kind of do more stuff or realization, we need to do more stuff and then in the fact, like engaging with you on that, I would assume that's kind of a multi-quarter story here that it should be starting to unfold. But I'm just wondering if you see some of that already. And then I had a follow-up for Mike.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. There's no question that what COVID-19 has done is forced every customer no matter how traditional or critical legacy they were to be digital by default. So whether you're a traditional retailer, you have to quickly build out your e-commerce channel. If you're in a different type of business, you have to figure out a way to engage with your customers in a digital kind of format and approach. And so that obviously plays to our strength. One, customers can innovate and build very, very quickly on MongoDB. They can also scale it very well compared to all the other legacy platforms. Two, Atlas becomes very attractive because we take care of all the management of the database and the underlying infrastructure. So that makes it very attractive for allowing the customer to really focus on what's important to them. And then as I said, multi-cloud plays a big role, depending on what the customer is trying to do, what geo coverage they need, what existing relationships they have with certain cloud provider, etcetera. They have ultimate choice in terms of who they -- what underlying cloud provider to use with Atlas. So all those three things play in our favor. And I think what COVID has done is really accelerated long-term trends. We're always very bullish about the future. But the long-term trends are clearly accelerating and we're trying to capitalize on it.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. That makes total sense. And then one for Mike. Mike, I hear you on the Q4 situation. But if I look at your Q3 guidance, it also kind of looks for kind of flat quarter-on-quarter, which is something we haven't seen. Is there anything in Q3 on the comps, etcetera or EA that you wanted to point out?\nMichael Gordon: No. I think in Q3, the key thing is we've got a very healthy outlook and strong customer engagement, but just a lot of macro uncertainty that we've incorporated into the forecast, which has been consistent with our general approach each quarter is to sort of mark the current state of the macroeconomic landscape as best we can to market and incorporate that into our thought process, but from an overall engagement perspective, quite strong. And we expect to see an impact on new business that, obviously, particularly with the Enterprise Advanced product has impact in terms of revenue, from term license revenue and we're assuming that Atlas is still expanding at below historic levels, consistent with Q2.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nHeather Bellini: Thanks guys for taking the question. Just had a couple of quick ones. In regards to your comments about Atlas and the consumption, you're starting to see existing customer consumption start to come back, is there a sense you could give us for how far off you think it is from where you were pre-COVID? And how long you think that takes to come back? I know that's a tough question, given the macro environment, but I'll start with that one, and then I just had a follow-up.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. Yes. Thanks Heather. I would go back to our commentary on the Q1 call where we talked about it being sort of modest but broad-based and tracking the macro economy overall, where we sort of across region, across sector, et cetera, et cetera. And that what we said is in Q2 -- in the middle of Q2, we saw a rebound or an improvement in those lower levels that clearly at least to us when you look at all the data and we slice and dice, it indicates that it's tied to overall economic conditions. It's not quite yet back to historic levels, and it would be very hard for me to predict when or how that would happen. But I think the correlations that we've clearly seen is it's broadly tied to macroeconomic behavior, which would make sense, given both the broad-based nature of the behavior, but also the broad-based nature of the fact that it's a database application and it's a consumption revenue model, and so all those things should mirror each other. And that's what we're seeing.\nHeather Bellini: Okay. And then the follow-up question would be, just wondering from -- if your customers still might be asking for -- if you're seeing kind of request for payment extensions or anything like that or are you doing anything -- anything else creative on kind of top of funnel builds that might be helping down the line? So, I guess, two other ones, sorry.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. No, no, that's fine. So, we saw a very limited and isolated instance of that in Q1, but that has effectively worked its way through, taking care of itself, those folks have come and cleared. And frequency of requests or anything like that has really dried up. So, we saw a little bit of right as the crisis was for sort of setting in, but it's not been a regular recurring sort of business consideration that we've had to deal with.\nHeather Bellini: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question will come from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Dev, as you think about the evolution of the go-to-market and the acceleration in smaller Atlas customers upfront, coupled with a much broader product portfolio, is there any reason to think that your net dollar expansion rate shouldn't accelerate in coming years?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So, I think just to make clear why we're doing that. We have seen Atlas customers grow very, very quickly. And one of the reasons we want to get them on the platform is really condition them so that they don't begin to think about even managing the next new app by themselves. So, once they get condition on building every new app on Atlas that becomes almost the standard way of people building and deploying applications. So, there's a long-term effect of that. It's hard for me to sit here in terms of what the implications will be on the net expansion rate. They've always been very healthy and we don't see any potential change to that.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jason Ader with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJason Ader: Yes. Thank you. Dev, when you look at the database market, we're still seeing good traction for relational products and I'm thinking of like MongoDB, in particular, where do you think that traction is coming from, especially, as the document model seems to be gaining significant share?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, what I would say is there's really two phenomenons. There's what I call a phenomenon of lift and shift where customers just want to get off the legacy vendor, in most cases, it's something like Oracle, where they don't want to pay the Oracle tax anymore and go to an open source relational database. And that's what many people call the lift-and-shift phenomenon. Many customers naively believe that, that will allow them to just keep running their business. What they missed though is that, they missed the opportunity to refactor that application and really modernize it to position themselves to really take advantages -- take advantage of all the new capabilities of a distributed platform and take advantage of other things like micro service and so forth. And so we have many customers who decide, you know what, rather than just lifting and shifting, we want to replatform and basically choose MongoDB as the solution -- the destination solution. So, it really depends on -- how quickly the customers want to move their perceptions of how difficult it is to move off the, say, Oracle to a distributed database like MongoDB, how enabled they are versus -- and also how much time pressure they're in. So, that's why we're expanding our reach, working with systems integrators, working with our partners and obviously, own sales force to get out there and really explain the benefits of MongoDB and the fact that whatever perception they have, we can address to make the choice of making MongoDB that much more easy.\nJason Ader: Do you think the current environment will change those dynamics at all in terms of those phenomenon? In other words, maybe move people faster to the modernization of replatforming phenomenon?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, I think when we first came out a lot of people viewed us as an interesting, but niche solution, maybe just use for a certain set of use cases. I think we've clearly shown that MongoDB can serve the most demanding customers anywhere in the world for a wide variety of use cases, and that's only increasing. So, I think people are recognizing and as I mentioned, all the major players today have had to acknowledge that JSON is the format and the structure that developers like to use that the document model is truly the best way to work with data and the added benefits of our distributed capabilities, it's so easy to scale out using a distributed platform like MongoDB than, say, staying on a relational platform and having to do a lot of gymnastics to get the application to scale. And so I think it does take time, but we've clearly seen customers recognize and use us for very, very sophisticated applications.\nJason Ader: Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Hey thanks. And good evening Mike and Dev. Michael I just wanted to start with you in trying to understand the accelerating customer adds here. And it sounds like you did make some tweaks so that your sales incentives to prioritize adding new customers. But I wanted to just kind of better understand the financial impacts here? I mean, are they -- are you landing customers -- new customers at a lower ASP and then hoping that those expands are higher down the road? Maybe just help me understand that? And then how we should think about just kind of the accelerating new customer adds translating into higher revenue growth -- or how to think through the financial impacts of that?\nMichael Gordon: Sure. Yes. There are a couple of different factors and flavors of it. You can slice it sort of by channel or you can slice it by product. I'll try to do both relatively quickly. If you look at it on a channel basis, it's really just improvements in the returns from the investments that we're making in the self serve. Self-serve customers, as you know, come on at $5,000 or $6,000 in annualized spend. And so -- and the unit economics are very attractive of that given the cohort behavior. And as Dev mentioned in their prepared remarks, we're continuing to get better in terms of the muscle and introducing more of the DNA there. And we've been pleased with the results that we've had, and so that shows up in self-serve customer additions.  On the direct sales side, we've also made some sort of refinements to making it easier for customers to use the platform. And as Dev was mentioning in response to one of the earlier questions, rather than a salesperson being focused on maximizing the magnitude of the initial commitment, we know based on the data and the cohort behavior for Atlas customers that getting them on the platform is the most critical thing because then usage will expand from there. And so we've decreased some of the customer-related friction in terms of getting folks on the platform, which just makes it easier for people to adapt and then what's getting paid for the consumption over time rather than try to get paid on some maximum initial commitment. And we're also seeing really good success there. So customers from -- to the revenue question, customers will start off or may start off consuming less. I think from a revenue perspective, it doesn't really matter because even if someone made a big commitment, their initial consumption still is small. And so from a revenue consumption perspective, the dynamics will generally be the same. It will be different in terms of like how much do we bill upfront or some of those things that aren't areas that we focus on, but there are things that sometimes investors focus on. And so that's one of the other reasons why we call it the dynamic, just so people can understand that.\nTyler Radke: Okay. And then -- most of what we're talking about, just back to the product view of things. Most of what we're talking about really is sort of Atlas related and sort of Atlas centered, there's certainly in any given quarter, mix and variability between what the ultimate list of deals looks like in a given quarter, but the piece that we're talking out here really Altas centric?\nMichael Gordon: Right. So the acceleration is mainly coming from Atlas, which I think we can see in there.\nDev Ittycheria: And Tyler, what I would also add is that, it's not lost on us and that in difficult times, most companies gravitate to selling to the existing install base and as we've talked about many times in the past, we do have a land and expand strategy. So our sales force could easily do that. But we thought just myopically focusing on existing installed base would be a mistake because we do see a big market opportunity. And the added benefit of engaging with them earlier is that, you just condition them to start using Atlas as the default platform by which they build their applications. So that ends up building a long-term durable relationship with those customers.\nTyler Radke: Yes, that makes sense. And just a follow-up for you, Dev. I would just love to get your view on Oracle's autonomous JSON service. I know you briefly touched on it in the prepared remarks. But curious if you have a view on why you think Oracle introduced the service? Like do you think it's in response to greater competitive pressure that they're seeing from you guys? And then, I would just love to hear if you have a view on the pricing claims from Oracle that it's 30% cheaper?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Sure. So, a couple of points. One, they provide a support for JSON in 2014, but what they recently announced was support for JSON on their autonomous database in the cloud. One, it only runs in their cloud. Two, much like what Microsoft did with Cosmos and AWS DocumentDB, it's really built on top of a relational database. So it's basically a shim that basically tries to allow developers to more easily use JSON, but the back end is basically the same old engine. And so, there're some severe feature limitations. One simple example is that, because it's basically a JSON blob, you really can't even parse numeric data. It's all basically text. And so, there're some severe limitations in terms of how you can use those features. And obviously, because it's built on a relational back end, there's also a huge set of implications around performance. To the latter part of your question, this is really in response to the fact that developers are recognizing and are acknowledging that it's so much easier to use JSON or by definition, documents to work with data. It's so much easier to code. It's so much more natural. It's much more intuitive. It's much more flexible. And Oracle basically acknowledged that. And so, we believe that, as the world moves more and more towards using documents, we are well positioned. And, obviously, we've been competing with clones for quite some time, and I think we've done quite well.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Jack Andrews with Needham & Company. Please, go ahead.\nJack Andrews: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to ask a couple of product questions. First, I was curious if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of the uptake of Search so far within your customer base? And any context around changes in consumption patterns?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So, just so we're clear, we made these products generally available in June of this past year. And so it's very, very early days. We're quite excited about the uptake so far. And the reason, just to remind everyone why we introduced Search, is we actually had customers telling us, we much rather stay on one platform than to have to go learn, build and maintain a separate platform. And our Atlas Search product is obviously fully managed as well and takes -- you can take advantage of all the features like [indiscernible] that you could before with the regular database server. So it's still early days, but we're very pleased with the results to-date. And as we get more focused and attention from the sales force on this, we feel quite good about the trends of the business.\nJack Andrews: That's great. And then just as a follow-up, how should we be thinking about the monetization opportunity around Realm? And just trying to get a sense for what proportion of your customers do you think need those -- the full capabilities between Realm and with the cross-sell with the Atlas?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So the reason we acquired the Realm mobile database and now have built a tight coupling between the mobile front end and the Atlas back end is to really enable developers to take advantage of a much more powerful format. Realm's architecture is very similar to the MongoDB architecture. Mobile developers find very, very useful to use the Realm mobile database. Realm itself is not meant to be a revenue generator onto itself. It's really in to enable mobile developers to think about using Realm and Atlas first because allowed it to move that much more quickly. So, what you'll see in terms of revenue impact will be more on the Atlas consumption at the back end versus like us trying to monetize the front end. Typically, the mobile database, the client side is given away for free and our approach is to really enable developers to build very, very sophisticated applications and one of the key features, Realm Sync, which is still in beta, really simplifies the work a developer has to do to be able synchronize data between the client side and the server side. As you can imagine, with people using mobile devices, or other devices that are not tethered to a direct network, there's always a chance that you could be offline and so being able to quickly synchronize data between the two -- between the front end and the back end become very, very important and developers have to incur an enormous amount of complexity and cost to be able to do that manually. And so offering this capability will make our capability will make our developers' life that much more easy and will make our platform that much more compelling.\nJack Andrews: Got it. Thanks for the color and congratulations on the results.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks Jack.\nOperator: Our next question will come Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nJoey Marincek: Great. Thank you. This is Joey Marincek on for Pat. Dev, just one high-level one for you. I want to touch on the employee engagement survey, you mentioned how do make MongoDB a place people want to work at and then keep them engaged, especially in the current work-from-home environment? Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. Well, thank you for that question. I mean, for a business like MongoDB, our success is directly correlated to our ability to attract and keep great employees, both on the product and engineering side as well as on the go-to-market side and obviously, as well as the people who support the entire business. And so we were very intentional when COVID-19 happened to really be very transparent with employees about what we're doing. Now, candidly, we were in a very healthy financial position. And while we did worry that there might be some short-term impacts to the business, we weren't changing our posture or potentially laying off anyone. So, I think there's two questions that have impacted anyone in COVID. One, can you -- do you still have a job? And two, can you do your job safely? Those two questions at MongoDB have been an unequivocal, yes. And more importantly, we really communicated to all our employees about making sure they were clear on their priorities, making sure that our leaders were clear with their teams about what was important, making sure that they understood where we're going in terms of what we're trying to do, making sure that we made it very easy for them to work in from a work-from-home environment without much disruption. And we've also been sensitive to the fact that working from home for many people is very challenging, especially if you have young kids at home or you don't have ample private workspace at home. And so we've been very flexible with employees to make sure that they can take the time off, work flexible hours, et cetera. And I think we are also really live our values. And that's another way of saying, we really try and create a culture where people feel like that this is a great place to work that they're respected, no matter who they are, that they can not just have a job, but a career, and that we want to set them up for success. And so we tried to do that. We're very grateful for what our employees have done since COVID. Our results are, obviously, a reflection of that, and we've been hiring aggressively. And so we're very focused on on-boarding those new employees to make sure that they get quickly inculcated into the culture.\nJoey Marincek: Awesome. Thank you. Congrats.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dev Ittycheria for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. I just want to wrap by saying that, I'm really proud of the strong execution this quarter in a difficult macro environment. We've also expanded our product portfolio to really increase our lead as the preeminent to the data platform on the developer. As we discussed, we've had a record direct and self-serve customer additions, demonstrating that our strategy of adding new customers is working. And lastly, we're pursuing a big market opportunity and COVID is only accelerating long-term trends. So thank you for your time. And we'll talk to you soon. Take care. Bye-bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our second quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2021. First, I'll start with our second quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $138.3 million, up 39% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $132.5 million, up 41% year-over-year. And professional services revenue was $5.8 million, up 11% year-over-year. To put our performance in the quarter into perspective, we thought it would be helpful to provide an update on how COVID-19 has impacted the growth of our business. First, let's talk about new business. The negative impact of COVID-19 on new business in Q2 was less than we had expected. As Dev explained, our various go-to-market teams had executed well in the first fully remote quarter since the pandemic started. Second, in Q1, we noted that we observed a slowdown in the growth in spending from our existing Atlas customers, particularly in the self-serve channel. In mid Q2, as the economies around the world started the gradual process of reopening, we saw an improvement in the rate of growth of our existing Atlas customers. While the trend still remains below historic levels, the improvement we experienced in Q2 increases our confidence that the slower than historical growth is simply a macro phenomenon. Overall, Atlas' strong performance continued to be the biggest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew over 66% in the quarter and now represents 44% of total revenue compared to 37% in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and 42% last quarter. During the second quarter, we grew our customer base by over 1,800 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 20,200, which is up from over 15,000 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 2,500 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,850 in the year ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 18,800 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 13,200 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net AR expansion rate above 120%, despite the impact of the macroeconomic environment. We ended the quarter with 118 customers, at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 622 in the year ago period. Moving down the P&L, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the second quarter was $99.7 million, representing a gross margin of 72% compared to 73% last quarter and 72% in the year ago period. Overall, we are pleased with our gross margin performance, which reflects greater efficiency and scale in our Atlas business. However, we continue to expect that we'll see some modest reduction in overall company gross margin as Atlas continues to be a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $10.2 million or a negative 7% operating margin for the second quarter compared to negative 15% margin in the year ago period. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was in part driven by revenue outperformance, but also by the timing of certain expenses that we now expect to incur in the second half of the year. Net loss in the second quarter was $12.7 million or $0.22 per share based on 58.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.26 per share on 55.6 million shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $975.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was negative $10 million. After taking into consideration approximately $5 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $15 million in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $13.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. I'd like to turn now to our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2021. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $137 million to $139 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $27 million to $25 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.45 based on 59.1 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2021, we are increasing our revenue guidance to $549 million to $554 million. We are improving our profitability expectations and now expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $71 million to $66 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to in the range of $1.29 to $1.21 based on 58.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. Let me provide some incremental color on how we're seeing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacting our outlook for the rest of the year. As we did in our Q4 and Q1 calls, let me start off by updating you on our underlying view on the business environment that's driving our guidance. In March, we expected COVID-19 to have a material impact only in the first half of the year. By June, we understood the impact would extend into the second half of fiscal 2021. At this point, we clearly we clearly believe that the impact of pandemic will extend at least through the end of this fiscal year. Starting with new business, our strong Q2 results notwithstanding, we do expect to see an impact on new business in the second half of the year, while customer engagement continues to be high, we expect macro uncertainty to be a factor. Furthermore, our forecast assumes we're continuing experiencing slower than historic growth from our existing Atlas customers, consistent with our results in Q2. Finally, as you will recall, our fourth quarter last year was a particularly strong quarter for our Enterprise Advanced product. Enterprise Advanced has an immediate impact on revenue due to the fact that under ASC 606, we recognize the term license component upfront. That dynamic makes Q4, in particular, a tough compare for us. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent second quarter results. We're executing well on our product and go-to-market strategies, which is generating strong growth at scale. We believe our clear leadership as the modern data platform of choice will enable us to continue delivering strong growth going forward. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Yes. So thanks for the question, Keith. So overall, I think we have a very healthy outlook, despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. But as we've indicated, we certainly expect to continue to see or to see some impact on new business in the macroeconomic environment. We're also expecting to continue to see the Atlas consumption expansion at lower levels than we've had historically consistent with Q2. And obviously, as you go later in the year that also compounds. And the last factor, which you did call out is the tough compare. We called out last year in the Q4 that it was a particularly strong quarter for enterprise advance. And actually, even in that quarterly call, we talked about one large multiyear customer that represented about $3.5 million just from that one customer of Q4 of last year. And so just for those following the bouncing ball, not only do you lose that from the denominator or do you need to take that of the denominator, but you also don't get the benefit of that in this year in the numerator. But overall, I think we are liking the dialogues that we're seeing is an incredible relevance, but there is macroeconomic uncertainty in the back half of the year. Thanks Keith. Yes, sure. No, totally understand. No, we feel very good about the engagement that we're seeing with customers. But I think in the face of the macroeconomic environment, it makes sense to factor that in. We've got one quarter under our belt fully remotely. And I think we feel really well about how the team has done. But the situation with COVID-19 and the overall kind of coordinated global slowdowns and openings and whole things is unprecedented. So I'm incredibly proud of how people have adapted. But this is not a playbook where you sort of said it, you've nailed it and then you forget it, there's a lot operationally to focus on. So very proud of what the team does, but -- and how that we've done. But I think when you look out at the second half of the year it's hard not to assume that the macro won't have an impact. No. I think in Q3, the key thing is we've got a very healthy outlook and strong customer engagement, but just a lot of macro uncertainty that we've incorporated into the forecast, which has been consistent with our general approach each quarter is to sort of mark the current state of the macroeconomic landscape as best we can to market and incorporate that into our thought process, but from an overall engagement perspective, quite strong. And we expect to see an impact on new business that, obviously, particularly with the Enterprise Advanced product has impact in terms of revenue, from term license revenue and we're assuming that Atlas is still expanding at below historic levels, consistent with Q2. Sure. Yes. There are a couple of different factors and flavors of it. You can slice it sort of by channel or you can slice it by product. I'll try to do both relatively quickly. If you look at it on a channel basis, it's really just improvements in the returns from the investments that we're making in the self serve. Self-serve customers, as you know, come on at $5,000 or $6,000 in annualized spend. And so -- and the unit economics are very attractive of that given the cohort behavior. And as Dev mentioned in their prepared remarks, we're continuing to get better in terms of the muscle and introducing more of the DNA there. And we've been pleased with the results that we've had, and so that shows up in self-serve customer additions.  On the direct sales side, we've also made some sort of refinements to making it easier for customers to use the platform. And as Dev was mentioning in response to one of the earlier questions, rather than a salesperson being focused on maximizing the magnitude of the initial commitment, we know based on the data and the cohort behavior for Atlas customers that getting them on the platform is the most critical thing because then usage will expand from there. And so we've decreased some of the customer-related friction in terms of getting folks on the platform, which just makes it easier for people to adapt and then what's getting paid for the consumption over time rather than try to get paid on some maximum initial commitment. And we're also seeing really good success there. So customers from -- to the revenue question, customers will start off or may start off consuming less. I think from a revenue perspective, it doesn't really matter because even if someone made a big commitment, their initial consumption still is small. And so from a revenue consumption perspective, the dynamics will generally be the same. It will be different in terms of like how much do we bill upfront or some of those things that aren't areas that we focus on, but there are things that sometimes investors focus on. And so that's one of the other reasons why we call it the dynamic, just so people can understand that. Right. So the acceleration is mainly coming from Atlas, which I think we can see in there."

            "name": "Dev Ittycheria",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our second quarter results before giving you a product and go-to-market update. Looking quickly at our second quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $138.3 million or 39% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 41% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew 66% year-over-year and now represents 44% of revenue, and we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 20,200 customers. These would be strong results in any environment, but are particularly notable during the global health and economic crisis. I'm especially proud of how our employees across all facets of the business have adapted to working in a remote environment and execute at a high level. Their passion and commitment to our customers and to the business in this difficult time have been outstanding. Over the past five years, we have conducted detailed employee engagement survey semiannually to understand how our employees feel about the company. Tellingly, in our most recent survey conducted in this past July, the scores in employee engagement and on their confidence in the company's future prospects were the highest ever recorded. Every business is quickly becoming a software business, which means the value proposition of any business is increasingly enabled, delivered, or defined by software. Consequently, a key unit of productivity of a business becomes a developer, as developers create enhanced applications that lead to a competitive advantage. Since our inception 13 years ago, we put the developer at the center of our universe, and we introduced a new class of database based on the document model or JSON. JSON is a data format that's easy for developers to read and write and machines to parse. We have always believed that JSON is the best way to work with data. As tech-savvy companies around the world adopted the document model, the industry took note. First, Microsoft, then AWS, and most recently, Oracle tried to emulate what we have done. Oracle recently made public statements that acknowledge that JSON has become the main data model for new applications and that developers love JSON because it provides support for dynamic schemas, consequently making it easy to make changes. I believe, it's noteworthy that the industry now agrees with our fundamental premise, the document model is simply the best way to work with data. Our mission continues to make it stunningly easy for software developers to work with data, wherever it resides, to drive innovation and create value. At MongoDB.live, our user conference held in June, we made significant product announcements -- several significant product announcements that further advance our mission. With the introduction of MongoDB 4.4, we delivered a number of additional feature enhancements that push the envelope of what it means to be a modern database, with new capabilities in our query language, layered on the most flexible distributed systems architecture anywhere, developers can build the most sophisticated transactional and analytical applications securely at scale. MongoDB Atlas Data Lake is now generally available and allows teams to query and analyze the structured and unstructured data in the S3 buckets using the MongoDB query language. Atlas Data Lake also supports federated queries, which means teams can submit single query and analyze operational data and Atlas alongside their data in S3. We announced the beta of Atlas Online Archive, which completely changes the economics of large data sets, by allowing users to define rules that automatically archive data from their Atlas database to low-cost cloud object storage. Best of all, customers retain the ability to seamlessly query their archive data with no extra effort. The general availability of Atlas search allows developers to deliver rich search experiences on top of their data in the cloud without needing to deploy, learn and manage a separate search technology. Atlas search uses the MongoDB query language and is fully managed. And finally, we unveiled MongoDB Realm, it combines the popular Realm mobile database we acquired last year and the serverless data access, data movement and data manipulation services formerly known as MongoDB Stitch. Our core component of MongoDB Realm is Realm Sync, which is available in public beta. This edge-to-cloud data synchronization service between Realm, mobile database on the front end and MongoDB Atlas on the back end solves one of the most challenging data problems for mobile developers. Our recent product announcements enable customers to use MongoDB for a broad set of use cases and represent a significant step forward on our journey to deliver the preeminent modern data platform for the developer. Our strong second quarter results reflect the fact that our go-to-market organization executed exceptionally well under challenging circumstances. It is in difficult times when world-class go-to-market organizations separate themselves from the mediocre ones, and we are proud of our team and our sophisticated approach to growing our business. Our second quarter results also demonstrate the increasing efficiency of our go-to-market efforts, as we are driving increased synergy across our four sales channels: our field sales force; the inside sales team; our self-service channel; and our partner organization. Starting with the self-serve channel, where over the past two years, we assembled a strong growth marketing team, built out processes and the infrastructure to scale our self-service business, and implemented a way to rapidly experiment and launch programs to increase the size and quality of our pipeline. We are pleased by the traction we're seeing, particularly in terms of acquiring new Atlas customers, which have achieved a third consecutive quarter of record growth. As our sophistication managing the self-serve business grows, we are finding ways to accelerate the growth of the overall Atlas business. We do this by identifying self-serve customers based on product usage signals that benefit from direct engagement with our sales organization. With more attention, service and support, we see a significant acceleration in customer spend. As we have become better at identifying the self-service customers with high-growth prospects, it has given our sales teams a more efficient way to prospect our self-service customer base. The end result is a self-serve channel that generates significant value on multiple levels as an important revenue generator in its own right and as a source of excellent leads for our inside and field sales teams. Turning to our inside and field sales teams. Over the past year, we have also gained conviction that new Atlas customers irrespective of their size, when given proper resources and support at the outset, grow rapidly. This is true not only for customers who transitioned from self-serve, but also for customers launching brand-new applications on Atlas or migrating their self-managed instances of community server onto our platform. As a result, we have adjusted our approach to increase the velocity of acquiring new customers. This year, prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, we changed the incentives of our sales team to focus more on landing new customers onto our platform and less on the initial size of -- on size of the initial commitment. Moreover, we are using our professional services organization strategically to set up customers for success early to give them more confidence in using MongoDB. The result is a third consecutive quarter of record customer growth with notable strength in our inside sales channel. Lastly, the partner organization is sourcing or influencing a growing percentage of our business, especially with cloud providers. We have seen strong momentum on deal activity with all 3 major cloud providers, and each cloud provider is providing more marketing dollars, adding more incentives for their salespeople to work closely with MongoDB and dedicating more headcount to better support and grow the partnership.  Given the fundamental advantages of the document model and the breadth of our product offering, customers recognize that MongoDB is the clear choice for their digital transformation plans. The combination of our leading modern data platform and our sophisticated go-to-market efforts allow us to deliver consistently strong performance. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some of the customer wins and interesting use cases from the second quarter. One of the world's largest telecommunications providers is currently developing a next-generation location service that can pinpoint mobile locations with centimeter level accuracy. Their need for a flexible data model with rich indexing and translytical capabilities and a data platform that can scale quickly led them to choose Atlas this quarter. Adair Group, the world's third largest holding company in consumer goods for do-it-yourself in decoration with an international network of 14 brands across 13 countries moved to Atlas in order to standardize app development among the developers and accelerate time to market as e-commerce demands grew during COVID-19. Agero, a leader in the digitalization of driver system services, serving more than 2/3 of insurance companies in the U.S. chose MongoDB to help power its next-generation of software-enabled driver safety services and technology. MongoDB Atlas has allowed them to move from one monolithic application to micro services and provide a better digital experience for the 115 million drivers they protect each year. Highspot, the sales enablement platform that makes every conversation count, helps customers worldwide empower their remote sales efforts, which is now more crucial than ever because of COVID-19. They recently standardized on MongoDB Atlas to drive strategic growth and improve customer satisfaction. Symphony, the cloud messaging and collaboration platform for the financial services industry chose MongoDB Atlas to support the evolution of their architecture and faster efficiencies. Atlas will allow them to adhere to crucial security policies and provide the best and most reliable experience to the customers at scale.  Lastly, one of the world's largest cloud providers has built a security solution on MongoDB that provides rich visibility, control over data traffic and sophisticated analytics to identify and combat cyber threats across their cloud services. This cloud providers increased its commitment to MongoDB making us the primary technology for handling immense workload and highly flexible yet secure environment.  In summary, we are very pleased with our performance in Q2, while the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, we are executing well and remain focused on the enormous opportunity that lies ahead. We continue investing to capture this opportunity, and in particular, recruiting world-class talent to help us maximize our potential. To that end, in the past weeks, we welcomed several important additions to our senior management team. Mark Porter joined us as our Chief Technology Officer in July. Most recently, CTO of Core Technologies and Transport at Grab, Mark is a 30-year veteran of the database industry. He is an early member of the Oracle Database Kernel Group and later was a General Manager of the AWS RDS business. Mark originally joined MongoDB as a Board member earlier this year, but he got excited about the opportunity in front of MongoDB and wanted to be directly involved. Very few people understand the relational database technology and its limitations better than Mark. So we're excited that he voted with his seat and joined the world's most popular modern database company in a senior leadership role. In early August, we welcomed Harsha Jalihal as our new Chief People Officer. Harsha is a seasoned HR executive has been the forefront of scaling large tech companies as well as managing complex enterprises. Most recently, Harsha was the Vice President of HR, Unilever and was responsible for delivering end-to-end HR strategy and operations for the U.S. business. Prior to that, she was an HR executive of the Cognizant during its hyper growth phase. Finally, mid-August, Rishi Dave joined us as Chief Marketing Officer. Rishi is a veteran technology and marketing executive with more than two decades of experience most recently at Vonage, where he was the company's Chief Marketing Officer. Prior to that, Rishi was CMO, Dun & Bradstreet, a cloud data and analytics provider and earlier had a senior leadership role driving Dell's digital marketing strategy. Harsha, Mark and Rishi joined a talented and dedicated senior management team that is performing at a high level as our Q2 results clearly demonstrate. We are excited for what we can all accomplish together as we continue disrupting one of the largest markets in software. With that, I'll turn it over now to Michael. Yes. Thanks, Keith. We're obviously very pleased with the customer additions for the quarter. I would tell you that, we made some changes to sales incentives at the beginning of the year prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, where we made a conscious decision that we just wanted to accelerate the acquisition of new customers this year. And we decided that because we saw how customers grew really, really quickly, once they got into our platform and, in particular, on Atlas. And because we saw that growth happen .We said, gosh, why we just focus more on acquiring new customers and they natural will grow more. And so before we would force -- force made a strong word, we would incentivize our salespeople to get upfront commitments and for many customers, they're not completely sure one of the platform to how quickly their workloads will grow, how much data they'll have, how many users they have. So it ended up being a bit of a adding a little bit more friction to the sales process, because you had to naturally -- they had to naturally try and convince the customer to make some form of commitment. Because we took that objection away, we've just seen, frankly, it's unleashed, the productivity of salespeople. It's cut down the cycle time of some deals because avoiding that negotiation allows them to get on the platform more quickly and allows us both on the direct side and even on the self-serve side to just add a lot more new customers. Well, thanks for the question, Brent. I would say it's a bit of both. I would say that in general, what we're seeing is customers are really gravitating to modern technology stack that allows them to be very nimble, move quickly, innovate fast. And so obviously, MongoDB plays to that strength. Second; that they do want to focus on work that adds value to the business and basically outsource all the undifferentiated work, so managing a database is not exactly going to give them a competitive advantage. And third, given our platform offers them a lot of choice with offerings to allow them to run their workloads across the 3 different providers that gives them also more confidence in terms of betting on Atlas. So I think that's one clear dimension. And then we have actually, I think, as I said in the opening remarks, we put a lot of focus on our go-to-market efforts. In fact, I would say, as much thought and effort we put into our product, we do the same in our go-to-market efforts. And so, what I think you're seeing is, the strong execution on -- across our 4 channels. And as I indicated in the last question, we have slightly modified. This is just a tweak. It's not a major modification, slightly modified some of the incentives to really make it easy for customers to engage with us and get on the platform quickly. And that's really yielded the results that we've seen. Yes. There's no question that what COVID-19 has done is forced every customer no matter how traditional or critical legacy they were to be digital by default. So whether you're a traditional retailer, you have to quickly build out your e-commerce channel. If you're in a different type of business, you have to figure out a way to engage with your customers in a digital kind of format and approach. And so that obviously plays to our strength. One, customers can innovate and build very, very quickly on MongoDB. They can also scale it very well compared to all the other legacy platforms. Two, Atlas becomes very attractive because we take care of all the management of the database and the underlying infrastructure. So that makes it very attractive for allowing the customer to really focus on what's important to them. And then as I said, multi-cloud plays a big role, depending on what the customer is trying to do, what geo coverage they need, what existing relationships they have with certain cloud provider, etcetera. They have ultimate choice in terms of who they -- what underlying cloud provider to use with Atlas. So all those three things play in our favor. And I think what COVID has done is really accelerated long-term trends. We're always very bullish about the future. But the long-term trends are clearly accelerating and we're trying to capitalize on it. Sure. Yes. Thanks Heather. I would go back to our commentary on the Q1 call where we talked about it being sort of modest but broad-based and tracking the macro economy overall, where we sort of across region, across sector, et cetera, et cetera. And that what we said is in Q2 -- in the middle of Q2, we saw a rebound or an improvement in those lower levels that clearly at least to us when you look at all the data and we slice and dice, it indicates that it's tied to overall economic conditions. It's not quite yet back to historic levels, and it would be very hard for me to predict when or how that would happen. But I think the correlations that we've clearly seen is it's broadly tied to macroeconomic behavior, which would make sense, given both the broad-based nature of the behavior, but also the broad-based nature of the fact that it's a database application and it's a consumption revenue model, and so all those things should mirror each other. And that's what we're seeing. Yes. No, no, that's fine. So, we saw a very limited and isolated instance of that in Q1, but that has effectively worked its way through, taking care of itself, those folks have come and cleared. And frequency of requests or anything like that has really dried up. So, we saw a little bit of right as the crisis was for sort of setting in, but it's not been a regular recurring sort of business consideration that we've had to deal with. Yes. So, I think just to make clear why we're doing that. We have seen Atlas customers grow very, very quickly. And one of the reasons we want to get them on the platform is really condition them so that they don't begin to think about even managing the next new app by themselves. So, once they get condition on building every new app on Atlas that becomes almost the standard way of people building and deploying applications. So, there's a long-term effect of that. It's hard for me to sit here in terms of what the implications will be on the net expansion rate. They've always been very healthy and we don't see any potential change to that. Thank you. Yes, what I would say is there's really two phenomenons. There's what I call a phenomenon of lift and shift where customers just want to get off the legacy vendor, in most cases, it's something like Oracle, where they don't want to pay the Oracle tax anymore and go to an open source relational database. And that's what many people call the lift-and-shift phenomenon. Many customers naively believe that, that will allow them to just keep running their business. What they missed though is that, they missed the opportunity to refactor that application and really modernize it to position themselves to really take advantages -- take advantage of all the new capabilities of a distributed platform and take advantage of other things like micro service and so forth. And so we have many customers who decide, you know what, rather than just lifting and shifting, we want to replatform and basically choose MongoDB as the solution -- the destination solution. So, it really depends on -- how quickly the customers want to move their perceptions of how difficult it is to move off the, say, Oracle to a distributed database like MongoDB, how enabled they are versus -- and also how much time pressure they're in. So, that's why we're expanding our reach, working with systems integrators, working with our partners and obviously, own sales force to get out there and really explain the benefits of MongoDB and the fact that whatever perception they have, we can address to make the choice of making MongoDB that much more easy. Well, I think when we first came out a lot of people viewed us as an interesting, but niche solution, maybe just use for a certain set of use cases. I think we've clearly shown that MongoDB can serve the most demanding customers anywhere in the world for a wide variety of use cases, and that's only increasing. So, I think people are recognizing and as I mentioned, all the major players today have had to acknowledge that JSON is the format and the structure that developers like to use that the document model is truly the best way to work with data and the added benefits of our distributed capabilities, it's so easy to scale out using a distributed platform like MongoDB than, say, staying on a relational platform and having to do a lot of gymnastics to get the application to scale. And so I think it does take time, but we've clearly seen customers recognize and use us for very, very sophisticated applications. Thank you, Jason. And Tyler, what I would also add is that, it's not lost on us and that in difficult times, most companies gravitate to selling to the existing install base and as we've talked about many times in the past, we do have a land and expand strategy. So our sales force could easily do that. But we thought just myopically focusing on existing installed base would be a mistake because we do see a big market opportunity. And the added benefit of engaging with them earlier is that, you just condition them to start using Atlas as the default platform by which they build their applications. So that ends up building a long-term durable relationship with those customers. Yes. Sure. So, a couple of points. One, they provide a support for JSON in 2014, but what they recently announced was support for JSON on their autonomous database in the cloud. One, it only runs in their cloud. Two, much like what Microsoft did with Cosmos and AWS DocumentDB, it's really built on top of a relational database. So it's basically a shim that basically tries to allow developers to more easily use JSON, but the back end is basically the same old engine. And so, there're some severe feature limitations. One simple example is that, because it's basically a JSON blob, you really can't even parse numeric data. It's all basically text. And so, there're some severe limitations in terms of how you can use those features. And obviously, because it's built on a relational back end, there's also a huge set of implications around performance. To the latter part of your question, this is really in response to the fact that developers are recognizing and are acknowledging that it's so much easier to use JSON or by definition, documents to work with data. It's so much easier to code. It's so much more natural. It's much more intuitive. It's much more flexible. And Oracle basically acknowledged that. And so, we believe that, as the world moves more and more towards using documents, we are well positioned. And, obviously, we've been competing with clones for quite some time, and I think we've done quite well. Yes. So, just so we're clear, we made these products generally available in June of this past year. And so it's very, very early days. We're quite excited about the uptake so far. And the reason, just to remind everyone why we introduced Search, is we actually had customers telling us, we much rather stay on one platform than to have to go learn, build and maintain a separate platform. And our Atlas Search product is obviously fully managed as well and takes -- you can take advantage of all the features like [indiscernible] that you could before with the regular database server. So it's still early days, but we're very pleased with the results to-date. And as we get more focused and attention from the sales force on this, we feel quite good about the trends of the business. Yes. So the reason we acquired the Realm mobile database and now have built a tight coupling between the mobile front end and the Atlas back end is to really enable developers to take advantage of a much more powerful format. Realm's architecture is very similar to the MongoDB architecture. Mobile developers find very, very useful to use the Realm mobile database. Realm itself is not meant to be a revenue generator onto itself. It's really in to enable mobile developers to think about using Realm and Atlas first because allowed it to move that much more quickly. So, what you'll see in terms of revenue impact will be more on the Atlas consumption at the back end versus like us trying to monetize the front end. Typically, the mobile database, the client side is given away for free and our approach is to really enable developers to build very, very sophisticated applications and one of the key features, Realm Sync, which is still in beta, really simplifies the work a developer has to do to be able synchronize data between the client side and the server side. As you can imagine, with people using mobile devices, or other devices that are not tethered to a direct network, there's always a chance that you could be offline and so being able to quickly synchronize data between the two -- between the front end and the back end become very, very important and developers have to incur an enormous amount of complexity and cost to be able to do that manually. And so offering this capability will make our capability will make our developers' life that much more easy and will make our platform that much more compelling. Thanks Jack. Sure. Well, thank you for that question. I mean, for a business like MongoDB, our success is directly correlated to our ability to attract and keep great employees, both on the product and engineering side as well as on the go-to-market side and obviously, as well as the people who support the entire business. And so we were very intentional when COVID-19 happened to really be very transparent with employees about what we're doing. Now, candidly, we were in a very healthy financial position. And while we did worry that there might be some short-term impacts to the business, we weren't changing our posture or potentially laying off anyone. So, I think there's two questions that have impacted anyone in COVID. One, can you -- do you still have a job? And two, can you do your job safely? Those two questions at MongoDB have been an unequivocal, yes. And more importantly, we really communicated to all our employees about making sure they were clear on their priorities, making sure that our leaders were clear with their teams about what was important, making sure that they understood where we're going in terms of what we're trying to do, making sure that we made it very easy for them to work in from a work-from-home environment without much disruption. And we've also been sensitive to the fact that working from home for many people is very challenging, especially if you have young kids at home or you don't have ample private workspace at home. And so we've been very flexible with employees to make sure that they can take the time off, work flexible hours, et cetera. And I think we are also really live our values. And that's another way of saying, we really try and create a culture where people feel like that this is a great place to work that they're respected, no matter who they are, that they can not just have a job, but a career, and that we want to set them up for success. And so we tried to do that. We're very grateful for what our employees have done since COVID. Our results are, obviously, a reflection of that, and we've been hiring aggressively. And so we're very focused on on-boarding those new employees to make sure that they get quickly inculcated into the culture. Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. I just want to wrap by saying that, I'm really proud of the strong execution this quarter in a difficult macro environment. We've also expanded our product portfolio to really increase our lead as the preeminent to the data platform on the developer. As we discussed, we've had a record direct and self-serve customer additions, demonstrating that our strategy of adding new customers is working. And lastly, we're pursuing a big market opportunity and COVID is only accelerating long-term trends. So thank you for your time. And we'll talk to you soon. Take care. Bye-bye."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We have a lot to cover. But before I do, I would like to speak to what's happening across the United States and in many parts of the world. I want to state unequivocally that MongoDB stands with the black community against racism, violence and hate. We are distraught by the spate of recent deaths of, and other horrific incidents towards members of the black community, all because a bigotry that is far too prevalent in our society. MongoDB is deeply committed to creating a culture of inclusion. This is one of our core values, where everyone, no matter what they look like, where they're from, whom they love or what God they pray to, is treated equally. Moving forward, I will start by reviewing our first quarter results before providing some color on how our employees and customers are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and how the current environment is impacting our long-term view of the business. Looking quickly at our first quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $130.3 million, a 46% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 49% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew over 75% year-over-year and now represent 42% of our revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 18,400 customers. Delivering such strong Q1 results in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis and the associated economic disruption is a testament to the resiliency of our employees, the quality of our execution, the appeal of our technology and our positioning in the marketplace. While the high degree of uncertainty in the market will continue to have some impact on our near-term results, our results in Q1 reinforced our conviction in the long-term potential of our business. Our first operating principle is the safety and well-being of our employees and our customers. We responded early and decisively to adapt to the spread of COVID-19. I couldn't be prouder of how our employees adapted. And how quickly each of our teams retools their operating plans to address the constraints we are operating under. Our developer relations team is making Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 dashboard more accessible, by hosting it on MongoDB Atlas. Our marketing, developer relations and finance teams collaborated to launch a free Atlas credit programs for all developers looking to build applications to track and stop the spread of the virus. So far, we have helped launched 180 new initiatives. Finally, covidnearyou.org, supported by MongoDB employees and built on Atlas, has made it easier for people to track the virus in their local communities, with users having reported over 1 million personal health updates. From a business perspective, we quickly made a number of changes that allowed us to operate with minimal disruption. Our sales team was inspired by the performance of teams, in the earliest impact areas, such as China and Italy, where we actually saw an increase in customer engagement. The team adhered to its rigorous pipeline generation and deal qualification processes, resulting in strong close rates despite the challenging backdrop. Our self-serve team closely monitored the online advertising market and use the decline in advertising prices to invest more in this channel, while maintaining high rates of return. Our marketing team pivoted completely from physical to online events, resulting in 12,000 webinar attendees in Q1, compared to 2,500 a year ago. In addition, we turned MongoDB World, our flagship user conference, into an online event called MongoDB.live, which will take place next week. We have been thrilled with the response and already have over 40,000 people registered for the event. In comparison, last year, we had 2,000 people attend our in-person events. Speaking of MongoDB.live next week, we're excited to announce a slate of new products and enhancements to existing products that our engineering teams have been working on despite the significant disruption that was caused by the work-from-home transition. Finally, the rest of our teams rose to the challenge and performed admirably, against a difficult backdrop. For example, we seamlessly transitioned recruiting and onboarding to a fully virtual environment, enabling us to hit our Q1 hiring plan. We also transitioned our highly regarded summer internship program to remote experience. And we look forward to welcoming our 83 interns, chosen from the over 20,000 applications we received. While we can't predict with certainty, how long or how severe the COVID-19 global disruption will be we are seeing clear signs that the current environment is only accelerating the secular trends of which we are a long-term beneficiary. Our customers are more determined than ever to proceed with their digital transformation efforts. Businesses of all kinds, even the most technology cautious, recognize their future is powered by software. Consequently, they need to continue to invest in their digital future despite the near-term economic uncertainty. During Q1, we saw customers in even some of the most negatively impacted industries, double down on their digital transformation journeys. For example, we closed a 7-figure deal with one of the largest global auto companies. The company is making a MongoDB as a service available to internal users on their private cloud. There are currently more than 1,000 MongoDB servers in production, supporting critical use cases within the various areas of the company's digitization strategy, including their connected car initiative. Next, the volatility of the current environment is further underscoring the need to use platforms that enable speed and agility. Our customers want to move fast to quickly seize new opportunities or respond to new threats. They want to easily bring new features to market and leverage data effectively, while being able to operate at almost unlimited scale. This increased need for speed and agility plays squarely into MongoDB's core strengths. For example, one of the world's most popular consumer video chat applications was built on MongoDB technology. And was able to withstand 120x increase in concurrent users of the weekend of March 14th. In addition, we strongly believe that the current environment will only hasten the cloud transition. COVID-19 has made it abundantly clear that doing the undifferentiated work of database management is not only inefficient but can, in fact, make it harder to address users' ever-increasing expectations. Customers want to derisk their operations and devote all their energy to doing work that has high impact on the business, as opposed to managing and maintaining their own infrastructure. In Q1, we expanded our Atlas relationship with a leading North American airline. Their strategic focus is to accelerate their move to the cloud in order to modernize their applications and reduce their dependence, on the mainframe. MongoDB is helping them build an operational data layer in the cloud. Finally, our customers are learning the value of a global cloud data platform that makes multicloud easy to implement. Since the pandemic has started, all cloud providers have seen spikes in usage that have impacted their performance and availability in certain regions. In addition, cloud providers have limited certain features to avoid bottlenecks. Given the increasing likelihood of infrastructure constraints, having a data platform such as MongoDB that makes it easy to use multiple cloud providers is becoming even more important. A Canadian security company recently migrated its mobile security platform from document DB to MongoDB Atlas. In addition to reducing costs by 60% and being able to leverage all the features of MongoDB, the key objective was to create a global multicloud foundation to rapidly scale IoT, AI and transactional workloads. I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some of the other customer wins and interesting use cases from the first quarter. Grocery delivery wholesale or boxed, has seen soaring demand for the goods and services due to the pandemic. With the availability of essential supplies changing on a daily basis, they needed a highly scalable database platform to manage their supply chain in real time. They doubled down on MongoDB Atlas and started using MongoDB Charts to help with capacity planning and to ensure they could scale to meet the extreme increases in customer demand. Bingel, the leader in interactive and personalized online learning for the Belgian primary school children, turned to MongoDB on March 13 to handle the increase in demand when the government shut down all schools because of COVID-19. The company, part of Sanoma Learning, immediately became part of the country's critical infrastructure and realized it needed Atlas in order to scale to meet the needs of the country's children. Bingel rapidly migrated services and now sees and effortly handles more than 12 million online exercises a day. Forbes recently added digital asset management to its list of technologies running on Atlas. The publisher has been working with us to transition more of its digital footprint to MongoDB. Known for being an innovative brand, Forbes has many new products in development designed to help showcase its journalism fueled by digital. As it continues to lead the media industry, set new traffic records and attract new audiences, Forbes credits MongoDB for improving its ability to serve dynamic content, decreasing its total cost of ownership and make it possible to replace some of its legacy technologies. Zomato, one of the largest restaurant discovery and food delivery service in the world with over 80 million monthly active users in 24 countries, recently increased its commitment to MongoDB to power its logistics application, an essential piece of the last mile in the food delivery chain. This helps Zomato ensure that they are able to keep up with increased demand, efficiently map their food delivery orders to the right delivery partner, track their journey and ensure on-time deliveries. French multinational, Schneider Electric, which provides energy and automation digital solutions for efficiency and sustainability, recently expanded its commitment to MongoDB. The company chose MongoDB to help rapidly scale new secure requirements for its new IoT-enabled platform EcoStructure, which makes businesses safer, more reliable and more connected. The company leverages Atlas to reduce TCO and help its team scale and manage large volumes of data more effectively. NETS Group, the leading payment service provider in Scandinavia and across Europe, chose MongoDB as its anchor data platform to modernize its payment services and establish a distributed micro services architecture. With MongoDB, the NETS Group makes it even easier and more intuitive for its customers to handle digital payments and related solutions. Woolworths Group, one of the largest retailers in Australia and New Zealand, decided to start offering digital receipts to its 11.7 million reward customers in order to minimize human contact during COVID-19. The retailer used Atlas to create a new platform to ingest all of its point-of-sale data, more than 350 transactions per second and serve it out to customers in real time. MongoDB was able to help them get the system up and running in under three weeks. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance in Q1. In many ways, the world's technology has seen more than three years' worth of change in the past three months. While we expect the uncertainty and the volatility to continue, we remain very focused on building for the long-term and the large opportunity we see ahead. With that, let me now turn the call over to Michael to review our financial results.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the first quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2021. First, I'll start with our first quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $130.3 million, up 46% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $124.9 million, up 49% year-over-year. Professional services revenue was $5.5 million, up 1% year-over-year. To help you better understand our performance in the quarter and the impact from COVID-19 on our outlook, we wanted to share some trends we are seeing across our customer base to provide additional context. First, let's talk about new business. Q1 was a strong quarter for new business, and COVID-19 had less of an impact on new business in Q1 than we expected. On the direct sales side, as Dev mentioned, our sales teams around the world worked effectively and responded to the new circumstances and executed well. In particular, we had a stronger-than-expected quarter in terms of new business coming from Enterprise Advanced, which helped drive revenue outperformance due to the upfront licensing revenue recognition component under ASC 606. On the self-serve side, we saw a meaningful increase in registrations in Q1, which translated into better-than-expected new customer acquisition, which you can see in our customer counts. While we saw a muted impact from the pandemic on new business activity after the global lockdown began in mid-March, we did observe a modest slowdown in the growth from our existing Atlas customers, particularly in self-serve. The impact was modest, but broad-based, mirroring the broader economic contraction. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenues based on consumption, so the slowdown did impact our Q1 Atlas revenue performance. To be clear, we haven't seen any increase in customer churn in either of our direct sales or self-service channels. Overall, Atlas' strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew over 75% in the quarter and now represents 42% of total revenue compared to 35% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 41% last quarter. In addition to the dynamics in existing self-service customer that I referenced, mLab, as expected, represented the growth headwind as we're in the final stages of transitioning those customers before we deprecate the mLab platform. During the first quarter, we grew our customer base by over 1,400 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 18,400, which is up from over 14,200 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 2,200 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,800 in the year ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 16,800 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 12,300 in the year ago period. Sequential growth in total customers includes growth in our EA customers as well as new Atlas customers. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. Customer retention remains high and we've seen continued strong net expansion rates across our installed base. We had another quarter of net ARR expansion rate above 120% despite the impact of the economic environment. We ended the quarter with 780 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 598 in the year ago period. Moving down the P&L, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $95.6 million, representing a gross margin of 73% compared to 74% last quarter and 70% in the year ago period. Overall, we're pleased with our gross margin performance, which reflects greater efficiency and scale in our Atlas business. However, we continue to expect that we will see some modest reduction in overall company gross margin as Atlas continues to be a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $7.4 million or negative 6% operating margin for the first quarter compared to a negative 14% margin in the year ago period. Net loss in the first quarter was $7.3 million or $0.13 a share based on 57.6 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.22 per share on 54.7 million shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $977.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was negative $5.9 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.6 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease obligations, free cash flow was negative $8.5 million in the quarter. This compares to positive free cash flow of $2.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2021. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $125 million to $127 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $24 million to $22 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.38 based on 58 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2021, despite the fact that the macroeconomic outlook is materially worse than what we'd factored into our March guidance, we are pleased to raise the midpoint of our revenue guidance and tightened our range to $520 million to $530 million. We're also tightening our profitability ranges and now expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $78 million to $70 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to the range of $1.34 to $1.21 based on 58.1 million weighted average shares outstanding. Let me provide some incremental color on how we see the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacting our revenues for the rest of the year. When we introduced our fiscal 2021 guidance in March, we shared our underlying assumptions that we would see a material business impact on the first half, followed by a more normalized environment in the second half of the year. Given the global development since March, we clearly now expect the impact of the pandemic to extend longer and impact the second half of the year more materially, resulting in a greater revenue impact for the remainder of the year than we had outlined in March. Let me share some more color on how we expect this impact to manifest itself. In March, we stated that we expected a greater impact on new business activity in Q2 as compared to Q1, as Q1 benefited from a deal pipeline already in place when the pandemic started. We still expect that to be the case and we now expect the Q3 environment to be similar to that of Q2, followed by a more modest improvement in Q4. Furthermore, our forecast assumes that we continue experiencing this slower than historical growth from existing Atlas customers for the duration of the crisis, but returning to historical levels thereafter. Turning specifically to Q2. We expect the stronger-than-expected Enterprise Advanced performance in Q1 to represent a tough sequential compare given the term license revenue recorded under ASC 606. Also keep in mind that we will feel the impact of a full quarter's worth of slow growth from existing Atlas customers, which impacted only a portion of the first quarter. Let me also provide you with an update on our investment outlook. As Dev explained, we see clear signals that the current environment is only accelerating the secular trends that we are beneficiary of. That long-term potential as well as our strong execution in this challenging environment gives us continued confidence to be opportunistic on the investment front. Due to the constraints caused by the prolonged COVID-19 disruption, we are naturally generating savings as travel, event and facility expenses are lower. We've decided to reinvest those savings in two high-return areas, in particular, where we're seeing unique opportunities. First, as Dev mentioned, online advertising rates have declined significantly, in some cases, as much as 30% since the pandemic started. This provides us an excellent opportunity to increase our investment in digital marketing to expand on recent strength in self-serve customer new additions. Given that our new self-serve customers are relatively small, the revenue impact from this year will be modest, but the increased investment will position us well for fiscal 2022 and beyond. Second, in the current environment, we're finding there's an opportunity to incrementally add strong engineering talent that is not normally on the market and is now looking to join a well-positioned and well-funded company like ours. As a result, we've decided to pull forward a portion of our expected fiscal year 2022 R&D hiring to take advantage of talent availability and further accelerate our ambitious product road map. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent first quarter results. Our ability to focus and execute has served us well in a difficult environment. And our Q1 performance gives us increased conviction that we'll be in an even stronger position when economic conditions improve. We are also confident the investments we are making today are positioning us well for continued success as we pursue our long-term market opportunity. And with that, we'd like to open it up with questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSanjit Singh: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. And congrats on the strong Q1 in a really difficult selling environment. Dev, you sort of outlined how you sort of think COVID sort of is a force accelerator in terms of digital transformation and cloud adoption. When I look at Q1 results, it seems like in terms of the strength in the quarter, it was expressed through Enterprise Advanced versus Atlas. I was wondering if you could sort of help bridge those two worlds in terms of customers are looking for greater flexibility, greater agility, how -- why was demand expressed more through Enterprise Advanced? Is that kind of the lowest friction way for the existing customer base to stand up new applications today, and that'll change over time? If you could sort of give us a sense of current demand versus how you think the trends are going to play out for Atlas over time.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Thanks, Sanjit. I just want to remind people that we don't push people towards any particular consumption model, because one of our strong value proposition is that you can run MongoDB anywhere. And so we still have lots of customers, even though Atlas has grown so quickly, have lots of customers who purchased Enterprise Advanced. And the same phenomenon happened in Q1 where we had, again, quite a robust demand for EA. I would say Atlas was also very strong. I mean Atlas grew 75% year-over-year. And so, I wouldn't suggest that it is solely because of Enterprise Advanced. And I know in previous calls, people were little worried about the growth of EA. And so, I think this puts to rest that there's still robust demand for our products and some customers want to run on-premise. They made significant commitments to their existing internal infrastructure. And obviously, a lot of customers are embracing the cloud. And we do believe that the long-term trends are towards the cloud and one of the benefits of using MongoDB now even on-premises that it gives customers easy on-ramp to cloud because they don't have to rewrite the application once they actually decide to move to the cloud. So that's one of the added benefits of going with MongoDB.\nSanjit Singh: Got it, makes total sense. And then Michael, just as a follow-up, as we think about the full year guidance, and you sort of mentioned Q1 benefited from a healthy pipeline coming into the quarter, as you think about the range and guidance, what sort of close rates are you assuming? Like, did you take down your close rates or any sort of color you can provide on contextualizing the range of guidance in terms of the pipeline that you have going forward and potential closure rates on that pipeline, that would be helpful? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. Sure. I'll say a few things, and I'll disaggregate it into the two main channels sales sold versus self-serve. I think in sales sold, we walk people through the impacts back in the March quarter when a lot of this was emerging and we attempted to quantify the potential impact. We walk people through the scenario where we were looking at Q1 impacts and Q2 impacts in terms of new business with the recovery and normalization in the back half of the year and that's sort of flowing through the revenue model, if you will. I think what we saw is obviously a very strong Q1 and the team really did a great job in terms of powering through. We're still expecting to see an impact in Q2 and that's reflected in the guidance. And we're also expecting that, that to continue further into the year, right? So we're expecting Q3 to be roughly in line in Q2 and Q4 to be more impacted. And so that's sort of on the new business activity and the signing of new business activity, and that flows its way through the revenue, as you might imagine. One of the things to call out, which I think Dev mentioned on the last call as well, is I think while this has been going on for a while, it's still relatively new. And I think if you think about deal cycles and close rates and some of the things that you're describing, I think we obviously did a very good job in terms of execution and close rates and pursuing against the pipeline of opportunities that we had. But we have to remember the deals that we closed in Q1 were mostly in process. And so there's a question that we're \u2013 that's sort of factored in, which is we assume productivity takes a hit in Q2 and Q3 in part because now you're having to generate the new business all in this remote environment the team has done a great job of adapting, but we don't have a lot of data points around that. On the self-service side and \u2013 which is all Atlas and including the revenue components of sales sold Atlas, we did mention the slower expansion that we saw from our existing customer base, great strength in adding new customers and no uptick in churn in terms of customers going to 0. And so \u2013 but we did see slower growth, that's very much COVID related. I think if you think about having a consumption model that's one of the things that sort of flows through, right. And you've got a usage based model, there's a portion of the customer base whose business \u2013 their own business is materially impacted. And so as a result, we see less expansion from that existing customer base and we're sort of assuming that will continue as well. So when you take those couple of factors and in terms of the annual guide and then you also layer in the mLab declines that we've talked about, I think that's what sort of all adds up to our full-year view.\nSanjit Singh: Perfect. Thank you, Michael, for the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And now our next question will come from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBrad Reback: Great, thanks very much. On the Atlas side, could you provide maybe any color, I know you said it was fairly broad-based, but were there any specific pockets of weakness either from a customer side and/or vertical?\nMichael Gordon: No. So in general, as we mentioned, this is more on the self-service side in the first place, so obviously, smaller customer base, also saw some of it on the sales sold side, but not in any particular large pockets. Like I said, no churn, no uptick in churn. You might think that you'd see a disproportionate number of -- a small number of customers having an outside impact. This is sort of more of the reverse just given the broad economic contraction, a number of businesses seeing underlying demand for their products shrink. And one of the corollaries of having an elastic business model is when there's less demand, they'll have less usage on Atlas, and that's really turn to. So I don't think there are any particular unique insights. No big customer outliers that are contributing to the slower growth.\nBrad Reback: Got it. And just one quick follow-up. If you think about usage trends thus far in 2Q, have you seen any modest uptick, or are they where they were for the month of April?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So we, in general saw some initial behavior, probably mid-to-late March and saw that come down. We are assuming right now from a forecast perspective that based on everything we've been able to discern, that's related to COVID-19, and so we baked into our outlook that we'll see those continue.\nBrad Reback: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question will come from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nDan Church: Hi. This is Dan Church on for Heather Bellini. Thanks for taking my question. You kind of talked about this a little bit in your remarks, but I was just -- just to kind of piggyback on the last question a little bit. As Atlas continues to grow, what kind of visibility do you have when you look into the back half of the year in terms of revenues -- revenue given its consumption based? And then any kind of color you can provide in terms of how that affects billings as Atlas continues to grow as a percentage of the mix? Thank you. \nMichael Gordon: Sure. Yes. So I think in general, we've seen strong consumption of Atlas. Dev mentioned that to see 75-plus percent growth at this kind of scale is unusual. And if you actually back out the contraction of the drag from mLab, organic Atlas more than doubled. So you can see really strong performance from Atlas overall. We see visibility if -- it's probably best to disaggregate that in terms of the sales sold side as well as the self-serve side. So I think on the sales sold side, you typically have annual commitments that people are making. And so that really -- the usage, of course, will vary, but there is a contract, so you've got a fair amount of visibility. From a billings standpoint, while we don't guide to it, I think it's important to call out that -- I think we mentioned this in one of the calls last year. We've sort of increasingly been encouraging people to engage with us and engage in Atlas on a -- in a more friction-free basis. And so there are plenty of customers in the sales sold side that are doing monthly invoicing in arrears. And so again, not something that's driving meaningful deferred revenue when you're doing your sort of calculated billings calculations. So I think that's important to understand. On the self-service side, it's really more of a portfolio dynamic. So it's lots of smaller customers. And so you can see a particular outlier here or there, but they tend not to meaningfully move the needle. I think what we're talking about in terms of the slower growth that we saw from existing customers is really something macro economically driven, right? Just -- it's virtually unprecedented to have this kind of much of a macroeconomic shift. And as -- when people -- the database usage is directly correlated to the usage intensity of their business. And so we're seeing that. And it's why that's we're incorporating that into the forecast going forward.\nDan Church: Helpful. Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up. Are you seeing any changes in the overall pricing environment, or have you received any request for discounts from customers or extended billing terms, flexible payments, anything like that would be helpful.\nMichael Gordon: Sure. Yes. Customers obviously, would always love discounts. But no, there really hasn't been an increase there. I do think we've seen some, sort of, like I would describe it as anecdotally interesting, but quantitatively, not meaningful or material outliers in terms of payment terms -- a one-off here or there, but nothing that I would describe as, sort of, broad-based or a true trend. You know, we did some internal analysis and looked at, sort of, payment terms and everything else. And so we haven't seen anything meaningfully different there, like I said, other than, sort of, an anecdote here or there that's, sort of, interesting. But you'd have to work -- you have to really torture to kind of call it a trend.\nDan Church: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: And the next question will come from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Hey. Thanks a lot. Hope you are doing well. I wanted to ask you about the strong customer adds that you saw this quarter, both in Atlas and overall. Is there anything to call out there? Was that led by kind of the customer side, more of a pull or push? And how are you thinking about the growth in customer adds in Atlas going forward?\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Tyler. I think this is just a function of us just being increasingly really, really focused on things like pipeline generation and being -- and on the self-service side, being much more learning, and as we're growing our business, understanding what programs work. And so the efficacy of our digital marketing efforts is just improving over time. And so -- and I think frankly, it's also a function of the fact that our value proposition is very strong. As I said, we have a high degree of customer engagement, even with customers in highly challenged industries, as we've talked about the digital trends are accelerating, people want to move to more modern cloud-native stocks, because software is powering almost every business, and they want to use that as a competitive advantage. And I would also say the fact that our platform makes multi-cloud very, very easy, gives customers confidence that investing in MongoDB enables them real optionality. And so, I think all those things are just giving us confidence in the long-term health of our business.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. I would just also add, and we said this in the prepared remarks, but just so people are clear, both the self-service side customers start small, and one of the things that we've been able to do in the direct sales side, as I mentioned, is sort of reduced friction. What that means is, people tend to come on at smaller revenue levels, but then we see great growth and expansion within Atlas. And so, not as much, I wouldn't get carried away with the sort of near-term takeaway in terms of the revenue impact, but in terms of how it sets us up in fiscal 2022 and beyond, we feel very good about it.\nTyler Radke: Thanks. And just a follow-up, Michael, on your comments around the -- some cohort of customers in Atlas seeing slower expansions, I guess, are you seeing a dollar-based churn? Are you seeing kind of workloads maybe moving off that were less mission-critical, or is it just simply, hey, maybe they were expanding at 20%, 30% and now they're flat? And then, I guess, how should we be sort of trying to model this? Would you expect just more modest growth, of that impact, you kind of get a full quarter of that impact going forward, or how should we just think about that impact on overall Atlas growth rate?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So, I think about it really in three main buckets, and it's probably clear, but just because it's important enough, and we are trying to shed the insight and the color, I want to make sure it's sort of clear and well understood by folks. So I think one of three main buckets, there is new customers coming in, which continues to be strong, and we saw an acceleration in that. There is turning customers, meaning customers leaving, and we saw no increase in that. And the rest is just the expansion rate from existing customers, and what we saw there is slower growth from those existing customers. So just to be clear, still growth, right? And so, what we saw there was is within some of that, you see people adjusting their consumption levels based on the underlying trends in their business, and so that's really what's happening.\nTyler Radke: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Hynes with Canaccord. Please go ahead.\nDavid Hynes: Hey, thanks very much. Dev, you touched on the importance of multi-cloud optionality a couple of times here in the call. But I want to ask you, what you're seeing from the public cloud database efforts. Any change in competitive tactics or what you're seeing in the field from Dynamo or Cosmos?\nDev Ittycheria: Frankly, we\u2019re not seeing any real changes. Obviously, I think we've talked about this in the past. Clearly, we partner with all the major cloud providers. And Amazon and Microsoft or Azure, in particular, have their alternatives to MongoDB, but we've not seen any real change in the competitive dynamics. Frankly, when we're competing, we feel really, really good about our position. Those products are clones of MongoDB, and so when we expose the full feature set and all the capabilities available in MongoDB and through Atlas, it becomes a pretty easy decision. The things that we worry about, frankly, are the deals that we're not a participant in. And so just as a virtue of their reach, their brand, they're clearly gaining business that we just don't always have access to. That being said, Google, as we talked about in the past, doesn't have a competitive product, and the partnership there is really strong. They named us one of the technology partners of the year. And the sales teams do a lot of joint planning -- joint account planning and work in various -- in Europe and in North America and other parts of the world. And so that business is growing quickly. But frankly, our business is all the cloud providers are growing quickly. So we feel quite -- we feel very good about our value proposition.\nDavid Hynes : Perfect. And Michael, one quick follow-up for you. I'm not sure if you called it out. I may have missed it, but how much was the EA term license in Q1? It would just be helpful as we think about the sequential comparisons looking to the July quarter.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So we didn't call it and quantify the number, but it was a significant increase and contributor to the strong outperformance in Q1. And this is where we've tried to call out pretty consistently from folks when that happens just given that it introduces this increased variability and the reduced comparability from period-to-period, both sequentially as well as year-over-year. And as Dev mentioned, it's not something that we're particularly trying to drive, but it's just sort of the way the deals in any given quarter fall out from a pipeline perspective.\nDavid Hynes : Sure. Okay. Thanks guys, congrats.\nMichael Gordon: One thing I'll just add, we did add some of the disclosure that's historically been in the Qs. We did pull that forward into the release to help people to see the percent of subscription revenue from Enterprise Advanced and percent from the direct sales force. Just, I know some people are doing some of those calculations. And so rather than making folks wait, we decided to incorporate that and pull that up into the release and hope that's helpful.\nDavid Hynes : Yes, I did see that. Thank you guys.\nOperator: The next question will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: Dev, if you kind of go back to March, you had certain -- like you had certain planning assumptions for the year that kind of drove what you guided for. And now you kind of kind of say like, okay, actually, maybe it's slightly longer. Can you talk a little bit about like the process you had back then in terms of going for the different regions, I'm thinking about cost rate, et cetera, but then what changed -- what's the thing that changed compared to back in March? Like, what's the thing that makes you incrementally a little bit more nervous, or what -- just talk about the changes from then.\nMichael Gordon: In terms of our guidance now versus in March?\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Yes, yes.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I think the most simple way to think about it is at the time of our guidance in March, I think people would not have been expecting that much of the working world would be still shut down and/or talking about working through home through the rest of the year and all the other things that are sort of going on macroeconomically. So we obviously had a great Q1 and powered through that, but we applied the same kind of framework or rubric, if you will, to the new business piece where we looked at it region-by-region. And I guess, maybe the most simplistic way of thinking about it is, if you thought previously that you could shade or grade different regions at different risk levels, meaning the -- in Region A, there would be -- it would be high risk and a much bigger impact. And in the Region B, it would be a much smaller impact. I think when you look at the universe today, at least when we look at things, everything in the high-risk, high-impact region, right? And so that puts pressure. It's not just on a global pocket here or there, but it's really quite broad-based. And it's also going on for longer. So you've got a bigger impact that's happening for a longer period of time. And then secondly, at the time of the guidance in March, we hadn't seen any of the slower expansion -- the slower growth in the existing Atlas customers. And so since then, we've seen that, so we've updated the forecast model to -- and then the guidance to incorporate that as well, and so just trying to give all of you the best view that we have on the business. And I think despite that, and despite the fact that sort of while we had quantified the impact in March, so 15 to 25, clearly, magnitude of the impact now for the full year is greater than that. And despite that, given the strong execution, we're able to raise the midpoint of the guide given how well we've been doing and how strong we feel about -- how well we're positioned.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Okay. Perfect. \nMichael Gordon: In challenging environment.\nRaimo Lenschow: Got it. Yes, yes. Okay. That's really helpful. That's really helpful to getting extra detail, Mike. And then the other question is on Atlas self-service. Obviously, like there are different things that people will wonder now. It's like if you think about it, is this still a law of large numbers coming in and that drives the deceleration? Because like in theory, like, you could see, like, okay, maybe the higher churn, but you said there's not higher churn, like, how do I have to think about that self-serve number going forward and underlying? I mean, clearly, just the strength in the direct business, which should be your future, but on self-serve, kind of we're all struggling a little bit, like, how to think about that?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I think what I'd say is because it was so broad-based, and again, we sort of dissected it in the way that I described, you can see that the new customer additions are strong, and we looked and we saw \u2013 we did not see an increase in customers churning. And so really, it's just about what is the expansion behavior, what is the growth rate of that existing base. And it was so broad-based. And so modest on sort of a per customer impact, if you will, but broad-based and so coincident with the global shutdown, lockdown that sort of started happening in mid- to late March, that the correlation is quite high. And when you think about just if you're running a business, if you've got an application and there is dramatically less usage, your business is taking a hit as so many businesses are, the underlying impact of that is significant to your business and some of that in a consumption usage-based model starts to flow through. I think, importantly, based on everything we've seen, and there's a macroeconomic recovery, which we're currently not forecasting for fiscal 2021, I would expect that, that would recover as well. Again, it might be a different situation where we're seeing increases in churn or people leaving or shutting off applications or stuff like that, but that's not the behavior that we're seeing. And so I think if you look further out from sort of a longer-term duration perspective when there's a recovery or normalization there, I would expect that we would be a beneficiary of that, and it would become helpful and additive to growth. Clearly, we've had very good customer additions as you can see in the numbers, and I think that sort of speaks to the product market fit and the long-term opportunity that we have.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the color. Thanks for the extra color that was very helpful.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Good quarter. Michael, I want to kind of dig in on your view for the next quarter and kind of tied up potential into the activity in this quarter around the pipeline. Is there a way for you to gauge \u2013 it sounds like you expect \u2013 you're clearly ending the quarter with lower levels of pipeline versus last where you had some things outstanding that you closed in the quarter. Is there a way to think about whether there was some business that was pulled forward from the second quarter into the first quarter that perhaps there was a little bit of a mentality of I might lose a budget, so let's go ahead and accelerate the project? Is there anything to be to be made around that?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. We didn't really see anything like that. I mean, obviously, in any quarter, there are some deals that you get that you didn't expect to get or deals slip or whatever. And when we've seen meaningful variances there, we've tried to call that out. But no, we didn't really see anything like that. I think the key things to think about in terms of Q1 and maybe, in particular, Q2 relative to Q1 because, obviously, we're guiding down sequentially is Q1 was a really strong EA quarter. And given the term license revenue under 606, that makes it a really tough sequential compare. Secondly, as we said from March, and it continues through to today, we expect a bigger impact in Q2 from coronavirus and the challenges that we have from the overall market. And then third, we mentioned the slower growth from existing Atlas customers in Q1. We only experienced that for a partial quarter in Q1. And so I think that's \u2013 you need to think about that happening for the full quarter in Q2. So I think that's really it. I don't think about it. It's necessarily about smaller or weaker pipelines. We're seeing, as Dev mentioned in his remarks, really strong engagement and customer activity and everything else like that. So I wouldn't think of the guide in that context. I think about it more in terms of the factors that I just walked through.\nIttai Kidron: Maybe then as a follow-up to that, regarding these comments, if you think about the EA performance this quarter, which clearly was very strong, can you tell us if it was in line with your expectations? Was there something unusual there? And I'm kind of asking it also in the context of next quarter, is it fair to say the pipeline around EA is probably much weaker relative to what pipeline in Atlas is it heading into the next quarter?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I wouldn't think about \u2013 I'd probably not for me to get into sort of pipeline, let alone sort of pipeline by product or channel or anything else like that. So I wouldn't \u2013 I don't think that's like the right way to head down. I think if I'm looking at Q2 guide relative to Q1, I go back to the things I mentioned in terms of the tough sequential compare given the strong EA quarter, the big COVID impact in Q2 and then the full quarter of the slower growth.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Good luck, guys.\nOperator: The next question will come from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nJoey Marincek: Thank you. This is Joey on for Pat. First, how are you guys thinking about M&A at this point? And then maybe back to partnerships. Can you just give us an update on the Alibaba Cloud partnership? Thank you so much.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Joey. So in terms of M&A, we don't have any, obviously, specific plans to go acquire any new technology. We, obviously, will be opportunistic. We've made three acquisitions since I've been here. One was the WiredTiger acquisition in 2014. Then it was mLab, and then most recently, last year was Realm. And they were frankly opportunistic that allowed us to accelerate some product stuff that we wanted to do and build more momentum in our Atlas business. We are very focused on our organic efforts. Now that being said, obviously, we're not na\u00efve about the macroeconomic has deteriorated. There's a lot of businesses that are maybe struggling, and there's an opportunity to potentially acquire some assets that may come in the market. And so it will be all around the context of how it further accelerates our product at our product platform. And so that's the context by which we look at acquisitions. And at this point, we don't see anything in the near-term horizon that would -- that we're contemplating. In terms of partnerships, we feel really good about the Alibaba relationship. They just gave us an update. We're about past six months in terms of when that relationship really got started from an operational point of view. And they've told us that they're actually -- demand is higher than they've expected. And so we're not factoring that into any form of guidance, but we feel -- the point that they shared with us is the product market for MongoDB in China is very strong, and they're feeling really good about the customer traction they're getting. So that's another strong signal about our value proposition and why customers not just in North America and Europe, but also in large parts of Asia are gravitating to MongoDB.\nJoey Marincek: Great. Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you for taking the question here. Dev, I wanted to get your view of the database market, perhaps looking at beyond the economic shots of the business here that you're guiding to. What do you think happens to this industry in a post-COVID world? Is this -- just given the uncertainty here, is this an environment where it's just going to be harder to convince enterprises to switch to database vendors? Is there an appetite to accelerate some digital projects? Just as you look out beyond the short run here, what's your take on industry adoption trends post-COVID?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. I would say it's not harder. It's actually becoming easier, because what COVID and the pandemic is basically causing everyone to recognize, even the most technically conservative or cautious customers that just staying a legacy technology is not the place to be. What people need is the ability to move quickly, and they need to be able to change directions quickly, too. So they need to be able to respond to new threats or seize new opportunities. And so MongoDB plays right into that, like gives them the ability to build new features and capabilities very, very fast and really gives them a very scalable, durable mission-critical platform to build the most sophisticated applications on. So, we frankly are seeing a lot of demand. We've been running a lot of webinars. And the demand and interest level is really, really high. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have over 40,000 people already registered for MongoDB.live conference. I encourage everyone on this call to try and register and try and attend as many of the sessions as possible. We have some really exciting announcements planned. And so we're seeing a lot of interest. And again, it just comes back to the fact that people want to move to more modern platforms, software is the future for almost every business. And software becomes a competitive advantage. Consequently, they want to build on a platform that enables them to build software applications quickly, to build more modern applications, leveraging mobile, machine learning, micro services, et cetera, and to do it on a platform that has a large developer community and momentum around. And so, given all those things, we feel really good. Now, we do recognize that, obviously, the current macroenvironment is not great, but our long-term view on the business is very bullish.\nBrent Bracelin: Got it. And so it sounds like the engagement around the opportunity is certainly accelerating the risk. It sounds like is more just on around timing of when that opportunity converts to revenue, because of all the economic -- is that the right way to kind of frame kind of the increased engagement, but increasing uncertainty around the timing when that converts to revenue, is that the best way to frame it or not?\nDev Ittycheria: I would say they maybe started a little smaller than planned and then grow over time. And we much rather engage with the customer sooner than wait for some bigger deal. And so, the more we condition customers to use MongoDB earlier and for more of their applications, the more that kind of allows us to build a more meaningful kind of relationship with those customers, and we become the de facto standard in those accounts. And so that's all long-term goodness. And so, when we see new customer acquisitions really strong, when we see the level of interest and demand for MongoDB to be strong, when we see the level of attendees to our webinars and conferences and our large user conference to be really strong, these are all signs -- really great signs for us for the future.\nBrent Bracelin: Very helpful color. That's all I had. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jack Andrews with Needham. Please go ahead.\nJack Andrews: Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations on the results. I want to see if you could just update us on terms of where things stand with some of your systems integration partnerships. Could you update us in terms of where the momentum is, who's ramping up MongoDB practices these days and how that's impacting your business?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. Actually, I was on the phone -- well, technically, the Zoom call with one of the most senior execs of one of the largest systems integrators in the world two days ago. So the interest level continues to be very, very high. And so, we're seeing actually another senior exec from another large systems integrator was asking me, how could he acquire more MongoDB skills more quickly, because they're seeing so much demand. And you have to recognize that, obviously, SIs have a lot of people, and they want access to talent. And people really understand these new platforms and these new architectures and so forth. And so, while they're retooling their existing organization, they're also looking for new skill sets. The other thing that I would also add is we have Frank D'Souza, who is the former Founder and CEO of Cognizant on our Board. So, he is a real domain expert in this place and he has really helped us broaden our thinking around both working with larger systems integrators -- global systems integrators as well as more boutique and regional players to really accelerate our business with the size and so that's a segment that we think there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to do a lot of business with.\nJack Andrews: That's great to hear. Just as a follow-up question, you mentioned that you are planning on pulling forward some of your planned fiscal 2022 R&D hiring. Are there any comments you can make in terms of how you're thinking about sales and marketing hiring in this environment?\nDev Ittycheria: On the marketing side, what we talked about and Michael mentioned in his remarks, is that -- and actually, I also mentioned is that we're seeing obviously some very attractive rates from an online advertising and digital marketing areas. So, we're frankly leveraging those lower rates to do more because we're seeing such high rates of return and so we think that, that makes a lot of sense. And so obviously, as our self-serve business continues to grow, we feel like those investments make a lot of sense. And so -- and on the sales side, we've already -- we've had a pretty ambitious hiring plan and a lot of it will depend on us seeing how results go and if -- we typically make investments from a success-based point of view. So, the -- where teams are having a lot of effects, we plow more resources. And if you feel that things are going a little slower than planned, we'll try and figure out what's going on. But in general, we've been really pleased with how our sales team did, especially given our Q1 results. And we -- I have a lot of -- frankly a lot of confidence in our salesforce. I believe our salesforce is one of the best in the business and we wouldn't be delivering these results without the strong salesforce that we have.\nJack Andrews: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: This will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dev Ittycheria for any closing remarks.\nDev Ittycheria: Well, I want to thank everyone for joining today. Obviously, this is a crazy environment, but now I want to reiterate MongoDB's commitment to culture of inclusion. This is something that's one of our core values and we're very committed to making sure that people of all walks of life are treated equally. I also want to just acknowledge that obviously, we're still dealing with pandemic. So, I wish all of you all the best and to stay safe and healthy. With that, thank you for your time and we look forward to speaking to you soon. Take care. Bye, bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the first quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2021. First, I'll start with our first quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $130.3 million, up 46% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $124.9 million, up 49% year-over-year. Professional services revenue was $5.5 million, up 1% year-over-year. To help you better understand our performance in the quarter and the impact from COVID-19 on our outlook, we wanted to share some trends we are seeing across our customer base to provide additional context. First, let's talk about new business. Q1 was a strong quarter for new business, and COVID-19 had less of an impact on new business in Q1 than we expected. On the direct sales side, as Dev mentioned, our sales teams around the world worked effectively and responded to the new circumstances and executed well. In particular, we had a stronger-than-expected quarter in terms of new business coming from Enterprise Advanced, which helped drive revenue outperformance due to the upfront licensing revenue recognition component under ASC 606. On the self-serve side, we saw a meaningful increase in registrations in Q1, which translated into better-than-expected new customer acquisition, which you can see in our customer counts. While we saw a muted impact from the pandemic on new business activity after the global lockdown began in mid-March, we did observe a modest slowdown in the growth from our existing Atlas customers, particularly in self-serve. The impact was modest, but broad-based, mirroring the broader economic contraction. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenues based on consumption, so the slowdown did impact our Q1 Atlas revenue performance. To be clear, we haven't seen any increase in customer churn in either of our direct sales or self-service channels. Overall, Atlas' strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew over 75% in the quarter and now represents 42% of total revenue compared to 35% in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 41% last quarter. In addition to the dynamics in existing self-service customer that I referenced, mLab, as expected, represented the growth headwind as we're in the final stages of transitioning those customers before we deprecate the mLab platform. During the first quarter, we grew our customer base by over 1,400 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 18,400, which is up from over 14,200 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 2,200 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 1,800 in the year ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 16,800 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 12,300 in the year ago period. Sequential growth in total customers includes growth in our EA customers as well as new Atlas customers. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. Customer retention remains high and we've seen continued strong net expansion rates across our installed base. We had another quarter of net ARR expansion rate above 120% despite the impact of the economic environment. We ended the quarter with 780 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 598 in the year ago period. Moving down the P&L, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $95.6 million, representing a gross margin of 73% compared to 74% last quarter and 70% in the year ago period. Overall, we're pleased with our gross margin performance, which reflects greater efficiency and scale in our Atlas business. However, we continue to expect that we will see some modest reduction in overall company gross margin as Atlas continues to be a bigger portion of our revenue. Our operating loss was $7.4 million or negative 6% operating margin for the first quarter compared to a negative 14% margin in the year ago period. Net loss in the first quarter was $7.3 million or $0.13 a share based on 57.6 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $0.22 per share on 54.7 million shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $977.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was negative $5.9 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.6 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease obligations, free cash flow was negative $8.5 million in the quarter. This compares to positive free cash flow of $2.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2021. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $125 million to $127 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $24 million to $22 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.38 based on 58 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2021, despite the fact that the macroeconomic outlook is materially worse than what we'd factored into our March guidance, we are pleased to raise the midpoint of our revenue guidance and tightened our range to $520 million to $530 million. We're also tightening our profitability ranges and now expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $78 million to $70 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to the range of $1.34 to $1.21 based on 58.1 million weighted average shares outstanding. Let me provide some incremental color on how we see the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacting our revenues for the rest of the year. When we introduced our fiscal 2021 guidance in March, we shared our underlying assumptions that we would see a material business impact on the first half, followed by a more normalized environment in the second half of the year. Given the global development since March, we clearly now expect the impact of the pandemic to extend longer and impact the second half of the year more materially, resulting in a greater revenue impact for the remainder of the year than we had outlined in March. Let me share some more color on how we expect this impact to manifest itself. In March, we stated that we expected a greater impact on new business activity in Q2 as compared to Q1, as Q1 benefited from a deal pipeline already in place when the pandemic started. We still expect that to be the case and we now expect the Q3 environment to be similar to that of Q2, followed by a more modest improvement in Q4. Furthermore, our forecast assumes that we continue experiencing this slower than historical growth from existing Atlas customers for the duration of the crisis, but returning to historical levels thereafter. Turning specifically to Q2. We expect the stronger-than-expected Enterprise Advanced performance in Q1 to represent a tough sequential compare given the term license revenue recorded under ASC 606. Also keep in mind that we will feel the impact of a full quarter's worth of slow growth from existing Atlas customers, which impacted only a portion of the first quarter. Let me also provide you with an update on our investment outlook. As Dev explained, we see clear signals that the current environment is only accelerating the secular trends that we are beneficiary of. That long-term potential as well as our strong execution in this challenging environment gives us continued confidence to be opportunistic on the investment front. Due to the constraints caused by the prolonged COVID-19 disruption, we are naturally generating savings as travel, event and facility expenses are lower. We've decided to reinvest those savings in two high-return areas, in particular, where we're seeing unique opportunities. First, as Dev mentioned, online advertising rates have declined significantly, in some cases, as much as 30% since the pandemic started. This provides us an excellent opportunity to increase our investment in digital marketing to expand on recent strength in self-serve customer new additions. Given that our new self-serve customers are relatively small, the revenue impact from this year will be modest, but the increased investment will position us well for fiscal 2022 and beyond. Second, in the current environment, we're finding there's an opportunity to incrementally add strong engineering talent that is not normally on the market and is now looking to join a well-positioned and well-funded company like ours. As a result, we've decided to pull forward a portion of our expected fiscal year 2022 R&D hiring to take advantage of talent availability and further accelerate our ambitious product road map. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent first quarter results. Our ability to focus and execute has served us well in a difficult environment. And our Q1 performance gives us increased conviction that we'll be in an even stronger position when economic conditions improve. We are also confident the investments we are making today are positioning us well for continued success as we pursue our long-term market opportunity. And with that, we'd like to open it up with questions. Operator? Yes. Sure. I'll say a few things, and I'll disaggregate it into the two main channels sales sold versus self-serve. I think in sales sold, we walk people through the impacts back in the March quarter when a lot of this was emerging and we attempted to quantify the potential impact. We walk people through the scenario where we were looking at Q1 impacts and Q2 impacts in terms of new business with the recovery and normalization in the back half of the year and that's sort of flowing through the revenue model, if you will. I think what we saw is obviously a very strong Q1 and the team really did a great job in terms of powering through. We're still expecting to see an impact in Q2 and that's reflected in the guidance. And we're also expecting that, that to continue further into the year, right? So we're expecting Q3 to be roughly in line in Q2 and Q4 to be more impacted. And so that's sort of on the new business activity and the signing of new business activity, and that flows its way through the revenue, as you might imagine. One of the things to call out, which I think Dev mentioned on the last call as well, is I think while this has been going on for a while, it's still relatively new. And I think if you think about deal cycles and close rates and some of the things that you're describing, I think we obviously did a very good job in terms of execution and close rates and pursuing against the pipeline of opportunities that we had. But we have to remember the deals that we closed in Q1 were mostly in process. And so there's a question that we're \u2013 that's sort of factored in, which is we assume productivity takes a hit in Q2 and Q3 in part because now you're having to generate the new business all in this remote environment the team has done a great job of adapting, but we don't have a lot of data points around that. On the self-service side and \u2013 which is all Atlas and including the revenue components of sales sold Atlas, we did mention the slower expansion that we saw from our existing customer base, great strength in adding new customers and no uptick in churn in terms of customers going to 0. And so \u2013 but we did see slower growth, that's very much COVID related. I think if you think about having a consumption model that's one of the things that sort of flows through, right. And you've got a usage based model, there's a portion of the customer base whose business \u2013 their own business is materially impacted. And so as a result, we see less expansion from that existing customer base and we're sort of assuming that will continue as well. So when you take those couple of factors and in terms of the annual guide and then you also layer in the mLab declines that we've talked about, I think that's what sort of all adds up to our full-year view. No. So in general, as we mentioned, this is more on the self-service side in the first place, so obviously, smaller customer base, also saw some of it on the sales sold side, but not in any particular large pockets. Like I said, no churn, no uptick in churn. You might think that you'd see a disproportionate number of -- a small number of customers having an outside impact. This is sort of more of the reverse just given the broad economic contraction, a number of businesses seeing underlying demand for their products shrink. And one of the corollaries of having an elastic business model is when there's less demand, they'll have less usage on Atlas, and that's really turn to. So I don't think there are any particular unique insights. No big customer outliers that are contributing to the slower growth. Sure. Yes. So I think in general, we've seen strong consumption of Atlas. Dev mentioned that to see 75-plus percent growth at this kind of scale is unusual. And if you actually back out the contraction of the drag from mLab, organic Atlas more than doubled. So you can see really strong performance from Atlas overall. We see visibility if -- it's probably best to disaggregate that in terms of the sales sold side as well as the self-serve side. So I think on the sales sold side, you typically have annual commitments that people are making. And so that really -- the usage, of course, will vary, but there is a contract, so you've got a fair amount of visibility. From a billings standpoint, while we don't guide to it, I think it's important to call out that -- I think we mentioned this in one of the calls last year. We've sort of increasingly been encouraging people to engage with us and engage in Atlas on a -- in a more friction-free basis. And so there are plenty of customers in the sales sold side that are doing monthly invoicing in arrears. And so again, not something that's driving meaningful deferred revenue when you're doing your sort of calculated billings calculations. So I think that's important to understand. On the self-service side, it's really more of a portfolio dynamic. So it's lots of smaller customers. And so you can see a particular outlier here or there, but they tend not to meaningfully move the needle. I think what we're talking about in terms of the slower growth that we saw from existing customers is really something macro economically driven, right? Just -- it's virtually unprecedented to have this kind of much of a macroeconomic shift. And as -- when people -- the database usage is directly correlated to the usage intensity of their business. And so we're seeing that. And it's why that's we're incorporating that into the forecast going forward. Sure. Yes. Customers obviously, would always love discounts. But no, there really hasn't been an increase there. I do think we've seen some, sort of, like I would describe it as anecdotally interesting, but quantitatively, not meaningful or material outliers in terms of payment terms -- a one-off here or there, but nothing that I would describe as, sort of, broad-based or a true trend. You know, we did some internal analysis and looked at, sort of, payment terms and everything else. And so we haven't seen anything meaningfully different there, like I said, other than, sort of, an anecdote here or there that's, sort of, interesting. But you'd have to work -- you have to really torture to kind of call it a trend. Yeah. I would just also add, and we said this in the prepared remarks, but just so people are clear, both the self-service side customers start small, and one of the things that we've been able to do in the direct sales side, as I mentioned, is sort of reduced friction. What that means is, people tend to come on at smaller revenue levels, but then we see great growth and expansion within Atlas. And so, not as much, I wouldn't get carried away with the sort of near-term takeaway in terms of the revenue impact, but in terms of how it sets us up in fiscal 2022 and beyond, we feel very good about it. Yeah. So, I think about it really in three main buckets, and it's probably clear, but just because it's important enough, and we are trying to shed the insight and the color, I want to make sure it's sort of clear and well understood by folks. So I think one of three main buckets, there is new customers coming in, which continues to be strong, and we saw an acceleration in that. There is turning customers, meaning customers leaving, and we saw no increase in that. And the rest is just the expansion rate from existing customers, and what we saw there is slower growth from those existing customers. So just to be clear, still growth, right? And so, what we saw there was is within some of that, you see people adjusting their consumption levels based on the underlying trends in their business, and so that's really what's happening. Yes. So we didn't call it and quantify the number, but it was a significant increase and contributor to the strong outperformance in Q1. And this is where we've tried to call out pretty consistently from folks when that happens just given that it introduces this increased variability and the reduced comparability from period-to-period, both sequentially as well as year-over-year. And as Dev mentioned, it's not something that we're particularly trying to drive, but it's just sort of the way the deals in any given quarter fall out from a pipeline perspective. One thing I'll just add, we did add some of the disclosure that's historically been in the Qs. We did pull that forward into the release to help people to see the percent of subscription revenue from Enterprise Advanced and percent from the direct sales force. Just, I know some people are doing some of those calculations. And so rather than making folks wait, we decided to incorporate that and pull that up into the release and hope that's helpful. In terms of our guidance now versus in March? Yes. I think the most simple way to think about it is at the time of our guidance in March, I think people would not have been expecting that much of the working world would be still shut down and/or talking about working through home through the rest of the year and all the other things that are sort of going on macroeconomically. So we obviously had a great Q1 and powered through that, but we applied the same kind of framework or rubric, if you will, to the new business piece where we looked at it region-by-region. And I guess, maybe the most simplistic way of thinking about it is, if you thought previously that you could shade or grade different regions at different risk levels, meaning the -- in Region A, there would be -- it would be high risk and a much bigger impact. And in the Region B, it would be a much smaller impact. I think when you look at the universe today, at least when we look at things, everything in the high-risk, high-impact region, right? And so that puts pressure. It's not just on a global pocket here or there, but it's really quite broad-based. And it's also going on for longer. So you've got a bigger impact that's happening for a longer period of time. And then secondly, at the time of the guidance in March, we hadn't seen any of the slower expansion -- the slower growth in the existing Atlas customers. And so since then, we've seen that, so we've updated the forecast model to -- and then the guidance to incorporate that as well, and so just trying to give all of you the best view that we have on the business. And I think despite that, and despite the fact that sort of while we had quantified the impact in March, so 15 to 25, clearly, magnitude of the impact now for the full year is greater than that. And despite that, given the strong execution, we're able to raise the midpoint of the guide given how well we've been doing and how strong we feel about -- how well we're positioned. In challenging environment. Yes. I think what I'd say is because it was so broad-based, and again, we sort of dissected it in the way that I described, you can see that the new customer additions are strong, and we looked and we saw \u2013 we did not see an increase in customers churning. And so really, it's just about what is the expansion behavior, what is the growth rate of that existing base. And it was so broad-based. And so modest on sort of a per customer impact, if you will, but broad-based and so coincident with the global shutdown, lockdown that sort of started happening in mid- to late March, that the correlation is quite high. And when you think about just if you're running a business, if you've got an application and there is dramatically less usage, your business is taking a hit as so many businesses are, the underlying impact of that is significant to your business and some of that in a consumption usage-based model starts to flow through. I think, importantly, based on everything we've seen, and there's a macroeconomic recovery, which we're currently not forecasting for fiscal 2021, I would expect that, that would recover as well. Again, it might be a different situation where we're seeing increases in churn or people leaving or shutting off applications or stuff like that, but that's not the behavior that we're seeing. And so I think if you look further out from sort of a longer-term duration perspective when there's a recovery or normalization there, I would expect that we would be a beneficiary of that, and it would become helpful and additive to growth. Clearly, we've had very good customer additions as you can see in the numbers, and I think that sort of speaks to the product market fit and the long-term opportunity that we have. Yes. We didn't really see anything like that. I mean, obviously, in any quarter, there are some deals that you get that you didn't expect to get or deals slip or whatever. And when we've seen meaningful variances there, we've tried to call that out. But no, we didn't really see anything like that. I think the key things to think about in terms of Q1 and maybe, in particular, Q2 relative to Q1 because, obviously, we're guiding down sequentially is Q1 was a really strong EA quarter. And given the term license revenue under 606, that makes it a really tough sequential compare. Secondly, as we said from March, and it continues through to today, we expect a bigger impact in Q2 from coronavirus and the challenges that we have from the overall market. And then third, we mentioned the slower growth from existing Atlas customers in Q1. We only experienced that for a partial quarter in Q1. And so I think that's \u2013 you need to think about that happening for the full quarter in Q2. So I think that's really it. I don't think about it. It's necessarily about smaller or weaker pipelines. We're seeing, as Dev mentioned in his remarks, really strong engagement and customer activity and everything else like that. So I wouldn't think of the guide in that context. I think about it more in terms of the factors that I just walked through. Yes. I wouldn't think about \u2013 I'd probably not for me to get into sort of pipeline, let alone sort of pipeline by product or channel or anything else like that. So I wouldn't \u2013 I don't think that's like the right way to head down. I think if I'm looking at Q2 guide relative to Q1, I go back to the things I mentioned in terms of the tough sequential compare given the strong EA quarter, the big COVID impact in Q2 and then the full quarter of the slower growth. Yes. Actually, I was on the phone -- well, technically, the Zoom call with one of the most senior execs of one of the largest systems integrators in the world two days ago. So the interest level continues to be very, very high. And so, we're seeing actually another senior exec from another large systems integrator was asking me, how could he acquire more MongoDB skills more quickly, because they're seeing so much demand. And you have to recognize that, obviously, SIs have a lot of people, and they want access to talent. And people really understand these new platforms and these new architectures and so forth. And so, while they're retooling their existing organization, they're also looking for new skill sets. The other thing that I would also add is we have Frank D'Souza, who is the former Founder and CEO of Cognizant on our Board. So, he is a real domain expert in this place and he has really helped us broaden our thinking around both working with larger systems integrators -- global systems integrators as well as more boutique and regional players to really accelerate our business with the size and so that's a segment that we think there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to do a lot of business with."

            "name": "Dev Ittycheria",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We have a lot to cover. But before I do, I would like to speak to what's happening across the United States and in many parts of the world. I want to state unequivocally that MongoDB stands with the black community against racism, violence and hate. We are distraught by the spate of recent deaths of, and other horrific incidents towards members of the black community, all because a bigotry that is far too prevalent in our society. MongoDB is deeply committed to creating a culture of inclusion. This is one of our core values, where everyone, no matter what they look like, where they're from, whom they love or what God they pray to, is treated equally. Moving forward, I will start by reviewing our first quarter results before providing some color on how our employees and customers are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and how the current environment is impacting our long-term view of the business. Looking quickly at our first quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $130.3 million, a 46% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 49% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew over 75% year-over-year and now represent 42% of our revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 18,400 customers. Delivering such strong Q1 results in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis and the associated economic disruption is a testament to the resiliency of our employees, the quality of our execution, the appeal of our technology and our positioning in the marketplace. While the high degree of uncertainty in the market will continue to have some impact on our near-term results, our results in Q1 reinforced our conviction in the long-term potential of our business. Our first operating principle is the safety and well-being of our employees and our customers. We responded early and decisively to adapt to the spread of COVID-19. I couldn't be prouder of how our employees adapted. And how quickly each of our teams retools their operating plans to address the constraints we are operating under. Our developer relations team is making Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 dashboard more accessible, by hosting it on MongoDB Atlas. Our marketing, developer relations and finance teams collaborated to launch a free Atlas credit programs for all developers looking to build applications to track and stop the spread of the virus. So far, we have helped launched 180 new initiatives. Finally, covidnearyou.org, supported by MongoDB employees and built on Atlas, has made it easier for people to track the virus in their local communities, with users having reported over 1 million personal health updates. From a business perspective, we quickly made a number of changes that allowed us to operate with minimal disruption. Our sales team was inspired by the performance of teams, in the earliest impact areas, such as China and Italy, where we actually saw an increase in customer engagement. The team adhered to its rigorous pipeline generation and deal qualification processes, resulting in strong close rates despite the challenging backdrop. Our self-serve team closely monitored the online advertising market and use the decline in advertising prices to invest more in this channel, while maintaining high rates of return. Our marketing team pivoted completely from physical to online events, resulting in 12,000 webinar attendees in Q1, compared to 2,500 a year ago. In addition, we turned MongoDB World, our flagship user conference, into an online event called MongoDB.live, which will take place next week. We have been thrilled with the response and already have over 40,000 people registered for the event. In comparison, last year, we had 2,000 people attend our in-person events. Speaking of MongoDB.live next week, we're excited to announce a slate of new products and enhancements to existing products that our engineering teams have been working on despite the significant disruption that was caused by the work-from-home transition. Finally, the rest of our teams rose to the challenge and performed admirably, against a difficult backdrop. For example, we seamlessly transitioned recruiting and onboarding to a fully virtual environment, enabling us to hit our Q1 hiring plan. We also transitioned our highly regarded summer internship program to remote experience. And we look forward to welcoming our 83 interns, chosen from the over 20,000 applications we received. While we can't predict with certainty, how long or how severe the COVID-19 global disruption will be we are seeing clear signs that the current environment is only accelerating the secular trends of which we are a long-term beneficiary. Our customers are more determined than ever to proceed with their digital transformation efforts. Businesses of all kinds, even the most technology cautious, recognize their future is powered by software. Consequently, they need to continue to invest in their digital future despite the near-term economic uncertainty. During Q1, we saw customers in even some of the most negatively impacted industries, double down on their digital transformation journeys. For example, we closed a 7-figure deal with one of the largest global auto companies. The company is making a MongoDB as a service available to internal users on their private cloud. There are currently more than 1,000 MongoDB servers in production, supporting critical use cases within the various areas of the company's digitization strategy, including their connected car initiative. Next, the volatility of the current environment is further underscoring the need to use platforms that enable speed and agility. Our customers want to move fast to quickly seize new opportunities or respond to new threats. They want to easily bring new features to market and leverage data effectively, while being able to operate at almost unlimited scale. This increased need for speed and agility plays squarely into MongoDB's core strengths. For example, one of the world's most popular consumer video chat applications was built on MongoDB technology. And was able to withstand 120x increase in concurrent users of the weekend of March 14th. In addition, we strongly believe that the current environment will only hasten the cloud transition. COVID-19 has made it abundantly clear that doing the undifferentiated work of database management is not only inefficient but can, in fact, make it harder to address users' ever-increasing expectations. Customers want to derisk their operations and devote all their energy to doing work that has high impact on the business, as opposed to managing and maintaining their own infrastructure. In Q1, we expanded our Atlas relationship with a leading North American airline. Their strategic focus is to accelerate their move to the cloud in order to modernize their applications and reduce their dependence, on the mainframe. MongoDB is helping them build an operational data layer in the cloud. Finally, our customers are learning the value of a global cloud data platform that makes multicloud easy to implement. Since the pandemic has started, all cloud providers have seen spikes in usage that have impacted their performance and availability in certain regions. In addition, cloud providers have limited certain features to avoid bottlenecks. Given the increasing likelihood of infrastructure constraints, having a data platform such as MongoDB that makes it easy to use multiple cloud providers is becoming even more important. A Canadian security company recently migrated its mobile security platform from document DB to MongoDB Atlas. In addition to reducing costs by 60% and being able to leverage all the features of MongoDB, the key objective was to create a global multicloud foundation to rapidly scale IoT, AI and transactional workloads. I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some of the other customer wins and interesting use cases from the first quarter. Grocery delivery wholesale or boxed, has seen soaring demand for the goods and services due to the pandemic. With the availability of essential supplies changing on a daily basis, they needed a highly scalable database platform to manage their supply chain in real time. They doubled down on MongoDB Atlas and started using MongoDB Charts to help with capacity planning and to ensure they could scale to meet the extreme increases in customer demand. Bingel, the leader in interactive and personalized online learning for the Belgian primary school children, turned to MongoDB on March 13 to handle the increase in demand when the government shut down all schools because of COVID-19. The company, part of Sanoma Learning, immediately became part of the country's critical infrastructure and realized it needed Atlas in order to scale to meet the needs of the country's children. Bingel rapidly migrated services and now sees and effortly handles more than 12 million online exercises a day. Forbes recently added digital asset management to its list of technologies running on Atlas. The publisher has been working with us to transition more of its digital footprint to MongoDB. Known for being an innovative brand, Forbes has many new products in development designed to help showcase its journalism fueled by digital. As it continues to lead the media industry, set new traffic records and attract new audiences, Forbes credits MongoDB for improving its ability to serve dynamic content, decreasing its total cost of ownership and make it possible to replace some of its legacy technologies. Zomato, one of the largest restaurant discovery and food delivery service in the world with over 80 million monthly active users in 24 countries, recently increased its commitment to MongoDB to power its logistics application, an essential piece of the last mile in the food delivery chain. This helps Zomato ensure that they are able to keep up with increased demand, efficiently map their food delivery orders to the right delivery partner, track their journey and ensure on-time deliveries. French multinational, Schneider Electric, which provides energy and automation digital solutions for efficiency and sustainability, recently expanded its commitment to MongoDB. The company chose MongoDB to help rapidly scale new secure requirements for its new IoT-enabled platform EcoStructure, which makes businesses safer, more reliable and more connected. The company leverages Atlas to reduce TCO and help its team scale and manage large volumes of data more effectively. NETS Group, the leading payment service provider in Scandinavia and across Europe, chose MongoDB as its anchor data platform to modernize its payment services and establish a distributed micro services architecture. With MongoDB, the NETS Group makes it even easier and more intuitive for its customers to handle digital payments and related solutions. Woolworths Group, one of the largest retailers in Australia and New Zealand, decided to start offering digital receipts to its 11.7 million reward customers in order to minimize human contact during COVID-19. The retailer used Atlas to create a new platform to ingest all of its point-of-sale data, more than 350 transactions per second and serve it out to customers in real time. MongoDB was able to help them get the system up and running in under three weeks. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance in Q1. In many ways, the world's technology has seen more than three years' worth of change in the past three months. While we expect the uncertainty and the volatility to continue, we remain very focused on building for the long-term and the large opportunity we see ahead. With that, let me now turn the call over to Michael to review our financial results. Yes. Thanks, Sanjit. I just want to remind people that we don't push people towards any particular consumption model, because one of our strong value proposition is that you can run MongoDB anywhere. And so we still have lots of customers, even though Atlas has grown so quickly, have lots of customers who purchased Enterprise Advanced. And the same phenomenon happened in Q1 where we had, again, quite a robust demand for EA. I would say Atlas was also very strong. I mean Atlas grew 75% year-over-year. And so, I wouldn't suggest that it is solely because of Enterprise Advanced. And I know in previous calls, people were little worried about the growth of EA. And so, I think this puts to rest that there's still robust demand for our products and some customers want to run on-premise. They made significant commitments to their existing internal infrastructure. And obviously, a lot of customers are embracing the cloud. And we do believe that the long-term trends are towards the cloud and one of the benefits of using MongoDB now even on-premises that it gives customers easy on-ramp to cloud because they don't have to rewrite the application once they actually decide to move to the cloud. So that's one of the added benefits of going with MongoDB. Yes. So we, in general saw some initial behavior, probably mid-to-late March and saw that come down. We are assuming right now from a forecast perspective that based on everything we've been able to discern, that's related to COVID-19, and so we baked into our outlook that we'll see those continue. Thanks, Tyler. I think this is just a function of us just being increasingly really, really focused on things like pipeline generation and being -- and on the self-service side, being much more learning, and as we're growing our business, understanding what programs work. And so the efficacy of our digital marketing efforts is just improving over time. And so -- and I think frankly, it's also a function of the fact that our value proposition is very strong. As I said, we have a high degree of customer engagement, even with customers in highly challenged industries, as we've talked about the digital trends are accelerating, people want to move to more modern cloud-native stocks, because software is powering almost every business, and they want to use that as a competitive advantage. And I would also say the fact that our platform makes multi-cloud very, very easy, gives customers confidence that investing in MongoDB enables them real optionality. And so, I think all those things are just giving us confidence in the long-term health of our business. Frankly, we're not seeing any real changes. Obviously, I think we've talked about this in the past. Clearly, we partner with all the major cloud providers. And Amazon and Microsoft or Azure, in particular, have their alternatives to MongoDB, but we've not seen any real change in the competitive dynamics. Frankly, when we're competing, we feel really, really good about our position. Those products are clones of MongoDB, and so when we expose the full feature set and all the capabilities available in MongoDB and through Atlas, it becomes a pretty easy decision. The things that we worry about, frankly, are the deals that we're not a participant in. And so just as a virtue of their reach, their brand, they're clearly gaining business that we just don't always have access to. That being said, Google, as we talked about in the past, doesn't have a competitive product, and the partnership there is really strong. They named us one of the technology partners of the year. And the sales teams do a lot of joint planning -- joint account planning and work in various -- in Europe and in North America and other parts of the world. And so that business is growing quickly. But frankly, our business is all the cloud providers are growing quickly. So we feel quite -- we feel very good about our value proposition. Thanks, Joey. So in terms of M&A, we don't have any, obviously, specific plans to go acquire any new technology. We, obviously, will be opportunistic. We've made three acquisitions since I've been here. One was the WiredTiger acquisition in 2014. Then it was mLab, and then most recently, last year was Realm. And they were frankly opportunistic that allowed us to accelerate some product stuff that we wanted to do and build more momentum in our Atlas business. We are very focused on our organic efforts. Now that being said, obviously, we're not nai\u0308ve about the macroeconomic has deteriorated. There's a lot of businesses that are maybe struggling, and there's an opportunity to potentially acquire some assets that may come in the market. And so it will be all around the context of how it further accelerates our product at our product platform. And so that's the context by which we look at acquisitions. And at this point, we don't see anything in the near-term horizon that would -- that we're contemplating. In terms of partnerships, we feel really good about the Alibaba relationship. They just gave us an update. We're about past six months in terms of when that relationship really got started from an operational point of view. And they've told us that they're actually -- demand is higher than they've expected. And so we're not factoring that into any form of guidance, but we feel -- the point that they shared with us is the product market for MongoDB in China is very strong, and they're feeling really good about the customer traction they're getting. So that's another strong signal about our value proposition and why customers not just in North America and Europe, but also in large parts of Asia are gravitating to MongoDB. Yeah. I would say it's not harder. It's actually becoming easier, because what COVID and the pandemic is basically causing everyone to recognize, even the most technically conservative or cautious customers that just staying a legacy technology is not the place to be. What people need is the ability to move quickly, and they need to be able to change directions quickly, too. So they need to be able to respond to new threats or seize new opportunities. And so MongoDB plays right into that, like gives them the ability to build new features and capabilities very, very fast and really gives them a very scalable, durable mission-critical platform to build the most sophisticated applications on. So, we frankly are seeing a lot of demand. We've been running a lot of webinars. And the demand and interest level is really, really high. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have over 40,000 people already registered for MongoDB.live conference. I encourage everyone on this call to try and register and try and attend as many of the sessions as possible. We have some really exciting announcements planned. And so we're seeing a lot of interest. And again, it just comes back to the fact that people want to move to more modern platforms, software is the future for almost every business. And software becomes a competitive advantage. Consequently, they want to build on a platform that enables them to build software applications quickly, to build more modern applications, leveraging mobile, machine learning, micro services, et cetera, and to do it on a platform that has a large developer community and momentum around. And so, given all those things, we feel really good. Now, we do recognize that, obviously, the current macroenvironment is not great, but our long-term view on the business is very bullish. I would say they maybe started a little smaller than planned and then grow over time. And we much rather engage with the customer sooner than wait for some bigger deal. And so, the more we condition customers to use MongoDB earlier and for more of their applications, the more that kind of allows us to build a more meaningful kind of relationship with those customers, and we become the de facto standard in those accounts. And so that's all long-term goodness. And so, when we see new customer acquisitions really strong, when we see the level of interest and demand for MongoDB to be strong, when we see the level of attendees to our webinars and conferences and our large user conference to be really strong, these are all signs -- really great signs for us for the future. Thank you. On the marketing side, what we talked about and Michael mentioned in his remarks, is that -- and actually, I also mentioned is that we're seeing obviously some very attractive rates from an online advertising and digital marketing areas. So, we're frankly leveraging those lower rates to do more because we're seeing such high rates of return and so we think that, that makes a lot of sense. And so obviously, as our self-serve business continues to grow, we feel like those investments make a lot of sense. And so -- and on the sales side, we've already -- we've had a pretty ambitious hiring plan and a lot of it will depend on us seeing how results go and if -- we typically make investments from a success-based point of view. So, the -- where teams are having a lot of effects, we plow more resources. And if you feel that things are going a little slower than planned, we'll try and figure out what's going on. But in general, we've been really pleased with how our sales team did, especially given our Q1 results. And we -- I have a lot of -- frankly a lot of confidence in our salesforce. I believe our salesforce is one of the best in the business and we wouldn't be delivering these results without the strong salesforce that we have. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining today. Obviously, this is a crazy environment, but now I want to reiterate MongoDB's commitment to culture of inclusion. This is something that's one of our core values and we're very committed to making sure that people of all walks of life are treated equally. I also want to just acknowledge that obviously, we're still dealing with pandemic. So, I wish all of you all the best and to stay safe and healthy. With that, thank you for your time and we look forward to speaking to you soon. Take care. Bye, bye."

All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call, with an opportunity for questions-and-answers at the end. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Brian Denyeau, with ICR. Please go ahead.\nBrian Denyeau: Thank you, Selena. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to review MongoDB's fourth quarter fiscal 2022 financial results, which we announced in our press issued after the close of the market today. Joining on the call today are Dev Ittycheria, President and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance and our planned investments. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those related to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our business, results of operations, clients and the macroeconomic environment that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our fourth quarter results before giving you a broader company update. Looking quickly at our fourth quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $266 million, a 56% year-over-year increase and above the high-end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 85% year-over-year, representing 58% of revenue. We had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 33,000 customers. The fourth quarter marked another major milestone as we crossed $1 billion in annualized revenue run rate. Crossing over the $1 billion mark five years after reaching the annualized $100 million mark is clear evidence of the value MongoDB's application data platform offers customers, large and small, all over the world. Our excellent fourth quarter performance was broad-based. We saw success in nearly every industry, geography and customer type. It was powered once again by the ongoing strength of Atlas. We also saw an uptick in sales for Enterprise Advanced, which speaks to the popularity of MongoDB, regardless of where our technology is deployed. Customer net additions remained robust, especially in our direct channel where Q4 marked a new record. It is expected that hundreds of millions of new applications will be developed over the next few years, as most organizations now recognize that a competitive advantage has to be built rather being blocked with off-the-shelf software. The core reason for our success is that in an era where there is an urgency to build compelling modern applications, MongoDB reduces the friction and cost of working with data, which is the biggest challenge developers face. However, the developer experience of working with data has become increasingly complex. The technologies and mechanisms of working with data have continued to get more fragmented as there has been a proliferation of specialized and niche data technologies, each designed to solve a slice of a growing set of necessary data use cases. The hyperscale cloud providers are reinforcing this by taking a bag-of-tools approach by introducing many proprietary point solutions. This approach pushes complexity on to developers, to wrangle these data technologies in their applications and develop workarounds to address scalability and performance. The complexity created by this data sprawl impedes the speed of innovation, adds cost and effectively becomes a direct business risk. MongoDB's application data platform takes a radically different approach to liberate the developer from the unnecessary data complexity to accelerate innovation. First, our platform removes enormous friction in how a developer works with data instead of requiring developers to work with inflexible data models, MongoDB is built on the document model, which is aligned to the way how developers think and code. The docking model not only allows developers to build applications faster but to also easily make changes in response to business conditions or customer feedback. Second, our application data platform enables developers to focus on the needs of the business as opposed to working around the constraints of their data infrastructure. MongoDB abstracts away all that complexity through an architecture that is designed to address the vast majority of use cases. Instead of having to deal with numerous point solutions, customers can use our tightly integrated platform that offers a unified and seamless developer experience. Third, our platform is designed to meet the most demanding requirements for performance and scale. Unlike other solutions that struggle scaling beyond a few nodes in a few regions, MongoDB's application data platform can enable anyone to provision a globally distributed and persistent data platform anywhere in a matter of minutes with just a few clicks of a button by virtue of being available on 80-plus regions across AWS, Azure and GCP. Perhaps the best evidence that our platform is resonating in the marketplace is in the growth of our customer base. We ended the year with over 33,000 customers, of which over 1,300 are fix figure customers and 164 are $1 million plus customers, the latter number growing nearly 70% year-over-year. This level of customer adoption is reflective of our popularity around the world as well as our value as a general purpose rather than a niche technology. To provide a small sampling of how MongoDB is used across different industries. In Financial Services, MongoDB is used for a trading platform, global payment data store, a digital end-to-end loan origination and servicing solution, general ledger system of record, regulatory risk, treasury and for many other back-office processes. In the retail sector, MongoDB is used for single view, real-time product catalogs, hyper-personalization, recommendation engines, AI-driven customer engagement, inventory and supply chain management, including sensor tracking and omni-channel user experiences. In the telecom industry, MongoDB is used to enable smart home services, Internet of Things, media streaming, call routing, endpoint management, real-time fulfillment, AI-based fraud detection and advanced billing and payment services. These are a few examples of how MongoDB is being used. We also do extensive work in the health care, manufacturing, gaming, oil and gas and many other industries. We continue to be excited about the future and the massive opportunities in front of us. Businesses across all industries will continue to invest heavily in software as a means to differentiate themselves to seize new opportunities and to respond to new threats. While this has been happening aggressively over the past decade, we are still only in the early stage of this movement. As infrastructure becomes more advanced, with chips getting more powerful, algorithms getting smarter and networks getting faster, the capability for innovation only increases. Powerful software powered by real-time data will empower experiences and business models we cannot even conceive of today. Future applications will need to be incredibly responsive, increasingly global and requires strong distribution data to the edge or across the world. However, there is still a dearth of development talent to meet this demand. Consequently, organizations will invest in technologies that allow developers to go faster by offering an integrated suite of data capabilities to build smarter applications. In fiscal 2023, we'll continue to build on our momentum and advantages in the marketplace. In product, we'll continue innovating to enhance the value of our platform. Our high win rates and strong broad-based performance gives us confidence to continue to rapidly scale our sales organization as we remain fractionally penetrated in the 70 billion-plus market. In marketing we see a great opportunity to elevate our brand and our value proposition to the voice of our customers who are doing remarkable things to our platform across different industries and geographies. Finally, we'll continue investing in our people, processes and systems to support rapidly scaling our company. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the fourth quarter. Ultrafast grocery delivery pioneer, Getir has revolutionized last mile grocery delivery with its 10-minute grocery delivery proposition, making thousands of everyday items available in minutes. The company has built its core grocery delivery platform on MongoDB community and migrate to Atlas. Getir achieved superior performance and reliability and also relied on Atlas' always-on multi-region clusters for 99.995% uptime during its critical US launch. One of the largest North American banks chose MongoDB as its modern database standard to fuel modernization, improve uptime and power a highly available, always-on secure customer experience for the bank's 10 million of retail customers. The bank runs over 200 applications on MongoDB across digital, capital markets, consumer lending, risk and payment divisions. Use cases span mainframe offload, operational data store, single view of the customer, time series, cashing, real-time analytics, mobile and content management. Societ\u00e0 Generale d'Informatica or Sogei, is an information technology company operated by the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance. It recently chose MongoDB as the application data platform for a government initiative that mandate citizens to present a digital or paper certificate to show whether they have been vaccinated, tested negative or recovered from COVIN-19. Called the Greenpass project, the program grants access to activities like restaurant dining, museums, cinemas, amusement parks and more. Sogei was able to generate 150 million certificates in less than 45 days with MongoDB. Content cloud company Box empowers more than 100,000 businesses globally to revolutionize how they work by securely connecting their people, information and applications. Box's content ingestion solutions, Box Shuttle leverages MongoDB Atlas to accelerate a customers' migration to the cloud. Box wanted a FedRAMP-ready multi-cloud managed cloud database to support high throughput and horizontal scale by [sorting] (ph) large data sets. One of the largest supermarket chains in the United States selected Atlas and Atlas Search to power its enterprise promotions engine. The engine gives customers immediate access to promotions and coupons, while shopping at any one of its thousands of stores across the US. With Atlas Search, the company was able to modernize the data structure so that developers can make more updates more quickly and use multidimensional array lookups to run 5 million cruise per day faster. Insulet Corporation is an innovative medical device company dedicated to simplifying life for people with diabetes. Insulet's flagship product, Omnipod, is the first tubeless automated insulin delivery system that is helping people with diabetes lead better lives. Insulet migrated to MongoDB Atlas to reduce costs while simplifying the complexity of mission-critical database management, configuration, upgrades and scale without business interruption while having HIPAA, PII and PCI compliance protection. In summary, we had another excellent quarter. We are seeing continued strong momentum because we're solving one of the most important problems impeding innovation namely the challenges of working with data. We are more optimistic than ever about our prospects and we'll continue investing and executing to capture the large market opportunity ahead of us. With that, here's Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the fourth quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2023. First, I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $266.5 million, up 56% year-over-year. Subscription revenue, $258.2 million, up 58% year-over-year and professional services revenue was $8.3 million, up 17% year-over-year. It was a very strong quarter across the board, and we exceeded our expectations for both Atlas and Enterprise Advanced. Overall, Atlas' strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew 85% in the quarter compared to the previous year and represents 58% of total revenue compared to 49% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and 58% last quarter. On a sequential basis, this quarter's strong Atlas revenue performance was driven in part by the exceptionally high in-quarter expansion of existing customers that we experienced and previously called out in Q3. Simply put, strong in-quarter expansion benefits, not just the revenue and the completed quarter, but also the revenue in the following quarter because the new quarter starts with a higher beginning run rate. In Q4, we experienced strong in-quarter expansion of existing customers that was in line with historical trends versus the exceptionally high growth rates we experienced in Q3. Enterprise Advanced had a particularly strong quarter. An important driver of the strength of EA is the success we are seeing in our large, high potential accounts. As a reminder, we provide incremental resources to some of our most promising customers in order to accelerate the adoption of MongoDB. A number of these high potential accounts are primarily using EA, and we had a strong new business quarter with them in Q4. During the fourth quarter, we again grew our customer base by over 2,000 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 33,000, which is up from over 24,800 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 4,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 3,000 in the year ago period. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform as well as self-serve customers with whom we've now established a direct sales relationship. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 31,500 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 23,300 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB, in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,307 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 975 in the year ago period. As Dev mentioned, we ended the year with 164 customers with at least $1 million in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 98 in the year ago period. The continued strong growth in our $100,000 and $1 million-plus annualized spend is an indication of the success of our land and expand strategy and the fact that we are increasingly becoming a strategic platform for our customers. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $196.6 million, representing a gross margin of 74%, which is up from last quarter and up from 72% in the year-ago period. Our loss from operations was $1.3 million or a negative 1% operating margin for the fourth quarter compared to a negative 9% margin in the year-ago period. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was primarily driven by our revenue outperformance. Net loss in the fourth quarter was $6.3 million or $0.09 per share based on 67 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $19.9 million or $0.33 per share on 60.5 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the fourth quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. This quarter, we saw strong sequential growth in deferred revenue, driven by the strength of Enterprise Advanced, given EA contracts are predominantly billed annually in advance. As we've discussed in the past, Q4 is the seasonally strongest quarter for our EA installed base. As a reminder, in Q3, we noted that our deferred revenue benefited from several very large Atlas early renewals. We did not see a similar impact in Q4, but would like to reiterate that some of those large deals that were new early in Q3 were originally scheduled to renew in Q1. Operating cash flow in the quarter was positive $22.3 million. After taking into consideration approximately $5.5 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was positive $16.8 million in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $20.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. For the full fiscal year 2022, we had positive operating cash flow of $7 million and negative free cash flow of $6.7 million. While we have had positive operating cash flow quarters before, this is the first full year in our company's history that we generated cash from operations. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2023. Please note that the guidance provided for fiscal year 2023 include certain refinements to our non-GAAP financial measures for expenses related to stock-based compensation to more accurately to take the underlying business results each quarter. For comparative purposes, we've provided a historical reconciliation of these updated measures in our earnings release. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $263 million to $267 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $5 million to $2 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.12 to $0.08 based on 67.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.151 billion to $1.181 billion. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $22 million to $7 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.29 based on 68.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our strong guidance for fiscal 2023 reflects our underlying confidence in our market opportunity and our ability to deliver strong growth at significant scale. Let me provide some incremental context around our guidance. In Q1, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to see a slight sequential revenue decline as Q1 is typically a lower new business quarter for Enterprise Advanced in Q4. As a reminder, EA revenue recognition under ASC 606 is disproportionately affected by the upfront term license component. In addition, as we've discussed in the past, Atlas' sequential growth in Q1 is lower compared to other quarters, driven by seasonal factors impacting consumption, most notably the fact that there are simply fewer calendar days in Q1 than in other quarters. Let me also discuss how we are factoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic into our fiscal year 2023 guidance. First, unlike in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, we do not assume any impact of the pandemic on our revenue performance in fiscal 2023. Despite the ongoing uncertainty related to the pandemic, our performance over the last two years gives us confidence and our ability to execute in this environment. In other words, our guidance reflects that we have more confidence operating in the current environment than in either the last two years. Second, on the expense side. Our guidance anticipates the normalization of travel event and office expenses as COVID-19 restrictions continue to relax. We have previously expected a normalization in the second half of fiscal 2022 but the spread of the Delta and Omicron variants delayed the return-to-office plans and reduced employee travel. As a result, our travel, event and office expenses in fiscal 2022 were only modestly higher than in fiscal 2021 and well below our initial expectation. However, we now expect normalization starting in Q2, and we anticipate an incremental $45 million to $55 million in travel, events and office expenses in fiscal 2023. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent fourth quarter results, we continue acquiring new customers at a strong pace, and our revenue growth is a testament to the breadth of platform adoption and our increasing strategic importance to our customers. We remain convinced that we're in the early innings of pursuing our large market opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKash Rangan: Congrats on the quarter. I just want to clarify the seasonality comment, Michael that you made with respect to Atlas. So we're merely talking about it sequentially only because Atlas is a much larger business today than it was exactly a year ago going into Q1, or are we actually calling out any structural changes in consumption that underlie that forecast? I also have a follow-up question. Thank you so much.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So what we're talking about \u2013 and we called this out last year, is that Q1 for Atlas is seasonally lower because of the fewer calendar days in the quarter. It's a consumption-based model. And just obviously, you need days in order to consume and Q1 has fewer of those days. But the overall cohort behaviors as evidenced by the Q4 numbers are very strong, and we feel good about the underlying patterns.\nKash Rangan: Got it. So consumption as a structural change driver of your Atlas business is still less positive as you felt \u2013 \nMichael Gordon: No change.\nKash Rangan: No change. Got it. Yeah. And one for Dev, when you look at the cohort of Atlas customers initial deployment steadily small, but then what are some of the bigger deployments on Atlas looking like that rival the more traditional on-prem deployments that give you the conviction that that some of the biggest database appointments on the planet could end up being completely cloud native and the prices two to three years from now? Thank you so much.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. Thanks, Kash. I would say just \u2013 I'd point to the seven-figure customers. The majority of those customers are on Atlas today. So we have large customers and actually even cutting-edge start-ups or running mission-critical workloads for start-ups is probably the entire business on Atlas for large customers, they're running mission-critical workloads. And so Atlas is not just for small workloads. We're seeing \u2013 and this has happened now for a number of years, we're seeing enterprises increasingly get comfortable with moving mission-critical workloads to the cloud. And one of the benefits of moving to MongoDB is that you get real optionality of not just starting on-prem and moving to the cloud, but going from one cloud provider to another. So we're seeing strong interest -- and I think we have the customer proof points to give people confidence to really move mission-critical workloads to Atlas.\nKash Rangan: Tremendous. Thank you so much.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Kash. The next question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nSanjit Singh: Well. Thank you so much for the questions, and my congrats on another exceptional year. Dev, you mentioned that you went from $100 million to $1 in the [Technical difficulty]...\nDev Ittycheria: Hey, Sanjit? Hey Sanjit, we're having trouble hearing your question it's coming across very muffled.\nSanjit Singh: I apologize, Dev. I think that was my headset. So question is essentially like as you scale beyond $1 billion, going from $1 billion to $2 billion, is there anything in the sort of how you go to market, how you organize the business change versus how you got to $1 billion? Typically, in prior sort of ramps of software companies, there's been a bit of a hiccup scaling past $1 billion. As this business crosses $1 billion, how do you feel about your ability to scale to $2 billion and beyond over time?\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. So we've constantly always tried to stay ahead of where the business is in terms of anticipating changes to our go-to-market model. I mean, as you can imagine, in the early days, we had one model, which is, a direct sales force really trying to sell to everyone. Then we introduced an inside sales team. Then we introduced self-serve. Then we've introduced the notion of having focused teams on high-end accounts. We introduced the notion of removing friction from the initial selling process to get customers on our platform more quickly. So we're always refining our go-to-market motion in anticipation of, one, how big this market is, and we try to meet customers where they are versus trying to force them to try to engage with us in one way. And you'll see us continue to do that. We're going to be focused -- increasing on verticalization. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're seeing a lot of traction in key vertical industries. We're developing a deep degree of confidence around those industries. We've been having a team focused on solutions marketing for a number of years to particular industries. And you're going to see us organize our sales teams more overtime with a vertical orientation. You'll also see us going after what we call digital natives, which are kind of fast-growing mid-market customers who are building software and not just buying software. And they will obviously have a lot of value -- see a lot of value from MongoDB. So you can see us continue to push the envelope in terms of innovation. And I would argue that we have the best sales organization in enterprise software.\nSanjit Singh: Well, plenty of opportunity ahead. So it sounds like, a lot to look forward to. Michael, on the guidance, you did a really great job of sort of contextualizing how you're approaching guidance this year versus last year, particularly on the element of COVID. But I guess I just have to ask, just given the geopolitical environment that we're in, particularly with exposure, potential exposure to Russia and Eastern Europe and then we also have this element of higher oil prices and what that can do for the macro environment more broadly, to what extent did you sort of incorporate those factors into this year's guidance, understanding that COVID looks hopefully, knock on wood, largely behind us.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So thank you. So obviously we try and be thoughtful and transparent in the guidance. That said, we don't have a crystal ball for what's going to happen geopolitically or macroeconomically. I think we feel confident in our ability to execute sort of despite the uncertainty. Specifically on your point about Russia, I would just call out, we have very limited revenue in Russia for fiscal 2022, was roughly a low single-digit millions revenue contributor. We're obviously complying with all those relevant laws and regulations as they emerge. But obviously, if there are future things in the horizon that we can't contemplate we'll certainly update you, but we feel good about the outlook.\nSanjit Singh: Super helpful context. Thank you, Michael and congrats.\nMichael Gordon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Sanjit. The next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Dev, could you speak a little bit to the relationship with the big hyperscalers? It looked like the deals influenced by them kind of shot up quite a bit, like -- and obviously, this funny relationship of coopetition. But what you saw -- what did you see there in terms of like how they are interacting with you and how that relationship is changing over time? And then I have one follow-on.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. The basis of our relation with the cloud providers is really, first and foremost, based on the strong product markets of MongoDB. MongoDB is incredibly popular and the popularity spans all major cloud providers. I think what we have shown first with Google as we started working with them very closely, given their ambitions to grow their business quickly is that we could partner effectively and help them acquire a lot of new customers, a lot of new workloads onto their platform. This did not go unnoticed by some of the other cloud providers, and we started going deeper with AWS. As people may remember, in early 2018, AWS introduced a competitor, a clone of MongoDB and there were some worries about how that relationship would evolve. And I'm pleased to say that I feel like the relationship has never been stronger. We have deep relationships in the field. We partner more on deals. And AWS has recognized that MongoDB drives a lot of demand to their platform. And so the relationship there is very healthy. And we're also doing a lot of business with Azure. So I would say our win rates are still very high against them when we go head to head against them. But clearly, they're good partners, and we're investing a lot in those relationships.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yeah. Okay. And then, Michael, on the guidance, like it's really impressive to see the margin guidance, if I consider the $45 million to $55 million extra spending that we see this year, can you just talk a little bit about the other drivers that helped you achieve that?\nMichael Gordon: The what -- sorry, that helped us?\nRaimo Lenschow: So just like it does look like the internal efficiencies or the scale of the businesses that allow you to do that because that looks -- despite the spending, the outlook is actually better than what I modeled?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. No, No, we've been continuing to show meaningful operating leverage. We feel good about that. We're seeing scaling throughout the business. That said, we certainly are investing to pursue the market opportunity. That means both investments in sales and marketing and in R&D and obviously, sort of everything else to scale the business. But no, we've been really pleased both at the gross margin line with the success, given where Atlas is as a percentage of this and executing against the plan there, as well as on the bottom line. And I think that we'll continue to execute on that, but we feel really good about where we are.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Congrats. Well done.\nMichael Gordon: Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Raimo. The next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nPhil Winslow: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. If we look at just an analysis of just sales efficiency, it seems that the productivity continues to rise, but you also continue to add capacity. Would give us a sense of just what you're seeing from the inside in terms of productivity and how you're thinking about this coming year in terms of just capacity adds but also productivity? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Thanks, Phil. We feel really good about the performance and the productivity of the sales organization. It performance was broad-based. One of the traps in software sales is that you can get -- get some big deals can mask weak performance in the rest of the sales cohort. We're not seeing that. We're seeing broad-based performance across our entire sales teams across all the different theaters. So that's giving us a lot of confidence. We're adding a lot of people quickly. MongoDB is viewed as a very attractive place to come to. We believe that we really help people understand and master the art of sales. And so we've put a lot of time and effort into developing our people. We -- Because we're growing so fast, we give people tremendous opportunities for growth. So people can really grow their careers here at MongoDB and we push the envelope on innovation. So we're doing things that not many other companies are doing. And so all things put together, we feel really good about the sales organization and as a result, it's the reason why we're investing aggressively to expand the capacity of that organization.\nPhil Winslow: Great and thanks, guys. Keep doing the great work\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Phil.\nOperator: Thank you, Phil. The next question comes from DJ Hynes with Canaccord. Please proceed.\nDJ Hynes: Hi, guys. Nice set of numbers here. Dave, we've seen a bit of an inflection in revenue per customer over the last couple of quarters. I'm wondering if that's more a function of your big customers getting bigger, right? I mean, we saw a record $100,000-plus adds -- or is it all the smaller starting Atlas customers that you've added over the last couple of years now kind of ramping to more material spend levels. I'm sure it's a bit of both, but I'd love to get some qualitative cover -- color.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. In general, the expansion rates of the cohorts are very strong, but I think a lot of it is also due to mix. When we changed our -- the way we want to engage with customers, we saw a big influx of self-serve customers moving to a direct relationship. So obviously, that change in mix affected the revenue per customer number. And as things have kind of as a gone to more of a steady-state function, you're seeing those numbers stabilize. But we feel like we have a really huge embedded growth opportunity in our customer base, and that's where we're spending a lot of time with as well as acquiring new customers.\nDJ Hynes: Yes. Okay. And then, Michael, my follow-up for you. I mean, obviously, the EA strength in the quarter drove the strong cash flow that we saw. As you look out to fiscal 2023, do you think Mongo can be free cash flow profitable?\nMichael Gordon: Yes so \u2013 thanks for that DJ. A couple of things, I would say part of the -- so in general, it's a very strong quarter, Q4 from a cash flow perspective. I would say that's less as a result of the EA sales in and more a result of the strong Q3 inclusive of some of the pull forward that we called out previously. Typically, there is a little less in truck quarter collection from when you book business, obviously, it depends a little bit on the linearity. We haven't given specific guidance around operating cash flow positive, but I certainly do think it's noteworthy not just a strong and significant magnitude more than $20 million in Q4. But the fact that we had $7 million in positive operating cash flow for the full year I do think is noteworthy. It's not a specific milestone that we've focused on or set out, but I do think it's a positive reflection on the underlying trends of the business.\nDJ Hynes: Yes, I agree. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, DJ. The next question comes from Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Thanks a lot. Maybe two for Mike. Mike, back to the Atlas strong sequential usage growth, I'm sure you're well aware that some of your peers, snowflake confluent Datadog, that also have AWS-centric usage models called out a bit of a usage lull or unusual consumption seasonality in December, January. Did you see that? And if you -- perhaps it was offset by other drivers, or did you not? And if you didn't, what makes your model different from those peers? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Karl. So no, we saw a very strong behavior in Q4. The cohort expansion was in line with historical trends. So nothing sort of abnormal or atypical there. It was a strong quarter in Q4, as we mentioned, in part because the beginning run rate was higher given the exceptionally high expansion in Q3, but Q4 itself behave pretty normally. So I think it doesn't like fit the patterns that you're describing. Hard for me to speculate exactly all the reasons why as it relates to those other businesses, other than the fact that from the database standpoint, that it sort of has an always on component to it, for lack of a better phrase as opposed to something that is a specific...\nDev Ittycheria: Episodic.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, episodic or a query -- analytics query or batch-query driven basis.\nKarl Keirstead: Yes. Okay. That's perfectly clear. Thanks for that, Mike. And then my follow-up, I just want to be crystal clear on what you're conveying when you say that you're not assuming a pandemic impact in your fiscal '23 guidance. Mike, are you really saying that you're guiding less conservatively going forward, and therefore, implying that perhaps we should not be thinking that the beat cadence will maintain at the level you've put up in the last two to three quarters?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. The way I would think about it Karl, is that our guidance philosophy hasn't changed, but I think our perception of the uncertainty or risk of the environment has changed and given how well we've operated over the course of the last two years of the pandemic, it would be hard for us. Despite the uncertainty that still exists, I think we just have a lot of confidence that we can execute in that environment, and that hasn't been the case the last two March's when we've provided that guidance. So, I wouldn't describe it as a change in philosophy or a change in conservatism, but I think it's just sort of reacting to the facts as we have them and less risk and less uncertainty than we've had previously.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s very clear and congrats the whole team on the great results.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Karl. The next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nBrent Bracelin: Thanks for taking question here. Michael, it certainly is impressive to hear all this talk about positive free cash flow and positive cash from operations. I guess, as you think about the guide for next year, clearly much better than when what we had modeled from an operating perspective. Where do you expect to see the most operating efficiencies coming from in the coming year? And then, Dev, if you could talk a little bit about Atlas? The usage trends per customer are showing the highest growth rate that we've seen in three years. I'm just wondering here if that's seasonally strong or do you think this is just tied to a broader adoption, broader number of customers standardizing the platform? Thanks.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Brett. On the first part of the question, I don't think that there's any material skew sort of one way or other. If you look across the board, I think we'll continue to show progress overall, and that will come from sales and marketing, R&D and then overall, the rest of the organization in G&A. So we're not intentionally trying to skew that in any particular way. As Dave mentioned, we feel like we are still quite thin on the footprint coverage. And so we're trying to expand sales and marketing as rapidly as we responsibly can just to make sure that we're in as many conversations and customer dialogue as possible. And then given the breadth of the product road map and the returns that we've been getting on those investments, we think that it's prudent to invest in those as well. So there's not one particular lever that we're looking to sort of disproportionate incrementally scale. But you'll see scaling in aggregate, as you can see in the results and in the guide. And then, Dev, do you want to talk about the other.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So Brent, on your question on usage trends, whether it's seasonal or there's some other things going on. I would say it\u2019s definitely the latter. We are definitely seeing broader adoption of Atlas by customers. We're definitely adding more customers and more workloads to Atlas. And I'd also say the mission criticality of those workloads is increasing from, say, four or five years ago to today where people are now running major elements of their infrastructure, major elements of their business on our platform. And these are not applications that you turn off or slow down. And I think that's why you're seeing the usage strength as we've observed.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, I would just add, Brent, I'm not exactly sure which math you're doing, but if you're looking at sort of Atlas revenue -- average Atlas revenue for average Atlas customer, part of that today's point, will very specifically come from the fact that we're seeing increased adoption of Atlas among direct sales customers, right, which will be at a higher spending level than self-serve customers. And so that's really more of an output rather than an input. Again, we run the business on a channel basis, and that's a little bit of what's happening kind of below the surface of the math that you might be doing.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color. Great to see the momentum. Thanks\nOperator: Thank you, Brent. The next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Hey, guys. Great quarter. Dev, I want to go to the macro environment. I know the events in Russia and Ukraine are on no more than two weeks old, but I'm just kind of wondering if your discussions, I'm sure you had a few of them, with customers in Europe where there's greater concern that the continent will go into recession or several companies will go into a recession over there. Is there any change in the tone in the discussion and that investment planning? Are things getting allengated as far as deal closings? Any color that will help us understand what the state of mind is over there right now, of course, outside of Ukraine and Russia?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Outside of UK and Russia, we see no change. We feel really good about Q1 as for the guidance, and we look at this on a daily and weekly basis, and we're seeing no change.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Ittai. The next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with RBC. Please proceed.\nRishi Jaluria: Oh, wonderful. Hi, Dev. Hi, Michael. Thanks so much for taking my question. Two -- just two on my end. First, I wanted to start with the serverless offering, which is in preview mode. Can you talk a little bit about how is customer feedback and early adopter feedback been? How to think about the long-term impact of this starts to see real adoption? And maybe help us understand some use cases that you see for serverless versus the core Atlas? And then I've got a follow-up.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. So the whole notion of serverless is to essentially abstract the way the need to do capacity planning that people can basically connect to our database, start using it and not have to worry about it anymore in the database to just scale up and down based on the needs of the application. And so the early feedback has been incredibly positive. We're seeing a lot of interest. We have a lot of people using it today. We're getting great customer feedback. And you'll see us continue to invest aggressively on serverless. And we look -- we obviously will have our own dedicated offerings as well as serverless. But over time, we think service will become a more meaningful part of the business. But we're super excited by the feedback so far.\nRishi Jaluria: All right. Great. And then I wanted to go into the NRR. Showing 120%-plus NRR at $1 billion and ARR is really impressive. Can you talk a little bit about what are kind of some of the drivers of being able to maintain this level of NRR at the scale? Is it a function of expanding workloads, new use cases, upmarket momentum, lower churn. Maybe walk us through a few of the drivers for keeping it up and how to think of that metric going forward? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So we believe that we have built a very durable business. And a big reason for that is we really focused on acquiring workloads and acquiring customers and acquiring workloads in those customer accounts. And unlike other businesses where you can grow very, very quickly because you just basically manage a lot of data. We -- our unit of measure in terms of account penetration is the number of apps or number of workloads. So they do take time. No one's going to move 100 workloads overnight, but you have a great opportunity because we are so fractionally penetrated in even our existing accounts even though they may be large customers, and they're spending a lot of money with us, there's still thousands of apps that we can win, whether they're new apps or building or existing apps that they want to modernize. And so -- we also put a lot of focus on making sure our customers are successful, really ensuring that the customers get value very, very quickly from our platform, which obviously affects retention rates and churn. And so the degree to which we do that well, that also affects our net expansion rates. And so I think those two factors, along with adding new customers in general to our platform really help keep that high net retention rate.\nRishi Jaluria: All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Rishi. The next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed.\nTyler Radke: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Obviously, the Atlas revenue was really impressive this quarter. But I think the Enterprise Advanced revenue really stood out to me this quarter. It grew seven points faster than you saw last quarter where there was kind of a pull-forward dynamic. I was wondering if you could just kind of unpack the drivers of the EA performance this quarter. Was it primarily driven by an uptick in new customers? And given that EA customers tend to be larger companies, are you seeing any change in terms of the mix of legacy or traditional database migrations? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. Yeah. As we mentioned and as I commented on in the prepared remarks, it was obviously a very strong Enterprise Advance quarter. Q4 historically has been the strongest EA renewal base. We clearly demonstrated and observed very strong demand for more EA workloads. Most of the -- just if you step back more generically, most sales of EA are to existing EA customers, right, who are expanding incremental workloads. And in addition as we called out these sorts of focused accounts that we're putting more resources around, a number of them are primarily EA accounts. And we had a lot of success, deepening our penetration with those customers. And given that Q4 is a large renewal base, that's often a good time when that takes place. Certainly, EA will be volatile quarter-to-quarter given 606, but it continues to be very strong. And again, our goal is really just to give the customer\u2019s choice and meet them wherever they are in their cloud journey.\nTyler Radke: Great. And maybe a question for Dave, so you've released a lot of kind of interesting new capabilities around support for time series and in streaming, I'm just curious, how you're seeing kind of the up-tick in operational intelligence or real-time analytics within your customer base? And how impactful is that going to be in terms of growing existing accounts going forward? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Oh! So we believe that the trend of applications are getting smarter and they get smarter by embedding more data and more real-time data and more analytics into their into the application is a trend that's going to increase dramatically, which is why we believe we're well setup to take advantage of that trend. One, by definition, we're an operational to platform, but that's where you get the live data. Two, we have a distributed platform, so you can segregate nodes, one for essentially writing the transaction and the other notes for reading data. So this enables you to do that without impacting user performance. Three, we came out with capabilities, where if you want to do a sophisticated query, obviously, operational data is constantly changing. You can take a snapshot of the data at some point in time and run a query and get that result and embed that result back into the application. So we're embedding more and more capabilities into our platform to enable developers to build smarter applications. And as I mentioned, with the advent of faster networks, faster chips, better algorithms, the sophistication of use cases are only going to increase. And we feel like, we'll be -- we're really well positioned to take advantage of that. And you'll see a lot of our investments go in that direction.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Tyler. The next question comes from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. Please proceed.\nFred Havemeyer: Hey, thank you. In your prepared remarks, Dev, you were mentioning it was [Indiscernible] here was scaling from just MongoDB community addition on to MongoDB Atlas. And I got me thinking, Dev, would either you or Michael will be able to provide any context on some of the larger Atlas customers are generally MongoDB customers? And how many of them began is just kind of like community addition start-ups and scaled into some of your larger and more material accounts?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, in the early days, all of them came from community. And so \u2013 and what they were attracted by was the notion of really outsourcing all the undifferentiated work of provisioning, configuring and managing a distributed database and essentially focusing on building great apps that transform their business. What we've done over the last few years has really enabled a free tier of users on Atlas. And so they essentially can try and test and play with Atlas. And then we get those customers to migrate into our paid offerings, and we're starting to see increased success with that motion where people start our free tier because they don't even want to \u2013 they just want to work on the cloud. And then very quickly, they start using level of usage and interest ends up getting them to a paid offering. So that's another trend that we're seeing that's emerged. And so obviously, it all starts with the product markets that MongoDB, the document model, the way we just make it so easy to build applications quickly, the way we enable developers to innovate fast. And obviously, Atlas just allows us to \u2013 allows them to essentially focus on what's important and leave all the plumbing to us.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. I would just add that Atlas self-serve, whether it's free tiered or paid, it's sort of the modern more contemporary version of downloading community server and managing it yourself. And as we pointed out before, more than 50% of Atlas ARR was self-serve source, right? So it's just sort of reinforcing that same motion that Dev was describing.\nFred Havemeyer: Okay. Thank you for the context there. And I think I'm one of those free-tier users. Eventually, I'll scale up. Second question I wanted to ask about is \u2013 on thank you. I'll head over to your office and knock on the door and ask for some help, just like back in the old days. I'd also like to ask about cash in the balance sheet and with generating some free cash flow this year, material free cash flow this year. I wanted to ask how, Michael, are you thinking about cash deployment within MongoDB? Generally, are you thinking about \u2013 just really, how are you thinking about cash in your balance sheet? And how would you characterize MongoDB's M&A appetite if you have one?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So in general, I would say that, we've got an appropriate, and very healthy cash balance with $1.8 billion. It gives us the confidence to think long-term Obviously, we're continuing to make operating leverage progress. But as we see needs or opportunities or high-return investments, we're able to make those. I think specifically, from an M&A perspective will be opportunistic. We feel like we've got a lot of organic running room to go, but we'll certainly be opportunistic as needed. Dev, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. I would say that, we obviously stay very closely ground in terms of what's happening in the data infrastructure space. There's a lot of \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of activity in the start-up ecosystem. But as Michael mentioned, we feel like we have a lot of opportunity with our core offerings. We have done some acquisitions in the past. They tend to be smaller, more surgical acquisitions. And if we do end up doing anything, it's probably more in that category than anything meaningful.\nFred Havemeyer: Thanks for the context. And congratulations on a strong quarter.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Fred.\nOperator: Thank you, Fred. The next question comes from Steve Koenig with SMBC. Please proceed.\nSteve Koenig: Hi, gentlemen. Just one question today from me. Last week, it was pretty surprising to see from Snowflake, how performance improvements in their platform negatively impacted effective pricing and the revenue outlook. And I don't think I've ever seen that either working in or covering database companies. And so I'm wondering, without commenting on them, tell me about maybe your model why won't performance improvements negatively impact you guys? And is there a difference between operation and analytic data stores that's relevant here? Thank you very much.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Thanks, Steve, for your question. I would say the big difference is our unit of work is the application of the workload. I would say other companies unit of work is the amount of data they have to ingest. And I think when people think about building new applications, there's obviously some sort of business case, essentially some funding to solve some important business problem or seek some new business opportunity. So they think about that investment very differently than the amount of data that we're constantly collecting. So as you can imagine, it's not surprising to me that some customers, when they see their bills escalate probably frustrated at the rate and pace of how their bills are escalating, whereas as customers are building new applications on our platform for them, that's a new decision on a new use case and for them, it makes sense to obviously invest the appropriate resources and technologies to deliver on that use case. So I think that's the big difference that you're seeing. And we have made performance improvements in our platform, but it doesn't show up in the way, I think, it does for other companies. And I think we feel very, very comfortable about the value proposition we\u2019re our offering to our customers.\nSteve Koenig: Awesome. Great. Thanks Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you, Steve. The next question comes from Mike Cikos with Needham & Co. Please proceed.\nMike Cikos: Hey, guys. Thanks for getting me on for a couple of questions here. I did just want to walk through the guidance real quick for Michael. If I'm thinking about that revenue guidance that you guys provided for the full year of fiscal 2023 and parse out Q1, but is that implied deceleration? Is that just -- should we be thinking about that as just more difficult year-on-year comps? Is that -- or are there any other puts or takes to that? And then the second point, gross margins has really just held up phenomenally given the amount of exposure coming in from Atlas as it becomes a more meaningful driver to total revenue. Should we still expect some gross margin erosion going forward as that Atlas becomes a larger piece because of the associated infrastructure component?\nMichael Gordon: Sure. You think about your gross margin, that's the first question, that was...\nDev Ittycheria: Guidance. Guidance.\nMichael Gordon: Guidance. Yes. Yeah, yeah. So -- thank you. No, I think overall, on the guide, we feel like it's a very strong outlook and we're guiding to significant durable growth at scale. I would say -- two key factors to point out. One is we continue to expect more Atlas over time. And so less 606 impact of EA. Obviously, over a 12-month period, that also comes out in the wash. But given that upfront term license component piece as more of the business shifts from EA to Atlas over time, we expect to have less of that. And then, just the second point would be what you called out, which is the strong Atlas performance, particularly in the back half of the year sets up a very significant compare. And then on the gross margins, yes, we've been super pleased with how we've done on our gross margin game plan. We've executed better than we had thought we could if we thought that was one this size and scale and the 58% of revenue, you'd say we have 74% non-GAAP gross margins or 77% non-GAAP subscription margins, I would have doubted that we'd be able to execute that. I don't think we're prepared to call the bottom, but I do think that we are closing in on one given the strong performance of our optimization program.\nMike Cikos: Thank you very much for that. I hope I didn't mean to sound like the revenue guidance is not strong here. I just wanted to make sure I understood the puts and takes for the full year. And just one more.\nMichael Gordon: I understand.\nMike Cikos: One more, if I could. I think, the last time we received an update as far as incremental OpEx. And I'm thinking about that $45 million to $55 million that we're talking to as commercial activity normalizes, right? For the, I guess, backwards looking here, but for fiscal 2022, I think we might have been expecting, call it, $9 million to $12 million based on the most recent data point we had. I just wanted to see how the year ended up finishing up versus that $9 million to $12 million, I guess, guideposts that we had previously had when thinking through the Q4 upside.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. I think what we've talked about it, we said in the end fiscal 2022 came out broadly in line with our fiscal 2021 spending, and we had expected to spend much more in fiscal 2022 on the sort of I'll call them, COVID-related expenses for lack of a better phrase. And just given the environment and backdrop, we did not see as much activity there.\nMike Cikos: Makes a ton of sense. Thank you very much for getting me on guys. I really do appreciate it.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Mike.\nDev Ittycheria: No problem\nOperator: Thank you, Mike. That concludes the Q&A session. I'll pass the conference back to MongoDB's CEO, Dev Ittycheria, for additional remarks.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Selena. I think it's fair to say that we had an excellent quarter. We're seeing to see strong momentum. We believe that we're solving fundamental problems and addressing fundamental pros that developers have and the value of our platform, offering one unified integrated way to solve and address many use cases that very well played in the marketplace. So -- and that's evidenced in our continued strong customer growth. So with that, I want to thank everyone for joining us today, and we'll talk to you soon. Take care. Bye-bye.\nOperator: That concludes the MongoDB Fourth Quarter FY 2022 Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the fourth quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2023. First, I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $266.5 million, up 56% year-over-year. Subscription revenue, $258.2 million, up 58% year-over-year and professional services revenue was $8.3 million, up 17% year-over-year. It was a very strong quarter across the board, and we exceeded our expectations for both Atlas and Enterprise Advanced. Overall, Atlas' strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew 85% in the quarter compared to the previous year and represents 58% of total revenue compared to 49% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and 58% last quarter. On a sequential basis, this quarter's strong Atlas revenue performance was driven in part by the exceptionally high in-quarter expansion of existing customers that we experienced and previously called out in Q3. Simply put, strong in-quarter expansion benefits, not just the revenue and the completed quarter, but also the revenue in the following quarter because the new quarter starts with a higher beginning run rate. In Q4, we experienced strong in-quarter expansion of existing customers that was in line with historical trends versus the exceptionally high growth rates we experienced in Q3. Enterprise Advanced had a particularly strong quarter. An important driver of the strength of EA is the success we are seeing in our large, high potential accounts. As a reminder, we provide incremental resources to some of our most promising customers in order to accelerate the adoption of MongoDB. A number of these high potential accounts are primarily using EA, and we had a strong new business quarter with them in Q4. During the fourth quarter, we again grew our customer base by over 2,000 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 33,000, which is up from over 24,800 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 4,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 3,000 in the year ago period. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform as well as self-serve customers with whom we've now established a direct sales relationship. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 31,500 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 23,300 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB, in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,307 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 975 in the year ago period. As Dev mentioned, we ended the year with 164 customers with at least $1 million in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 98 in the year ago period. The continued strong growth in our $100,000 and $1 million-plus annualized spend is an indication of the success of our land and expand strategy and the fact that we are increasingly becoming a strategic platform for our customers. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $196.6 million, representing a gross margin of 74%, which is up from last quarter and up from 72% in the year-ago period. Our loss from operations was $1.3 million or a negative 1% operating margin for the fourth quarter compared to a negative 9% margin in the year-ago period. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was primarily driven by our revenue outperformance. Net loss in the fourth quarter was $6.3 million or $0.09 per share based on 67 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $19.9 million or $0.33 per share on 60.5 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the fourth quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. This quarter, we saw strong sequential growth in deferred revenue, driven by the strength of Enterprise Advanced, given EA contracts are predominantly billed annually in advance. As we've discussed in the past, Q4 is the seasonally strongest quarter for our EA installed base. As a reminder, in Q3, we noted that our deferred revenue benefited from several very large Atlas early renewals. We did not see a similar impact in Q4, but would like to reiterate that some of those large deals that were new early in Q3 were originally scheduled to renew in Q1. Operating cash flow in the quarter was positive $22.3 million. After taking into consideration approximately $5.5 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was positive $16.8 million in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $20.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. For the full fiscal year 2022, we had positive operating cash flow of $7 million and negative free cash flow of $6.7 million. While we have had positive operating cash flow quarters before, this is the first full year in our company's history that we generated cash from operations. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2023. Please note that the guidance provided for fiscal year 2023 include certain refinements to our non-GAAP financial measures for expenses related to stock-based compensation to more accurately to take the underlying business results each quarter. For comparative purposes, we've provided a historical reconciliation of these updated measures in our earnings release. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $263 million to $267 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $5 million to $2 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.12 to $0.08 based on 67.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.151 billion to $1.181 billion. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $22 million to $7 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.29 based on 68.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our strong guidance for fiscal 2023 reflects our underlying confidence in our market opportunity and our ability to deliver strong growth at significant scale. Let me provide some incremental context around our guidance. In Q1, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to see a slight sequential revenue decline as Q1 is typically a lower new business quarter for Enterprise Advanced in Q4. As a reminder, EA revenue recognition under ASC 606 is disproportionately affected by the upfront term license component. In addition, as we've discussed in the past, Atlas' sequential growth in Q1 is lower compared to other quarters, driven by seasonal factors impacting consumption, most notably the fact that there are simply fewer calendar days in Q1 than in other quarters. Let me also discuss how we are factoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic into our fiscal year 2023 guidance. First, unlike in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, we do not assume any impact of the pandemic on our revenue performance in fiscal 2023. Despite the ongoing uncertainty related to the pandemic, our performance over the last two years gives us confidence and our ability to execute in this environment. In other words, our guidance reflects that we have more confidence operating in the current environment than in either the last two years. Second, on the expense side. Our guidance anticipates the normalization of travel event and office expenses as COVID-19 restrictions continue to relax. We have previously expected a normalization in the second half of fiscal 2022 but the spread of the Delta and Omicron variants delayed the return-to-office plans and reduced employee travel. As a result, our travel, event and office expenses in fiscal 2022 were only modestly higher than in fiscal 2021 and well below our initial expectation. However, we now expect normalization starting in Q2, and we anticipate an incremental $45 million to $55 million in travel, events and office expenses in fiscal 2023. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent fourth quarter results, we continue acquiring new customers at a strong pace, and our revenue growth is a testament to the breadth of platform adoption and our increasing strategic importance to our customers. We remain convinced that we're in the early innings of pursuing our large market opportunity. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Yeah. So what we're talking about \u2013 and we called this out last year, is that Q1 for Atlas is seasonally lower because of the fewer calendar days in the quarter. It's a consumption-based model. And just obviously, you need days in order to consume and Q1 has fewer of those days. But the overall cohort behaviors as evidenced by the Q4 numbers are very strong, and we feel good about the underlying patterns. No change. Yeah. So thank you. So obviously we try and be thoughtful and transparent in the guidance. That said, we don't have a crystal ball for what's going to happen geopolitically or macroeconomically. I think we feel confident in our ability to execute sort of despite the uncertainty. Specifically on your point about Russia, I would just call out, we have very limited revenue in Russia for fiscal 2022, was roughly a low single-digit millions revenue contributor. We're obviously complying with all those relevant laws and regulations as they emerge. But obviously, if there are future things in the horizon that we can't contemplate we'll certainly update you, but we feel good about the outlook. Thank you. The what -- sorry, that helped us? Yeah. No, No, we've been continuing to show meaningful operating leverage. We feel good about that. We're seeing scaling throughout the business. That said, we certainly are investing to pursue the market opportunity. That means both investments in sales and marketing and in R&D and obviously, sort of everything else to scale the business. But no, we've been really pleased both at the gross margin line with the success, given where Atlas is as a percentage of this and executing against the plan there, as well as on the bottom line. And I think that we'll continue to execute on that, but we feel really good about where we are. Thank you. Yes so \u2013 thanks for that DJ. A couple of things, I would say part of the -- so in general, it's a very strong quarter, Q4 from a cash flow perspective. I would say that's less as a result of the EA sales in and more a result of the strong Q3 inclusive of some of the pull forward that we called out previously. Typically, there is a little less in truck quarter collection from when you book business, obviously, it depends a little bit on the linearity. We haven't given specific guidance around operating cash flow positive, but I certainly do think it's noteworthy not just a strong and significant magnitude more than $20 million in Q4. But the fact that we had $7 million in positive operating cash flow for the full year I do think is noteworthy. It's not a specific milestone that we've focused on or set out, but I do think it's a positive reflection on the underlying trends of the business. Yes. Thanks, Karl. So no, we saw a very strong behavior in Q4. The cohort expansion was in line with historical trends. So nothing sort of abnormal or atypical there. It was a strong quarter in Q4, as we mentioned, in part because the beginning run rate was higher given the exceptionally high expansion in Q3, but Q4 itself behave pretty normally. So I think it doesn't like fit the patterns that you're describing. Hard for me to speculate exactly all the reasons why as it relates to those other businesses, other than the fact that from the database standpoint, that it sort of has an always on component to it, for lack of a better phrase as opposed to something that is a specific... Yes, episodic or a query -- analytics query or batch-query driven basis. Yes. The way I would think about it Karl, is that our guidance philosophy hasn't changed, but I think our perception of the uncertainty or risk of the environment has changed and given how well we've operated over the course of the last two years of the pandemic, it would be hard for us. Despite the uncertainty that still exists, I think we just have a lot of confidence that we can execute in that environment, and that hasn't been the case the last two March's when we've provided that guidance. So, I wouldn't describe it as a change in philosophy or a change in conservatism, but I think it's just sort of reacting to the facts as we have them and less risk and less uncertainty than we've had previously. Thanks. Yes. Thanks, Brett. On the first part of the question, I don't think that there's any material skew sort of one way or other. If you look across the board, I think we'll continue to show progress overall, and that will come from sales and marketing, R&D and then overall, the rest of the organization in G&A. So we're not intentionally trying to skew that in any particular way. As Dave mentioned, we feel like we are still quite thin on the footprint coverage. And so we're trying to expand sales and marketing as rapidly as we responsibly can just to make sure that we're in as many conversations and customer dialogue as possible. And then given the breadth of the product road map and the returns that we've been getting on those investments, we think that it's prudent to invest in those as well. So there's not one particular lever that we're looking to sort of disproportionate incrementally scale. But you'll see scaling in aggregate, as you can see in the results and in the guide. And then, Dev, do you want to talk about the other. Yes, I would just add, Brent, I'm not exactly sure which math you're doing, but if you're looking at sort of Atlas revenue -- average Atlas revenue for average Atlas customer, part of that today's point, will very specifically come from the fact that we're seeing increased adoption of Atlas among direct sales customers, right, which will be at a higher spending level than self-serve customers. And so that's really more of an output rather than an input. Again, we run the business on a channel basis, and that's a little bit of what's happening kind of below the surface of the math that you might be doing. Yeah. I would just add that Atlas self-serve, whether it's free tiered or paid, it's sort of the modern more contemporary version of downloading community server and managing it yourself. And as we pointed out before, more than 50% of Atlas ARR was self-serve source, right? So it's just sort of reinforcing that same motion that Dev was describing. Yeah. So in general, I would say that, we've got an appropriate, and very healthy cash balance with $1.8 billion. It gives us the confidence to think long-term Obviously, we're continuing to make operating leverage progress. But as we see needs or opportunities or high-return investments, we're able to make those. I think specifically, from an M&A perspective will be opportunistic. We feel like we've got a lot of organic running room to go, but we'll certainly be opportunistic as needed. Dev, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that? Sure. You think about your gross margin, that's the first question, that was... Guidance. Yes. Yeah, yeah. So -- thank you. No, I think overall, on the guide, we feel like it's a very strong outlook and we're guiding to significant durable growth at scale. I would say -- two key factors to point out. One is we continue to expect more Atlas over time. And so less 606 impact of EA. Obviously, over a 12-month period, that also comes out in the wash. But given that upfront term license component piece as more of the business shifts from EA to Atlas over time, we expect to have less of that. And then, just the second point would be what you called out, which is the strong Atlas performance, particularly in the back half of the year sets up a very significant compare. And then on the gross margins, yes, we've been super pleased with how we've done on our gross margin game plan. We've executed better than we had thought we could if we thought that was one this size and scale and the 58% of revenue, you'd say we have 74% non-GAAP gross margins or 77% non-GAAP subscription margins, I would have doubted that we'd be able to execute that. I don't think we're prepared to call the bottom, but I do think that we are closing in on one given the strong performance of our optimization program. I understand. Thanks, Mike."

Looking quickly at our fourth quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $266 million, a 56% year-over-year increase and above the high-end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 85% year-over-year, representing 58% of revenue. We had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 33,000 customers. The fourth quarter marked another major milestone as we crossed $1 billion in annualized revenue run rate. Crossing over the $1 billion mark five years after reaching the annualized $100 million mark is clear evidence of the value MongoDB's application data platform offers customers, large and small, all over the world. Our excellent fourth quarter performance was broad-based. We saw success in nearly every industry, geography and customer type. It was powered once again by the ongoing strength of Atlas. We also saw an uptick in sales for Enterprise Advanced, which speaks to the popularity of MongoDB, regardless of where our technology is deployed. Customer net additions remained robust, especially in our direct channel where Q4 marked a new record. It is expected that hundreds of millions of new applications will be developed over the next few years, as most organizations now recognize that a competitive advantage has to be built rather being blocked with off-the-shelf software. The core reason for our success is that in an era where there is an urgency to build compelling modern applications, MongoDB reduces the friction and cost of working with data, which is the biggest challenge developers face. However, the developer experience of working with data has become increasingly complex. The technologies and mechanisms of working with data have continued to get more fragmented as there has been a proliferation of specialized and niche data technologies, each designed to solve a slice of a growing set of necessary data use cases. The hyperscale cloud providers are reinforcing this by taking a bag-of-tools approach by introducing many proprietary point solutions. This approach pushes complexity on to developers, to wrangle these data technologies in their applications and develop workarounds to address scalability and performance. The complexity created by this data sprawl impedes the speed of innovation, adds cost and effectively becomes a direct business risk. MongoDB's application data platform takes a radically different approach to liberate the developer from the unnecessary data complexity to accelerate innovation. First, our platform removes enormous friction in how a developer works with data instead of requiring developers to work with inflexible data models, MongoDB is built on the document model, which is aligned to the way how developers think and code. The docking model not only allows developers to build applications faster but to also easily make changes in response to business conditions or customer feedback. Second, our application data platform enables developers to focus on the needs of the business as opposed to working around the constraints of their data infrastructure. MongoDB abstracts away all that complexity through an architecture that is designed to address the vast majority of use cases. Instead of having to deal with numerous point solutions, customers can use our tightly integrated platform that offers a unified and seamless developer experience. Third, our platform is designed to meet the most demanding requirements for performance and scale. Unlike other solutions that struggle scaling beyond a few nodes in a few regions, MongoDB's application data platform can enable anyone to provision a globally distributed and persistent data platform anywhere in a matter of minutes with just a few clicks of a button by virtue of being available on 80-plus regions across AWS, Azure and GCP. Perhaps the best evidence that our platform is resonating in the marketplace is in the growth of our customer base. We ended the year with over 33,000 customers, of which over 1,300 are fix figure customers and 164 are $1 million plus customers, the latter number growing nearly 70% year-over-year. This level of customer adoption is reflective of our popularity around the world as well as our value as a general purpose rather than a niche technology. To provide a small sampling of how MongoDB is used across different industries. In Financial Services, MongoDB is used for a trading platform, global payment data store, a digital end-to-end loan origination and servicing solution, general ledger system of record, regulatory risk, treasury and for many other back-office processes. In the retail sector, MongoDB is used for single view, real-time product catalogs, hyper-personalization, recommendation engines, AI-driven customer engagement, inventory and supply chain management, including sensor tracking and omni-channel user experiences. In the telecom industry, MongoDB is used to enable smart home services, Internet of Things, media streaming, call routing, endpoint management, real-time fulfillment, AI-based fraud detection and advanced billing and payment services. These are a few examples of how MongoDB is being used. We also do extensive work in the health care, manufacturing, gaming, oil and gas and many other industries. We continue to be excited about the future and the massive opportunities in front of us. Businesses across all industries will continue to invest heavily in software as a means to differentiate themselves to seize new opportunities and to respond to new threats. While this has been happening aggressively over the past decade, we are still only in the early stage of this movement. As infrastructure becomes more advanced, with chips getting more powerful, algorithms getting smarter and networks getting faster, the capability for innovation only increases. Powerful software powered by real-time data will empower experiences and business models we cannot even conceive of today. Future applications will need to be incredibly responsive, increasingly global and requires strong distribution data to the edge or across the world. However, there is still a dearth of development talent to meet this demand. Consequently, organizations will invest in technologies that allow developers to go faster by offering an integrated suite of data capabilities to build smarter applications. In fiscal 2023, we'll continue to build on our momentum and advantages in the marketplace. In product, we'll continue innovating to enhance the value of our platform. Our high win rates and strong broad-based performance gives us confidence to continue to rapidly scale our sales organization as we remain fractionally penetrated in the 70 billion-plus market. In marketing we see a great opportunity to elevate our brand and our value proposition to the voice of our customers who are doing remarkable things to our platform across different industries and geographies. Finally, we'll continue investing in our people, processes and systems to support rapidly scaling our company. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the fourth quarter. Ultrafast grocery delivery pioneer, Getir has revolutionized last mile grocery delivery with its 10-minute grocery delivery proposition, making thousands of everyday items available in minutes. The company has built its core grocery delivery platform on MongoDB community and migrate to Atlas. Getir achieved superior performance and reliability and also relied on Atlas' always-on multi-region clusters for 99.995% uptime during its critical US launch. One of the largest North American banks chose MongoDB as its modern database standard to fuel modernization, improve uptime and power a highly available, always-on secure customer experience for the bank's 10 million of retail customers. The bank runs over 200 applications on MongoDB across digital, capital markets, consumer lending, risk and payment divisions. Use cases span mainframe offload, operational data store, single view of the customer, time series, cashing, real-time analytics, mobile and content management. Societa\u0300 Generale d'Informatica or Sogei, is an information technology company operated by the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance. It recently chose MongoDB as the application data platform for a government initiative that mandate citizens to present a digital or paper certificate to show whether they have been vaccinated, tested negative or recovered from COVIN-19. Called the Greenpass project, the program grants access to activities like restaurant dining, museums, cinemas, amusement parks and more. Sogei was able to generate 150 million certificates in less than 45 days with MongoDB. Content cloud company Box empowers more than 100,000 businesses globally to revolutionize how they work by securely connecting their people, information and applications. Box's content ingestion solutions, Box Shuttle leverages MongoDB Atlas to accelerate a customers' migration to the cloud. Box wanted a FedRAMP-ready multi-cloud managed cloud database to support high throughput and horizontal scale by [sorting] (ph) large data sets. One of the largest supermarket chains in the United States selected Atlas and Atlas Search to power its enterprise promotions engine. The engine gives customers immediate access to promotions and coupons, while shopping at any one of its thousands of stores across the US. With Atlas Search, the company was able to modernize the data structure so that developers can make more updates more quickly and use multidimensional array lookups to run 5 million cruise per day faster. Insulet Corporation is an innovative medical device company dedicated to simplifying life for people with diabetes. Insulet's flagship product, Omnipod, is the first tubeless automated insulin delivery system that is helping people with diabetes lead better lives. Insulet migrated to MongoDB Atlas to reduce costs while simplifying the complexity of mission-critical database management, configuration, upgrades and scale without business interruption while having HIPAA, PII and PCI compliance protection. In summary, we had another excellent quarter. We are seeing continued strong momentum because we're solving one of the most important problems impeding innovation namely the challenges of working with data. We are more optimistic than ever about our prospects and we'll continue investing and executing to capture the large market opportunity ahead of us. With that, here's Michael. Yeah. Thanks, Kash. I would say just \u2013 I'd point to the seven-figure customers. The majority of those customers are on Atlas today. So we have large customers and actually even cutting-edge start-ups or running mission-critical workloads for start-ups is probably the entire business on Atlas for large customers, they're running mission-critical workloads. And so Atlas is not just for small workloads. We're seeing \u2013 and this has happened now for a number of years, we're seeing enterprises increasingly get comfortable with moving mission-critical workloads to the cloud. And one of the benefits of moving to MongoDB is that you get real optionality of not just starting on-prem and moving to the cloud, but going from one cloud provider to another. So we're seeing strong interest -- and I think we have the customer proof points to give people confidence to really move mission-critical workloads to Atlas. Thank you. Hey, Sanjit? Hey Sanjit, we're having trouble hearing your question it's coming across very muffled. Sure. So we've constantly always tried to stay ahead of where the business is in terms of anticipating changes to our go-to-market model. I mean, as you can imagine, in the early days, we had one model, which is, a direct sales force really trying to sell to everyone. Then we introduced an inside sales team. Then we introduced self-serve. Then we've introduced the notion of having focused teams on high-end accounts. We introduced the notion of removing friction from the initial selling process to get customers on our platform more quickly. So we're always refining our go-to-market motion in anticipation of, one, how big this market is, and we try to meet customers where they are versus trying to force them to try to engage with us in one way. And you'll see us continue to do that. We're going to be focused -- increasing on verticalization. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're seeing a lot of traction in key vertical industries. We're developing a deep degree of confidence around those industries. We've been having a team focused on solutions marketing for a number of years to particular industries. And you're going to see us organize our sales teams more overtime with a vertical orientation. You'll also see us going after what we call digital natives, which are kind of fast-growing mid-market customers who are building software and not just buying software. And they will obviously have a lot of value -- see a lot of value from MongoDB. So you can see us continue to push the envelope in terms of innovation. And I would argue that we have the best sales organization in enterprise software. Sure. The basis of our relation with the cloud providers is really, first and foremost, based on the strong product markets of MongoDB. MongoDB is incredibly popular and the popularity spans all major cloud providers. I think what we have shown first with Google as we started working with them very closely, given their ambitions to grow their business quickly is that we could partner effectively and help them acquire a lot of new customers, a lot of new workloads onto their platform. This did not go unnoticed by some of the other cloud providers, and we started going deeper with AWS. As people may remember, in early 2018, AWS introduced a competitor, a clone of MongoDB and there were some worries about how that relationship would evolve. And I'm pleased to say that I feel like the relationship has never been stronger. We have deep relationships in the field. We partner more on deals. And AWS has recognized that MongoDB drives a lot of demand to their platform. And so the relationship there is very healthy. And we're also doing a lot of business with Azure. So I would say our win rates are still very high against them when we go head to head against them. But clearly, they're good partners, and we're investing a lot in those relationships. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Phil. We feel really good about the performance and the productivity of the sales organization. It performance was broad-based. One of the traps in software sales is that you can get -- get some big deals can mask weak performance in the rest of the sales cohort. We're not seeing that. We're seeing broad-based performance across our entire sales teams across all the different theaters. So that's giving us a lot of confidence. We're adding a lot of people quickly. MongoDB is viewed as a very attractive place to come to. We believe that we really help people understand and master the art of sales. And so we've put a lot of time and effort into developing our people. We -- Because we're growing so fast, we give people tremendous opportunities for growth. So people can really grow their careers here at MongoDB and we push the envelope on innovation. So we're doing things that not many other companies are doing. And so all things put together, we feel really good about the sales organization and as a result, it's the reason why we're investing aggressively to expand the capacity of that organization. Thanks, Phil. Yes. In general, the expansion rates of the cohorts are very strong, but I think a lot of it is also due to mix. When we changed our -- the way we want to engage with customers, we saw a big influx of self-serve customers moving to a direct relationship. So obviously, that change in mix affected the revenue per customer number. And as things have kind of as a gone to more of a steady-state function, you're seeing those numbers stabilize. But we feel like we have a really huge embedded growth opportunity in our customer base, and that's where we're spending a lot of time with as well as acquiring new customers. Episodic. Yes. So Brent, on your question on usage trends, whether it's seasonal or there's some other things going on. I would say it's definitely the latter. We are definitely seeing broader adoption of Atlas by customers. We're definitely adding more customers and more workloads to Atlas. And I'd also say the mission criticality of those workloads is increasing from, say, four or five years ago to today where people are now running major elements of their infrastructure, major elements of their business on our platform. And these are not applications that you turn off or slow down. And I think that's why you're seeing the usage strength as we've observed. Yes. Outside of UK and Russia, we see no change. We feel really good about Q1 as for the guidance, and we look at this on a daily and weekly basis, and we're seeing no change. Sure. So the whole notion of serverless is to essentially abstract the way the need to do capacity planning that people can basically connect to our database, start using it and not have to worry about it anymore in the database to just scale up and down based on the needs of the application. And so the early feedback has been incredibly positive. We're seeing a lot of interest. We have a lot of people using it today. We're getting great customer feedback. And you'll see us continue to invest aggressively on serverless. And we look -- we obviously will have our own dedicated offerings as well as serverless. But over time, we think service will become a more meaningful part of the business. But we're super excited by the feedback so far. Yes. So we believe that we have built a very durable business. And a big reason for that is we really focused on acquiring workloads and acquiring customers and acquiring workloads in those customer accounts. And unlike other businesses where you can grow very, very quickly because you just basically manage a lot of data. We -- our unit of measure in terms of account penetration is the number of apps or number of workloads. So they do take time. No one's going to move 100 workloads overnight, but you have a great opportunity because we are so fractionally penetrated in even our existing accounts even though they may be large customers, and they're spending a lot of money with us, there's still thousands of apps that we can win, whether they're new apps or building or existing apps that they want to modernize. And so -- we also put a lot of focus on making sure our customers are successful, really ensuring that the customers get value very, very quickly from our platform, which obviously affects retention rates and churn. And so the degree to which we do that well, that also affects our net expansion rates. And so I think those two factors, along with adding new customers in general to our platform really help keep that high net retention rate. Sure. Yeah. As we mentioned and as I commented on in the prepared remarks, it was obviously a very strong Enterprise Advance quarter. Q4 historically has been the strongest EA renewal base. We clearly demonstrated and observed very strong demand for more EA workloads. Most of the -- just if you step back more generically, most sales of EA are to existing EA customers, right, who are expanding incremental workloads. And in addition as we called out these sorts of focused accounts that we're putting more resources around, a number of them are primarily EA accounts. And we had a lot of success, deepening our penetration with those customers. And given that Q4 is a large renewal base, that's often a good time when that takes place. Certainly, EA will be volatile quarter-to-quarter given 606, but it continues to be very strong. And again, our goal is really just to give the customer's choice and meet them wherever they are in their cloud journey. Oh! So we believe that the trend of applications are getting smarter and they get smarter by embedding more data and more real-time data and more analytics into their into the application is a trend that's going to increase dramatically, which is why we believe we're well setup to take advantage of that trend. One, by definition, we're an operational to platform, but that's where you get the live data. Two, we have a distributed platform, so you can segregate nodes, one for essentially writing the transaction and the other notes for reading data. So this enables you to do that without impacting user performance. Three, we came out with capabilities, where if you want to do a sophisticated query, obviously, operational data is constantly changing. You can take a snapshot of the data at some point in time and run a query and get that result and embed that result back into the application. So we're embedding more and more capabilities into our platform to enable developers to build smarter applications. And as I mentioned, with the advent of faster networks, faster chips, better algorithms, the sophistication of use cases are only going to increase. And we feel like, we'll be -- we're really well positioned to take advantage of that. And you'll see a lot of our investments go in that direction. Well, in the early days, all of them came from community. And so \u2013 and what they were attracted by was the notion of really outsourcing all the undifferentiated work of provisioning, configuring and managing a distributed database and essentially focusing on building great apps that transform their business. What we've done over the last few years has really enabled a free tier of users on Atlas. And so they essentially can try and test and play with Atlas. And then we get those customers to migrate into our paid offerings, and we're starting to see increased success with that motion where people start our free tier because they don't even want to \u2013 they just want to work on the cloud. And then very quickly, they start using level of usage and interest ends up getting them to a paid offering. So that's another trend that we're seeing that's emerged. And so obviously, it all starts with the product markets that MongoDB, the document model, the way we just make it so easy to build applications quickly, the way we enable developers to innovate fast. And obviously, Atlas just allows us to \u2013 allows them to essentially focus on what's important and leave all the plumbing to us. Yeah. I would say that, we obviously stay very closely ground in terms of what's happening in the data infrastructure space. There's a lot of \u2013 there's a lot of activity in the start-up ecosystem. But as Michael mentioned, we feel like we have a lot of opportunity with our core offerings. We have done some acquisitions in the past. They tend to be smaller, more surgical acquisitions. And if we do end up doing anything, it's probably more in that category than anything meaningful. Thanks, Fred. Yes. Thanks, Steve, for your question. I would say the big difference is our unit of work is the application of the workload. I would say other companies unit of work is the amount of data they have to ingest. And I think when people think about building new applications, there's obviously some sort of business case, essentially some funding to solve some important business problem or seek some new business opportunity. So they think about that investment very differently than the amount of data that we're constantly collecting. So as you can imagine, it's not surprising to me that some customers, when they see their bills escalate probably frustrated at the rate and pace of how their bills are escalating, whereas as customers are building new applications on our platform for them, that's a new decision on a new use case and for them, it makes sense to obviously invest the appropriate resources and technologies to deliver on that use case. So I think that's the big difference that you're seeing. And we have made performance improvements in our platform, but it doesn't show up in the way, I think, it does for other companies. And I think we feel very, very comfortable about the value proposition we're our offering to our customers. Thanks, Steve. Guidance. Guidance. Yes. I think what we've talked about it, we said in the end fiscal 2022 came out broadly in line with our fiscal 2021 spending, and we had expected to spend much more in fiscal 2022 on the sort of I'll call them, COVID-related expenses for lack of a better phrase. And just given the environment and backdrop, we did not see as much activity there. No problem Thanks, Selena. I think it's fair to say that we had an excellent quarter. We're seeing to see strong momentum. We believe that we're solving fundamental problems and addressing fundamental pros that developers have and the value of our platform, offering one unified integrated way to solve and address many use cases that very well played in the marketplace. So -- and that's evidenced in our continued strong customer growth. So with that, I want to thank everyone for joining us today, and we'll talk to you soon. Take care. Bye-bye."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. 00:37 I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Denyeau from ICR. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrian Denyeau: 00:45 Thank you, Alley. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review MongoDB\u2019s third quarter fiscal twenty twenty two financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. During the call today are Dev Ittycheria, President and CEO of MongoDB, and Michael Gordon, MongoDB\u2019s COO and CFO. 01:05 During this call, we will make forward-looking statements including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance and our planned investments. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those related to the ongoing COIVD-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, results of operations, clients and the macroeconomic environment, could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. 01:37 For discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them. 01:55 Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 02:09 With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: 02:11 Thank you, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a company update. Looking quickly at our third quarter financial results, we generated revenue of two twenty seven million dollars, a fifty percent year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew eighty four percent year over year, representing fifty eight percent of revenue and is now over zero point five billion revenue run rate. We had another strong quarter of customer growth ending the quarter with over thirty one thousand customers. 02:45 Our third quarter results demonstrate that customers are increasingly choosing MongoDB to build modern apps that run their businesses. We had another strong quarter of customer additions led by a self-service channel. Both our field sales and inside sales teams again performed well. A key driver of results is the healthy expansion of our customers as many of them are meaningfully increasing their adoption of MongoDB. As you'll hear from Michael, some of our largest customers made increased multiyear commitments to MongoDB in Q3. 03:12 Our performance is clear evidence at MongoDB is emerging as an enterprise standard in a growing number of accounts. Our excellent Q3 performance as the result of continuously strong go to market execution as well as a confidence of two factors, secular trends that reinforce our technical advantages and are growing credibility and influence with customers. 03:33 Let me start with the secular trends that play to our strengths. First, the ability to move fast and innovate quickly, whether it's pivoting to a digital first strategy, quickly sees a new market opportunities or responds new threats has never been more important. MongoDB\u2019s Document model maps data to the way developers think in code, removing friction from the development process to enable developers to move incredibly fast. 03:57 Second, while there has been a proliferation of single purpose databases that address specific needs. The result is that most customers find the challenges of learning, managing and supporting Myriad Technologies and resulting Data Silos to be overwhelming. Consequently, there's a growing demand for a modern general purpose database platform that supports a broad range of workloads to dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of company's data infrastructure. MongoDB\u2019s application data platform is designed to address the specific need. 04:26 Third, the performance and scale expectations of modern applications continue to grow. MongoDB distributed architecture supports unlimited horizontal scaling, allowing organizations to linearly scale costs as the applications grow and to easily address data sovereignty regulations or to ensure responsive and predictable performance where the uses are local or across the world. Today, we have customers have workloads doing over one million transactions per second, with data sizes of hundreds of terabytes. Legacy platform struggled to address these demanding, performance and scale requirements. 05:04 Fourth, the accuracy availability and secure of data are paramount importance. MongoDB allows developers to easily build resilient mission critical applications with native replication, fast and automatic failover and retriable operations. MongoDB also for sophisticated security controls for access, auditing and end-to-end encryption whether data is in use or at rest. 05:27 And fifth customers want choice on where and how they deploy their applications. The offers can build and run MongoDB applications are in a data center in any cloud and at the edge. However, technical advantages are not enough unless there are customer proof points to validate these technical claims. As a disruptive of a massive market with a longstanding entrenched technology, we had to build our credibility one workload at a time. We usually land in an account by identifying a pinpoint that simply cannot be addressed by Legacy Technology. We then leverage the success of the first workload to expand across divisional and geographic boundaries. 06:03 Eventually, we up level the conversation to the C-suite and become a standard for future app development. While it's still early days, we believe the key driver of our success this year has been the growing trend of customers choosing MongoDB as an enterprise standard, which is having a positive impact on our ability to increase our penetration of these accounts over time. With more than thirty one thousand customers, which is up ten X since our IPO four years ago. We have all types of customers using MongoDB to do a wide variety of amazing things to run and transform their businesses. 06:35 We have had tremendous success in acquiring customers from large global two thousand organizations to cutting edge startups across all major industries in most geographies. This creates a compelling social proof effect. When we are able to reference customers in particular industries or geographies who are aggressively adopting MongoDB, other customers in those same industries or Geos are more interested in engaging with us. 06:59 While we feel confident about our position in the marketplace, we are not standing still. We recently moved to a quarterly product release schedule starting with MongoDB five point one to bring new features and more quickly to market. How that\u2019s MongoDB five point one include time series enhancements, such as support for shorting, improved capabilities for joints and draft versus to do more sophisticated real time analytics and enhancements to our client side field level encryption security feature to work with any KMIP compliant key management system. In addition, we announced a preview ability to provide hundred X faster facets and counts in that research. 07:36 Faster search allows users to filter and quickly navigate search results by categories. Fast assets and counts are essential in a search first applications such as product catalogs and content search. MongoDB combines the core database and search data base into one unified developer and operational experience, differentiating it\u2019s from all other standalone application search offerings in the market. Last but not least, we also announced Atlas data API which allows developers to easily access the MongoDB data via standard rest like interface. It exposes MongoDB\u2019s rich query and migration capabilities we are fully managed scalable in the Brazilian API, which allows customers to quickly build microservice on Atlas and easily integrate with a wide array of tech stacks. 08:21 We made these product announcements at our (Dock) [ph] Local Developer Conference in London, which is our first in person event since the start of COVID-19. We also just returned from AWS reinvent, where announced the expansion relationship with AWS including the launch of a pay as you go MongoDB Atlas on the AWS marketplace. 08:38 Customers are used to buying services from the AWS marketplace can find a simple and integrated way to subscribe to MongoDB Atlas, starting even with the free trial and use Atlas without the need for not upfront commitment. This makes it even easier to start using Atlas. 08:55 Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the quarter. Coin based, which is dedicated to increasing economic freedom in the world by building more accessible, transparent and equitable financial system is the trusted choice of more than seventy three million individuals, businesses and institutions to interact with the crypto economy. The company is moving more work close to MongoDB Atlas so we can build new products and services quickly and meet the scale and avail the requirements of the unprecedented growth in the cryptocurrency markets. The adoption of Atlas Data lake gives their engineers as simple and powerful way to create resilient data pipelines that enable downstream analytics on the large volumes of data generated by the platform. 09:37 Global technology and communications leader Verizon is working with MongoDB to bring data closer to the edges as part of its multi access edge computing and 5G data architecture. This can enable the next generation of low latency applications such as Machine Learning, Intelligent Edge, Robotics, ARVR, Autonomous Vehicle, Telemedicine and more. 10:00 QHealth is a healthcare technology company that makes it easy for individuals to access health information and places diagnostic information at the center of care. Their revolution on new device, the QHealth monitoring system paired with COVID-19 test is the first at home molecular COVID-19 test available over the counter without a prescription, and it is used by the NBA, Johnson Johnson and Mayo Clinic. The company chose MongoDB Atlas, search and Realm Sync to power their mobile application, mobile database and synchronization enabling consumers to receive data from the QHealth devices on the smartphones and securely stored in the cloud. 10:39 Telecom Italian Mobile or TIM, the communications industry leader in Italy and Brazil, up fixed mobile and cloud infrastructure, data centers service offerings and products for communications and entertainment. The company at the forefront of Digital Technologies, TIM selected MongoDB Atlas for fly together, it's a core digital service delivery platform to accelerate the transition to Google Cloud and enable flexible delivery of digital services through a Microservices Architecture. MongoDB has been a partner and maximize the customer experience across all of his digital channels. 11:11 In summary, we had another excellent quarter, our strong performance as a result of the seeds we planted years ago, such as launching Atlas, releasing multi-document asset transactions and expanding our go-to-market channels to complement our enterprise sales organization. Our continued success for the fuels are aspirations, we not only expect to benefit from the seeds already planted, but we will continue to plan new seeds to drive long-term growth. Customers are embracing the vision of our application to a platform that simplifies their data architecture while accelerating the pace of innovation. We believe the seeds are planting today will yield strong roles, results in the years to come. 11:48 Before I turn it over to Michael, I would officially like to welcome our new CMO, Peter (Ulander) [ph] to MongoDB. A development is core, Peter joined us from AWS, where let developer enterprise marketing. He brings deep experience in the Cloud, Open Source, engaging with developers and has a track record of helping brands from startups to tech leaders to take advantage of major market transitions. With that. Here's Michael.\nMichael Gordon: 12:13 Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the third quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with the detailed review of our third quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year twenty twenty two. First, I'll start with the third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was two hundred and twenty six point nine million dollars up fifty percent year-over-year. Subscription revenue was two hundred seventeen point nine million dollars up fifty one percent year-over-year and professional services revenue was nine million dollars up thirty five percent year-over-year. It was a very strong quarter across the board, and we exceeded our expectations for both Atlas and Enterprise Advanced. 12:53 Overall, Atlas\u2019 strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew eighty four percent in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents fifty eight percent of total revenue compared to forty seven percent in the third quarter of fiscal twenty twenty one and fifty six percent last quarter. In any given quarter, the sequential growth of Atlas has driven primarily by the expansion of the existing applications on our platform. As you can see in our strong Q3 results, that expansion was towards the higher end of the historical range this quarter. 13:24 Enterprise Advanced also exceeded our expectations this quarter driven by stronger than anticipated new business demand. During the third quarter, we again grew our customer base by over two thousand customers sequentially bringing our total customer count to over thirty one thousand which is up from over twenty two thousand six hundred in the year ago period. Of our total customer count over three thousand nine hundred direct sales customers, which compares to over two eight hundred in the year ago period. 13:52 As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform, as well as self-service customers with whom we have now established a direct sales relationship. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which have over twenty nine thousand five hundred customers at the end of the quarter compared to over twenty one thousand one hundred customers in the year ago period. 14:16 It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing Enterprise Advanced customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net air expansion rate above one hundred and twenty percent. We ended the quarter with one thousand two hundred and one customers with at least one hundred thousand dollars in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from eight ninety eight in the year ago period. The continued strong growth in customers with one hundred thousand dollars or more in ARR is an indication of the success of our land and expand go-to-market strategy and the fact that we are increasingly becoming a strategic partner for our customers. 14:55 Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a Non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit the third quarter was one hundred and sixty three point nine million dollars representing a gross margin of seventy two percent, which is consistent with last quarter and consistent with seventy two percent in the year ago period. In the near term, we continue to expect some modest reduction in the overall company gross margin as Atlas continues to grow as a percentage of our revenues. 15:23 Our operating loss was three point five million dollars or a negative two percent operating margin for the third quarter compared to a negative eleven percent margin in the year ago period. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was clearly driven by our revenue outperformance but also by timing of certain expenses. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are experiencing less of a rebound in travel events and workplace expenses that we'd previously assumed. At the beginning of fiscal twenty two, we had shared with you our expectation that these categories would contribute an incremental twenty million dollars to twenty five million dollars in expenses for the year compared to fiscal twenty twenty one with most of it occurring in the second half. 16:06 Given the sustained impact from the pandemic, our revised expectation is that these incremental expenses will only amount to nine million dollars to twelve million dollars for the current year. We see this is a one-time benefit as we do expect our activities to return much more closely to pre-COVID levels in fiscal year twenty three. 16:22 In addition, our marketing spend was lower than expected in Q3 as our new CMO, Peter Ulander, but certain programs on hold while we evaluated their effectiveness. This process is now complete, and we expect our marketing spend to revert to normal levels in Q4. Net loss in the third quarter was seven point two million dollars or zero point one one dollars per share based on sixty six point four million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of eighteen point two million dollars or zero point three one dollars per share on fifty nine point four million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. 16:57 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with one point eight billion dollars in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. I would also like to point your attention to a meaningful sequential increase in our deferred revenue. As Dev mentioned in his remarks, we are increasingly becoming an enterprise standard and strategic partner to our largest customers. And correspondingly, these customers have high confidence and continued growth of MongoDB. In order to optimize the best commercial terms. These companies \u2013 these customers typically make multiyear commitments to MongoDB. 17:32 In Q3 we had a number of our largest Atlas customers renew their Q4 and Q1 contracts early because these are Atlas customers and Atlas revenues recognized upon consumption, the multiyear nature of these Atlas commitments did not affect revenue in the period. However, there was an impact on deferred revenue, given these contracts were billed annually in advance. While early renewals occur regular in our business, the dollar magnitude in Q3 was significantly above what we had experienced in the past. 18:00 Operating cash flow in the third quarter was negative five point eight million dollars after taking into consideration approximately three point four million dollars in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities. Free cash flow was negative nine point two million dollars in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of fourteen point nine million dollars in the third quarter of fiscal twenty twenty one. 18:22 I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal twenty twenty two. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to the range of two thirty nine million dollars to two forty two million dollars. We expect Non-GAAP loss from operations to be thirteen million dollars to eleven million dollars and Non-GAAP net loss per share to the range of zero point two four dollars to zero point two one based on sixty seven million dollars weighted average shares outstanding. 18:46 For the full year of fiscal twenty twenty two, we now expect revenues in the range of eight forty six point three million dollars to eight hundred forty nine point three million dollars. For the full fiscal year twenty twenty two, we expect Non-GAAP loss of operations to be thirty six point four million dollars to thirty four point four million dollars and Non-GAAP net loss per share to be range of zero point seven four dollars to zero point seven one dollars based on sixty four point six million dollars weighted average shares outstanding. 19:10 To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent third quarter results. We're seeing strong customer additions as well as excellent expansion within our existing customers. Customers have increased confidence in our application data platform and our turn increasing their commitments to MongoDB. Our performance gives us increased confidence to continue to investing to capture the large market opportunity ahead of us and we're seeing attractive returns on those investments. 19:32 With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: 19:37 We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: 20:02 Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the \u2013 on a very strong quarter. Great? The results across the board and including Atlas. If I take a step back, Dave and I look at where we are with Atlas in terms of the mix, sort of fifty eight percent of revenue, it\u2019s almost two thirds of your subscription revenue. When we look at the motion around migration, so, enterprise customers have been expanding for Atlas for quite some time. Now are you starting to see more of the outright migrations on Enterprise Advanced Atlas or is that still on the common? And when customers do that, is there a revenue uplift associated with customers who from Enterprise Advanced to Atlas?\nDev Ittycheria: 20:43 Thanks Sanjit. Yes, to your question on migrations, still, it's a very small set of customers who have actually migrated from Enterprise Advanced to Atlas. The bulk of our growth of Atlas is net new workloads. And in terms of a price increase, in general, it tends to be flattish, maybe this is slight price premium, but there's not like some significant price delta. Again, I would say the growth of Atlas is really driven by there's a massive cloud transformation happening in the enterprise and best would be vendors are winning and clearly customers are very comfortable moving mission critical workflows, not only to the cloud, but also to MongoDB, and that's what I think you've seeing here.\nSanjit Singh: 21:29 Makes total sense and in your script, I thought to call out on claim base being a customer was pretty interesting. That obviously tied to the sort of new financial revolution that's going on and we think of massive scale, but also financial transactional integrity. I was wondering like what the sort of specifics set of use cases Atlas was playing with that customers. Is that more around sort of customer interactivity or is that more on kind of on the transactional level?\nDev Ittycheria: 22:02 Yes. I think there's limits to what I can say, but it's definitely the transactional level along with some adjacent applications and what I would tell you is they have some pretty unique requirements when it comes to performance and scale. And now you could imagine in their market, they have a lot of periods where they have some intense trading days and then to scale up capacity very, very quickly, to deal with those surges and trading volume so on and so forth. So they basically realize the only platform out there, they could really address our need was MongoDB.\nSanjit Singh: 22:32 Well, great [Indiscernible] there and very impressive. I'll see the floor. Thank you. Congrats again for the great quarter.\nDev Ittycheria: 22:38 Thanks, Sanjit.\nOperator: 22:44 Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: 22:50 Hey, congrats from me as well. And two quick ones. Dev, what we saw this quarter in terms of what we haven't seen for quite a wireless on the EA side, you talked about new customers starting to kind of come back and doing more deals etcetera. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there in terms to what people are doing on that side? Is that kind of more regulated industries, that can't go to Atlas, yes, there were, it is it like post pandemic investments again and then I had one follow-up for Michael on the deferred side?\nDev Ittycheria: 23:23 Yes, we have a lot of EA customers who are just expanding their usage of MongoDB in the enterprise, some of its driven by cultural reasons where basically they're just comfortable running workloads in their own data center and want to continue to do that. The benefit for them obviously is that when they do decide to move the cloud, they don't have to rewrite one line of code and then clearly, there are some customers who can trained by the industry they operate in and they can't move to the cloud as quickly as they like to, and that's where EA comes in.\nRaimo Lenschow: 23:54 Yeah. Okay. But you do see it's coming back now after the pandemic as well. Okay. And then Michael, on the deferred side like the and obviously like there's no kind of (TMO) [ph] benefit on people renewing earlier like what's driving those kind of big early renewals, did do anything of terms of terms \u2013 opinion in terms of something to encourage did or is that like here financial year, it seems unusual without you kind of pushing for it.\nMichael Gordon: 24:25 Yeah. I think this is an example of really customer demand responding to the customer needs, I think what we've tried to make clear over the last couple of years is that we're trying to make it increasingly easier to adopt and use MongoDB. We've tried to strip away some of the incentives that our sales folks have for people to do things naturally. So it's much more customer centric. And this is really a result of them looking at their own demand profiles internally, aggregating demand and thinking and being confident that they will be able to sort of expand more and therefore looking for sort of best possible commercial terms and started coming to us saying, hey, we'd like to commit even more based on what we see internally.\nRaimo Lenschow: 25:05 Perfect. Congratulations. Really good news.\nRaimo Lenschow: 25:08 Thanks, Raimo.\nOperator: 25:11 Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel.\nBrad Reback: 25:17 Great. Thanks a lot. Dev, you had mentioned the hiring of Peter, CMO and Michael, you talked about some delayed marketing spend as a result. Can you give us a high level sense of what maybe some of the changes, the marketing go to market will be going forward?\nDev Ittycheria: 25:34 Yes, I think what Peter wanted to do and he came from almost like you came out of central casting given his background and open source in the cloud and also knowing how to engage the developers. He really want to do a comprehensive review of all the marketing programs that were underway and what he's done I would say there's a major swings in kind of strategy, but it's basically making some optimizations around doubling down some areas and pulling back to some other areas. So I don't think you'll see any drastic changes. He's also building tighter relationships with the sales organization and so he and Cedric Pech, our CRO are working very closer together and making sure the market team is aligned with the sales efforts around and going up market as well as going down market. So that's essentially what's happening, and we're thrilled to have Peter on the team.\nBrad Reback: 26:26 Great. And Michael, maybe one quick follow-up for you last quarter, you had talked about some specific 2Q to 3Q seasonal trends within Atlas. Anything we should think about as relates to 3Q to 4Q seasonal trends as we head to the end of the year?\nDev Ittycheria: 26:40 Thanks.\nMichael Gordon: 26:42 Yes. I think there are a couple of different ways to think about that. I think within Atlas, as we mentioned, Q1 is seasonal softer and so we were trying to help put in contact some of the strength that we saw in Q2 certainly the results in Q3. We're very strong and compare very favorably when you sort of adjust for that seasonality. I think the only other thing I'd call out that's probably important in terms of Q4 seasonality is two things. One, we had a very strong year ago year in Q4 particularly in Atlas and then on a more macro basis, Q4 tends to be disproportionately Enterprise Advanced, Centric, a lot of the renewal base as it relates to workloads tends to, like I said disproportionately skewed towards Enterprise Advanced in Q4 and so that's take another factor to keep in mind as well.\nBrad Reback: 27:33 That's great. Thanks very much guys.\nDev Ittycheria: 27:36 Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: 27:38 Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin: 27:44 Good afternoon. Thanks for the question here it's incredibly see the return fifty percent fast growth for the first time in two years. On the drivers of the growth here an acceleration, it looks like not only to be a strong Atlas new customer growth, but the Atlas usage in particular was very strong even actually stronger than last quarter. So, walk me through kind of what are you seeing across the broader side of customers, what's driving higher Atlas usage on a per customer basis and one quick follow-up on renewals?\nDev Ittycheria: 28:24 Yeah, sure, Brad. Thank you. A few different things. So I think you have to think about the mix overall and just as a reminder for folks, we don't run the business on a product basis. We run the business on a channel basis. Just so people kind of remember that, but if you think about the overall growth, I think about in terms of new business and then expansions of existing behavior. So it continued to be another strong new business quarter within Atlas workloads, that new business doesn't tend to have as big an impact immediately, whereas under Enterprise Advanced you've got the term license component recognized under six zero six. And then as it relates to expansion, we've seen very consistent like good strong cohort behavior across the expansion. I mentioned in the prepared remarks specifically for Atlas during this quarter that what we saw was sort of higher than sort at the higher end of what we typically see for the cohort behavior and that drive \u2013 that drove some of the Atlas outperformance. You can also tell if you look at our numbers and Brent, I don't know if this is what you're getting at, but you can tell if you look at the numbers where you can calculate from our disclosure, the average revenue per direct sales customer and that is up a little bit year-over-year and up sequentially and I think that's generally pretty impressive given the fact that there's a bit of a tailwind given that, a lot of the customers that we've added overall are in the mid-market who tend to spend below the average level and then also some of those customers that are new to the direct sales channel or self-service customers who we've moved to be in the, we've now established a direct sales relationship with them, they will grow more quickly as a result of that. But that's revenue is not all like net new and obviously those folks started at a lower basis. And so, I think sort of despite some mix headwinds if you want to think about it. Those results have continued to impress us.\nBrent Bracelin: 30:21 Absolutely and I'm just quickly on the renewals, short-term of forty nine million dollars sequentially, you talked about some of that data, early renewals, can you just maybe remind us why someone would be motivated to renew early, would it be strictly tie to some of the [Indiscernible] rebound solve years and I mean more heavy renewals or are there benefits for an Atlas customer, if they're starting to consume more today is there a financial advantage for them to kind of really renewed just to onboard more use cases, just try to understand because there's a little unusual or why customers would be on that to spend more now and it really renew just trying to drill little deeper to that? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: 31:10 Sure. Yeah. And that's part of the reason why we wanted to call it out because it was typical. Obviously, we've said for some time though that deferred revenue and the calculated billing calculation, the number of folks do is not a particularly insightful or instructive measure for our business, and that certainly continues to be the case. But just given the behavior in Q2, we wanted to call that out. These were Atlas customers and therefore, really as we discussed doesn't affect the revenue, the revenue in Atlas is really all consumption. Based and so what this is reflecting is the increasing strategic or mission critical nature of Atlas in those accounts and so those folks are looking at their run rate. They're seeing their run rate increase. And while they may get whatever benefits are of the initial commercial deal that they struck given that they are at meaningfully higher run rates, they want to make sure that they're getting sort of the best commercial terms out of the relationship and as a result, are entering into committed paying advanced contracts for larger amounts to try and make sure they're optimizing their spend levels with us. And so that's why we want to call it up, but again, unlike kind of typical kind of the calculated billings number, my sort of hypothesis or assumption is that part of the reason people like that as they view that as sort of an indicator of future revenue and where the business going. I think given that Atlas is consumption based and these folks that already were at run rates, often that exceeded their commitment, it's not necessarily as helpful in that way that people are traditionally used to seeing it, but nevertheless, I think it's a great sign around the strategic nature of Atlas and their conviction that kind of continue to invest and expand usage of the platform.\nBrent Bracelin: 32:55 It is very clear and helpful with color. Thank you.\nOperator: 33:00 Our next question comes from DJ Hynes with Canaccord.\nDJ Hynes: 33:05 Hey, thanks guys. I go to congrats on awesome set of numbers here. Two questions. I'll start with you, Michael just kind of building off the thread that Brent start last question around expansion. I know you guys don't get granular with disclosure around net revenue retention metrics and north of one one twenty is great. But is it fair to think that you're seeing that metric kick higher? I mean, I think it makes sense given net adds have been strong, but they've been pretty consistent for the last five, six quarters, but growth has been accelerating. Is that one of the drivers?\nMichael Gordon: 33:40 Yes, I would say that the net air expansion rate has been strong at that north of a one hundred and twenty percent level. And I think when we look at the underlying cohort dynamics, they have generally been consistently strong. I think the success has really been a mix. I think it's adding new customers as well as expanding within existing customers and you have to remember a lot of times particularly with Atlas, which is where the bulk of the new customers are coming. There's new customers aren't necessarily coming right away and are spending at their full levels right away and so you get a little bit blurred. It becomes a little bit sort of artificial distinction between what is a new customer land and what is a is what part is the expansion rate? Because when you think about if you're starting off relatively small, and I only look at what are you spending on day one, everything else is expansion. So, yes, of course, you could say that, but you wouldn't have that opportunity to expand if you hadn't added them and so just, I think it's too pronged, I think it's both acquiring new customers continue to lay that foundation for that sort of expansion of the multilayer cake or however you want to think about it and so we've got to keep adding those new customers but then expanding within them. So hopeful for that helps.\nDJ Hynes: 34:52 Yeah, that makes sense. And then Dave, I want to ask you a competitive question that's really not related at all to the quarter, but my sense is that Reddit is talking to public investors a bit more. So maybe could just spend a minute touching on competitive differentiation there. I don't know if that's key value versus document or maybe used cases. Where they make more sense than you and vice versa any comparative contrast, I think would be helpful at this point?\nDev Ittycheria: 35:19 Yes, sure. So, Reddit is predominantly used as a front end cash and so that was a use case that actually lot of people to use MongoDB before in the early days. We have a much broader set of capabilities as a document model. We support so many different types of workloads between key value. We support relational joints, we have time series, graft reversals, etcetera. So we offer broad sort of capabilities. We also support multi-document asset transactions. So to decline base example and we have lots of financial services customers that using us for mission critical workloads, the breadth and capabilities of our platform are far wider and superior. And I think what I talked about little bit in the prepared remarks was that we hear loudly from customers that it just can't continue to use a net new technologies for every net new use case. That the challenges of learning supporting and managing all these different data technologies, having all these different data silos, how do you synchronize that data? How do you secure that data, how do you back up that data? How do you query that data becomes even more challenging? And so, they're gravitating to more of a modern platform where it can run most of those workloads on one platform it really simplifies the operational issues. It really makes a life of developer that much more easy and so that's why we're winning. We don't really compete with Reddit per se. It's very rare that we go into battle Reddit because it's becomes quite easy to differentiate our [Indiscernible] against them. But this is a big market. So there's no doubt that they're probably getting some traction somewhere, but we really feel good about our competitive advantages.\nDJ Hynes: 36:57 Very helpful. Thank you guys.\nOperator: 37:02 Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: 37:08 Hey Dev and team congratulations on a fantastic quarter. Dev, I'm curious to get your perspective as you look at Atlas, if you want to look at it two to four years from now, what kind of scale of applications do you see Atlas supporting? Scope of applications, scale up applications, Atlas supporting that are currently just not today and what are the other technological break-through that you are looking for in the core system to be able to accomplish clearly three or four years from now what MongoDB is capable of achieving. Thank you so much, congrats again.\nDev Ittycheria: 37:45 Yes, thanks, Kash. So what I'd say is one of the advantages MongoDB had from day one is that was built on a distributed system, right? So, by definition, we allow customers to really scale out there, the environment and deal with massive amounts of data and very high performance requirements. And the reason that coming to us is because the existing relational technologies just can't handle today's skill, so to your point as modern applications have even greater requirements to scale the existing set of technologies will be even more handicapped. And so, we've done a lot of sophisticated things around replication for data resiliency, shorting for scale out, doing things like workload isolation, so that when you're running sophisticated analytics, impact user performance, building and materialize views so that you can predefined queries upfront and have those, that data ready versus trying to run the grace when you need it and then impacting CPU usage, all these things we're doing and we're just chipping away and adding more and more capabilities. So it's hard for me to see here and say what we'll be doing five years from now, but we're just pushing the envelope on performance and scale and because we've been built on a distributed architecture, we have a fundamental advantage over all the other technologies out there and that allows us to really serve our customers well. And that's why the most sophisticated and demanding customers like the coin basis of world and others are using MongoDB because no other platform can address their needs.\nKash Rangan: 39:18 Wonderful. Thank you very much. Happy holidays, Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: 39:21 Thanks, Kash.\nOperator: 39:24 Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: 39:31 Oh thank you. I wanted to ask you about the EA business, if we can go back to that twenty percent growth is an acceleration from mid-teens over the last couple of quarters and if it was not the EA business that was the beneficiary of these early renewals, what would you attribute the growth rate acceleration to Michael, I know you mentioned generally new business demand, but maybe you could elaborate. Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: 39:57 Yes, certainly. Thanks, Karl. I think this goes back to some of the things we've said for a while, which is that while clearly, we're seeing a lot of adoption of Atlas, not every customer is ready to be in the cloud and our goal is to give customers choice to meet them wherever they are on their cloud journey. Enterprise Advanced could be a great setup as David alluded to earlier to eventually moving into the cloud when they are ready for it. But I think more broadly, it just sort of speaks to the fact that the MongoDB value proposition resonates with customers and so here we have customers who are not as cloud forward continuing to add and expand to their MongoDB footprint and that drove, the better expected quarter that we saw from sort of that product line.\nKarl Keirstead: 40:48 Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then Michael, just if you don't mind, back on (DR) [ph], does it feel like this early renewal, larger multiyear commitment phenomenon is sort of one offish? Or does it feel like this is the start of a trend and maybe to put it another way, would you encourage us to be somewhat tempered in our DR growth estimates for 4Q and 1Q, if in fact some deals renewals were pulled forward. Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: 41:20 Yes. I think I'm going to say so sort of yes to both even though that might seem somewhat contradictory in the sense of like, yes, I think it's a one off. I think it is a directional trend over time as Atlas becomes more strategic within accounts, but I would at least in the near term certainly think of this as more one off which is part of the reason why we wanted to explicitly call it out, so people didn't sort of get unduly take the numbers and sort of extrapolate, do whatever you all want to do with it.\nKarl Keirstead: 41:48 Yep. Thanks for my question. That's clear. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: 41:55 Our next question comes from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities.\nPatrick Walravens: 42:02 Great. Thank you and let me add my congratulations. So, Dev, I've been listening carefully to some of the broader themes that you've been mentioning as we've been going through massive cloud transformation, the enterprise, the benefit that's distributed an architecture and the reason I've been trying to figure out what it might be MongoDB, Snowflake, Datadog and Confluent, Mike all having in common because you guys are all already at super high growth rates and all accelerated in Q3. So if you have one of few thoughts on that, I would love to hear it.\nDev Ittycheria: 42:43 Well thanks. Thanks for the question. What I would say is a couple of things. One, obviously, we are going through a massive transformation of the enterprise where people are moving workloads to the cloud, they've taken some time to get there, but now they're really moving aggressively to move not just tertiary second tier apps, but mission critical workloads to the cloud, but by that move, they also been very thoughtful about what technology they use and not just taking the standard offerings from any of the cloud vendors, but cloud providers, but really taking a best breed approach and so I think that's what you're seeing as the beneficiaries are there basically choosing the best technologies available in the marketplace? And running the workloads there. And I think we are well positioned and this \u2013 and to your point about themes or trends that I mentioned, their desire to increase the speed of development. Are people just going to want to move faster of course, they are. Are they going to want to buy standalone single purpose databases no, they need to have a general purpose platform? Our performance and scale requirements is going to grow over time, of course, they are. The security availability going to be important, of course, they are. Our both customers one choice, of course, they will. So we feel all those trends are only going to be playing to our strengths and that's why I think you're seeing customers increasingly choosing MongoDB to run their mission critical applications in the cloud.\nPatrick Walravens: 44:08 Great. Thank you.\nOperator: 44:13 And our next question comes from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie.\nFred Havemeyer: 44:20 Thank you. So MongoDB, you recently announced pays you go for Atlas. Last quarter, you announced several described, but across the board that MongoDB, it's really looking like you're trying to align database consumption deployment and utilization and make that much tighter of loop than I think it really has been historically. Also I got to say, I'd like to shut [Indiscernible] on MongoDB and I recall that earlier this year you've also announced UI path had adopted MongoDB, so you certainly have something going on with supporting lowering no code workloads. But that's the kind of question in hands here. How should be thinking about Atlas growth drivers? We say traditional enterprises adopting Atlas for just more agile development cycles versus innovative startups to rapidly growing on your platform and perhaps adopting it because it much more tightly aligns what their need for scaling.\nDev Ittycheria: 45:12 Yeah. So thanks for your question. I just want to make one clarification. The pay as you go that we announced AWS is only new to the marketplace at AWS. We've always had essentially an option where you could sign up via self-serve without any commitment and we also actually offer that option now. Our salespeople can offer that for customers to basically sign up with the zero dollar contract just to get started. So the pay as you go is really just a feature available on the Amazon AWS marketplace, because obviously, they transact a lot there and we just want to make it even easier for customers on marketplace to engage with Atlas. But it's part of the general team, we just, as Michael mentioned, just making more and more easy for customers to use Atlas. In terms of signals that we are looking for, obviously, we really like the fact that large well-known brands I mentioned a couple of them in the prepared remarks are using MongoDB, but I also pay attention to signals of startups who are using MongoDB, because to me, when startups are betting on MongoDB, that's a great sign for future. Because the question I'd ask you is how many starts today using Oracle and I can't think of many and so to me, we spent a lot of time. Now you're looking at the starts using MongoDB, but what are some of the next generation developers? What tech stacks are using? What modern application framework are using? And that's where we feel really good because MongoDB basically at the center of those ecosystems and that's a good sign of help for our future.\nFred Havemeyer: 46:40 Yes. Thank you, Dev. And I think that your ranking is on stock overflow consistently reflected some of that to. So a quick follow-up question for Michael. I think, can we get an update on how many of your over one hundred thousand dollars ARR customers would qualify for that level of spend on Atlas alone. Are you seeing any customers out there that are approaching on Atlas said like north of one million dollars in ARR?\nMichael Gordon: 47:06. Yes, so a couple of things. So, we reported earlier this year that roughly over sixty percent of the one hundred K customers would have qualified just on their Atlas spend alone. There's been no material change to that number. So, I think it continues to be a very strong percentage of Atlas. And so that's not surprising given the increased investment that we're seeing customers make.\nFred Havemeyer: 47:35 Great. Thank you. Congrats on a strong quarter.\nMichael Gordon: 47:37 Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: 47:38 Thank you.\nOperator: 47:40 Our next question comes from Jason Adder with William Blair.\nJason Adder: 47:46 Yeah, thanks. Hey guys. I know you've kind of covered this ground somewhat, but I want to ask it in a slightly different way. This is the biggest beat you've had maybe ever. And I'm just wondering if something changed in the market here in the second half, whether there is the velocity of the enterprise transformation to cloud or is it something more company specific where you just been able to kind of separate yourself from the competition more?\nDev Ittycheria: 48:18 Yes. I think the thanks, Jason. I think a couple of things as we sort of tried to call out in the prepared remarks. I think it was just a really strong quarter across the board. We talked about Atlas and the success in Atlas and the stronger expansion than we typically see which is great and then it was also a really strong Enterprise Advanced quarter as people commented on and some of the questions and the follow ups and so I think there, continue to be sort of multiple legs of the growth we continue to add customers, we continue to find the customers that we're adding are behaving attractively, consistently with their kind of like kind cohorts from beforehand so the changes that we've made in terms of making it easier to adopt MongoDB and easier to get in the platform are working and are having the desired effects and I think it's just sort of the combination of all those things going really well resulting in a really strong quarter that certainly beat our expectations.\nJason Adder: 49:17 So, it's kind of have maybe half macro where things are moving faster to cloud and half just really good execution across your various product areas. Is that a fair way to think about it?\nDev Ittycheria: 49:31 I think it's hard to sort of parse it that way I guess I just look back and say, we're going after an incredibly large market. We are being increasingly effective at capitalizing on that market opportunity. You see that sort of showing up in the numbers. Dev talked about in the prepared remarks sort of the social proof impact and other things like that. And so I just think all that really added up to an exceptionally strong quarter.\nJason Adder: 50:00 Thanks guys.\nDev Ittycheria: 50:03 Thank you.\nOperator: 50:06 Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron: 50:11 Thanks. Great numbers. Dev, my question is to you on the competitive front. I saw at [Indiscernible] event last week, it was in Vegas, and I couldn't be more surprised by the number of serverless announcements that AWS made with regards to pretty much every database platform that they have. At the same time, they've also been pushing the DocumentDB and the highlighting its compatibility to you, I think version for at this point and also the mantra of their whole event was the right tool for the right job. So, it seems like they're taking a little bit of a different approach to you and clearly they're being extremely successful. So I guess my question is two-fold, number one, what you make up all serverless announcements and what we did to make your life or bit more difficult to you and that they significantly simplify adoption of any platform, but then second, your platform comment, could just read that the market overall for everybody is very strong that the market is in a necessarily shifting to the platform. It's just, all both, getting lifted right here right now?\nDev Ittycheria: 51:20 Yeah. Well, I'll make one eta, it\u2019s good to see you at reinvent, it was good to actually have a face to face conference. So a couple things. One, I would say is on the serverless parts, we announced serverless over the summer and we've been working on it for a while. DocumentDB still does not have a serverless offering just to be clear and the reason we announced serverless was that we wanted to make it even easier use MongoDB, people will not have to do a front capacity planning and pick a particular instance size that the database would just scale elastically as their demands grow. 51:58 The second thing I would say that that is very different in terms of our strategy versus AWS strategies. We don't believe that customers want to use fifteen or eighteen different databases. I don't know if any customer and the team and I and our sales organization. We spent a lot of time off with customers. No customer said I want to use that many different databases. Because the challenge is very simple, the challenges of learning, managing, supporting all those different technologies, having data sitting in all those different silos, knowing how to create that data, backup that data, synchronized that data is an operational nightmare. And so that's why we believe our approach of offering a general purpose platform to \u2013 for our customers consolidated workloads is really resonating with our customers and obviously seen in our numbers. And I would say Amazon obviously has a big brand. There's have a lot of reach and they can get it's a big market. So clearly, they're doing well, but we feel, we've been partnering and competing with them and many others in the marketplace and we're holding our own effect we're doing extremely well, and we feel really good about our competitive position.\nIttai Kidron: 53:13 Very good. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: 53:15 Thank you.\nOperator: 53:18 Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhil Winslow: 53:23 Hey guys congrats on our good quarter and thanks for taking my question. We just wanted to focus on-the-go-to-market channels. Obviously, been highlighting especially having in direct. So question there is are things trending in terms of new hiring there? How do you feel back capacity and sort of plans for next year, but also want things so you highlighted it was the self-service channel, some of the new non-direct channels they are seeing success, wondering if you buy just more detail on those two? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: 53:49 Yes, sure. So, yes, as you talked about in many of the quarterly calls that we're trying to grow our sales capacity as fast as operation possible. Q3 was another great quarter for hiring, and it's basically, we're running the same playbook, we're going to increasingly segment in the market. As you know, we have field sales organization, we have inside field sales organization, but we're now finding that business is like mid-market segment comprised of really digital natives we're building their own applications and being very sophisticated in the user technology, maybe have also raised a lot of capital that's a big target market for us. We're probably on the margins going to, started looking at some vertical areas of where there's some commonality of use cases where we can leverage our common learnings across, I\u2019d say like financial services, manufacturing, retail, healthcare, etcetera. And so and that's all things in terms of just refining and optimizing our go-to-market. And so and on the self-serve side, again, it's really helping drive our business, the combined self-serve inside sales, filed sales organization and our partner organization is creating a really virtuous slightly look effect. Just to be clear, even today, over half of the revenue in Atlas was sourced from self-serve. So the self-serve channel is a great way to acquire customers and our sales organization then uses the customers require and grows them even faster. So the virtuous cycle is working really well.\nPhil Winslow: 55:25 Awesome. Thanks guys and congrats again on awesome quarter.\nDev Ittycheria: 55:28 Thanks, Phil.\nOperator: 55:32 Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: 55:37 Hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you just how are you seeing these large cloud platform partners help you get into these larger deals, I know you talked about that a bit in the script, but I'm curious if you're seeing those also help to accelerate the migration away from kind of non prem relational incumbent as well. Just talk to how does large cloud platform partnerships kind of an evolved from a relationship perspective? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: 56:07 Yes, Sure Tyler and again, it was good to see who said reading then last week. What I would say is that the cloud partners have kind of realized that when the workload and Atlas workloads moving on the cloud, there is beneficiary of multiples of that revenue that's spend with us on their platform between the consumption of the underlying storage and compute as well as all the other ancillary services that customer may use and so it's truly, it sounds like a clean shave is truly a win win relationship. So, we've seen our partners and obviously last week, got some great relationships with senior level people at AWS because the relationship is really working and we're seeing a lot of \u2013 we're doing lot of business together and we're becoming a very, very meaningful partner for them. And so And I think it's, we've obviously been working with them closely now ever since the launch of Atlas over the last five years. We've learned a lot lesson and is an important not only to have product integrations, it was also important to have the sales organizations aligned to work well with each other and that took a little bit of time to work through these are naturally with some competitive offerings and salespeople are not the most trusting types when they had to work with someone who may have a competitive offering but when you incentivize them to work well together and becomes clear that we have the far superior solution, the cloud rep from the particular providers more than happy to work with us because they're going to get so much of the business that comes to them and that's essentially what's happening. We're doing now deeper integrations and as we talked about, we announced the pay as you go, announcement for AWS marketplace. So we're just making easier for customers to business with us and the cloud provider together, which is good news for everyone.\nTyler Radke: 57:48 Great. And then just on hiring, you mentioned it was a strong quarter. Do you anticipate that you're going to grow your direct sales force faster next year than they needed this year?\nDev Ittycheria: 58:01 Yes. I don't think we're prepared to go into what we'll do next, just say that'll be the March quarter, but I would tell you this in generally, we've been trying to grow our sales capacity, as fast as operationally possible now, we do have a high bar. So, we're not just going to hire salespeople in Italy. And we also want to make sure that we have the leadership capacity in place to develop and get \u2013 we got the sales reps to execute in the consistent way quarter in and quarter out. So we put a lot of thought in terms of how we think about capacity planning where we have people. Do we have the right leadership in place etcetera, etcetera, and but we're trying to move as fast as possible?\nTyler Radke: 58:44 Thanks. Good to see you in last week.\nDev Ittycheria: 58:46 Thanks, Tyler.\nOperator: 58:50 Our last question today comes from Jack Andrews with Needham.\nJack Andrews: 58:55 Good afternoon. Thanks for fitting names in the call. I just wanted to ask if there's a quick update you can provide on the time series and just how we should be thinking about that patch opportunity within Atlas and how that may drive, that maybe the rate and pace of consumption?\nDev Ittycheria: 59:12 Yes. I think what we're seeing is that the time series is a use case is growing quite rapidly and I think what is driven by is that you have the small and expensive IoT sensors and fast and reliable wireless networks that just made it so much easy for, so much easier for organizations to generate the collect times through his data. So, for example, Walmart will have seven million unit data points and stores, electric cars now over one thousand sensors in the cars. So those sensors could be across the board, temperature sensors, smart watches, smart meters and blood glucose monitors, etcetera, etcetera. And so that's a big big opportunity that we see, and MongoDB is well designed to service those workloads we can ingest data very quickly and we can scale as the volume data grows and so that's something that we're very focused on. We've made some enhancements to now support time [Indiscernible] before just on replica sets now on Charter clusters and you'll see us going after that opportunity quite aggressively. And again, the benefit of the customers again they have one platform where they can run time series workloads that can run key value or close, they can run transaction intensive workloads, etcetera, all one platform with one developer experience and so this makes their life so much more easy.\nJack Andrews: 60:39 Thank you And congratulations.\nDev Ittycheria: 60:42 Thank you.\nOperator: 60:45 This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Dev Ittycheria for any closing comments.\nDev Ittycheria: 60:52 Well, thank you for joining us today. As you know, we had an excellent quarter and I think just to reiterate our strong performance is really due to again our consistent go-to-market execution as well as the confluence of the fact that the secular trends are really reinforcing our technical advantages and are growing incredibly with customers. And our Q3 results really give us increased confidence to continue investing and planting seeds for future growth. With that, I would like to wish everyone, very happy and healthy and safe holiday season and we look forward to talk to you soon. Take care.\nOperator: 61:25 The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "12:13 Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the third quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with the detailed review of our third quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year twenty twenty two. First, I'll start with the third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was two hundred and twenty six point nine million dollars up fifty percent year-over-year. Subscription revenue was two hundred seventeen point nine million dollars up fifty one percent year-over-year and professional services revenue was nine million dollars up thirty five percent year-over-year. It was a very strong quarter across the board, and we exceeded our expectations for both Atlas and Enterprise Advanced. 12:53 Overall, Atlas' strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew eighty four percent in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents fifty eight percent of total revenue compared to forty seven percent in the third quarter of fiscal twenty twenty one and fifty six percent last quarter. In any given quarter, the sequential growth of Atlas has driven primarily by the expansion of the existing applications on our platform. As you can see in our strong Q3 results, that expansion was towards the higher end of the historical range this quarter. 13:24 Enterprise Advanced also exceeded our expectations this quarter driven by stronger than anticipated new business demand. During the third quarter, we again grew our customer base by over two thousand customers sequentially bringing our total customer count to over thirty one thousand which is up from over twenty two thousand six hundred in the year ago period. Of our total customer count over three thousand nine hundred direct sales customers, which compares to over two eight hundred in the year ago period. 13:52 As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform, as well as self-service customers with whom we have now established a direct sales relationship. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which have over twenty nine thousand five hundred customers at the end of the quarter compared to over twenty one thousand one hundred customers in the year ago period. 14:16 It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing Enterprise Advanced customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net air expansion rate above one hundred and twenty percent. We ended the quarter with one thousand two hundred and one customers with at least one hundred thousand dollars in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from eight ninety eight in the year ago period. The continued strong growth in customers with one hundred thousand dollars or more in ARR is an indication of the success of our land and expand go-to-market strategy and the fact that we are increasingly becoming a strategic partner for our customers. 14:55 Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a Non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit the third quarter was one hundred and sixty three point nine million dollars representing a gross margin of seventy two percent, which is consistent with last quarter and consistent with seventy two percent in the year ago period. In the near term, we continue to expect some modest reduction in the overall company gross margin as Atlas continues to grow as a percentage of our revenues. 15:23 Our operating loss was three point five million dollars or a negative two percent operating margin for the third quarter compared to a negative eleven percent margin in the year ago period. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was clearly driven by our revenue outperformance but also by timing of certain expenses. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are experiencing less of a rebound in travel events and workplace expenses that we'd previously assumed. At the beginning of fiscal twenty two, we had shared with you our expectation that these categories would contribute an incremental twenty million dollars to twenty five million dollars in expenses for the year compared to fiscal twenty twenty one with most of it occurring in the second half. 16:06 Given the sustained impact from the pandemic, our revised expectation is that these incremental expenses will only amount to nine million dollars to twelve million dollars for the current year. We see this is a one-time benefit as we do expect our activities to return much more closely to pre-COVID levels in fiscal year twenty three. 16:22 In addition, our marketing spend was lower than expected in Q3 as our new CMO, Peter Ulander, but certain programs on hold while we evaluated their effectiveness. This process is now complete, and we expect our marketing spend to revert to normal levels in Q4. Net loss in the third quarter was seven point two million dollars or zero point one one dollars per share based on sixty six point four million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of eighteen point two million dollars or zero point three one dollars per share on fifty nine point four million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. 16:57 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with one point eight billion dollars in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. I would also like to point your attention to a meaningful sequential increase in our deferred revenue. As Dev mentioned in his remarks, we are increasingly becoming an enterprise standard and strategic partner to our largest customers. And correspondingly, these customers have high confidence and continued growth of MongoDB. In order to optimize the best commercial terms. These companies \u2013 these customers typically make multiyear commitments to MongoDB. 17:32 In Q3 we had a number of our largest Atlas customers renew their Q4 and Q1 contracts early because these are Atlas customers and Atlas revenues recognized upon consumption, the multiyear nature of these Atlas commitments did not affect revenue in the period. However, there was an impact on deferred revenue, given these contracts were billed annually in advance. While early renewals occur regular in our business, the dollar magnitude in Q3 was significantly above what we had experienced in the past. 18:00 Operating cash flow in the third quarter was negative five point eight million dollars after taking into consideration approximately three point four million dollars in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities. Free cash flow was negative nine point two million dollars in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of fourteen point nine million dollars in the third quarter of fiscal twenty twenty one. 18:22 I would now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal twenty twenty two. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to the range of two thirty nine million dollars to two forty two million dollars. We expect Non-GAAP loss from operations to be thirteen million dollars to eleven million dollars and Non-GAAP net loss per share to the range of zero point two four dollars to zero point two one based on sixty seven million dollars weighted average shares outstanding. 18:46 For the full year of fiscal twenty twenty two, we now expect revenues in the range of eight forty six point three million dollars to eight hundred forty nine point three million dollars. For the full fiscal year twenty twenty two, we expect Non-GAAP loss of operations to be thirty six point four million dollars to thirty four point four million dollars and Non-GAAP net loss per share to be range of zero point seven four dollars to zero point seven one dollars based on sixty four point six million dollars weighted average shares outstanding. 19:10 To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent third quarter results. We're seeing strong customer additions as well as excellent expansion within our existing customers. Customers have increased confidence in our application data platform and our turn increasing their commitments to MongoDB. Our performance gives us increased confidence to continue to investing to capture the large market opportunity ahead of us and we're seeing attractive returns on those investments. 19:32 With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? 24:25 Yeah. I think this is an example of really customer demand responding to the customer needs, I think what we've tried to make clear over the last couple of years is that we're trying to make it increasingly easier to adopt and use MongoDB. We've tried to strip away some of the incentives that our sales folks have for people to do things naturally. So it's much more customer centric. And this is really a result of them looking at their own demand profiles internally, aggregating demand and thinking and being confident that they will be able to sort of expand more and therefore looking for sort of best possible commercial terms and started coming to us saying, hey, we'd like to commit even more based on what we see internally. 26:42 Yes. I think there are a couple of different ways to think about that. I think within Atlas, as we mentioned, Q1 is seasonal softer and so we were trying to help put in contact some of the strength that we saw in Q2 certainly the results in Q3. We're very strong and compare very favorably when you sort of adjust for that seasonality. I think the only other thing I'd call out that's probably important in terms of Q4 seasonality is two things. One, we had a very strong year ago year in Q4 particularly in Atlas and then on a more macro basis, Q4 tends to be disproportionately Enterprise Advanced, Centric, a lot of the renewal base as it relates to workloads tends to, like I said disproportionately skewed towards Enterprise Advanced in Q4 and so that's take another factor to keep in mind as well. 33:40 Yes, I would say that the net air expansion rate has been strong at that north of a one hundred and twenty percent level. And I think when we look at the underlying cohort dynamics, they have generally been consistently strong. I think the success has really been a mix. I think it's adding new customers as well as expanding within existing customers and you have to remember a lot of times particularly with Atlas, which is where the bulk of the new customers are coming. There's new customers aren't necessarily coming right away and are spending at their full levels right away and so you get a little bit blurred. It becomes a little bit sort of artificial distinction between what is a new customer land and what is a is what part is the expansion rate? Because when you think about if you're starting off relatively small, and I only look at what are you spending on day one, everything else is expansion. So, yes, of course, you could say that, but you wouldn't have that opportunity to expand if you hadn't added them and so just, I think it's too pronged, I think it's both acquiring new customers continue to lay that foundation for that sort of expansion of the multilayer cake or however you want to think about it and so we've got to keep adding those new customers but then expanding within them. So hopeful for that helps. 39:57 Yes, certainly. Thanks, Karl. I think this goes back to some of the things we've said for a while, which is that while clearly, we're seeing a lot of adoption of Atlas, not every customer is ready to be in the cloud and our goal is to give customers choice to meet them wherever they are on their cloud journey. Enterprise Advanced could be a great setup as David alluded to earlier to eventually moving into the cloud when they are ready for it. But I think more broadly, it just sort of speaks to the fact that the MongoDB value proposition resonates with customers and so here we have customers who are not as cloud forward continuing to add and expand to their MongoDB footprint and that drove, the better expected quarter that we saw from sort of that product line. 41:20 Yes. I think I'm going to say so sort of yes to both even though that might seem somewhat contradictory in the sense of like, yes, I think it's a one off. I think it is a directional trend over time as Atlas becomes more strategic within accounts, but I would at least in the near term certainly think of this as more one off which is part of the reason why we wanted to explicitly call it out, so people didn't sort of get unduly take the numbers and sort of extrapolate, do whatever you all want to do with it. 47:06. Yes, so a couple of things. So, we reported earlier this year that roughly over sixty percent of the one hundred K customers would have qualified just on their Atlas spend alone. There's been no material change to that number. So, I think it continues to be a very strong percentage of Atlas. And so that's not surprising given the increased investment that we're seeing customers make. 47:37 Thanks."

            "name": "Dev Ittycheria",
            "content": "02:11 Thank you, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a company update. Looking quickly at our third quarter financial results, we generated revenue of two twenty seven million dollars, a fifty percent year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew eighty four percent year over year, representing fifty eight percent of revenue and is now over zero point five billion revenue run rate. We had another strong quarter of customer growth ending the quarter with over thirty one thousand customers. 02:45 Our third quarter results demonstrate that customers are increasingly choosing MongoDB to build modern apps that run their businesses. We had another strong quarter of customer additions led by a self-service channel. Both our field sales and inside sales teams again performed well. A key driver of results is the healthy expansion of our customers as many of them are meaningfully increasing their adoption of MongoDB. As you'll hear from Michael, some of our largest customers made increased multiyear commitments to MongoDB in Q3. 03:12 Our performance is clear evidence at MongoDB is emerging as an enterprise standard in a growing number of accounts. Our excellent Q3 performance as the result of continuously strong go to market execution as well as a confidence of two factors, secular trends that reinforce our technical advantages and are growing credibility and influence with customers. 03:33 Let me start with the secular trends that play to our strengths. First, the ability to move fast and innovate quickly, whether it's pivoting to a digital first strategy, quickly sees a new market opportunities or responds new threats has never been more important. MongoDB's Document model maps data to the way developers think in code, removing friction from the development process to enable developers to move incredibly fast. 03:57 Second, while there has been a proliferation of single purpose databases that address specific needs. The result is that most customers find the challenges of learning, managing and supporting Myriad Technologies and resulting Data Silos to be overwhelming. Consequently, there's a growing demand for a modern general purpose database platform that supports a broad range of workloads to dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of company's data infrastructure. MongoDB's application data platform is designed to address the specific need. 04:26 Third, the performance and scale expectations of modern applications continue to grow. MongoDB distributed architecture supports unlimited horizontal scaling, allowing organizations to linearly scale costs as the applications grow and to easily address data sovereignty regulations or to ensure responsive and predictable performance where the uses are local or across the world. Today, we have customers have workloads doing over one million transactions per second, with data sizes of hundreds of terabytes. Legacy platform struggled to address these demanding, performance and scale requirements. 05:04 Fourth, the accuracy availability and secure of data are paramount importance. MongoDB allows developers to easily build resilient mission critical applications with native replication, fast and automatic failover and retriable operations. MongoDB also for sophisticated security controls for access, auditing and end-to-end encryption whether data is in use or at rest. 05:27 And fifth customers want choice on where and how they deploy their applications. The offers can build and run MongoDB applications are in a data center in any cloud and at the edge. However, technical advantages are not enough unless there are customer proof points to validate these technical claims. As a disruptive of a massive market with a longstanding entrenched technology, we had to build our credibility one workload at a time. We usually land in an account by identifying a pinpoint that simply cannot be addressed by Legacy Technology. We then leverage the success of the first workload to expand across divisional and geographic boundaries. 06:03 Eventually, we up level the conversation to the C-suite and become a standard for future app development. While it's still early days, we believe the key driver of our success this year has been the growing trend of customers choosing MongoDB as an enterprise standard, which is having a positive impact on our ability to increase our penetration of these accounts over time. With more than thirty one thousand customers, which is up ten X since our IPO four years ago. We have all types of customers using MongoDB to do a wide variety of amazing things to run and transform their businesses. 06:35 We have had tremendous success in acquiring customers from large global two thousand organizations to cutting edge startups across all major industries in most geographies. This creates a compelling social proof effect. When we are able to reference customers in particular industries or geographies who are aggressively adopting MongoDB, other customers in those same industries or Geos are more interested in engaging with us. 06:59 While we feel confident about our position in the marketplace, we are not standing still. We recently moved to a quarterly product release schedule starting with MongoDB five point one to bring new features and more quickly to market. How that's MongoDB five point one include time series enhancements, such as support for shorting, improved capabilities for joints and draft versus to do more sophisticated real time analytics and enhancements to our client side field level encryption security feature to work with any KMIP compliant key management system. In addition, we announced a preview ability to provide hundred X faster facets and counts in that research. 07:36 Faster search allows users to filter and quickly navigate search results by categories. Fast assets and counts are essential in a search first applications such as product catalogs and content search. MongoDB combines the core database and search data base into one unified developer and operational experience, differentiating it's from all other standalone application search offerings in the market. Last but not least, we also announced Atlas data API which allows developers to easily access the MongoDB data via standard rest like interface. It exposes MongoDB's rich query and migration capabilities we are fully managed scalable in the Brazilian API, which allows customers to quickly build microservice on Atlas and easily integrate with a wide array of tech stacks. 08:21 We made these product announcements at our (Dock) [ph] Local Developer Conference in London, which is our first in person event since the start of COVID-19. We also just returned from AWS reinvent, where announced the expansion relationship with AWS including the launch of a pay as you go MongoDB Atlas on the AWS marketplace. 08:38 Customers are used to buying services from the AWS marketplace can find a simple and integrated way to subscribe to MongoDB Atlas, starting even with the free trial and use Atlas without the need for not upfront commitment. This makes it even easier to start using Atlas. 08:55 Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the quarter. Coin based, which is dedicated to increasing economic freedom in the world by building more accessible, transparent and equitable financial system is the trusted choice of more than seventy three million individuals, businesses and institutions to interact with the crypto economy. The company is moving more work close to MongoDB Atlas so we can build new products and services quickly and meet the scale and avail the requirements of the unprecedented growth in the cryptocurrency markets. The adoption of Atlas Data lake gives their engineers as simple and powerful way to create resilient data pipelines that enable downstream analytics on the large volumes of data generated by the platform. 09:37 Global technology and communications leader Verizon is working with MongoDB to bring data closer to the edges as part of its multi access edge computing and 5G data architecture. This can enable the next generation of low latency applications such as Machine Learning, Intelligent Edge, Robotics, ARVR, Autonomous Vehicle, Telemedicine and more. 10:00 QHealth is a healthcare technology company that makes it easy for individuals to access health information and places diagnostic information at the center of care. Their revolution on new device, the QHealth monitoring system paired with COVID-19 test is the first at home molecular COVID-19 test available over the counter without a prescription, and it is used by the NBA, Johnson Johnson and Mayo Clinic. The company chose MongoDB Atlas, search and Realm Sync to power their mobile application, mobile database and synchronization enabling consumers to receive data from the QHealth devices on the smartphones and securely stored in the cloud. 10:39 Telecom Italian Mobile or TIM, the communications industry leader in Italy and Brazil, up fixed mobile and cloud infrastructure, data centers service offerings and products for communications and entertainment. The company at the forefront of Digital Technologies, TIM selected MongoDB Atlas for fly together, it's a core digital service delivery platform to accelerate the transition to Google Cloud and enable flexible delivery of digital services through a Microservices Architecture. MongoDB has been a partner and maximize the customer experience across all of his digital channels. 11:11 In summary, we had another excellent quarter, our strong performance as a result of the seeds we planted years ago, such as launching Atlas, releasing multi-document asset transactions and expanding our go-to-market channels to complement our enterprise sales organization. Our continued success for the fuels are aspirations, we not only expect to benefit from the seeds already planted, but we will continue to plan new seeds to drive long-term growth. Customers are embracing the vision of our application to a platform that simplifies their data architecture while accelerating the pace of innovation. We believe the seeds are planting today will yield strong roles, results in the years to come. 11:48 Before I turn it over to Michael, I would officially like to welcome our new CMO, Peter (Ulander) [ph] to MongoDB. A development is core, Peter joined us from AWS, where let developer enterprise marketing. He brings deep experience in the Cloud, Open Source, engaging with developers and has a track record of helping brands from startups to tech leaders to take advantage of major market transitions. With that. Here's Michael. 20:43 Thanks Sanjit. Yes, to your question on migrations, still, it's a very small set of customers who have actually migrated from Enterprise Advanced to Atlas. The bulk of our growth of Atlas is net new workloads. And in terms of a price increase, in general, it tends to be flattish, maybe this is slight price premium, but there's not like some significant price delta. Again, I would say the growth of Atlas is really driven by there's a massive cloud transformation happening in the enterprise and best would be vendors are winning and clearly customers are very comfortable moving mission critical workflows, not only to the cloud, but also to MongoDB, and that's what I think you've seeing here. 22:02 Yes. I think there's limits to what I can say, but it's definitely the transactional level along with some adjacent applications and what I would tell you is they have some pretty unique requirements when it comes to performance and scale. And now you could imagine in their market, they have a lot of periods where they have some intense trading days and then to scale up capacity very, very quickly, to deal with those surges and trading volume so on and so forth. So they basically realize the only platform out there, they could really address our need was MongoDB. 22:38 Thanks, Sanjit. 23:23 Yes, we have a lot of EA customers who are just expanding their usage of MongoDB in the enterprise, some of its driven by cultural reasons where basically they're just comfortable running workloads in their own data center and want to continue to do that. The benefit for them obviously is that when they do decide to move the cloud, they don't have to rewrite one line of code and then clearly, there are some customers who can trained by the industry they operate in and they can't move to the cloud as quickly as they like to, and that's where EA comes in. 25:34 Yes, I think what Peter wanted to do and he came from almost like you came out of central casting given his background and open source in the cloud and also knowing how to engage the developers. He really want to do a comprehensive review of all the marketing programs that were underway and what he's done I would say there's a major swings in kind of strategy, but it's basically making some optimizations around doubling down some areas and pulling back to some other areas. So I don't think you'll see any drastic changes. He's also building tighter relationships with the sales organization and so he and Cedric Pech, our CRO are working very closer together and making sure the market team is aligned with the sales efforts around and going up market as well as going down market. So that's essentially what's happening, and we're thrilled to have Peter on the team. 26:40 Thanks. 27:36 Thanks, Brad. 28:24 Yeah, sure, Brad. Thank you. A few different things. So I think you have to think about the mix overall and just as a reminder for folks, we don't run the business on a product basis. We run the business on a channel basis. Just so people kind of remember that, but if you think about the overall growth, I think about in terms of new business and then expansions of existing behavior. So it continued to be another strong new business quarter within Atlas workloads, that new business doesn't tend to have as big an impact immediately, whereas under Enterprise Advanced you've got the term license component recognized under six zero six. And then as it relates to expansion, we've seen very consistent like good strong cohort behavior across the expansion. I mentioned in the prepared remarks specifically for Atlas during this quarter that what we saw was sort of higher than sort at the higher end of what we typically see for the cohort behavior and that drive \u2013 that drove some of the Atlas outperformance. You can also tell if you look at our numbers and Brent, I don't know if this is what you're getting at, but you can tell if you look at the numbers where you can calculate from our disclosure, the average revenue per direct sales customer and that is up a little bit year-over-year and up sequentially and I think that's generally pretty impressive given the fact that there's a bit of a tailwind given that, a lot of the customers that we've added overall are in the mid-market who tend to spend below the average level and then also some of those customers that are new to the direct sales channel or self-service customers who we've moved to be in the, we've now established a direct sales relationship with them, they will grow more quickly as a result of that. But that's revenue is not all like net new and obviously those folks started at a lower basis. And so, I think sort of despite some mix headwinds if you want to think about it. Those results have continued to impress us. 31:10 Sure. Yeah. And that's part of the reason why we wanted to call it out because it was typical. Obviously, we've said for some time though that deferred revenue and the calculated billing calculation, the number of folks do is not a particularly insightful or instructive measure for our business, and that certainly continues to be the case. But just given the behavior in Q2, we wanted to call that out. These were Atlas customers and therefore, really as we discussed doesn't affect the revenue, the revenue in Atlas is really all consumption. Based and so what this is reflecting is the increasing strategic or mission critical nature of Atlas in those accounts and so those folks are looking at their run rate. They're seeing their run rate increase. And while they may get whatever benefits are of the initial commercial deal that they struck given that they are at meaningfully higher run rates, they want to make sure that they're getting sort of the best commercial terms out of the relationship and as a result, are entering into committed paying advanced contracts for larger amounts to try and make sure they're optimizing their spend levels with us. And so that's why we want to call it up, but again, unlike kind of typical kind of the calculated billings number, my sort of hypothesis or assumption is that part of the reason people like that as they view that as sort of an indicator of future revenue and where the business going. I think given that Atlas is consumption based and these folks that already were at run rates, often that exceeded their commitment, it's not necessarily as helpful in that way that people are traditionally used to seeing it, but nevertheless, I think it's a great sign around the strategic nature of Atlas and their conviction that kind of continue to invest and expand usage of the platform. 35:19 Yes, sure. So, Reddit is predominantly used as a front end cash and so that was a use case that actually lot of people to use MongoDB before in the early days. We have a much broader set of capabilities as a document model. We support so many different types of workloads between key value. We support relational joints, we have time series, graft reversals, etcetera. So we offer broad sort of capabilities. We also support multi-document asset transactions. So to decline base example and we have lots of financial services customers that using us for mission critical workloads, the breadth and capabilities of our platform are far wider and superior. And I think what I talked about little bit in the prepared remarks was that we hear loudly from customers that it just can't continue to use a net new technologies for every net new use case. That the challenges of learning supporting and managing all these different data technologies, having all these different data silos, how do you synchronize that data? How do you secure that data, how do you back up that data? How do you query that data becomes even more challenging? And so, they're gravitating to more of a modern platform where it can run most of those workloads on one platform it really simplifies the operational issues. It really makes a life of developer that much more easy and so that's why we're winning. We don't really compete with Reddit per se. It's very rare that we go into battle Reddit because it's becomes quite easy to differentiate our [Indiscernible] against them. But this is a big market. So there's no doubt that they're probably getting some traction somewhere, but we really feel good about our competitive advantages. 37:45 Yes, thanks, Kash. So what I'd say is one of the advantages MongoDB had from day one is that was built on a distributed system, right? So, by definition, we allow customers to really scale out there, the environment and deal with massive amounts of data and very high performance requirements. And the reason that coming to us is because the existing relational technologies just can't handle today's skill, so to your point as modern applications have even greater requirements to scale the existing set of technologies will be even more handicapped. And so, we've done a lot of sophisticated things around replication for data resiliency, shorting for scale out, doing things like workload isolation, so that when you're running sophisticated analytics, impact user performance, building and materialize views so that you can predefined queries upfront and have those, that data ready versus trying to run the grace when you need it and then impacting CPU usage, all these things we're doing and we're just chipping away and adding more and more capabilities. So it's hard for me to see here and say what we'll be doing five years from now, but we're just pushing the envelope on performance and scale and because we've been built on a distributed architecture, we have a fundamental advantage over all the other technologies out there and that allows us to really serve our customers well. And that's why the most sophisticated and demanding customers like the coin basis of world and others are using MongoDB because no other platform can address their needs. 39:21 Thanks, Kash. 42:43 Well thanks. Thanks for the question. What I would say is a couple of things. One, obviously, we are going through a massive transformation of the enterprise where people are moving workloads to the cloud, they've taken some time to get there, but now they're really moving aggressively to move not just tertiary second tier apps, but mission critical workloads to the cloud, but by that move, they also been very thoughtful about what technology they use and not just taking the standard offerings from any of the cloud vendors, but cloud providers, but really taking a best breed approach and so I think that's what you're seeing as the beneficiaries are there basically choosing the best technologies available in the marketplace? And running the workloads there. And I think we are well positioned and this \u2013 and to your point about themes or trends that I mentioned, their desire to increase the speed of development. Are people just going to want to move faster of course, they are. Are they going to want to buy standalone single purpose databases no, they need to have a general purpose platform? Our performance and scale requirements is going to grow over time, of course, they are. The security availability going to be important, of course, they are. Our both customers one choice, of course, they will. So we feel all those trends are only going to be playing to our strengths and that's why I think you're seeing customers increasingly choosing MongoDB to run their mission critical applications in the cloud. 45:12 Yeah. So thanks for your question. I just want to make one clarification. The pay as you go that we announced AWS is only new to the marketplace at AWS. We've always had essentially an option where you could sign up via self-serve without any commitment and we also actually offer that option now. Our salespeople can offer that for customers to basically sign up with the zero dollar contract just to get started. So the pay as you go is really just a feature available on the Amazon AWS marketplace, because obviously, they transact a lot there and we just want to make it even easier for customers on marketplace to engage with Atlas. But it's part of the general team, we just, as Michael mentioned, just making more and more easy for customers to use Atlas. In terms of signals that we are looking for, obviously, we really like the fact that large well-known brands I mentioned a couple of them in the prepared remarks are using MongoDB, but I also pay attention to signals of startups who are using MongoDB, because to me, when startups are betting on MongoDB, that's a great sign for future. Because the question I'd ask you is how many starts today using Oracle and I can't think of many and so to me, we spent a lot of time. Now you're looking at the starts using MongoDB, but what are some of the next generation developers? What tech stacks are using? What modern application framework are using? And that's where we feel really good because MongoDB basically at the center of those ecosystems and that's a good sign of help for our future. 47:38 Thank you. 48:18 Yes. I think the thanks, Jason. I think a couple of things as we sort of tried to call out in the prepared remarks. I think it was just a really strong quarter across the board. We talked about Atlas and the success in Atlas and the stronger expansion than we typically see which is great and then it was also a really strong Enterprise Advanced quarter as people commented on and some of the questions and the follow ups and so I think there, continue to be sort of multiple legs of the growth we continue to add customers, we continue to find the customers that we're adding are behaving attractively, consistently with their kind of like kind cohorts from beforehand so the changes that we've made in terms of making it easier to adopt MongoDB and easier to get in the platform are working and are having the desired effects and I think it's just sort of the combination of all those things going really well resulting in a really strong quarter that certainly beat our expectations. 49:31 I think it's hard to sort of parse it that way I guess I just look back and say, we're going after an incredibly large market. We are being increasingly effective at capitalizing on that market opportunity. You see that sort of showing up in the numbers. Dev talked about in the prepared remarks sort of the social proof impact and other things like that. And so I just think all that really added up to an exceptionally strong quarter. 50:03 Thank you. 51:20 Yeah. Well, I'll make one eta, it's good to see you at reinvent, it was good to actually have a face to face conference. So a couple things. One, I would say is on the serverless parts, we announced serverless over the summer and we've been working on it for a while. DocumentDB still does not have a serverless offering just to be clear and the reason we announced serverless was that we wanted to make it even easier use MongoDB, people will not have to do a front capacity planning and pick a particular instance size that the database would just scale elastically as their demands grow. 51:58 The second thing I would say that that is very different in terms of our strategy versus AWS strategies. We don't believe that customers want to use fifteen or eighteen different databases. I don't know if any customer and the team and I and our sales organization. We spent a lot of time off with customers. No customer said I want to use that many different databases. Because the challenge is very simple, the challenges of learning, managing, supporting all those different technologies, having data sitting in all those different silos, knowing how to create that data, backup that data, synchronized that data is an operational nightmare. And so that's why we believe our approach of offering a general purpose platform to \u2013 for our customers consolidated workloads is really resonating with our customers and obviously seen in our numbers. And I would say Amazon obviously has a big brand. There's have a lot of reach and they can get it's a big market. So clearly, they're doing well, but we feel, we've been partnering and competing with them and many others in the marketplace and we're holding our own effect we're doing extremely well, and we feel really good about our competitive position. 53:15 Thank you. 53:49 Yes, sure. So, yes, as you talked about in many of the quarterly calls that we're trying to grow our sales capacity as fast as operation possible. Q3 was another great quarter for hiring, and it's basically, we're running the same playbook, we're going to increasingly segment in the market. As you know, we have field sales organization, we have inside field sales organization, but we're now finding that business is like mid-market segment comprised of really digital natives we're building their own applications and being very sophisticated in the user technology, maybe have also raised a lot of capital that's a big target market for us. We're probably on the margins going to, started looking at some vertical areas of where there's some commonality of use cases where we can leverage our common learnings across, I'd say like financial services, manufacturing, retail, healthcare, etcetera. And so and that's all things in terms of just refining and optimizing our go-to-market. And so and on the self-serve side, again, it's really helping drive our business, the combined self-serve inside sales, filed sales organization and our partner organization is creating a really virtuous slightly look effect. Just to be clear, even today, over half of the revenue in Atlas was sourced from self-serve. So the self-serve channel is a great way to acquire customers and our sales organization then uses the customers require and grows them even faster. So the virtuous cycle is working really well. 55:28 Thanks, Phil. 56:07 Yes, Sure Tyler and again, it was good to see who said reading then last week. What I would say is that the cloud partners have kind of realized that when the workload and Atlas workloads moving on the cloud, there is beneficiary of multiples of that revenue that's spend with us on their platform between the consumption of the underlying storage and compute as well as all the other ancillary services that customer may use and so it's truly, it sounds like a clean shave is truly a win win relationship. So, we've seen our partners and obviously last week, got some great relationships with senior level people at AWS because the relationship is really working and we're seeing a lot of \u2013 we're doing lot of business together and we're becoming a very, very meaningful partner for them. And so And I think it's, we've obviously been working with them closely now ever since the launch of Atlas over the last five years. We've learned a lot lesson and is an important not only to have product integrations, it was also important to have the sales organizations aligned to work well with each other and that took a little bit of time to work through these are naturally with some competitive offerings and salespeople are not the most trusting types when they had to work with someone who may have a competitive offering but when you incentivize them to work well together and becomes clear that we have the far superior solution, the cloud rep from the particular providers more than happy to work with us because they're going to get so much of the business that comes to them and that's essentially what's happening. We're doing now deeper integrations and as we talked about, we announced the pay as you go, announcement for AWS marketplace. So we're just making easier for customers to business with us and the cloud provider together, which is good news for everyone. 58:01 Yes. I don't think we're prepared to go into what we'll do next, just say that'll be the March quarter, but I would tell you this in generally, we've been trying to grow our sales capacity, as fast as operationally possible now, we do have a high bar. So, we're not just going to hire salespeople in Italy. And we also want to make sure that we have the leadership capacity in place to develop and get \u2013 we got the sales reps to execute in the consistent way quarter in and quarter out. So we put a lot of thought in terms of how we think about capacity planning where we have people. Do we have the right leadership in place etcetera, etcetera, and but we're trying to move as fast as possible? 58:46 Thanks, Tyler. 59:12 Yes. I think what we're seeing is that the time series is a use case is growing quite rapidly and I think what is driven by is that you have the small and expensive IoT sensors and fast and reliable wireless networks that just made it so much easy for, so much easier for organizations to generate the collect times through his data. So, for example, Walmart will have seven million unit data points and stores, electric cars now over one thousand sensors in the cars. So those sensors could be across the board, temperature sensors, smart watches, smart meters and blood glucose monitors, etcetera, etcetera. And so that's a big big opportunity that we see, and MongoDB is well designed to service those workloads we can ingest data very quickly and we can scale as the volume data grows and so that's something that we're very focused on. We've made some enhancements to now support time [Indiscernible] before just on replica sets now on Charter clusters and you'll see us going after that opportunity quite aggressively. And again, the benefit of the customers again they have one platform where they can run time series workloads that can run key value or close, they can run transaction intensive workloads, etcetera, all one platform with one developer experience and so this makes their life so much more easy. 60:42 Thank you. 60:52 Well, thank you for joining us today. As you know, we had an excellent quarter and I think just to reiterate our strong performance is really due to again our consistent go-to-market execution as well as the confluence of the fact that the secular trends are really reinforcing our technical advantages and are growing incredibly with customers. And our Q3 results really give us increased confidence to continue investing and planting seeds for future growth. With that, I would like to wish everyone, very happy and healthy and safe holiday season and we look forward to talk to you soon. Take care."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Denyeau from ICR. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrian Denyeau: Great. Thank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to review MongoDB\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2022 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me on the call today are Dev Ittycheria, President and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB\u2019s COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance and our planned investments. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those related to the ongoing COIVD-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, results of operations, clients and the macroeconomic environment, could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our SEC filings, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on our -- on the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our second quarter results before giving you a company update. Before diving in, I want to share that today marks my seventh anniversary at MongoDB. I\u2019m incredibly proud of how much progress we\u2019ve made over the past seven years. We went from being a small private company with an interesting technology to disrupting one of the largest markets in all of software. Along the way, we changed how open source software is licensed, we introduced a new cloud service that required us to both partner and compete with the largest cloud providers, and we grew revenues 20-fold with a compound annual growth rate of over 50%. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to all the amazing people in MongoDB and to our customers and partners around the world who made this happen. As proud as I am of the amazing journey we\u2019ve had, I\u2019m even more optimistic today about our opportunities ahead. Looking quickly at our second quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $199 million, a 44% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 44% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew 83% year-over-year and now represents 56% of our revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth ending the quarter with over 29,000 customers. Businesses across nearly every industry have realized that in today\u2019s highly dynamic global markets, speed of development is a meaningful competitive advantage. Businesses that can develop software faster are able to improve their products faster, and ultimately, grow more quickly than their competition. We believe our strong second quarter results are a clear indication that customers view MongoDB as a critical platform to accelerate their digital innovation agenda. Customers of all types are using MongoDB because they can develop so much faster using our platform to build new applications and re-platform legacy applications across a broad range of use cases to drive their business forward. Fundamentally MongoDB\u2019s application data platform offers three intrinsic advantages. First, MongoDB\u2019s document model is designed around how developers think and code, unlike legacy data technologies. This enables developers to be far more productive and build applications faster, as compared to any other technology. Second, MongoDB\u2019s document model is a superset of other data models, tabular, key value, time series, graph and other kinds of data relationships can be easily created using documents. The document model enables MongoDB to address a wide range of use cases and reduces the need for customers to use niche technologies that only serve a single purpose. Third, MongoDB is designed for performance and scale. With MongoDB sophisticated capabilities to replicate, manage and distribute data at massive scale, organizations increasingly choose MongoDB to address the most demanding requirements. Legacy technologies are fundamentally not designed for today\u2019s scale and performance expectations, requiring developers to spend an enormous amount of time working around their architectural limitations. The continued success of Atlas shows that speed is of paramount importance to our customers. Atlas is the best way for customers to enjoy the benefits of our platform, as the time to value can literally be only a matter of minutes. Atlas had another excellent quarter, accelerating to 83% year-over-year growth, while approaching a $0.5 billion run rate. We also had another strong quarter of Atlas customer additions from self-serve to enterprise customers. Our second quarter results give us even more conviction to continue investing in both our product portfolio and our go-to-market initiatives. Starting with go-to-market, our field sales team is increasingly being pulled into higher level strategic conversations at the C-suite of the largest companies in the world and we are adjusting our approach to more effectively serve that audience. Last year we expanded with increasing our focus on our most promising customers. Our hypothesis was that by going deep into an account with more resources, it will position us more strategically and allow us to penetrate the account more quickly. Those investments produce excellent returns and most accounts that ran this experiment grew faster than we expected. This is giving us confidence to expand this deeper coverage model to more accounts this year, while also focusing on expanding our field sales capacity in all regions. Our inside sales team is firing on all cylinders and had another great quarter. The strong product market fit of Atlas for this channel, along with the changes we introduced last year to make it easier for customers to start using Atlas, have had a positive impact. Given the results, we are focused on expanding our inside sales capacity in our regional hubs around the world to capture more of the large opportunity we see in this channel. Finally, turning to self-serve, this channel is a cost effective way to acquire large numbers of customers and is a critical lead generation vehicle for our sales organization. We are focused on increasing our sophistication on digital acquisition and product-led growth techniques to increase the top of funnel and optimize mid-funnel conversion rates. This is an iterative process with a lot of experimentation that is yielding promising results. Turning to our product roadmap, we continue to invest both to extend our lead and the core database space, as well as to mature and grow our merchant products. At MongoDB.live, our User Conference held in July, we made significant -- several significant product announcements that further advance our vision. We focused on two themes ease-of-use and expanding the capabilities of our platform to make it more compelling for customers to standardize on MongoDB. First, on ease-of-use, making it easy for developers to use and get value out of MongoDB has been the core of our DNA since the founding of the company. Our announcement of Atlas Serverless takes ease-of-use and developer productivity to the next level. With Serverless, customers can get started with MongoDB without having to pick a specific machine type or size. The application connects to Atlas and we handle the elastic scaling of compute and storage seamlessly, whether an application scales quickly or as spiky traffic patterns. This dramatically simplifies life for our customers, because they no longer have to do capacity planning or manually intervene to adjust the size of the deployment. We expect Serverless to drive more customer demand, because getting started on and using Atlas just became even easier. Next, for customers who want to benefit from our sharding features to manage a massive amount of data, we introduced Live Resharding. As a reminder, sharding is a method for horizontally distributing data across multiple machines. MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very large amounts of data and high throughput operations to prevent any single machine from becoming a bottleneck. Previously, when a customer wanted to shard data, the customer had to pick a shard key, essentially the parameter that would be used to partition the data. However, we know an application\u2019s requirements can change quickly, make it more beneficial to partition data using a different shard key. Live Resharding allows users to easily change the shard key when this happens. This feature, which is not available in any other platform, will make it far easier for customers to start using our sharding capabilities and seamlessly redistribute data when the requirements of their application or their business change. Finally, our announcement in Versioned API addresses a structural issue with all databases. Historically, when a new database version is introduced, there are feature changes that can break existing application functionality and create significant rework for development teams. Invariably, some organizations prefer to stay on an older version of a database to avoid this risk. But the downside is that they then cannot take advantage of new features available in the latest version. Our introduction of Versioned API solves this problem. The Versioned API feature lets you upgrade your MongoDB server at will. This groundbreaking capability allows customers to decouple the application development lifecycle from the database lifecycle, so they only need to update their application when they want to introduce new functionality, not when they upgrade the database. Of all the features we announced in MongoDB.Live, Versioned API got perhaps the most enthusiastic customer reception. Regarding the second theme, we remain focused on expanding the capabilities of our platform. Because customers consistently tell us that they want a modern general purpose platform that precludes the need for single purpose technologies in order to reduce back end infrastructure complexity and increase the speed of innovation. We introduce native time series support across our entire platform. Time series collections, clustered indexing and windows functions make it easier, faster and lower cost to build and run application like IoT. While we were able to address this fast growing use case in the past, with these new features, we can compete for even the most demanding time series workloads. We also add a depth of functionality across our merchant products, perhaps most notably an Atlas Search. We\u2019re enhancing search with custom synonyms and function scoring, which allow e-commerce customers to provide more relevant and geographically targeted results. We believe these features will make Atlas Search an excellent solution for even more use cases. Finally, we also recently announced that we achieve FedRAMP Ready status. This designation allows to capture the substantial demand for MongoDB Atlas across federal and state government agencies and ISVs that serve that market. Our recently announced product enhancements enable customers to use MongoDB for an even broader set of use cases and represent a meaningful step forward on our journey to deliver the preeminent modern application data platform. Now I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the second quarter. JetBlue is New York\u2019s hometown airline with 1 -- with over 100 destinations across the U.S., Caribbean, Latin America and between New York and London. To overhaul their core e-commerce app, JetBlue chose the MongoDB application data platform. MongoDB flexible data model allows JetBlue to build dynamic customer experiences when their ticketing application, as well as predictive analytics in real time. DataRobot is a leader in augmented intelligence, delivering a trusted AI platform that empowers organizations to make better data driven business decisions faster and at scale. MongoDB has powered the company\u2019s SaaS platform from its inception and this quarter DataRobot migrate from MongoDB Community Edition to Enterprise Advanced for compliance encryption features and support. Our enhanced relationship will help DataRobot continue to innovate and support its global customer base, as users who are using AI to transform their businesses. Roma Capitale is the governing body for the City of Rome and manages services across transport, welfare and education for over 4 million citizens. In a bid to drive a new smart city approach, Roma chose MongoDB as part of the underlying data platform to modernize its entire content management system and drive a new comprehensive single-view environment for development. As a result, Roma jumped from 15th place to fourth in the latest Italian Smart City ranking and was able to bring new online digital opportunities to its citizens. PT Visionet Internasional or OVO, a leading Indonesian payments, rewards and financial services platform relies on MongoDB to power its core digital payments platform that serves over 115 million devices. As part of a strategic initiative to market all of its database workloads spread across multiple databases and hosting platforms, OVO chose MongoDB Atlas enterprise to consolidate its tech stack and move to Google Cloud. OVO expect the modernization will increase developer productivity, accelerate new feature release cycles and consolidate workloads making the over infrastructure feature ready. In summary, we had another excellent quarter. Our customers want to innovate faster and are looking for a scalable general purpose application data platform that will give their developers the freedom to move quickly. MongoDB is increasingly seen as uniquely positioned to fulfill this need. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, both financially and operationally. I\u2019ll begin with a detailed review of our second quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2022. First, I\u2019ll start with our second quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $198.7 million, up 44% year-over-year, subscription revenue was $191.4 million, up 44% year-over-year, and professional services revenue was $7.4 million, up 27% year-over-year. We exceeded our expectations in both Atlas and Enterprise Advanced but our outperformance was particularly notable in Enterprise Advanced. As you know, EA has a more immediate impact on revenue due to the fact that under ASC 606 we\u2019re required to recognize the term license component of revenue upfront. Overall, Atlas\u2019 strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew 83% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 56% of total revenue, compared to 44% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 and 51% last quarter. During the second quarter, we grew our customer base by over 2,200 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 29,000, which is up from over 20,200 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count over 3,600 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 2,500 in the year ago period. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform, as well as self-service customers with whom we now have a direct sales relationship  The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 27,500 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 18,800 in the year ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,126 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 819 in the year ago period. The continued strong growth in customers, with $100,000 or more in ARR is an indication of the success of our land and expand go-to-market strategy and the fact that we\u2019re increasingly becoming a strategic partner and a database standard for our customers. Moving down the income statement, I\u2019ll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the second quarter was $142.9 million, representing a gross margin of 72%, which is consistent with last quarter and consistent with 72% in the year ago period. Overall, we are pleased with our gross margin performance, which is only seeing a modest impact from Atlas as it becomes a bigger portion of our revenue despite its infrastructure component. We continue to expect that we\u2019ll see a modest reduction in overall company gross margin as Atlas continues to grow as a percentage of our revenues. Our operating loss was $11.5 million or a negative 6% operating margin for the second quarter compared to a negative 7% margin in a year ago period. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was driven primarily by revenue outperformance. Net loss in the second quarter was $15.2 million or $0.24 per share based on 63.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $12.7 million or $0.22 per share on 58.4 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, after raising almost $900 million and a follow on equity offerings during the quarter, we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was negative $19.8 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $22.7 million in the quarter. This comparison negative free cash flow $15 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. I\u2019d now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2022. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $202 million to $204 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $25 million to $23 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.42 cents to $0.39 based on 66.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2022, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $805 million to $811 million. For the full fiscal year 2022, we now expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $67 million to $62 million and non-gap net loss per share to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.13 based on 64.6 million weighted average shares outstanding. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent second quarter results. We\u2019re driving high levels of growth at scale, driven by our large market opportunity and strong execution. We continue investing to capture the large opportunity ahead of us. We\u2019re seeing attractive returns on those investments and we\u2019re excited about our positioning for the future. With that, we\u2019d like to open up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the question and congrats on another really impressive quarter. Dev, maybe I wanted to understand the Atlas growth, I think on a sequential dollar basis, you almost doubled the amount of revenue that you added in Q1. If we could sort of unpack that along with a couple of different buckets, sort of existing customers, sort of expanding with Atlas versus migrating either Enterprise Advanced or another database versus contribution from net new, particularly, customers, you may have thought of the quarter, but also maybe the customers that you have added last year, was that you saw a big uptick, we could sort of unpack the sources of growth of that was and that would be helpful?\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. So, first of all, what I\u2019d say is that, customer additions remain robust across all three channels. So we\u2019re seeing strengthen in all geographies, including places like India and Latin America. And we frankly also see strong Enterprise adoption of Atlas. Atlas is increasingly seen as a destination for mission-critical applications. And as we said last quarter, over 600 customers spend north of $100,000 on Atlas alone. And self-serve remains a critical channel and a customer acquisition vehicle. So, over 50% of our Atlas ARR was from customers originally sourced in the self-serve channel. I\u2019d also say that multi-cloud is a huge selling point for Atlas, multi-cloud improves resilience. And as you know, cloud providers do have outages and they can leverage the best features of each cloud provider and avoid lock-in. In terms of like breakdown of where these customers are coming from, I think, I would just say, we\u2019re seeing healthy growth of both new customers, as well as expansion of existing customers. And yes, the customers we\u2019ve acquired over the last few quarters are growing, expansion rates for Atlas are very strong and so all of them are essentially contributing to the growth of Atlas.\nMichael Gordon: I would just add maybe, Sanjit, from perspective, the two thoughts. One, on the year-over-year piece, obviously, Q2 was an easier Atlas compare, given the COVID impact that we experienced last year that was that sort of broad based, but modest impact that we saw, resulting in slower expansion from accounts. And then sequentially to your point, there is some seasonality and Q2 tends to be meaningfully stronger than Q1 and so you sort of -- you see that showing up in the numbers as well.\nSanjit Singh: That\u2019s good context, Michael. And then as my follow-up, Dev, MongoDB 5.0 versus 4.0. Anyway sort of you could sort of frame out how significant this release? I mean, 4.0 was a major release, right? There was a lot of key enterprise features, multi-document ACID support, sort of a game-changing at least in my view. How should we think about 5.0 versus the 4.0 cycle?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, it\u2019s a question I actually haven\u2019t thought of. But as you said, 4.0 was assembled at least for us because it\u2019s introduced a big feature with multi-document ACID transactions, which at the time was the biggest objection for enterprises or anyone using, wanting to use MongoDB for mission-critical use case. That objection was obviously taken off the table. What I would say with 5.0 is we\u2019re just continue to double down on it, one, expanding our platform, obviously, with all the additions that we\u2019re making, especially with native time series support and we\u2019re also making it far easier for customers to use MongoDB. As you can imagine, with over 29,000 customers, we have customers of all shapes and sizes, of all levels of sophistication. And we really want, frankly, and that -- this is in our DNA, we really want the database to get other way of people getting their work done. And so we just want to make it really easy for people to use MongoDB and obviously Atlas is the best way to expose a lot of the features. And so I would just contrast, I would say, 4.0 is all about convincing people that we truly could be a general purpose, mission-critical platform. And 5.0 is all about expanding our platform and making MongoDB even more easy to use, so that people can get started on MongoDB more quickly.\nSanjit Singh: Makes total sense, Dev. Congrats on the stellar results. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Sanjit.\nOperator: The next question will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thanks and congrats from me as well. Can you talk a little bit about, Dev, what you see out in the field in terms of customer interest to do more stuff again. So I\u2019m looking at your self-service Atlas started to kind of reaccelerate on growth. But we\u2019re coming also out of the pandemic. What do you see in terms of pipeline build and appetite for bigger projects coming through again? And I had one follow up for Mike.\nDev Ittycheria: We\u2019re clearly seeing more and more demand. So one of the things that we talked about in the prepared remarks is that, we had identified a set of promising accounts and said, what can we do to grow these accounts even more quickly, because we knew that they like MongoDB, but our percent of the total database spend was still quite small. And so when we deployed more resources and really had one rep focus on that account only, we suddenly saw the level of focus and the incremental resources really drive great results. We started -- those accounts started growing more quickly and so we\u2019re starting to do that even more with some of our other more promising counts again. It\u2019s a small percentage of a total customer base. But these are probably some of the most sophisticated and demanding customers and we are obviously careful about who we choose. We -- these people are predisposed to use Atlas. So we kind of negotiated some sort of agreement with them to use our cloud services, they already have some existing Atlas spend. So we know we have a - some strong champions in account. But we also know that there\u2019s a massive upside in that account. So for the most demanding customers, we\u2019re seeing really, really strong signals and this is giving us confidence to expand this program even further this year, as well as into next year. So that\u2019s kind of the top of the food chain. And I would say that, we\u2019re even seeing digital-native companies, ISVs, who have very, very demanding requirements that can continue to use -- either choose MongoDB or double down on MongoDB for their platforms and we\u2019re really excited about what that means for us long-term.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. And then the follow-up for Michael, just, if I look at your cash position now, it\u2019s obviously kind of after the action last quarter kind of a bit bigger. Can you just talk a little bit about your philosophy around cash, how much you want to carry to run the company, et cetera? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Sure. Yeah. Thanks. Obviously, the cash was bolstered in part by the equity offering we did during the quarter. We talked about that as an opportunistic financing. I think we just want to make sure that we have the full degrees of freedom that we think makes sense in terms of maximizing the long-term opportunity and to sort of invest in a business as long as we continue to see good returns from that. So I think that\u2019s probably the key points there.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Congrats.\nOperator: The next question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKash Rangan: I\u2019m sure you will get very good returns on cash. Thank you so much, Raimo. My question was on Atlas. It looks like the adoption curve for Atlas is turning out to be even more aggressively positive than one would have expected given that its cloud deployment? If you can just compare and contrast the kind of workloads that Atlas is able to take on relative to its life history versus the core MongoDB platform and what are things that have surprised you with the adoption curve? And what does this mean for where this business could look like in the next three years to four years in terms of the scale and scope of customers you could take on, had versus the standalone MongoDB on-prem database server? Thank you so much.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So one of the key differences with Atlas and say deploying on-prem is that developers can move very, very quickly, without needing their operations team to set up the infra -- underlying compute and storage infrastructure to get going. So, and by definition, the cloud has elastic scalability and so people can increase their instance sizes or their capacity very, very quickly, without having to go back and ask the ops teams to build out more infrastructure. So the ability for development teams to move very, very fast is even more pronounced on a cloud service like Atlas than it is on prem. The second thing I would say is that, Atlas has clearly become a mission critical platform. In the early days, there were probably people were, obviously, being a new service and people didn\u2019t know what to expect. You saw more dev and test workloads, perhaps, peripheral or Tier 3 workloads moving on to Atlas. But as people got more and more experience with Atlas, as we added more enterprise features to Atlas, people became increasingly more comfortable and now we\u2019re seeing, very, very large and demanding applications move to Atlas, even from some of the more conservative mainstream organizations out there. So what we\u2019re really seeing now is enterprise adoption of Atlas at scale.\nKash Rangan: Got it. So it\u2019s not a limiting factor itself as it relates to Atlas as a platform, right? We have everything that you get with MongoDB plus more the deployment flexibility, the ability to scale, so on. Is there a point where Atlas becomes even more scalable, even more functionally complete than the core MongoDB platform.\nDev Ittycheria: Well, I think, we said this and this happened a couple years back. I mean, we got to feature parity on Atlas far faster than we expected and now we actually release new feature development Atlas First and then we catch up on Enterprise Advanced. And so I would say that, in terms of feature completeness and scalability, Atlas is the best solution in the marketplace today. And I think you\u2019ll see us continue to invest aggressively in Atlas, because every customer that we know, even the customers who are predominantly on-premise, they know that the benefit of using MongoDB is that they can start on-prem, but they have a very seamless path to the cloud. There\u2019s no forklift upgrade. There\u2019s no rewrite of the application code. It\u2019s just a very seamless migration path. And so there\u2019s different customers based on the regulatory environment they\u2019re in, compliance reasons, sometimes even cultural reasons. They may be moving more slowly. But every customer has a very clear migration path to the cloud and we believe the ultimate destination will be Atlas.\nKash Rangan: Congrats, Dev. Thank you so much.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Kash.\nOperator: The next question will come from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Gentlemen, as you think about the last couple of years, you\u2019ve obviously introduced a bunch of new products. So, as we think of where we are today, are those products a meaningful amount or a meaningful contributor to new consumption that we\u2019ve seen quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year or is that really yet to come?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So, Brad, I think, that\u2019s good question. Again, I just want to remind you and everyone else that, the new product usage, the revenue shows up as Atlas revenue. But let me just give you a little bit of color on each of the products and what we\u2019re seeing. On Search, what\u2019s becoming very, very clear, is that customers are really, really attracted to being able to combine a database with a Search engine as one endpoint and as a managed service that becomes very, very attractive. They don\u2019t want a disparate MongoDB deployment and then some sort of elastic or solar deployment. To do that on one platform becomes really attractive and we\u2019re seeing really interesting uptick there. On Realm Sync, which, by the way, Sync was just G8 in February. We\u2019re seeing some really interesting customer use cases in particular in retail and logistics, where people want to do inventory management and logistics and we\u2019re seeing some really interesting customer traction there. On the Data Lake product, we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest, especially from some of our larger customers to basically improve the economics of keeping large volumes of data accessible. There\u2019s a challenge of that either they have to migrate the data completely, but then you can\u2019t really access it or you have to delete the data. And with online archive, you can actually get the benefits of having all the data but in a very cost effective way. We also see that people are building more and more interesting smarter applications, where they\u2019re leveraging analytics to build better customer experiences. And so as that becomes more pervasive, you\u2019ll see use cases like real-time analytics and so on, so forth, becoming more and more prevalent. And then, what I would say is that, even though time series is new, we\u2019ve had some interesting traction on time series. Again, customers attracted to rather than buying some sort of bespoke solution, being a part of a single platform and we can leverage the existing MongoDB installed base to go after more business. And so, I would say, that\u2019s the color I provide in terms of new customer traction and we\u2019re quite pleased with how things are progressing.\nBrad Reback: That\u2019s great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question will come from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. Good afternoon. Sticking with Atlas thread here, obviously, third quarter of accelerating growth, if I look at kind of customer add metrics versus usage metrics, this quarter it looks like a more material uptick in usage. So I guess first question, what drove the step up in Atlas usage this quarter? I think you talked about 600 -- 100,000 plus kind of enterprise type customers spending on the platform. Is it mostly enterprise? Are there other factors here at play? And then one quick follow up?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. What I would say is that, the performance of Atlas is strong across all the three channels. But I think, I would add that, the enterprise adoption of Atlas is really, in particular, something that should be called out. Because we\u2019re seeing customers now becoming very comfortable in deploying mission critical applications on Atlas with very demanding requirements and I think that\u2019s a big part of what\u2019s driving our growth. And I would also say that, multi-cloud is becoming increasingly important. Customers really like the fact that they can protect and preserve their investments in the application, even though they may end up moving cloud providers or may be running an app across different cloud providers. And I would say that, we\u2019re seeing some really interesting demand and some regions like India and Latin America, especially in a mid-market channel. So that gives us -- just gives us more conviction about how big an opportunity we\u2019re going after.\nBrent Bracelin: Great. And then Michael for you\u2026\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. Brent, just\u2026\nBrent Bracelin: I know\u2026\nDev Ittycheria: Okay.\nBrent Bracelin: Yeah.\nDev Ittycheria: Okay. Let me just add on one thing and then happy to cover your question. I just -- I think people get the year-over-year piece given the easier compare, but I think, I just want to underscore the sort of sequential piece, which I think is really important in the seasonality of Q2 being stronger than Q2 -- than Q1. And when we look out to the second half of the year, we see a tougher compare for Atlas in the second half. Sorry, go ahead.\nBrent Bracelin: Got it. So seasonal factor help there. Now my question is still on Atlas. It\u2019s just on the gross margin side. I know overall gross margins downtick slightly. But if I look at kind of gross versus subscription gross margins, you\u2019re well north of 75% for the last three quarters, even with a pretty material mix shift to Atlas. So do you think that with Atlas over half of the revenue mix that sits 75% subscription gross margin is sustainable?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared to call the bottom yet, but we\u2019ve been exceptionally pleased with how we\u2019ve executed against the strategy. They\u2019re still sort of additional opportunities and while we\u2019re very pleased that Atlas has 56% of revenue, there\u2019s still a lot -- there still is a margin delta between the two and a healthy chunk of the revenue. And so we\u2019ve got more that we need to do and want to do on Atlas gross margin, but we\u2019ve -- so we\u2019re certainly not at the bottom, but we\u2019ve been really pleased with the progress to-date.\nBrent Bracelin: Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jason Adder with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJason Adder: Yeah. Thank you. Dev, do you have a sense of how you\u2019re doing versus the cloud players? I mean, obviously, your results speak for themselves. But do you track win rates there and any just color or commentary on your competitive position versus some of the house databases from the cloud providers?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, if you know anything about the MongoDB culture, we\u2019re very focused on serving our customers, but also being quite aware of what a competition is doing and I\u2019m pleased to report that our win rates against the competition are very, very high, against both the standalone companies, as well as the clones being offered by the cloud providers, our win rates are really, really high. As I\u2019ve said in the past, our biggest issue is deals that are going down that we\u2019re just not aware of and that\u2019s -- those are deals that keep us up at night, because when you go head-to-head, our win rates are extremely high.\nJason Adder: All right. And then just a quick follow up on the multi-model capabilities of the platform. I know you have native time series now. I know you have graph and some other data models. Do you have a sense of how much of your customer base actually uses some of those capabilities? Can you track that?\nDev Ittycheria: In general, we can, and obviously, with these new capabilities, we can track usage. One of the benefits of a cloud service is you get much better fidelity in terms of what customers are doing on your platform. Yeah, and to underscore, the point you just made is that, the point that we make to our customers is that, rather than having a bunch of bespoke solutions and some of our competition has like 13 or 15 different database options. What people realize after the fact is that the challenge of managing, learning, managing supporting all the different technologies, let alone dealing with how to query all that data, synthesize all that data, backup all that data, becomes onerous management task. And so being able to consolidate it on a single platform becomes very, very attractive, which is why we\u2019re seeing so much interest in Search, which is why we\u2019re seeing so much interest in time series, even though it\u2019s very early and why we think that our platform strategy is really working.\nJason Adder: Thanks. Good luck.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Thank you. Good evening. I wanted to start, Dev, you made an interesting comment in your prepared remarks, just around higher C level engagement and I guess a couple questions there. What specifically are you doing to support that? Is it hiring more experienced traditional enterprise sellers? And then, secondly, like, what do you think is driving that? Is it Atlas? Is it just overall standardization as they look at legacy migrations? Just to expand on that that comment would be helpful? Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. Sure. So, one of the things that we learned about the buying behavior in the space is that people make decisions workload-by workload. So every time you build an application, every time you want to re-platform application, you have to make a decision about what database you want to use. So it tends to be, when you\u2019re in an account, you tend to have a bunch of micro decisions about all these workloads and you have to almost win them workload-by-workload. The benefit of going high is that, ultimately, your goal is to become declarative standard, where people don\u2019t need permission to use MongoDB to build an app. They can pretty much choose MongoDB, quote-unquote, that\u2019s a product off the shelf that is choose and it\u2019s part of the standard architecture that\u2019s been blessed and approved by that organization. So part of the value is going high, is accelerating the path being declared standard and going high also allows you to be positioned very differently than just being yet another database that a company uses. So understanding, helping them understand how we can really help them accelerate the business, how we can help them seize new opportunities, respond to new threats and that -- it\u2019s a real competitive advantage to build applications MongoDB versus any other alternative. So in terms of the people we have, we have -- we hired some outstanding salespeople and sales leaders. And so, obviously, we leverage the whole organization up into including the C level executives. For example, Sahir Azam, our Chief Product officer; Mike -- Mark Porter, our Chief Technology Officer; and myself and others get involved in strategic conversations. Cedric Pech our CRO is outstanding at knowing how to kind of build and scale these types of organizations. And we have very strong leaders in different theaters of the world who know how to do this really, really well. And I would say, in terms of why are we being invited to these conversations. One, I would say, people are starting to get more and more familiar with MongoDB. There\u2019s more and more evidence of the value we can provide. So one is time, they get more experience in MongoDB and they get more confident. Second, I would say, our feature -- our product portfolio is expanded quite significantly, so that we can address more and more use cases. And third, obviously, Atlas has really changed the game where people can just deploy MongoDB far more quickly than doing it\u2019s really on-premise. And so all those things have kind of been accomplished events for us to see the acceleration in these accounts.\nTyler Radke: Thanks. And Michael, I had follow up for you, I think, in an earlier question, you reference some more challenging comparison in the second half on a sequential basis on Atlas. I\u2019m just curious if you could expand on that. I think if we look back at least on a $1 basis added. The last few years, you\u2019ve seen similar, if not even a little bit more kind of net new Atlas revenue added in Q3 than Q2. So just curious if you could expand on that and how we should kind of think about the shape of the Atlas trajectory for this year?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So it\u2019s less about sequential and it\u2019s more commenting that the first half of the year in the base period of the compare was an easier compare given the COVID impacts that we saw at the end of Q1 and then in Q2. So it\u2019s really more of a year-over-year compare question than a sequential comment.\nOperator: The next question will come from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please go ahead.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. I\u2019ve got to two Atlas related questions. Dev, a lot of developers are building apps for Azure and GCP. I think we all understand that the vast majority of Atlas revenues are on AWS. Could you give us a bit of a progress report maybe on the mix from Atlas on GCP and Atlas on Azure? Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. I don\u2019t believe we break out the exact detail. But our business tends to mirror the market share of all three cloud providers. I would say, GCP probably is further ahead in terms of our list -- we\u2019re further ahead with GCP relative to their market share. But in general, our business tracks on the market share the cloud providers. I would say GCP -- and I think what really differentiates one cloud provider versus another is that people are recognizing that moving an Atlas workload to their cloud actually has ancillary benefits for that cloud provider, that customer ends up consuming other services and the dollars that they spend with us, they spend multiples of that with the end cloud provider. So in particular, Amazon and Google have been more aggressive in partnering the field at the sales level, there\u2019s more partnering going on and I think that\u2019s yielding more deals. And I think Microsoft is starting to see the -- potentially the benefits of doing that as well, but they are little bit further behind.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe a second Atlas question, the Azure Cosmos DB vulnerability got a decent amount of attention over the last couple of weeks? I\u2019m just curious whether you sense any change and focus on cloud database security exposures? And how and if that\u2019s a differentiator for Atlas?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So that\u2019s a good question. Obviously, that news was quite recent in terms of what happened with the Cosmos breach and just a level set, a security company discovered that was possible to gain completely -- a complete unrestricted access to accounts and databases of all the Azure customers, including their flagship product, Cosmos DB and this vulnerability was introduced through -- integration through its Jupyter Notebook service. I would say that, we have a very robust focus on security. Our products are - have a bunch of security certifications, including SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PSI, et cetera, and we have layers of defensive controls and triggers alarms in the event of suspicious activity. We spend a lot of time on product innovation and the other security including using features like client side field level encryption, which allows customers to store data in Atlas without there being anyone outside of their organization can even see the data. We utilize external security firms to perform regular penetration tests, same way an attacker would. And we have had a coordinated disclosure program where we encourage independent security researchers to contact us if they find a security issue in our products and we reward them accordingly. So we found tremendous value and output from our engagement with the external security consultants researchers, as well as our internal team and controls around vulnerability and discovery management. And thankfully, we\u2019ve not had a breach of MongoDB Atlas. But we\u2019re very, very focused on security. So it\u2019s a core tenant of our offering.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Dev, thank you for that.\nOperator: The next question will come from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nPat Walravens: Oh! Great. Thank you and congratulations on the quarter. Hey, Dev, if you look at like the five major use cases for databases, transaction processing, data warehousing, data science, stream processing, operational intelligence, where do you see the most opportunity for MongoDB?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, clearly, our roots start off in transaction processing. But we definitely, we definitely see a lot of opportunity in, what you call operational intelligence or what we say is analytics -- real time analytics for the application, we\u2019re not trying to be a data warehouse and you\u2019ll see us continue to invest more in that area. And what we see is that, it\u2019s a massive market and we\u2019re well positioned and as you can do to expand our platform, we address a wider variety of use cases. And what I would say is that, what customers are clearly telling us that, that they just don\u2019t want to use a net new technology for net new use case, that they want to be able to run more things on platforms and they want to get the benefits of all the best of breed solutions out there. But they want to be able to do that on a fewer set of platforms and that\u2019s where I think we\u2019re really differentiating ourselves, because we truly are a general purpose mission critical platform. When you look at the size of our customer base, the variety of use cases that customers run a MongoDB, the types of customers that use MongoDB, it becomes very, very clear that people can use us for a lot of different things.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jack Andrews with Needham. Please go ahead.\nJack Andrews: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I would ask a bit more on the 5.0 release. It seems to be one of the important features is, you\u2019ve talked about the ability to have a faster cadence of releases between major releases? So could you just flesh out for us, what should we be expecting in terms of, how do you anticipate priorities and focus on when -- what to release when?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, I -- we have a pretty rigorous approach, starting our product manager organization leads that process, but we take input from obviously our sales team, our customer support team, our technical sales organization, as well as I know kind of we do some top down analysis in terms of what are the areas that we want to get into. Obviously, we also look at what the competition is doing to understand, whether they\u2019re getting traction and whether or not and that informs our view in terms of how we want to decide, what products to build and what cadence. And obviously, in our space is not like you just build a product and move on, you come out with a MVP release and then you introduce new features or basically mature that product over time. If you look at even Atlas, Atlas only came out five years ago and the level of feature development Atlas, even though it was one product has been enormous. And so these products just tend to mature over time and so there\u2019s a -- there is always some debate about new features and capabilities versus maturing and strengthening the existing set of products. And there\u2019s -- it\u2019s obviously a judgment call and some art, as well as science in terms of how we handle that. And I would say to your point, with a cloud service, we can introduce new capabilities far more quickly than, say, an on-prem version. So we have gone to a quarterly release cycle, which allows us to introduce new features, fix bugs is that much faster, while folding in all the new changes and so forth into our on-prem product once a year. So -- and so that really allows us to continue to innovate fast, but still be able to address the needs of the organization and make sure customers can consume MongoDB\u2019s capabilities at the rate and pace that they want to.\nJack Andrews: Thanks for the color. Just as a follow up question, could you update us, perhaps, on progress with the systems integrators? Is there a way to frame the proportion of your deals that are maybe SI driven or SI influenced these days?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. We don\u2019t break out that\u2019s in particular, but I would say, a meaningful percentage of our business is done through some sort of partner. Those partners can come in a variety of flavors. We already talked about the cloud providers. To your point, the systems integrators are another key cohort of partners that we work with. We also work with a bunch of ISVs and they could be either sell-to or sell-through kind of relations with the ISVs. And so our partnerships play a big role. We have a dedicated partner organization focused on our partners. And they play a critical role in kind of helping us expand our reach and accelerate deals, as well as shorten the cycle time to close deals. And with regards to the SIs, historically, we\u2019ve done business with every major SI in the industry and so I can\u2019t think of one larger SI where we haven\u2019t done some business with. We\u2019re obviously picking and choosing the partners we work with where we think we can have the biggest impact. But we\u2019re also working with some boutique partners who have real MongoDB expertise who bring some expertise, especially since many customers may not necessarily have all the MongoDB skills that they want in their own organization and they also provide a valuable role in helping us grow our business.\nJack Andrews: Thanks and congratulations on the results.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Nice numbers, guys. Just one from me, Dev, maybe you could talk about international, you haven\u2019t talked about your international mix and that performed in the quarter. Maybe you can kind of recap for us how patterns internationally similar or different than they are here in the U.S.? And also is your strategic discussions that you\u2019re having with customers now here in the U.S., is that also something that applies internationally or that\u2019s more of later cycles, say, relative to where you are here in the U.S.\nDev Ittycheria: So, I would say, our business is frankly strong across the globe. Obviously, different theaters are -- the size of businesses is different, but we\u2019re seeing significant demand across the globe. I\u2019ll start with Europe. Historically, we\u2019ve been very strong in Northern Europe, and particularly, U.K., but we\u2019ve really expanded very aggressively to Southern Europe, France, Italy, Spain, have become really, really strong markets for us. We\u2019ve also expanded quite aggressively as you imagined to Germany and in Northern Europe, and we\u2019re feeling really good about the opportunity there. In fact, we\u2019re trying to hire as fast as we can. In terms of Asia, we\u2019ve seen a burgeoning demand coming out of India and Southeast Asia. It was funny, our sales leadership, when we first launched Atlas, argue that Atlas, the value proposition would make a lot of sense as the cost of labor was a lot lower in India. Atlas, the value proposition wouldn\u2019t even make as much sense because people just hire their own op -- database administrators will turns out, people value speed, people value being able to innovate and people value being able to offload undifferentiated work. So Atlas is going on like gangbusters. Our India team has been crushing their numbers. So we\u2019re trying to expand that team as fast as possible, same in other parts of Southeast Asia. In China, obviously, we can\u2019t offer Atlas due to regulatory constraints. So we decided, as -- I think you may be aware that we have relationship with both Alibaba and Tencent. And Alibaba we are about in year two of that relationship and that relationship is going really, really well. And Tencent is just starting to heat up. As you know that there\u2019s some, the government there is taking -- there\u2019s a little bit more scrutiny about what the tech companies can do. But we\u2019re not seeing that in our business with those partners. And then, in terms of Latin America, while we don\u2019t have a huge present in Latin America, we\u2019re seeing a lot of demand. So we\u2019re trying to service that through our inside sales team and our self-serve channel and we\u2019re starting to deploy more resources in Latin America. So I would tell you that this market is very large and it\u2019s truly a global phenomenon.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Good luck. Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Ittai.\nOperator: The next question will come from Matthew Broome with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Broome: Thanks very much and definitely appreciate the geographic color there on. I guess, sort of a similar question in terms of, sort of, customer that goes, if there are any specific industries that sort of particularly outperformed your expectations or conversely where you\u2019d like to see a bit stronger momentum?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, I would say, obviously, it\u2019s a big market. So as you can imagine, our sales teams tend to go where the business is. We tend to not organize by verticals. But that\u2019s something that may change over time, as we see getting going deeper and accounts going deeper in financial services, going deeper into understanding their particular use cases can have disproportionate impact on our business. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019re contemplating. But I would say, in general, we\u2019re seeing strong across the Board performance. MongoDB is truly a horizontal solution and it\u2019s really a function of our coverage model and how many people we have in the region. And because they\u2019re organized geographically, they\u2019ll go after the opposite way, they think that they can have the quickest impact on. So, as you can imagine, companies that are more technology sophisticated tend to be really good customers of ours, because of companies who want to build their own custom applications tend to be really the customers ours. And obviously, every new SaaS company who\u2019s coming out, as we think about the tech stack, we want to be part of that tech stack. So we\u2019re spending a lot more focus on those companies, because as they grow, we\u2019re the beneficiaries of that growth.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. I would just add if you\u2026\nMatthew Broome: Okay.\nMichael Gordon: I would just add if you think about the Q2 outperformance. We talked about sort of strength across the Board. We also talked about how Enterprise Advanced was particularly strong. And while sometimes you might map that to certain industries, I think, even in the vignettes and customer examples, Dev pointed out, really, it depends on how someone\u2019s, what their architecture looks like and how they\u2019re going to consume software. So it doesn\u2019t perfectly map to the industries. But we had, like I said, very strong performance in Q2 really across the product wise, but particularly in EA. And then when we look out for the second half of the year, we don\u2019t see that -- we\u2019re not counting on that EA performance, when you look at the back half, which obviously, impacts numbers.\nMatthew Broome: Excellent. Thanks again.\nOperator: The next question will come from Steve Koenig with SMBC Nikko. Please go ahead.\nSteve Koenig: Okay, Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in guys. I\u2019ll just ask one question. So I remember back in the day, at Oracle, when interoperability and portability were big marketing points for them. Now their applications have all been built and the marketing message isn\u2019t so important for them. But new applications are being developed in the cloud, with new databases like Mongo, yet database interoperability is great, multi-cloud is great, but there\u2019s a lot of other past services that apps need to hook into besides database. So can you give us more color on how real multi-cloud is today and the customer challenges associated with implementing it? And I think the broader question is, long-term how do you stay ahead of the major cloud vendors who expand a very good chance of being major forces in this market? Thank you very much and I appreciate the squeezing me in.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So when -- if you talk to any developer, they will tell you that the most amount of time and effort that they spend on is working with data. So the database tends to be a place where they spend a particular amount of time and that\u2019s where they have the biggest challenges and that\u2019s where we see the biggest opportunity. So while they have to integrate with other solutions and they may have to build a range of microservices, every microservices, for example, will need a database. And so while applications are getting decomposed into smaller, smaller piece parts, like microservices, the database still plays a very, very important role. And so, yes, when a customer builds an application, they may tie into other services that the cloud provider may offer, but a big factor in terms of what application to build, how quickly they can innovate, how fast they can add features is directly correlated to what database they are using, which is why we win. And I would say that, to your second question, compared to the cloud providers, we have been competing with the largest companies in the world, obviously, Oracle and others in the early days and then the cloud providers, including Amazon and Azure, with their own competitive offerings for the longest time and we\u2019ve held our own. And the reason we\u2019ve held our own is that, we have built a very, very strong set of IP with the document model, it\u2019s proven to be the best way to work with data. Even though it\u2019s an open source product, we have a strong IP moat around it. So the cloud providers cannot just take our free version and compete with us, unlike a lot of other open source technologies. And with the success of Atlas, when we went public, there was some degree of skepticism by some investors about could we really compete by building our own cloud service going head-to-head with the cloud vendors. Well, I think the results speak for themselves. There aren\u2019t many businesses that are growing at over 80% that are at a $0.5 billion run rate and I think that speaks to the IP that we have, it speaks to the value that customers are getting and it speaks to our ability to execute.\nSteve Koenig: Great. Thanks very much again. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dev Ittycheria for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you. I just want to leave you with a few comments. First, I think, what we really want to reinforce is that we believe customers realize that if they want to move fast MongoDB is the best way to do so. Second, Atlas\u2019 growth of 83% reinforced the point that customers want a multi-cloud platform that enables them to innovate quickly and outsource the undifferentiated heavy lifting of managing their data infrastructure. Third, we continued investing and evolving a go-to-market strategy across field sales, inside sales and sell the self-serve channels to capture this large market opportunity. And last but not least, we continue to rollout significant innovation to improve our platform through both ease-of-use and expansion of capabilities to encourage more and more customers to use MongoDB. So thank you for your time and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Take care.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our second quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2022. First, I'll start with our second quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $198.7 million, up 44% year-over-year, subscription revenue was $191.4 million, up 44% year-over-year, and professional services revenue was $7.4 million, up 27% year-over-year. We exceeded our expectations in both Atlas and Enterprise Advanced but our outperformance was particularly notable in Enterprise Advanced. As you know, EA has a more immediate impact on revenue due to the fact that under ASC 606 we're required to recognize the term license component of revenue upfront. Overall, Atlas' strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew 83% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 56% of total revenue, compared to 44% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 and 51% last quarter. During the second quarter, we grew our customer base by over 2,200 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 29,000, which is up from over 20,200 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count over 3,600 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 2,500 in the year ago period. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform, as well as self-service customers with whom we now have a direct sales relationship  The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 27,500 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 18,800 in the year ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,126 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 819 in the year ago period. The continued strong growth in customers, with $100,000 or more in ARR is an indication of the success of our land and expand go-to-market strategy and the fact that we're increasingly becoming a strategic partner and a database standard for our customers. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the second quarter was $142.9 million, representing a gross margin of 72%, which is consistent with last quarter and consistent with 72% in the year ago period. Overall, we are pleased with our gross margin performance, which is only seeing a modest impact from Atlas as it becomes a bigger portion of our revenue despite its infrastructure component. We continue to expect that we'll see a modest reduction in overall company gross margin as Atlas continues to grow as a percentage of our revenues. Our operating loss was $11.5 million or a negative 6% operating margin for the second quarter compared to a negative 7% margin in a year ago period. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was driven primarily by revenue outperformance. Net loss in the second quarter was $15.2 million or $0.24 per share based on 63.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $12.7 million or $0.22 per share on 58.4 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, after raising almost $900 million and a follow on equity offerings during the quarter, we ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was negative $19.8 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $22.7 million in the quarter. This comparison negative free cash flow $15 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2022. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $202 million to $204 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $25 million to $23 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.42 cents to $0.39 based on 66.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2022, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $805 million to $811 million. For the full fiscal year 2022, we now expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $67 million to $62 million and non-gap net loss per share to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.13 based on 64.6 million weighted average shares outstanding. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent second quarter results. We're driving high levels of growth at scale, driven by our large market opportunity and strong execution. We continue investing to capture the large opportunity ahead of us. We're seeing attractive returns on those investments and we're excited about our positioning for the future. With that, we'd like to open up to questions. Operator? I would just add maybe, Sanjit, from perspective, the two thoughts. One, on the year-over-year piece, obviously, Q2 was an easier Atlas compare, given the COVID impact that we experienced last year that was that sort of broad based, but modest impact that we saw, resulting in slower expansion from accounts. And then sequentially to your point, there is some seasonality and Q2 tends to be meaningfully stronger than Q1 and so you sort of -- you see that showing up in the numbers as well. Sure. Yeah. Thanks. Obviously, the cash was bolstered in part by the equity offering we did during the quarter. We talked about that as an opportunistic financing. I think we just want to make sure that we have the full degrees of freedom that we think makes sense in terms of maximizing the long-term opportunity and to sort of invest in a business as long as we continue to see good returns from that. So I think that's probably the key points there. Yeah. So I don't think we're prepared to call the bottom yet, but we've been exceptionally pleased with how we've executed against the strategy. They're still sort of additional opportunities and while we're very pleased that Atlas has 56% of revenue, there's still a lot -- there still is a margin delta between the two and a healthy chunk of the revenue. And so we've got more that we need to do and want to do on Atlas gross margin, but we've -- so we're certainly not at the bottom, but we've been really pleased with the progress to-date. Yeah. So it's less about sequential and it's more commenting that the first half of the year in the base period of the compare was an easier compare given the COVID impacts that we saw at the end of Q1 and then in Q2. So it's really more of a year-over-year compare question than a sequential comment. Yeah. I would just add if you... I would just add if you think about the Q2 outperformance. We talked about sort of strength across the Board. We also talked about how Enterprise Advanced was particularly strong. And while sometimes you might map that to certain industries, I think, even in the vignettes and customer examples, Dev pointed out, really, it depends on how someone's, what their architecture looks like and how they're going to consume software. So it doesn't perfectly map to the industries. But we had, like I said, very strong performance in Q2 really across the product wise, but particularly in EA. And then when we look out for the second half of the year, we don't see that -- we're not counting on that EA performance, when you look at the back half, which obviously, impacts numbers."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Dev Ittycheria",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our second quarter results before giving you a company update. Before diving in, I want to share that today marks my seventh anniversary at MongoDB. I'm incredibly proud of how much progress we've made over the past seven years. We went from being a small private company with an interesting technology to disrupting one of the largest markets in all of software. Along the way, we changed how open source software is licensed, we introduced a new cloud service that required us to both partner and compete with the largest cloud providers, and we grew revenues 20-fold with a compound annual growth rate of over 50%. I'm incredibly grateful to all the amazing people in MongoDB and to our customers and partners around the world who made this happen. As proud as I am of the amazing journey we've had, I'm even more optimistic today about our opportunities ahead. Looking quickly at our second quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $199 million, a 44% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 44% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew 83% year-over-year and now represents 56% of our revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth ending the quarter with over 29,000 customers. Businesses across nearly every industry have realized that in today's highly dynamic global markets, speed of development is a meaningful competitive advantage. Businesses that can develop software faster are able to improve their products faster, and ultimately, grow more quickly than their competition. We believe our strong second quarter results are a clear indication that customers view MongoDB as a critical platform to accelerate their digital innovation agenda. Customers of all types are using MongoDB because they can develop so much faster using our platform to build new applications and re-platform legacy applications across a broad range of use cases to drive their business forward. Fundamentally MongoDB's application data platform offers three intrinsic advantages. First, MongoDB's document model is designed around how developers think and code, unlike legacy data technologies. This enables developers to be far more productive and build applications faster, as compared to any other technology. Second, MongoDB's document model is a superset of other data models, tabular, key value, time series, graph and other kinds of data relationships can be easily created using documents. The document model enables MongoDB to address a wide range of use cases and reduces the need for customers to use niche technologies that only serve a single purpose. Third, MongoDB is designed for performance and scale. With MongoDB sophisticated capabilities to replicate, manage and distribute data at massive scale, organizations increasingly choose MongoDB to address the most demanding requirements. Legacy technologies are fundamentally not designed for today's scale and performance expectations, requiring developers to spend an enormous amount of time working around their architectural limitations. The continued success of Atlas shows that speed is of paramount importance to our customers. Atlas is the best way for customers to enjoy the benefits of our platform, as the time to value can literally be only a matter of minutes. Atlas had another excellent quarter, accelerating to 83% year-over-year growth, while approaching a $0.5 billion run rate. We also had another strong quarter of Atlas customer additions from self-serve to enterprise customers. Our second quarter results give us even more conviction to continue investing in both our product portfolio and our go-to-market initiatives. Starting with go-to-market, our field sales team is increasingly being pulled into higher level strategic conversations at the C-suite of the largest companies in the world and we are adjusting our approach to more effectively serve that audience. Last year we expanded with increasing our focus on our most promising customers. Our hypothesis was that by going deep into an account with more resources, it will position us more strategically and allow us to penetrate the account more quickly. Those investments produce excellent returns and most accounts that ran this experiment grew faster than we expected. This is giving us confidence to expand this deeper coverage model to more accounts this year, while also focusing on expanding our field sales capacity in all regions. Our inside sales team is firing on all cylinders and had another great quarter. The strong product market fit of Atlas for this channel, along with the changes we introduced last year to make it easier for customers to start using Atlas, have had a positive impact. Given the results, we are focused on expanding our inside sales capacity in our regional hubs around the world to capture more of the large opportunity we see in this channel. Finally, turning to self-serve, this channel is a cost effective way to acquire large numbers of customers and is a critical lead generation vehicle for our sales organization. We are focused on increasing our sophistication on digital acquisition and product-led growth techniques to increase the top of funnel and optimize mid-funnel conversion rates. This is an iterative process with a lot of experimentation that is yielding promising results. Turning to our product roadmap, we continue to invest both to extend our lead and the core database space, as well as to mature and grow our merchant products. At MongoDB.live, our User Conference held in July, we made significant -- several significant product announcements that further advance our vision. We focused on two themes ease-of-use and expanding the capabilities of our platform to make it more compelling for customers to standardize on MongoDB. First, on ease-of-use, making it easy for developers to use and get value out of MongoDB has been the core of our DNA since the founding of the company. Our announcement of Atlas Serverless takes ease-of-use and developer productivity to the next level. With Serverless, customers can get started with MongoDB without having to pick a specific machine type or size. The application connects to Atlas and we handle the elastic scaling of compute and storage seamlessly, whether an application scales quickly or as spiky traffic patterns. This dramatically simplifies life for our customers, because they no longer have to do capacity planning or manually intervene to adjust the size of the deployment. We expect Serverless to drive more customer demand, because getting started on and using Atlas just became even easier. Next, for customers who want to benefit from our sharding features to manage a massive amount of data, we introduced Live Resharding. As a reminder, sharding is a method for horizontally distributing data across multiple machines. MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very large amounts of data and high throughput operations to prevent any single machine from becoming a bottleneck. Previously, when a customer wanted to shard data, the customer had to pick a shard key, essentially the parameter that would be used to partition the data. However, we know an application's requirements can change quickly, make it more beneficial to partition data using a different shard key. Live Resharding allows users to easily change the shard key when this happens. This feature, which is not available in any other platform, will make it far easier for customers to start using our sharding capabilities and seamlessly redistribute data when the requirements of their application or their business change. Finally, our announcement in Versioned API addresses a structural issue with all databases. Historically, when a new database version is introduced, there are feature changes that can break existing application functionality and create significant rework for development teams. Invariably, some organizations prefer to stay on an older version of a database to avoid this risk. But the downside is that they then cannot take advantage of new features available in the latest version. Our introduction of Versioned API solves this problem. The Versioned API feature lets you upgrade your MongoDB server at will. This groundbreaking capability allows customers to decouple the application development lifecycle from the database lifecycle, so they only need to update their application when they want to introduce new functionality, not when they upgrade the database. Of all the features we announced in MongoDB.Live, Versioned API got perhaps the most enthusiastic customer reception. Regarding the second theme, we remain focused on expanding the capabilities of our platform. Because customers consistently tell us that they want a modern general purpose platform that precludes the need for single purpose technologies in order to reduce back end infrastructure complexity and increase the speed of innovation. We introduce native time series support across our entire platform. Time series collections, clustered indexing and windows functions make it easier, faster and lower cost to build and run application like IoT. While we were able to address this fast growing use case in the past, with these new features, we can compete for even the most demanding time series workloads. We also add a depth of functionality across our merchant products, perhaps most notably an Atlas Search. We're enhancing search with custom synonyms and function scoring, which allow e-commerce customers to provide more relevant and geographically targeted results. We believe these features will make Atlas Search an excellent solution for even more use cases. Finally, we also recently announced that we achieve FedRAMP Ready status. This designation allows to capture the substantial demand for MongoDB Atlas across federal and state government agencies and ISVs that serve that market. Our recently announced product enhancements enable customers to use MongoDB for an even broader set of use cases and represent a meaningful step forward on our journey to deliver the preeminent modern application data platform. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the second quarter. JetBlue is New York's hometown airline with 1 -- with over 100 destinations across the U.S., Caribbean, Latin America and between New York and London. To overhaul their core e-commerce app, JetBlue chose the MongoDB application data platform. MongoDB flexible data model allows JetBlue to build dynamic customer experiences when their ticketing application, as well as predictive analytics in real time. DataRobot is a leader in augmented intelligence, delivering a trusted AI platform that empowers organizations to make better data driven business decisions faster and at scale. MongoDB has powered the company's SaaS platform from its inception and this quarter DataRobot migrate from MongoDB Community Edition to Enterprise Advanced for compliance encryption features and support. Our enhanced relationship will help DataRobot continue to innovate and support its global customer base, as users who are using AI to transform their businesses. Roma Capitale is the governing body for the City of Rome and manages services across transport, welfare and education for over 4 million citizens. In a bid to drive a new smart city approach, Roma chose MongoDB as part of the underlying data platform to modernize its entire content management system and drive a new comprehensive single-view environment for development. As a result, Roma jumped from 15th place to fourth in the latest Italian Smart City ranking and was able to bring new online digital opportunities to its citizens. PT Visionet Internasional or OVO, a leading Indonesian payments, rewards and financial services platform relies on MongoDB to power its core digital payments platform that serves over 115 million devices. As part of a strategic initiative to market all of its database workloads spread across multiple databases and hosting platforms, OVO chose MongoDB Atlas enterprise to consolidate its tech stack and move to Google Cloud. OVO expect the modernization will increase developer productivity, accelerate new feature release cycles and consolidate workloads making the over infrastructure feature ready. In summary, we had another excellent quarter. Our customers want to innovate faster and are looking for a scalable general purpose application data platform that will give their developers the freedom to move quickly. MongoDB is increasingly seen as uniquely positioned to fulfill this need. With that, I'll now turn it over to Michael. Sure. So, first of all, what I'd say is that, customer additions remain robust across all three channels. So we're seeing strengthen in all geographies, including places like India and Latin America. And we frankly also see strong Enterprise adoption of Atlas. Atlas is increasingly seen as a destination for mission-critical applications. And as we said last quarter, over 600 customers spend north of $100,000 on Atlas alone. And self-serve remains a critical channel and a customer acquisition vehicle. So, over 50% of our Atlas ARR was from customers originally sourced in the self-serve channel. I'd also say that multi-cloud is a huge selling point for Atlas, multi-cloud improves resilience. And as you know, cloud providers do have outages and they can leverage the best features of each cloud provider and avoid lock-in. In terms of like breakdown of where these customers are coming from, I think, I would just say, we're seeing healthy growth of both new customers, as well as expansion of existing customers. And yes, the customers we've acquired over the last few quarters are growing, expansion rates for Atlas are very strong and so all of them are essentially contributing to the growth of Atlas. Well, it's a question I actually haven't thought of. But as you said, 4.0 was assembled at least for us because it's introduced a big feature with multi-document ACID transactions, which at the time was the biggest objection for enterprises or anyone using, wanting to use MongoDB for mission-critical use case. That objection was obviously taken off the table. What I would say with 5.0 is we're just continue to double down on it, one, expanding our platform, obviously, with all the additions that we're making, especially with native time series support and we're also making it far easier for customers to use MongoDB. As you can imagine, with over 29,000 customers, we have customers of all shapes and sizes, of all levels of sophistication. And we really want, frankly, and that -- this is in our DNA, we really want the database to get other way of people getting their work done. And so we just want to make it really easy for people to use MongoDB and obviously Atlas is the best way to expose a lot of the features. And so I would just contrast, I would say, 4.0 is all about convincing people that we truly could be a general purpose, mission-critical platform. And 5.0 is all about expanding our platform and making MongoDB even more easy to use, so that people can get started on MongoDB more quickly. Thanks, Sanjit. We're clearly seeing more and more demand. So one of the things that we talked about in the prepared remarks is that, we had identified a set of promising accounts and said, what can we do to grow these accounts even more quickly, because we knew that they like MongoDB, but our percent of the total database spend was still quite small. And so when we deployed more resources and really had one rep focus on that account only, we suddenly saw the level of focus and the incremental resources really drive great results. We started -- those accounts started growing more quickly and so we're starting to do that even more with some of our other more promising counts again. It's a small percentage of a total customer base. But these are probably some of the most sophisticated and demanding customers and we are obviously careful about who we choose. We -- these people are predisposed to use Atlas. So we kind of negotiated some sort of agreement with them to use our cloud services, they already have some existing Atlas spend. So we know we have a - some strong champions in account. But we also know that there's a massive upside in that account. So for the most demanding customers, we're seeing really, really strong signals and this is giving us confidence to expand this program even further this year, as well as into next year. So that's kind of the top of the food chain. And I would say that, we're even seeing digital-native companies, ISVs, who have very, very demanding requirements that can continue to use -- either choose MongoDB or double down on MongoDB for their platforms and we're really excited about what that means for us long-term. Yeah. So one of the key differences with Atlas and say deploying on-prem is that developers can move very, very quickly, without needing their operations team to set up the infra -- underlying compute and storage infrastructure to get going. So, and by definition, the cloud has elastic scalability and so people can increase their instance sizes or their capacity very, very quickly, without having to go back and ask the ops teams to build out more infrastructure. So the ability for development teams to move very, very fast is even more pronounced on a cloud service like Atlas than it is on prem. The second thing I would say is that, Atlas has clearly become a mission critical platform. In the early days, there were probably people were, obviously, being a new service and people didn't know what to expect. You saw more dev and test workloads, perhaps, peripheral or Tier 3 workloads moving on to Atlas. But as people got more and more experience with Atlas, as we added more enterprise features to Atlas, people became increasingly more comfortable and now we're seeing, very, very large and demanding applications move to Atlas, even from some of the more conservative mainstream organizations out there. So what we're really seeing now is enterprise adoption of Atlas at scale. Well, I think, we said this and this happened a couple years back. I mean, we got to feature parity on Atlas far faster than we expected and now we actually release new feature development Atlas First and then we catch up on Enterprise Advanced. And so I would say that, in terms of feature completeness and scalability, Atlas is the best solution in the marketplace today. And I think you'll see us continue to invest aggressively in Atlas, because every customer that we know, even the customers who are predominantly on-premise, they know that the benefit of using MongoDB is that they can start on-prem, but they have a very seamless path to the cloud. There's no forklift upgrade. There's no rewrite of the application code. It's just a very seamless migration path. And so there's different customers based on the regulatory environment they're in, compliance reasons, sometimes even cultural reasons. They may be moving more slowly. But every customer has a very clear migration path to the cloud and we believe the ultimate destination will be Atlas. Thanks, Kash. Yeah. So, Brad, I think, that's good question. Again, I just want to remind you and everyone else that, the new product usage, the revenue shows up as Atlas revenue. But let me just give you a little bit of color on each of the products and what we're seeing. On Search, what's becoming very, very clear, is that customers are really, really attracted to being able to combine a database with a Search engine as one endpoint and as a managed service that becomes very, very attractive. They don't want a disparate MongoDB deployment and then some sort of elastic or solar deployment. To do that on one platform becomes really attractive and we're seeing really interesting uptick there. On Realm Sync, which, by the way, Sync was just G8 in February. We're seeing some really interesting customer use cases in particular in retail and logistics, where people want to do inventory management and logistics and we're seeing some really interesting customer traction there. On the Data Lake product, we're seeing a lot of interest, especially from some of our larger customers to basically improve the economics of keeping large volumes of data accessible. There's a challenge of that either they have to migrate the data completely, but then you can't really access it or you have to delete the data. And with online archive, you can actually get the benefits of having all the data but in a very cost effective way. We also see that people are building more and more interesting smarter applications, where they're leveraging analytics to build better customer experiences. And so as that becomes more pervasive, you'll see use cases like real-time analytics and so on, so forth, becoming more and more prevalent. And then, what I would say is that, even though time series is new, we've had some interesting traction on time series. Again, customers attracted to rather than buying some sort of bespoke solution, being a part of a single platform and we can leverage the existing MongoDB installed base to go after more business. And so, I would say, that's the color I provide in terms of new customer traction and we're quite pleased with how things are progressing. Yeah. What I would say is that, the performance of Atlas is strong across all the three channels. But I think, I would add that, the enterprise adoption of Atlas is really, in particular, something that should be called out. Because we're seeing customers now becoming very comfortable in deploying mission critical applications on Atlas with very demanding requirements and I think that's a big part of what's driving our growth. And I would also say that, multi-cloud is becoming increasingly important. Customers really like the fact that they can protect and preserve their investments in the application, even though they may end up moving cloud providers or may be running an app across different cloud providers. And I would say that, we're seeing some really interesting demand and some regions like India and Latin America, especially in a mid-market channel. So that gives us -- just gives us more conviction about how big an opportunity we're going after. Yeah. Brent, just... Okay. Okay. Let me just add on one thing and then happy to cover your question. I just -- I think people get the year-over-year piece given the easier compare, but I think, I just want to underscore the sort of sequential piece, which I think is really important in the seasonality of Q2 being stronger than Q2 -- than Q1. And when we look out to the second half of the year, we see a tougher compare for Atlas in the second half. Sorry, go ahead. Well, if you know anything about the MongoDB culture, we're very focused on serving our customers, but also being quite aware of what a competition is doing and I'm pleased to report that our win rates against the competition are very, very high, against both the standalone companies, as well as the clones being offered by the cloud providers, our win rates are really, really high. As I've said in the past, our biggest issue is deals that are going down that we're just not aware of and that's -- those are deals that keep us up at night, because when you go head-to-head, our win rates are extremely high. In general, we can, and obviously, with these new capabilities, we can track usage. One of the benefits of a cloud service is you get much better fidelity in terms of what customers are doing on your platform. Yeah, and to underscore, the point you just made is that, the point that we make to our customers is that, rather than having a bunch of bespoke solutions and some of our competition has like 13 or 15 different database options. What people realize after the fact is that the challenge of managing, learning, managing supporting all the different technologies, let alone dealing with how to query all that data, synthesize all that data, backup all that data, becomes onerous management task. And so being able to consolidate it on a single platform becomes very, very attractive, which is why we're seeing so much interest in Search, which is why we're seeing so much interest in time series, even though it's very early and why we think that our platform strategy is really working. Thank you. Yeah. Sure. So, one of the things that we learned about the buying behavior in the space is that people make decisions workload-by workload. So every time you build an application, every time you want to re-platform application, you have to make a decision about what database you want to use. So it tends to be, when you're in an account, you tend to have a bunch of micro decisions about all these workloads and you have to almost win them workload-by-workload. The benefit of going high is that, ultimately, your goal is to become declarative standard, where people don't need permission to use MongoDB to build an app. They can pretty much choose MongoDB, quote-unquote, that's a product off the shelf that is choose and it's part of the standard architecture that's been blessed and approved by that organization. So part of the value is going high, is accelerating the path being declared standard and going high also allows you to be positioned very differently than just being yet another database that a company uses. So understanding, helping them understand how we can really help them accelerate the business, how we can help them seize new opportunities, respond to new threats and that -- it's a real competitive advantage to build applications MongoDB versus any other alternative. So in terms of the people we have, we have -- we hired some outstanding salespeople and sales leaders. And so, obviously, we leverage the whole organization up into including the C level executives. For example, Sahir Azam, our Chief Product officer; Mike -- Mark Porter, our Chief Technology Officer; and myself and others get involved in strategic conversations. Cedric Pech our CRO is outstanding at knowing how to kind of build and scale these types of organizations. And we have very strong leaders in different theaters of the world who know how to do this really, really well. And I would say, in terms of why are we being invited to these conversations. One, I would say, people are starting to get more and more familiar with MongoDB. There's more and more evidence of the value we can provide. So one is time, they get more experience in MongoDB and they get more confident. Second, I would say, our feature -- our product portfolio is expanded quite significantly, so that we can address more and more use cases. And third, obviously, Atlas has really changed the game where people can just deploy MongoDB far more quickly than doing it's really on-premise. And so all those things have kind of been accomplished events for us to see the acceleration in these accounts. Yeah. I don't believe we break out the exact detail. But our business tends to mirror the market share of all three cloud providers. I would say, GCP probably is further ahead in terms of our list -- we're further ahead with GCP relative to their market share. But in general, our business tracks on the market share the cloud providers. I would say GCP -- and I think what really differentiates one cloud provider versus another is that people are recognizing that moving an Atlas workload to their cloud actually has ancillary benefits for that cloud provider, that customer ends up consuming other services and the dollars that they spend with us, they spend multiples of that with the end cloud provider. So in particular, Amazon and Google have been more aggressive in partnering the field at the sales level, there's more partnering going on and I think that's yielding more deals. And I think Microsoft is starting to see the -- potentially the benefits of doing that as well, but they are little bit further behind. Yeah. So that's a good question. Obviously, that news was quite recent in terms of what happened with the Cosmos breach and just a level set, a security company discovered that was possible to gain completely -- a complete unrestricted access to accounts and databases of all the Azure customers, including their flagship product, Cosmos DB and this vulnerability was introduced through -- integration through its Jupyter Notebook service. I would say that, we have a very robust focus on security. Our products are - have a bunch of security certifications, including SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, PSI, et cetera, and we have layers of defensive controls and triggers alarms in the event of suspicious activity. We spend a lot of time on product innovation and the other security including using features like client side field level encryption, which allows customers to store data in Atlas without there being anyone outside of their organization can even see the data. We utilize external security firms to perform regular penetration tests, same way an attacker would. And we have had a coordinated disclosure program where we encourage independent security researchers to contact us if they find a security issue in our products and we reward them accordingly. So we found tremendous value and output from our engagement with the external security consultants researchers, as well as our internal team and controls around vulnerability and discovery management. And thankfully, we've not had a breach of MongoDB Atlas. But we're very, very focused on security. So it's a core tenant of our offering. Well, clearly, our roots start off in transaction processing. But we definitely, we definitely see a lot of opportunity in, what you call operational intelligence or what we say is analytics -- real time analytics for the application, we're not trying to be a data warehouse and you'll see us continue to invest more in that area. And what we see is that, it's a massive market and we're well positioned and as you can do to expand our platform, we address a wider variety of use cases. And what I would say is that, what customers are clearly telling us that, that they just don't want to use a net new technology for net new use case, that they want to be able to run more things on platforms and they want to get the benefits of all the best of breed solutions out there. But they want to be able to do that on a fewer set of platforms and that's where I think we're really differentiating ourselves, because we truly are a general purpose mission critical platform. When you look at the size of our customer base, the variety of use cases that customers run a MongoDB, the types of customers that use MongoDB, it becomes very, very clear that people can use us for a lot of different things. Well, I -- we have a pretty rigorous approach, starting our product manager organization leads that process, but we take input from obviously our sales team, our customer support team, our technical sales organization, as well as I know kind of we do some top down analysis in terms of what are the areas that we want to get into. Obviously, we also look at what the competition is doing to understand, whether they're getting traction and whether or not and that informs our view in terms of how we want to decide, what products to build and what cadence. And obviously, in our space is not like you just build a product and move on, you come out with a MVP release and then you introduce new features or basically mature that product over time. If you look at even Atlas, Atlas only came out five years ago and the level of feature development Atlas, even though it was one product has been enormous. And so these products just tend to mature over time and so there's a -- there is always some debate about new features and capabilities versus maturing and strengthening the existing set of products. And there's -- it's obviously a judgment call and some art, as well as science in terms of how we handle that. And I would say to your point, with a cloud service, we can introduce new capabilities far more quickly than, say, an on-prem version. So we have gone to a quarterly release cycle, which allows us to introduce new features, fix bugs is that much faster, while folding in all the new changes and so forth into our on-prem product once a year. So -- and so that really allows us to continue to innovate fast, but still be able to address the needs of the organization and make sure customers can consume MongoDB's capabilities at the rate and pace that they want to. Yeah. We don't break out that's in particular, but I would say, a meaningful percentage of our business is done through some sort of partner. Those partners can come in a variety of flavors. We already talked about the cloud providers. To your point, the systems integrators are another key cohort of partners that we work with. We also work with a bunch of ISVs and they could be either sell-to or sell-through kind of relations with the ISVs. And so our partnerships play a big role. We have a dedicated partner organization focused on our partners. And they play a critical role in kind of helping us expand our reach and accelerate deals, as well as shorten the cycle time to close deals. And with regards to the SIs, historically, we've done business with every major SI in the industry and so I can't think of one larger SI where we haven't done some business with. We're obviously picking and choosing the partners we work with where we think we can have the biggest impact. But we're also working with some boutique partners who have real MongoDB expertise who bring some expertise, especially since many customers may not necessarily have all the MongoDB skills that they want in their own organization and they also provide a valuable role in helping us grow our business. Thank you. So, I would say, our business is frankly strong across the globe. Obviously, different theaters are -- the size of businesses is different, but we're seeing significant demand across the globe. I'll start with Europe. Historically, we've been very strong in Northern Europe, and particularly, U.K., but we've really expanded very aggressively to Southern Europe, France, Italy, Spain, have become really, really strong markets for us. We've also expanded quite aggressively as you imagined to Germany and in Northern Europe, and we're feeling really good about the opportunity there. In fact, we're trying to hire as fast as we can. In terms of Asia, we've seen a burgeoning demand coming out of India and Southeast Asia. It was funny, our sales leadership, when we first launched Atlas, argue that Atlas, the value proposition would make a lot of sense as the cost of labor was a lot lower in India. Atlas, the value proposition wouldn't even make as much sense because people just hire their own op -- database administrators will turns out, people value speed, people value being able to innovate and people value being able to offload undifferentiated work. So Atlas is going on like gangbusters. Our India team has been crushing their numbers. So we're trying to expand that team as fast as possible, same in other parts of Southeast Asia. In China, obviously, we can't offer Atlas due to regulatory constraints. So we decided, as -- I think you may be aware that we have relationship with both Alibaba and Tencent. And Alibaba we are about in year two of that relationship and that relationship is going really, really well. And Tencent is just starting to heat up. As you know that there's some, the government there is taking -- there's a little bit more scrutiny about what the tech companies can do. But we're not seeing that in our business with those partners. And then, in terms of Latin America, while we don't have a huge present in Latin America, we're seeing a lot of demand. So we're trying to service that through our inside sales team and our self-serve channel and we're starting to deploy more resources in Latin America. So I would tell you that this market is very large and it's truly a global phenomenon. Thanks, Ittai. Well, I would say, obviously, it's a big market. So as you can imagine, our sales teams tend to go where the business is. We tend to not organize by verticals. But that's something that may change over time, as we see getting going deeper and accounts going deeper in financial services, going deeper into understanding their particular use cases can have disproportionate impact on our business. So that's something that we're contemplating. But I would say, in general, we're seeing strong across the Board performance. MongoDB is truly a horizontal solution and it's really a function of our coverage model and how many people we have in the region. And because they're organized geographically, they'll go after the opposite way, they think that they can have the quickest impact on. So, as you can imagine, companies that are more technology sophisticated tend to be really good customers of ours, because of companies who want to build their own custom applications tend to be really the customers ours. And obviously, every new SaaS company who's coming out, as we think about the tech stack, we want to be part of that tech stack. So we're spending a lot more focus on those companies, because as they grow, we're the beneficiaries of that growth. Yeah. So when -- if you talk to any developer, they will tell you that the most amount of time and effort that they spend on is working with data. So the database tends to be a place where they spend a particular amount of time and that's where they have the biggest challenges and that's where we see the biggest opportunity. So while they have to integrate with other solutions and they may have to build a range of microservices, every microservices, for example, will need a database. And so while applications are getting decomposed into smaller, smaller piece parts, like microservices, the database still plays a very, very important role. And so, yes, when a customer builds an application, they may tie into other services that the cloud provider may offer, but a big factor in terms of what application to build, how quickly they can innovate, how fast they can add features is directly correlated to what database they are using, which is why we win. And I would say that, to your second question, compared to the cloud providers, we have been competing with the largest companies in the world, obviously, Oracle and others in the early days and then the cloud providers, including Amazon and Azure, with their own competitive offerings for the longest time and we've held our own. And the reason we've held our own is that, we have built a very, very strong set of IP with the document model, it's proven to be the best way to work with data. Even though it's an open source product, we have a strong IP moat around it. So the cloud providers cannot just take our free version and compete with us, unlike a lot of other open source technologies. And with the success of Atlas, when we went public, there was some degree of skepticism by some investors about could we really compete by building our own cloud service going head-to-head with the cloud vendors. Well, I think the results speak for themselves. There aren't many businesses that are growing at over 80% that are at a $0.5 billion run rate and I think that speaks to the IP that we have, it speaks to the value that customers are getting and it speaks to our ability to execute. Thank you. I just want to leave you with a few comments. First, I think, what we really want to reinforce is that we believe customers realize that if they want to move fast MongoDB is the best way to do so. Second, Atlas' growth of 83% reinforced the point that customers want a multi-cloud platform that enables them to innovate quickly and outsource the undifferentiated heavy lifting of managing their data infrastructure. Third, we continued investing and evolving a go-to-market strategy across field sales, inside sales and sell the self-serve channels to capture this large market opportunity. And last but not least, we continue to rollout significant innovation to improve our platform through both ease-of-use and expansion of capabilities to encourage more and more customers to use MongoDB. So thank you for your time and we'll talk to you next quarter. Take care."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Denyeau from ICR. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrian Denyeau: Great. Thank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to review MongoDB\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2022 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining me on the call today are Dev Ittycheria, President and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB\u2019s COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, our financial guidance, our planned investments and anticipated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations as well as on our clients and the macroeconomic environment. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For discussion of the material risks and uncertainties could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our first quarter results before giving you a company update. Looking quickly at our first quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $181.6 million, a 39% year-over-year increase and above the high-end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 40% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew 73% year-over-year and now represents 51% of revenue and we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ended the quarter with over 26,800 customers. June marks the 5th anniversary of launching Atlas, our MongoDB database as a service offering. In Q1, Atlas reached a remarkable milestone, becoming the majority of revenue in just under 5 years. Deployed in over 80 regions around the world across AWS, Azure and GCP, Atlas is now in nearly $400 million revenue run rate business growing over 70% year-over-year. While we are proud of how quickly we have grown this business since its inception, we are confident that we've only scratched the surface of the opportunity ahead of us. As we look back at the first five years of Atlas, we see a story of innovation, aggressive investment and demonstrate ability to take smart risks, some of which seemed quite controversial at the time. We launched Atlas in June of 2016 as a self-serve only offering on AWS. Although in retrospect the decision to launch an independent database as a service business seemed like a no brainer. It wasn't obvious at the time, there was a fair amount of skepticism in the market, that an independent company could build a successful cloud service, while both partnering and competing with the hyperscale cloud vendors. A year later, we launched Atlas on Azure and GCP. Even though it was more work and added more expense to support all three cloud providers, we made this a priority as you understood from the outset that as the cloud became mainstream, customers would want a multi cloud solution. Due to the strong initial reception of Atlas in our direct sales channel, we invested aggressively to achieve feature parity between enterprise advanced and Atlas. We reached that milestone in mid 2018 ahead of our original schedule, and since then have led with innovation on Atlas. Our ability to quickly ship new features and get customer feedback has not only allowed us to innovate faster, but has also benefited our enterprise advance customers. From an outsider's perspective, one of the more controversial decisions we made was to change our license from AGPL to SSPL in 2018. Our objective was to remain true to our open source roots, while ensuring that you could build a meaningful database as a service business in the cloud era. While some suggested this will limit the adoption of MongoDB, we had conviction that we could better serve customers with this change. MongoDB's popularity with developers has only continued to grow after adopting SSPL. Given the success of Atlas, a number of open source companies have now switched to similar license structures. Around the same time we acquired mLab, which not only increased our scale in the cloud, but also increased our expertise in the self-serve channel. We uncovered a virtuous cycle between our field sales organization, our inside sales team, our customer success organization and our self-serve channel. Investments in any one area lead to the acceleration for the entire cycle. And this virtuous cycle has been a key enabler of our growth. To give you some context, the majority of Atlas revenue was originally sourced by our self-serve channel, but the majority of growth has come through the direct sales channel. In 2019, we acquired Realm, the world's leading independent mobile database, and now beta versions of Atlas search and Atlas data like. With these actions, we took the first steps to move from offering a database to becoming a comprehensive application data platform. Our expanded product vision was driven by a customer's desire to leverage MongoDB more broadly across their organization. In 2020, we continue to make changes that made it easier for customers to start using Atlas. These changes resulted in a big uptick in new customers, resulting over 25,000 customers of almost every size, and from nearly every geography and industry using Atlas today. Looking back at the first 5 years of Atlas, we see a few key lessons learned. First, while innovation, strong execution and unconventional thinking contributed to the growth of Atlas. None of this would have been possible without MongoDB's outstanding product market fit and a massive market, which is estimated by IDC to be 73 billion in 2021. With 175 million cumulative downloads, which over 70 million were in the last 12 months. MongoDB continues to be the world's most popular modern general purpose database. The popularity of MongoDB is the foundational pillar for the success of Atlas. Second, given the choice, customers would rather focus resources on building new applications and shipping new features quickly than spend time and resources on the undifferentiated heavy lifting of managing their distributed application data infrastructure. Third, multi cloud is proving to be even more important than we originally imagined. Customers have experienced firsthand that cloud providers do have outages. So building resilience across cloud providers is critical for many customers. Moreover, as cloud providers differentiate among themselves, being able to leverage different services from different cloud providers is something customers want to do. Finally, customers value solutions that make it easy to move from one cloud provider to another, reducing lock in with any one cloud vendor. As we look to the future, there are a number of reasons why you are bullish about our long-term prospects. First, we are seeing increased adoption, enterprise adoption of Atlas. In the first quarter, approximately two-thirds of new business one by our field sales team was Atlas, more than double the percentage from 2 years ago. Not only our customers choosing more of Atlas, they\u2019re building or moving mission critical workloads onto Atlas, which is the biggest driver of growth of our more than 1006 figure customers. Second, cloud partners are recognizing the value that MongoDB and Atlas bring to their own businesses. Using Q1 as an example, we had a record co-sell quarter with AWS, GCP and Alibaba. We are seeing increasing opportunities to expand ways we partner with cloud providers through both technical integrations as well as go-to-market initiatives to enable more customers around the world to derive the benefits of using MongoDB. Finally, our C level customer conversations indicate that our application data platform strategy is clearly resonating in the marketplace. Customers increasingly tell us that they prefer to standardize on a general purpose platform, rather than use a myriad of single function databases that add more cost and increase the complexity of running workloads in the cloud. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the first quarter. Commerce tools the leading next generation eCommerce platform, selected Atlas to power the world's most popular ecommerce sites used by over 200 leading global brands such as Audi, AT&T and Tiffany, commerce tools is now able to scale as platform and flexible API first approach to support the world's biggest retailers so they can design unique and seamless shopping experiences across all digital touch points. At the beginning of May, MongoDB and commerce tools help one of the world's largest toy companies launch a massive and highly anticipated campaign to millions of fans across the world without a hitch, UI Path, a leading enterprise automation software company offering an end-to-end automation platform that combines robotic process automation with a full suite of capabilities. To enable organizations to rapidly scale digital businesses -- business operations chose MongoDB as their underlying data persistence platform to increase efficiency for developers and accelerate time to market with new features and functionality. Leading provider of cloud based compliance solutions, Avalara is migrating from SQL server to MongoDB to support its complex data requirements, with more than 30,000 customers 95 countries, the company needs a database to keep up with billions of transactions as it rapidly scale this platform to support new industries, geographies and compliance services. One of the largest grocery chains in the world chose Atlas to strengthen its digital portfolio and scale its services across the eCommerce platform and in store offerings. The company which has more than 2,000 stores selected MongoDB to replace Cosmos DB after searching for a scalable solution with a flexible data model that will give us developers a richer feature set and better visibility to their data. Capital created by leading Japanese intercompany CyberAgent is a dating application with over 6 million registered users. The app which has made over 200 million matches since inception was deployed in Atlas for ease of use the capacity store 7.5 billion documents and the ability to upgrade very large clusters, while scaling to accommodate large user growth. In summary, we're off to a strong start in fiscal '22. With that, I'll turn it over to Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the first quarter both financially and operationally. I will begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results, and then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2022. First, I'll start with our first quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $181.6 million, up 39% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $174.6 million, up 40% year-over-year and professional services revenue was $7.1 million, up 29% year-over-year. Overall Atlases strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew 73% in the quarter compared to the previous year, and now represents 51% of total revenue compared to 42% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and 49% last quarter. As David discussed Atlases continued strong growth at increasing scale, reflected strong product market fit, our large market opportunity and the clear market shift among customers of all sizes towards a fully managed cloud database offering. Given that Atlas is now the majority of our revenue, and that we continue to expect it to grow as a percent of revenue. I thought it would be helpful to remind everyone how Atlas impacts are reported financials. First, Atlas revenue is recorded on a consumption basis and therefore varies with usage. Whereas enterprise advance include a term license component that is recognized upfront. So for a comparable dollar size contract, both enterprise and advanced Atlas will recognize the same amount of revenue over the contract term, but the Atlas contract will generate less initial revenue. Second, so self-serve Atlas customers and a growing portion of our direct sales Atlas customers do not pay us annually upfront, as is customary for enterprise advanced customers. We believe that payment and commitment flexibility facilitate outlets adoption and usage, which will ultimately maximize long-term revenues and cash flows. However, as a result, Atlas generates less deferred revenue and less upfront cash than enterprise advance. To illustrate this point, as of Q1, nearly 40% of our total ARR had little or no impact on our deferred revenue. Finally, Atlas has a lower overall gross margin the enterprise advanced because of its infrastructure component. That said, we've significantly reduced the margin difference between the two as Atlas is scaled. In addition, on an apples to Apple's functionality basis, Atlas is a creative dollars of gross profit. As a reminder, we do not try to influence which of our products customers choose. What we really care about is customers adopting and expanding their use of MongoDB. We're happy to have customers run MongoDB in whatever way best suits their IT strategy. And we expected enterprise advance will continue to grow, especially in regulated industries such as financial services and healthcare that are moving to the cloud at a more measured pace. During the first quarter, we grow our customer base by over 2,000 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 26,800 customers, which is up from over 18,400 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 3,300 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 2,200 in the year ago period. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform as well as self-service customers with whom we now have established a direct sales relationship. The growth of our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which have over 25,300 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 16,800 in the year ago period. It is important to keep in mind that growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB. In addition to existing enterprise advanced customers adding incremental Atlas workloads, We had another quarter with our net air expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,057 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 780 in the year-ago period. The continued strong growth in customers with $100,000 or more in ARR is an indication of the success of our land and expand go-to-market strategy and the fact that we are increasingly becoming a strategic partner and a database standard for our customers. Moving down the P&L, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $131.6 million, represent a gross margin of 72%, which is consistent with last quarter and down from 73% in the year ago period. Overall, we are pleased that our gross margin performance, which is only seeing a modest impact from Atlas as it becomes a bigger portion of our revenue. Despite its infrastructure component. We've had good success driving greater efficiency as Atlas scales to minimize the gross margin impact. We continue to expect that we'll see some modest reduction in overall company gross margin as Atlas continues to grow as a percent of total revenue. Our operating loss was $8.4 million and negative 5% operating margin for the first quarter compared to a negative 6% margin in the year ago period or outperformance or operating loss guidance was driven primarily by revenue outperformance. Net loss in the first quarter was $9.5 million or 0.15 a share based on $61.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $7.3 million or $0.13 a share on $57.6 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $935.6 million and cash, cash equivalents short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was positive $10.2 million driven by strong collections following record q4 sales results after taking into consideration approximately $1.8 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities. free cash flow was positive $8.4 million again the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $8.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 Despite the stronger-than-expected Q1, we continue to expect that we will burn cash in full fiscal year 2022. As we continue to invest significantly in the business. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2022. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $180 million to $183 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $24 million to $22 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.40. Based on 62.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2022, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $771 million to $784 million. For the full fiscal year 2022, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $76 million to $68 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.25. Based on 62.6 million weighted average shares outstanding. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent first quarter results. We are driving high levels of growth at scale, driven by our exceptional product market fit and customers demand for a modern application data platform. We continue investing to capture the large opportunity ahead of us. We're seeing attractive returns on those investments and are excited about our positioning for the future. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions. Actually wanted to start with a pretty high level question, just given on the traction that you're seeing what that was in the cloud. And also in terms of the customer counts. Dev, do you have a goal in mind in terms of where MongoDB can get to? I mean, is 100,000 customers possible if you look at some of the modern software companies, I think it's last year it was like north of 200,000, a Datadog, which is a little bit younger company than you guys are sort of getting 15,000 to 20,000 -- [indiscernible] at 20,000? What do you think from a customer base perspective MongoDB can ultimately get to?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, as we said many, many times, we're going after one of the largest markets in enterprise software. And while obviously most of the dollars per customer are in the time of the can what I call the global 2,000. So obviously, there's only 2,000 of those customers. There's a massive opportunity to grow the long tail. And so while I don't want to speculate on what the high-end of the number could be, I think that number could easily be a lot higher than this today. And potentially even six figures, but at this point, we're not constrained by market, it's more about our operational capability and how quickly we can scale the business.\nSanjit Singh: Got it. And then as a follow-up, if we sort of get your latest views on the demand environment. As we come out of pandemic, you guys did a really good job more or less sustaining growth in the back half of last year, given what you're seeing in terms of new projects than digital more applications being rolled out. Is there a potential for growth to accelerate coming in the back half? Or is it more of a sustained growth framework on that you're thinking about as we go into the rest of [indiscernible]?\nDev Ittycheria: As Michael noted, we are raising our guidance for the year. So we feel pretty good about the demand environment. We think that as customers recognize their need to be digital first, due to the pandemic, it's not like they're going to suddenly say, well, I'm going to go back to my more costly and more inefficient distribution channels, I think they're going to recognize that having a strong digital presence is critical to growing their business. And when they step back and think about how they drive their business, every company is not thinking about using software and data as a competitive advantage. That means every company is thinking about how can they drive the productivity of sales force developers, and every company is thinking about, how can I -- I can't buy my competitive advantage, I got to build it. And so I think that positions us well for the future as people as customers and organizations come out of the pandemic.\nSanjit Singh: Excellent. Appreciate the thought, Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Sanjit.\nOperator: The next question will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: And congratulations from me as well. Amazing quarter. First question, I had two questions. One was on the relationship between EA and direct. If I look at this quarter that we'd like, lots and lots of momentum around direct, while EA is like kind of like, a little bit in the background. Is that kind of way how you see it as well playing out in the future? So in other words, have customers kind of fully realized they should be in the cloud and that's kind of the path forward? Or is there kind of a delay effect of EA potentially coming back a little bit more in the second half of the year and the next year? And then second question is on self-service.. And as we are coming out of the pandemic, do you think self-service will start picking up again, as kind of developers have a little bit more money? Or is it all going to be direct going forward? Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Raimo. So on the first part of your question about the relationship between our sales force and EA, I would just tell you that we are not prescriptive about what products to sell to customers. We basically want to serve the customers the best way that they want to be served. And so for some customers that they still have a very measured approach to moving to the cloud, others are going much more aggressively to the cloud. And we obviously have offerings for both sets of customers. I will tell you that we clearly see the high-end of the market getting very, very comfortable moving mission critical workloads to the cloud, and in particular to obviously to Atlas. And so one of the comments I made in the prepared remarks is that the majority of our six figure customers are now -- those are Atlas only accounts. And so that tells you a lot about the sophistication of our customers who are using Atlas at the high-end. And again, I think there's always going to be some seasonality that mix between Atlas and EA and we are still believers that EA is going to grow healthily over the long-term. And then with regards to self-service, self-service is a very, very important channel. One of the things I -- one of the comments I made in the prepared remarks was to basically explain that the majority of source revenue for Atlas came from the self-serve channel, not just customers, but revenue. Now the majority of the growth came from our sales force. So self-serve is a very healthy part of our business. And we see a nice flywheel effect between self-serve and direct sales. And so I don't want you to think that because what you -- when you look at the numbers, think like the self-serve business is not growing. What happens is that our sales force is now very adept at basically picking off the highest quality self-serve accounts and growing those accounts that much more quickly. So the self-serve channel is paying huge dividends for us. And we're investing in all parts of the business.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you and congrats.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Hynes with Canaccord. Please go ahead.\nDavid Hynes: Hey, thanks, guys. Great set of numbers here. Michael, I'm going to start with you. I feel silly asking this coming off of a 73% growth quarter. And I know it's clearly not contemplated in the guide. But it's possible that Atlas could accelerate further from here as we lap quarters a year ago, where expansion was coming under pressure during COVID.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. Thanks for the question. So when I think about it, I would go back to what Dev said. We really think about the business from a channel basis. And I think that this is important to sort of underscore, especially for people who haven't been following the story closely. And so when you think about the channel, we've got the self-serve channel, which is almost entirely Atlas, and has [indiscernible], and we've got a bunch of disclosure around that. And then there's the direct sales channel. Direct sales channel, really you can think of as having two main components, sort of a midmarket component, and then a field component, higher enterprise component. What we've seen is that midmarket component is also almost entirely Atlas. And one of the biggest factors when you think about what will the Atlas trajectory look like, over time is how rapidly does the field enterprise channel adopt public cloud, right, and we sort of said for a while, that's the biggest swing factor overall in terms of the Atlas numbers. Clearly, you can see in the mix of results from Q1, in some of the vignettes that Dev shared in terms of the narrative, it was a very strong quarter for Atlas, when you look at the mix of deals in the enterprise channel, roughly two thirds of the new business was coming from Atlas, which is a very significant kind of high watermark. And so that has impact as we talked about in terms of the financials in terms of not having term license revenue and other things like that sort of factors in to the rest of the year. And so I think that's how we have to think about it. It's really ultimately will depend on what your assumption is around that. We do think over the long-term it will trend, but really in Q1 is more of a mix of deals issue.\nDavid Hynes: Yes, yes. Okay. That's helpful color. And then Dev, the follow-up. As we think about the introduction of new functionality over time and how you take that to market, do you think there are capabilities that may come in the form of new SKUs? Or should we expect the innovation to be more aimed at kind of differentiating the core offering? I think of like [indiscernible] search and what you did there. Just trying to think about kind of the longer term monetization of R&D efforts.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so that's a great question, David. What I would tell you is today, our focus is really about innovating at the core. And then our new products are all about finding new ways to acquire new customers, and as well as expanding the lifetime value of our existing customers. And so today, the revenue does show up mainly in Atlas versus separate SKU, but you should not assume that that'll be the case long-term. We have a pretty aggressive innovative agenda -- innovation agenda. And so, over time you'll see us add more products and more SKUs.\nDavid Hynes: Yes, very helpful. Thanks, guys. Congrats.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Dev, from a high level, is there any way to know how much of what your customers are spending with you is net new budget versus what's being reallocated from legacy relational databases?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, I would say that, as companies recognize that at the heart of their value proposition is how effectively they use software and data, I have to believe that their investments in building software applications is growing over time. Now, we believe that applications have a certain lifespan, depending on the application could be as short as 3, 4 years. It could be as long as 15, 20 years. And so applications have a natural retirement rate. Now there could be situations where applications are just not serving the business or the end users effectively. And so people may decide that there's some changes that need to be made more quickly. And so it's hard for us to suss out all the time, like all these net new budgets versus existing budgets. What we recognize is that we have to make a compelling business case. And so our sales organization is quite adept at just making sure that as -- whenever you get a six figure deal, someone's got to justify that expenditure. It's just no one's is going to hand someone a six figure check. And so that either is about advancing the business forward or reducing costs and existing infrastructure, what have you. And so we typically ensure that our -- that we've built a compelling business case for customer decide to choose MongoDB. And so the business case is compelling. There'll be dolls available, even if it's stealing [indiscernible] from existing budgets.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, I would say add, Brad, so away from budget because that's a little bit hard for us to have perfect visibility on. We have pretty consistently seen that about a quarter of the enterprise advance wins are relational migrations, that number is lower on Atlas, because Atlas tends to be new applications as people are adopting the cloud. But that's been a pretty consistent number that we've seen.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: The next question will come from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question here. Dev, I wanted to drill down into kind of this 5-year anniversary of Atlas. Clearly you\u2019re messaging kind of a milestone shift and enterprise interest in the platform. Could you talk a little bit about maybe the number of $100,000 Atlas customers, are you seeing any $1 million plus Atlas customers yet? Clearly, it sounds like it's starting to really resonate with enterprises. But any additional color you could talk about relative to the size of some of these Atlas enterprise deployments would be helpful. And then one quick follow-up for Mike.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. The six figure related customer count grew quite handily from last quarter to this quarter and a big driver of that was Atlas. And so we see a number of not only six figure customers on Atlas, but we also see quite a large number of seven figure customers in Atlas. So you should be -- there should be no misunderstanding. People are building and deploying very sophisticated complex mission critical workloads on Atlas. And Atlas has really proven just by the ubiquity of its reach. We're in over 80 regions around the world. So we are by definition, because you run across AWS, Azure and GCP, we're the most widely -- geographically widely available database as a service offering in the market. Some of the capabilities we recently introduced like global clusters, so customers can run the same workload across two different cloud providers, something no one else can do. And there's a whole bunch of other capabilities around data partitioning, privacy and security that not many people can do. So people run very, very sophisticated workloads on Atlas. And I think you're seeing the results of the enterprise, and the high-end of the market recognizing that and more workloads moving on to Atlas.\nMichael Gordon: And Brent, Dev, sort of alluded to this, but just to give you the stats, so it's clear for everyone. 60% -- roughly 60% of our customers at that $100,000 or greater mark, have Atlas spend above that level, right. So that doesn't mean that they have only Atlas spend, they may have Atlas NDA, but 60% of the customers over that $100,000 threshold have Atlas spend that would qualify them alone for above that level.\nBrent Bracelin: [Technical difficulty] for you on -- I believe yet you're talking about record partner revenue contribution, I think it was from Alibaba, was that just MongoDB as a service? Was it predominantly Alibaba? Were there other MongoDB as a service partners there? Just clarify what that record was and what you're referencing relative to kind of the strength you saw on Alibaba and others in the quarter?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. We saw a huge increase in joint wins with -- to be clear, not just with Alibaba, but with Amazon and GCP as well. And with Alibaba, it is not Atlas, because due to the regulatory environment in China, we cannot offer Atlas directly. So we partner with both Alibaba and Tencent. We started with Alibaba first. And what we have done is repurpose some of our local sales team in China to really enable the Alibaba organization to more effectively position and articulate the value proposition of MongoDB. And that's we're seeing the results. They're getting impacted quite positively very, very. In the short timeframe, we've done that, so much so that even Alibaba is investing more and building a center of excellence around MongoDB. So we feel really good about what's happening with Alibaba. Tencent, we're in the early days. And our plan is to do the same there in terms of operationalizing their capabilities to sell MongoDB as a service to their customers as well.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color, and good to see them around here. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Brent.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jason Adder with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJason Ader: Yes. Thank you. Dev, you talked about your portability value proposition. And I'm just wondering, have you seen any noticeable change from your customer base on how they're viewing databases from cloud providers like AWS and Azure, just in terms of that cloud lock in risk? And then does it differ by the size of customer? In other words, larger customers tend to be more worried about it. Any color there would be great.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So what I will tell you is that one of the compelling value props of MongoDB is you can run MongoDB anywhere. And what that really means is you don't have to rewrite one line of code, whether you run it in your own data center, you manage yourself in the cloud, or use it as a service across AWS, GCP or Azure. And so that becomes a pretty compelling value proposition because as we all know, business conditions change. Cloud providers are differentiating among themselves, offering price concessions or new capabilities that customers want to take advantage of. And what they don't want to do is be locked into any one environment. In terms of competition, we have been competing with offerings, clone offerings from Amazon and from Azure. And obviously, all the cloud providers do offer some types of database services. So there's also other competition available and our win rates against them is exceptionally high. The clones are compromised, because they're not built on the same architecture as MongoDB. They're built on relational back end. So they're compromised in terms of features and performance. And we will go toe to toe with any relational database, because we know the superiority of our architecture, the scalability of our platform and the ability for customers to move much more quickly on MongoDB versus any other solution. So we feel pretty good about the competitive environment today.\nJason Ader: And a quick follow-up for Michael. Michael, the operating margin guidance for the year, does that assume that your expenses are going to be kind of back to normal as we come out of COVID?\nMichael Gordon: Yes, we talked about in the March call was that we assumed a significant resumption of expenses that were not realized in the context of COVID mostly sort of office and travel related. And I think we'd quantified those in the back half of the year, roughly $20 million to $25 million. And so see no reason for change on that based on kind of the global situation related to the pandemic.\nJason Ader: Great. Thank you guys.\nOperator: The next question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nDev Ittycheria: Hi, Kash. Operator, we might \u2026\nOperator: Perhaps you have been muted, sir. And the next question will come from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please go ahead.\nKarl Keirstead: Oh, thank you. Maybe one for Dev, one for Michael. Dev, I'm just wondering if you could comment on the pace at which the firm was able to add quota carrying reps during the quarter and whether the performance during the quarter has changed your hiring plans for the full year. And then maybe, Michael, when you were providing Q1 guidance 3 months ago, you did mention that I think it was on the EA side of rev rec 606 related issue that might cause subscription revs to be down sequentially. It clearly wasn't, but I'm wondering if whether that issue that was on your mind transpired and was simply offset by goodness elsewhere? Maybe you could comment on that. Thanks so much.\nDev Ittycheria: Karl, I'll take the first question regarding the pace of hiring. We're trying to hire salespeople as fast as possible. The main reason being we're going after a really big market. And, frankly, in enterprise sales, you have to show up to win, right. And so we know when we go head to head against the competitors for the last question asked that our win rates are exceptionally high. But you do have to show up to win. And there's many areas of the world that we're really under penetrated. And so we want to hire salespeople to make sure that we can go after those opportunities, but it's not just simply as hiring like 500,000 salespeople in one quarter. You have to make sure you have the right supporting infrastructure in place in terms of sales management, pre-sales technical skills, the right enablement, sufficient ramp time, etcetera. So there's a whole operation that we have to kind of make sure that we have the right support structure to make those salespeople successful. But we're being very aggressive in terms of hiring salespeople as fast as possible. Michael, I think the second question was for you.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So on the variability, we will see variability quarter-to-quarter based on the mix of deals and that does have revenue implications given the term license component under 606 for enterprise advance. I would generally characterize the quarter as good for both EA and Atlas. EA had a particularly difficult compare given the lumpiness of the term license recognition in the base period. But generally it was a strong quarter on both products and on EA was a particularly good quarter on relational migrations.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Okay, helpful. Thank you both.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Karl.\nOperator: The next question will come from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.\nTyler Radke: Thanks for taking my question. It looks like you're starting to see a lot more success selling Atlas directly into your large customers. And Dev, I think you referenced a Cosmos DB deal that you display. So I'm curious kind of how the competitive landscape may differ relative to EA when you are selling those Atlas deals to large enterprises? Do you find you're displacing a cloud native solution. And if so, kind of curious who you're running into most frequently?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, obviously, you have to remember that if someone's going to choose Atlas, by definition, they've already chosen MongoDB because Atlas is the -- obviously the service offering that underlies MongoDB. What I will tell you is actually this is that one of the real advantages of MongoDB is the ability to scale your application through something that's called sharding. When customers try and do that themselves on their own premise, we find that some customers get intimidated by the fact that they can -- how quickly they can scale the environment, or they may not have sufficient compute capacity to scale their environment as quickly as they want. When you move to the cloud and by definition, you now have elastic capacity, it becomes much easier to leverage the power of MongoDB in a cloud world. The distributed capabilities, the ability to easily shard data, the ability to use capabilities to partition data, whether it's for privacy and security regulations around data in different parts of the world, or whether it's for performance, moving some data closer to end -- some end users in different parts of the world, all this capabilities gets far better exposed in Atlas than someone trying to do that in their own data centers. So that's the added benefit of customers -- the customers see by running these mission critical workloads on Atlas.\nTyler Radke: Great. And a follow-up maybe for Michael or you Dev. So during the pandemic, you obviously invested pretty aggressively in sales headcount. I think, in the first half of last year, sales and marketing headcount grew close to 60%. I'm curious just how the ramp of those reps have gone. Obviously, it's probably a lot different getting those folks up and running in a remote environment. But maybe if you could just comment on the ramp time of those sales reps and kind of the percentage of your sales reps that are fully ramped at this point.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So what I will tell you is that we recognized very early on that once everyone's working in this virtual world, one of the biggest -- the one of the most -- typically one of the most fragile parts of any sales organization is your new reps, those reps for ramping. I haven't closed any business and they're obviously nervous about putting up numbers on the scoreboard. We went on our way to really ensure that we provided the right level of enablement, the right level support, and so on so forth to help those reps ramp as quickly as possible. And in general, the ramping of the new reps is in line with our expectations. And we're putting a lot of focus there. We do it actually for employees across all functions, not just sales. But we have a particular focus on salespeople, because by definition, we need them to produce in a certain timeframe. And so there's a lot of focus on making sure that our reps are ramping. We have different levels of training from boot camps, advanced sales training, to specialized product training to ongoing product updates as well as a lot of inspection by sales leadership in terms of their activity and the quality of their pipeline, and so on so forth. So we have a lot of measures in place to ensure that we can really track is a sales rep ramping appropriately given their time and tenure in the field. The same -- we do the same thing for our inside salespeople. We assume obviously a short ramp for inside salespeople. But in general, we've really instrumented our sales process to identify where people may be at risk and put in remediation of the programs in place as soon as possible.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, the only other thing I'd add, Tyler is we're consistently looking to expand the sales force to Dev's earlier comments given how thin our footprint coverage is, relative to the magnitude of our market opportunity. And we tend to be operationally constrained in terms of how much we can add. Obviously, if there are [indiscernible] locations, pandemic or otherwise, where we can incrementally or opportunistically add even faster, we will go do that. But that's been sort of a long and I think will be a long focus area, given the magnitude of our opportunity.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Jack Andrews with Needham. Please go ahead.\nJack Andrews: Thanks and congratulations on the results. Dev, I was wondering if you could provide an update in terms of how the global size might be helping you. You've talked in the past that a number of them have been building MongoDB practices. So could you maybe frame for us, is there -- what proportion of deals that they might be factoring in today? And I'm also just wondering, are they helping you to gain access to more of these C level conversations you're having over time?\nDev Ittycheria: Right. So there's a quite a synergistic relationship between MongoDB and the SIs because in many cases, the SIs act as either the company's development arm or augment their existing development organization. So by definition, they're the developers of the applications and they're the ones using MongoDB to build those applications. The SIs are also building cloud migration factories. Their practices in that area to help customers migrate workloads from on-premise to the cloud. And so, so we're involved working with a number of large size people like Accenture, TCS, Cap gems -- Capgemini, Infosys, etcetera. Working with them, they have different programs by organization. Essentially has their a MongoDB accelerator program, the Capgemini and TCS have different programs focused on different verticals. We also work with, frankly, some boutique asides, who have expertise, deep expertise in MongoDB, or perhaps deep expertise in mobile or deep expertise, in particular vertical or particular geography. And so we work with boutique SIs as well, if the situation warrant. So, I would say in general the SIs are that business overall is growing, but there's plenty more to do. And one of the challenges of working with these larger sides is that they're very decentralized. So even though you may have success in one geography or even one account doesn't mean that translates very, very quickly across the entire organization. But as we get more credibility as we are more wins as our reputation gets stronger, we're seeing these SIs come to us to work with us and more and more opportunities.\nJack Andrews: First, great. Thanks for the color.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nFred Havemeyer: Okay. Thank you, Dev. Similar to the SI question with the pan [ph] on ISVs, could you give an update on how your ISV ecosystem is progressing? And then also how you're seeing MongoDB adoption among ISV is trending between adoption of either Atlas or other offerings?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, in the prepared remarks you talked about commerce tools, which is just nice to be really helping retailers and so we're having a lot of success with them. There's a number of other ISVs that we work with. We, in fact, have a dedicated sales team now that's pursuing ISVs. And it's really a two step sales process. One is a sell two [ph] process where we get the -- either the CTO, the CEO, or like the Chief Product officer, or their teams to think about building their new version of their product or re-platform existing product off a legacy database onto MongoDB. And then the second step is then working with them to go close their first set of customers, and then we're the beneficiary of their growth. So that there's a team that's dedicated on doing that. And I don't have our IC count in front of me, but it's numbers in the hundreds. And that's a big opportunity for us. And you're going to see us put more focus, time and resources, serving ISVs.\nFred Havemeyer: Thank you. And then just a follow-up. So during the prepared remarks, you also mentioned about how UiPath is using MongoDB for its persistence layer. And I'd like to dig into that a little bit more depth here. We've seen tech companies talking about low code, no code a lot recently. Something like a 1,000%, more than last year when they last measured it. And we certainly picked up on low code and no code company using MongoDB in addition to what UiPath is doing. Can you talk to us about why you think or why you're seeing the low code and no code vendors choosing your database. And generally what that means for your overall organization, go to market as the platform is kind of catch on or wrap up.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, it's, I would say, in general, we see ISVs. And obviously, there's a segment of them being low code or no code, vendors are using who choosing MongoDB. One because of the data model. The document data model, we would argue quite convincingly I would add is that is the best way to work with data. The flexibility of the data model allows you to really manage data the way developers think in code. Also allows you to make changes very, very easily. So if you talk to anyone who's worked with relational databases, by the time the application gets past rev 1, or rev 2, the data model gets very brittle. And it becomes much harder to make ongoing changes. You do not have that problem with MongoDB. The second point is that MongoDB is by definition, the most distributed and scalable platform available. It was built from the ground up to be a distributed data platform. And so ISVs really appreciate that because they serve a myriad of customers. And so they want a platform that can scale. And the third thing is that the MongoDB can run anywhere. It's not a cloud only platform, it's not an on-premise only platform. So depending on the ISVs business model, they can deploy it as ShrinkWrap software. They can offer it as a service in the cloud, or anything in between. And so MongoDB enables them to maintain a whole host of options. And that's why I think you see ISVs choosing MongoDB.\nFred Havemeyer: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Congratulations on a wonderful quarter, and especially the cloud traction you're getting. Dev, I wanted to just get your perspective on incrementally speaking, as the economy opens up, you've been very successfully operating and producing results in a virtual setting. As we open up, what are the incremental opportunities that MongoDB can take advantage of, that you couldn't with the virtual setting during the pandemic. Thank you so much once again.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Kash. I think we said this last year, and we said I think even more most recently in the last quarter. While we've done well, during the pandemic, we do believe that COVID has been a slight headwind to our business. We know that there's still an enormous amount of deal scrutiny, especially on big deals. We know that approvals still take a long time to get done. We know that if customers are worried about the health of their business, there'll be cautious about making investments in their business with new technology. So as the world opens up, we believe that people will have even more confidence and more conviction in using MongoDB. And we think we're well-positioned because what the pandemic did tell us is that those companies who are adept at using software and data thrive because everyone have to become digital first. And so proficiency and using the software and data and I've said in the past, you can't buy your competitive advantage, you have to build it yourself. And so that means you need to be very proficient in building applications that truly transform your business, adding features quickly, being able to respond to new opportunities and new threats. And so MongoDB is a great platform for enabling you to do that in a very flexible and scalable way. So we think we're well-positioned as the world opens up, and people run the business, leveraging software and data.\nKash Rangan: Wonderful. Thank you so much. Congrats again.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Kash.\nOperator: The next question will come from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nJoey Marincek: Thank you so much. This is Joey Marincek on for Pat. Just one from us. It's great to see the momentum you're having with the cloud providers. But I'm just curious, how do you think about the pace of adoption and penetration you can achieve in international markets [technical difficulty] seeing with Alibaba, a partnership with [technical difficulty] and cloud partnerships that you announced as well are both based outside the U.S. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, So, I just want to make it clear. Atlas is available in 80 regions around the world. It's not just domestic offerings. So we leverage the points of presence of AWS, GCP, and Azure all around the world. And so pretty much in almost every market except China. Atlas is available, with a few other exceptions. And so we have a very wide global reach. What we do recognize is that certain regional players have deep customer relationships, or in some cases like in China and other places like Russia, there may be regulatory issues where we can't offer Atlas directly. And so by definition, we have to partner with a local provider to enable customers to drive the benefits of MongoDB. So I would say our international presence is very strong. We have thousands of international customers. And we partner with other providers when we don't believe we can serve the entire market ourselves through Atlas. And we've done that with people like OVH in Europe, and the cloud provider in Korea and other places around the world. Any other questions?\nOperator: And the next question will come from Matthew Broome with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Broome: Hi. Thanks very much. So, just in terms of your enterprise advanced customers, to what extent are you thinking about potentially promoting or accelerating the migration of those accounts to outlets where it makes sense to do so? And thus enable them to start receiving the benefits of database as a service.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so our philosophy is to enable customers to run MongoDB anywhere and it really depends on the customer's choice about where they want to run the workloads and why? And so for many reasons, customers are happy to self manage MongoDB themselves using enterprise advanced either managing those workloads in their own data center, or self managing those workloads in the cloud. And so we're not trying to convince every customer that Atlas is the right solution. We're not at all prescriptive about how customers choose MongoDB. We just want to make sure that the needs get -- gets served the best way they see fit. And Atlas obviously has been a great boon to our business in terms of the growth and our ability to innovate on Atlas, being a cloud service is that much easier, because we can ship features more quickly. And we can get feedback more quickly. And those the benefits of that innovation then get driven to our EA [ph] customer. So EA customers also benefit from the innovations from Atlas.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, we just add, given that we are effectively sales capacity constrained, it is much better to have the sales folks be paying attention to winning new workloads, rather than taking an existing workload that we've already won, moving it from EA to Atlas, unless it's important to the customer and their IT strategy.\nMatthew Broome: Okay, I, see. Thanks. And then on -- just as Atlas continues to scale, to what extent do you expect to be able to drive some upsides of gross margins via sort of negotiating better economics with your hyperscale cloud partners?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So, I think we've continued to do that over the last several years. And certainly, if you'd ask me, at the time of the IPO, and so that was a big majority of the revenue where do you think gross margins will be I would have guessed a lower number. And so we've out executed relative to sort of the plan and the expectations. There still is a difference. We can't make the infrastructure component zero. So there will be a gross margin difference, but we have made good progress and will continue to turn the various efficiency in the optimization dials and levers that come across a number of flavors.\nMatthew Broome: Perfect, thanks. Thanks very much.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Dev Ittycheria for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Chuck. I just want to again summarize that we're off to a strong start in fiscal '22. Again, with 39% year-over-year revenue growth driven by 73% growth in Atlas. We're seeing strong traction for Atlas in the enterprise channel as customers want a platform that enables them to innovate and scale quickly. And third, our application data platform strategy is resonating in the marketplace as customers see MongoDB's superior document data model as a viable solution for an increasing number of use cases. So we feel very good about the future. So thank you for everyone for joining us, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Take care.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the first quarter both financially and operationally. I will begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results, and then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2022. First, I'll start with our first quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $181.6 million, up 39% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $174.6 million, up 40% year-over-year and professional services revenue was $7.1 million, up 29% year-over-year. Overall Atlases strong performance continues to be the largest contributor to our growth. Atlas grew 73% in the quarter compared to the previous year, and now represents 51% of total revenue compared to 42% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and 49% last quarter. As David discussed Atlases continued strong growth at increasing scale, reflected strong product market fit, our large market opportunity and the clear market shift among customers of all sizes towards a fully managed cloud database offering. Given that Atlas is now the majority of our revenue, and that we continue to expect it to grow as a percent of revenue. I thought it would be helpful to remind everyone how Atlas impacts are reported financials. First, Atlas revenue is recorded on a consumption basis and therefore varies with usage. Whereas enterprise advance include a term license component that is recognized upfront. So for a comparable dollar size contract, both enterprise and advanced Atlas will recognize the same amount of revenue over the contract term, but the Atlas contract will generate less initial revenue. Second, so self-serve Atlas customers and a growing portion of our direct sales Atlas customers do not pay us annually upfront, as is customary for enterprise advanced customers. We believe that payment and commitment flexibility facilitate outlets adoption and usage, which will ultimately maximize long-term revenues and cash flows. However, as a result, Atlas generates less deferred revenue and less upfront cash than enterprise advance. To illustrate this point, as of Q1, nearly 40% of our total ARR had little or no impact on our deferred revenue. Finally, Atlas has a lower overall gross margin the enterprise advanced because of its infrastructure component. That said, we've significantly reduced the margin difference between the two as Atlas is scaled. In addition, on an apples to Apple's functionality basis, Atlas is a creative dollars of gross profit. As a reminder, we do not try to influence which of our products customers choose. What we really care about is customers adopting and expanding their use of MongoDB. We're happy to have customers run MongoDB in whatever way best suits their IT strategy. And we expected enterprise advance will continue to grow, especially in regulated industries such as financial services and healthcare that are moving to the cloud at a more measured pace. During the first quarter, we grow our customer base by over 2,000 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 26,800 customers, which is up from over 18,400 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 3,300 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 2,200 in the year ago period. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform as well as self-service customers with whom we now have established a direct sales relationship. The growth of our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which have over 25,300 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 16,800 in the year ago period. It is important to keep in mind that growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB. In addition to existing enterprise advanced customers adding incremental Atlas workloads, We had another quarter with our net air expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,057 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 780 in the year-ago period. The continued strong growth in customers with $100,000 or more in ARR is an indication of the success of our land and expand go-to-market strategy and the fact that we are increasingly becoming a strategic partner and a database standard for our customers. Moving down the P&L, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $131.6 million, represent a gross margin of 72%, which is consistent with last quarter and down from 73% in the year ago period. Overall, we are pleased that our gross margin performance, which is only seeing a modest impact from Atlas as it becomes a bigger portion of our revenue. Despite its infrastructure component. We've had good success driving greater efficiency as Atlas scales to minimize the gross margin impact. We continue to expect that we'll see some modest reduction in overall company gross margin as Atlas continues to grow as a percent of total revenue. Our operating loss was $8.4 million and negative 5% operating margin for the first quarter compared to a negative 6% margin in the year ago period or outperformance or operating loss guidance was driven primarily by revenue outperformance. Net loss in the first quarter was $9.5 million or 0.15 a share based on $61.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $7.3 million or $0.13 a share on $57.6 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $935.6 million and cash, cash equivalents short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was positive $10.2 million driven by strong collections following record q4 sales results after taking into consideration approximately $1.8 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities. free cash flow was positive $8.4 million again the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $8.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 Despite the stronger-than-expected Q1, we continue to expect that we will burn cash in full fiscal year 2022. As we continue to invest significantly in the business. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2022. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $180 million to $183 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $24 million to $22 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.40. Based on 62.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2022, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $771 million to $784 million. For the full fiscal year 2022, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be $76 million to $68 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.25. Based on 62.6 million weighted average shares outstanding. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent first quarter results. We are driving high levels of growth at scale, driven by our exceptional product market fit and customers demand for a modern application data platform. We continue investing to capture the large opportunity ahead of us. We're seeing attractive returns on those investments and are excited about our positioning for the future. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Yes. Thanks for the question. So when I think about it, I would go back to what Dev said. We really think about the business from a channel basis. And I think that this is important to sort of underscore, especially for people who haven't been following the story closely. And so when you think about the channel, we've got the self-serve channel, which is almost entirely Atlas, and has [indiscernible], and we've got a bunch of disclosure around that. And then there's the direct sales channel. Direct sales channel, really you can think of as having two main components, sort of a midmarket component, and then a field component, higher enterprise component. What we've seen is that midmarket component is also almost entirely Atlas. And one of the biggest factors when you think about what will the Atlas trajectory look like, over time is how rapidly does the field enterprise channel adopt public cloud, right, and we sort of said for a while, that's the biggest swing factor overall in terms of the Atlas numbers. Clearly, you can see in the mix of results from Q1, in some of the vignettes that Dev shared in terms of the narrative, it was a very strong quarter for Atlas, when you look at the mix of deals in the enterprise channel, roughly two thirds of the new business was coming from Atlas, which is a very significant kind of high watermark. And so that has impact as we talked about in terms of the financials in terms of not having term license revenue and other things like that sort of factors in to the rest of the year. And so I think that's how we have to think about it. It's really ultimately will depend on what your assumption is around that. We do think over the long-term it will trend, but really in Q1 is more of a mix of deals issue. Yes, I would say add, Brad, so away from budget because that's a little bit hard for us to have perfect visibility on. We have pretty consistently seen that about a quarter of the enterprise advance wins are relational migrations, that number is lower on Atlas, because Atlas tends to be new applications as people are adopting the cloud. But that's been a pretty consistent number that we've seen. And Brent, Dev, sort of alluded to this, but just to give you the stats, so it's clear for everyone. 60% -- roughly 60% of our customers at that $100,000 or greater mark, have Atlas spend above that level, right. So that doesn't mean that they have only Atlas spend, they may have Atlas NDA, but 60% of the customers over that $100,000 threshold have Atlas spend that would qualify them alone for above that level. Yes, we talked about in the March call was that we assumed a significant resumption of expenses that were not realized in the context of COVID mostly sort of office and travel related. And I think we'd quantified those in the back half of the year, roughly $20 million to $25 million. And so see no reason for change on that based on kind of the global situation related to the pandemic. Yes. So on the variability, we will see variability quarter-to-quarter based on the mix of deals and that does have revenue implications given the term license component under 606 for enterprise advance. I would generally characterize the quarter as good for both EA and Atlas. EA had a particularly difficult compare given the lumpiness of the term license recognition in the base period. But generally it was a strong quarter on both products and on EA was a particularly good quarter on relational migrations. Yes, the only other thing I'd add, Tyler is we're consistently looking to expand the sales force to Dev's earlier comments given how thin our footprint coverage is, relative to the magnitude of our market opportunity. And we tend to be operationally constrained in terms of how much we can add. Obviously, if there are [indiscernible] locations, pandemic or otherwise, where we can incrementally or opportunistically add even faster, we will go do that. But that's been sort of a long and I think will be a long focus area, given the magnitude of our opportunity. Yes, we just add, given that we are effectively sales capacity constrained, it is much better to have the sales folks be paying attention to winning new workloads, rather than taking an existing workload that we've already won, moving it from EA to Atlas, unless it's important to the customer and their IT strategy."

            "name": "Dev Ittycheria",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our first quarter results before giving you a company update. Looking quickly at our first quarter financial results, we generated revenue of $181.6 million, a 39% year-over-year increase and above the high-end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 40% year-over-year. Atlas revenue grew 73% year-over-year and now represents 51% of revenue and we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ended the quarter with over 26,800 customers. June marks the 5th anniversary of launching Atlas, our MongoDB database as a service offering. In Q1, Atlas reached a remarkable milestone, becoming the majority of revenue in just under 5 years. Deployed in over 80 regions around the world across AWS, Azure and GCP, Atlas is now in nearly $400 million revenue run rate business growing over 70% year-over-year. While we are proud of how quickly we have grown this business since its inception, we are confident that we've only scratched the surface of the opportunity ahead of us. As we look back at the first five years of Atlas, we see a story of innovation, aggressive investment and demonstrate ability to take smart risks, some of which seemed quite controversial at the time. We launched Atlas in June of 2016 as a self-serve only offering on AWS. Although in retrospect the decision to launch an independent database as a service business seemed like a no brainer. It wasn't obvious at the time, there was a fair amount of skepticism in the market, that an independent company could build a successful cloud service, while both partnering and competing with the hyperscale cloud vendors. A year later, we launched Atlas on Azure and GCP. Even though it was more work and added more expense to support all three cloud providers, we made this a priority as you understood from the outset that as the cloud became mainstream, customers would want a multi cloud solution. Due to the strong initial reception of Atlas in our direct sales channel, we invested aggressively to achieve feature parity between enterprise advanced and Atlas. We reached that milestone in mid 2018 ahead of our original schedule, and since then have led with innovation on Atlas. Our ability to quickly ship new features and get customer feedback has not only allowed us to innovate faster, but has also benefited our enterprise advance customers. From an outsider's perspective, one of the more controversial decisions we made was to change our license from AGPL to SSPL in 2018. Our objective was to remain true to our open source roots, while ensuring that you could build a meaningful database as a service business in the cloud era. While some suggested this will limit the adoption of MongoDB, we had conviction that we could better serve customers with this change. MongoDB's popularity with developers has only continued to grow after adopting SSPL. Given the success of Atlas, a number of open source companies have now switched to similar license structures. Around the same time we acquired mLab, which not only increased our scale in the cloud, but also increased our expertise in the self-serve channel. We uncovered a virtuous cycle between our field sales organization, our inside sales team, our customer success organization and our self-serve channel. Investments in any one area lead to the acceleration for the entire cycle. And this virtuous cycle has been a key enabler of our growth. To give you some context, the majority of Atlas revenue was originally sourced by our self-serve channel, but the majority of growth has come through the direct sales channel. In 2019, we acquired Realm, the world's leading independent mobile database, and now beta versions of Atlas search and Atlas data like. With these actions, we took the first steps to move from offering a database to becoming a comprehensive application data platform. Our expanded product vision was driven by a customer's desire to leverage MongoDB more broadly across their organization. In 2020, we continue to make changes that made it easier for customers to start using Atlas. These changes resulted in a big uptick in new customers, resulting over 25,000 customers of almost every size, and from nearly every geography and industry using Atlas today. Looking back at the first 5 years of Atlas, we see a few key lessons learned. First, while innovation, strong execution and unconventional thinking contributed to the growth of Atlas. None of this would have been possible without MongoDB's outstanding product market fit and a massive market, which is estimated by IDC to be 73 billion in 2021. With 175 million cumulative downloads, which over 70 million were in the last 12 months. MongoDB continues to be the world's most popular modern general purpose database. The popularity of MongoDB is the foundational pillar for the success of Atlas. Second, given the choice, customers would rather focus resources on building new applications and shipping new features quickly than spend time and resources on the undifferentiated heavy lifting of managing their distributed application data infrastructure. Third, multi cloud is proving to be even more important than we originally imagined. Customers have experienced firsthand that cloud providers do have outages. So building resilience across cloud providers is critical for many customers. Moreover, as cloud providers differentiate among themselves, being able to leverage different services from different cloud providers is something customers want to do. Finally, customers value solutions that make it easy to move from one cloud provider to another, reducing lock in with any one cloud vendor. As we look to the future, there are a number of reasons why you are bullish about our long-term prospects. First, we are seeing increased adoption, enterprise adoption of Atlas. In the first quarter, approximately two-thirds of new business one by our field sales team was Atlas, more than double the percentage from 2 years ago. Not only our customers choosing more of Atlas, they're building or moving mission critical workloads onto Atlas, which is the biggest driver of growth of our more than 1006 figure customers. Second, cloud partners are recognizing the value that MongoDB and Atlas bring to their own businesses. Using Q1 as an example, we had a record co-sell quarter with AWS, GCP and Alibaba. We are seeing increasing opportunities to expand ways we partner with cloud providers through both technical integrations as well as go-to-market initiatives to enable more customers around the world to derive the benefits of using MongoDB. Finally, our C level customer conversations indicate that our application data platform strategy is clearly resonating in the marketplace. Customers increasingly tell us that they prefer to standardize on a general purpose platform, rather than use a myriad of single function databases that add more cost and increase the complexity of running workloads in the cloud. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the first quarter. Commerce tools the leading next generation eCommerce platform, selected Atlas to power the world's most popular ecommerce sites used by over 200 leading global brands such as Audi, AT&T and Tiffany, commerce tools is now able to scale as platform and flexible API first approach to support the world's biggest retailers so they can design unique and seamless shopping experiences across all digital touch points. At the beginning of May, MongoDB and commerce tools help one of the world's largest toy companies launch a massive and highly anticipated campaign to millions of fans across the world without a hitch, UI Path, a leading enterprise automation software company offering an end-to-end automation platform that combines robotic process automation with a full suite of capabilities. To enable organizations to rapidly scale digital businesses -- business operations chose MongoDB as their underlying data persistence platform to increase efficiency for developers and accelerate time to market with new features and functionality. Leading provider of cloud based compliance solutions, Avalara is migrating from SQL server to MongoDB to support its complex data requirements, with more than 30,000 customers 95 countries, the company needs a database to keep up with billions of transactions as it rapidly scale this platform to support new industries, geographies and compliance services. One of the largest grocery chains in the world chose Atlas to strengthen its digital portfolio and scale its services across the eCommerce platform and in store offerings. The company which has more than 2,000 stores selected MongoDB to replace Cosmos DB after searching for a scalable solution with a flexible data model that will give us developers a richer feature set and better visibility to their data. Capital created by leading Japanese intercompany CyberAgent is a dating application with over 6 million registered users. The app which has made over 200 million matches since inception was deployed in Atlas for ease of use the capacity store 7.5 billion documents and the ability to upgrade very large clusters, while scaling to accommodate large user growth. In summary, we're off to a strong start in fiscal '22. With that, I'll turn it over to Michael. Yes, as we said many, many times, we're going after one of the largest markets in enterprise software. And while obviously most of the dollars per customer are in the time of the can what I call the global 2,000. So obviously, there's only 2,000 of those customers. There's a massive opportunity to grow the long tail. And so while I don't want to speculate on what the high-end of the number could be, I think that number could easily be a lot higher than this today. And potentially even six figures, but at this point, we're not constrained by market, it's more about our operational capability and how quickly we can scale the business. As Michael noted, we are raising our guidance for the year. So we feel pretty good about the demand environment. We think that as customers recognize their need to be digital first, due to the pandemic, it's not like they're going to suddenly say, well, I'm going to go back to my more costly and more inefficient distribution channels, I think they're going to recognize that having a strong digital presence is critical to growing their business. And when they step back and think about how they drive their business, every company is not thinking about using software and data as a competitive advantage. That means every company is thinking about how can they drive the productivity of sales force developers, and every company is thinking about, how can I -- I can't buy my competitive advantage, I got to build it. And so I think that positions us well for the future as people as customers and organizations come out of the pandemic. Thanks, Sanjit. Thanks, Raimo. So on the first part of your question about the relationship between our sales force and EA, I would just tell you that we are not prescriptive about what products to sell to customers. We basically want to serve the customers the best way that they want to be served. And so for some customers that they still have a very measured approach to moving to the cloud, others are going much more aggressively to the cloud. And we obviously have offerings for both sets of customers. I will tell you that we clearly see the high-end of the market getting very, very comfortable moving mission critical workloads to the cloud, and in particular to obviously to Atlas. And so one of the comments I made in the prepared remarks is that the majority of our six figure customers are now -- those are Atlas only accounts. And so that tells you a lot about the sophistication of our customers who are using Atlas at the high-end. And again, I think there's always going to be some seasonality that mix between Atlas and EA and we are still believers that EA is going to grow healthily over the long-term. And then with regards to self-service, self-service is a very, very important channel. One of the things I -- one of the comments I made in the prepared remarks was to basically explain that the majority of source revenue for Atlas came from the self-serve channel, not just customers, but revenue. Now the majority of the growth came from our sales force. So self-serve is a very healthy part of our business. And we see a nice flywheel effect between self-serve and direct sales. And so I don't want you to think that because what you -- when you look at the numbers, think like the self-serve business is not growing. What happens is that our sales force is now very adept at basically picking off the highest quality self-serve accounts and growing those accounts that much more quickly. So the self-serve channel is paying huge dividends for us. And we're investing in all parts of the business. Yes, so that's a great question, David. What I would tell you is today, our focus is really about innovating at the core. And then our new products are all about finding new ways to acquire new customers, and as well as expanding the lifetime value of our existing customers. And so today, the revenue does show up mainly in Atlas versus separate SKU, but you should not assume that that'll be the case long-term. We have a pretty aggressive innovative agenda -- innovation agenda. And so, over time you'll see us add more products and more SKUs. Thank you. Well, I would say that, as companies recognize that at the heart of their value proposition is how effectively they use software and data, I have to believe that their investments in building software applications is growing over time. Now, we believe that applications have a certain lifespan, depending on the application could be as short as 3, 4 years. It could be as long as 15, 20 years. And so applications have a natural retirement rate. Now there could be situations where applications are just not serving the business or the end users effectively. And so people may decide that there's some changes that need to be made more quickly. And so it's hard for us to suss out all the time, like all these net new budgets versus existing budgets. What we recognize is that we have to make a compelling business case. And so our sales organization is quite adept at just making sure that as -- whenever you get a six figure deal, someone's got to justify that expenditure. It's just no one's is going to hand someone a six figure check. And so that either is about advancing the business forward or reducing costs and existing infrastructure, what have you. And so we typically ensure that our -- that we've built a compelling business case for customer decide to choose MongoDB. And so the business case is compelling. There'll be dolls available, even if it's stealing [indiscernible] from existing budgets. Thanks, Brad. Sure. The six figure related customer count grew quite handily from last quarter to this quarter and a big driver of that was Atlas. And so we see a number of not only six figure customers on Atlas, but we also see quite a large number of seven figure customers in Atlas. So you should be -- there should be no misunderstanding. People are building and deploying very sophisticated complex mission critical workloads on Atlas. And Atlas has really proven just by the ubiquity of its reach. We're in over 80 regions around the world. So we are by definition, because you run across AWS, Azure and GCP, we're the most widely -- geographically widely available database as a service offering in the market. Some of the capabilities we recently introduced like global clusters, so customers can run the same workload across two different cloud providers, something no one else can do. And there's a whole bunch of other capabilities around data partitioning, privacy and security that not many people can do. So people run very, very sophisticated workloads on Atlas. And I think you're seeing the results of the enterprise, and the high-end of the market recognizing that and more workloads moving on to Atlas. Yes. We saw a huge increase in joint wins with -- to be clear, not just with Alibaba, but with Amazon and GCP as well. And with Alibaba, it is not Atlas, because due to the regulatory environment in China, we cannot offer Atlas directly. So we partner with both Alibaba and Tencent. We started with Alibaba first. And what we have done is repurpose some of our local sales team in China to really enable the Alibaba organization to more effectively position and articulate the value proposition of MongoDB. And that's we're seeing the results. They're getting impacted quite positively very, very. In the short timeframe, we've done that, so much so that even Alibaba is investing more and building a center of excellence around MongoDB. So we feel really good about what's happening with Alibaba. Tencent, we're in the early days. And our plan is to do the same there in terms of operationalizing their capabilities to sell MongoDB as a service to their customers as well. Thank you, Brent. Yes. So what I will tell you is that one of the compelling value props of MongoDB is you can run MongoDB anywhere. And what that really means is you don't have to rewrite one line of code, whether you run it in your own data center, you manage yourself in the cloud, or use it as a service across AWS, GCP or Azure. And so that becomes a pretty compelling value proposition because as we all know, business conditions change. Cloud providers are differentiating among themselves, offering price concessions or new capabilities that customers want to take advantage of. And what they don't want to do is be locked into any one environment. In terms of competition, we have been competing with offerings, clone offerings from Amazon and from Azure. And obviously, all the cloud providers do offer some types of database services. So there's also other competition available and our win rates against them is exceptionally high. The clones are compromised, because they're not built on the same architecture as MongoDB. They're built on relational back end. So they're compromised in terms of features and performance. And we will go toe to toe with any relational database, because we know the superiority of our architecture, the scalability of our platform and the ability for customers to move much more quickly on MongoDB versus any other solution. So we feel pretty good about the competitive environment today. Hi, Kash. Operator, we might ... Karl, I'll take the first question regarding the pace of hiring. We're trying to hire salespeople as fast as possible. The main reason being we're going after a really big market. And, frankly, in enterprise sales, you have to show up to win, right. And so we know when we go head to head against the competitors for the last question asked that our win rates are exceptionally high. But you do have to show up to win. And there's many areas of the world that we're really under penetrated. And so we want to hire salespeople to make sure that we can go after those opportunities, but it's not just simply as hiring like 500,000 salespeople in one quarter. You have to make sure you have the right supporting infrastructure in place in terms of sales management, pre-sales technical skills, the right enablement, sufficient ramp time, etcetera. So there's a whole operation that we have to kind of make sure that we have the right support structure to make those salespeople successful. But we're being very aggressive in terms of hiring salespeople as fast as possible. Michael, I think the second question was for you. Thanks, Karl. Well, obviously, you have to remember that if someone's going to choose Atlas, by definition, they've already chosen MongoDB because Atlas is the -- obviously the service offering that underlies MongoDB. What I will tell you is actually this is that one of the real advantages of MongoDB is the ability to scale your application through something that's called sharding. When customers try and do that themselves on their own premise, we find that some customers get intimidated by the fact that they can -- how quickly they can scale the environment, or they may not have sufficient compute capacity to scale their environment as quickly as they want. When you move to the cloud and by definition, you now have elastic capacity, it becomes much easier to leverage the power of MongoDB in a cloud world. The distributed capabilities, the ability to easily shard data, the ability to use capabilities to partition data, whether it's for privacy and security regulations around data in different parts of the world, or whether it's for performance, moving some data closer to end -- some end users in different parts of the world, all this capabilities gets far better exposed in Atlas than someone trying to do that in their own data centers. So that's the added benefit of customers -- the customers see by running these mission critical workloads on Atlas. Yes. So what I will tell you is that we recognized very early on that once everyone's working in this virtual world, one of the biggest -- the one of the most -- typically one of the most fragile parts of any sales organization is your new reps, those reps for ramping. I haven't closed any business and they're obviously nervous about putting up numbers on the scoreboard. We went on our way to really ensure that we provided the right level of enablement, the right level support, and so on so forth to help those reps ramp as quickly as possible. And in general, the ramping of the new reps is in line with our expectations. And we're putting a lot of focus there. We do it actually for employees across all functions, not just sales. But we have a particular focus on salespeople, because by definition, we need them to produce in a certain timeframe. And so there's a lot of focus on making sure that our reps are ramping. We have different levels of training from boot camps, advanced sales training, to specialized product training to ongoing product updates as well as a lot of inspection by sales leadership in terms of their activity and the quality of their pipeline, and so on so forth. So we have a lot of measures in place to ensure that we can really track is a sales rep ramping appropriately given their time and tenure in the field. The same -- we do the same thing for our inside salespeople. We assume obviously a short ramp for inside salespeople. But in general, we've really instrumented our sales process to identify where people may be at risk and put in remediation of the programs in place as soon as possible. Right. So there's a quite a synergistic relationship between MongoDB and the SIs because in many cases, the SIs act as either the company's development arm or augment their existing development organization. So by definition, they're the developers of the applications and they're the ones using MongoDB to build those applications. The SIs are also building cloud migration factories. Their practices in that area to help customers migrate workloads from on-premise to the cloud. And so, so we're involved working with a number of large size people like Accenture, TCS, Cap gems -- Capgemini, Infosys, etcetera. Working with them, they have different programs by organization. Essentially has their a MongoDB accelerator program, the Capgemini and TCS have different programs focused on different verticals. We also work with, frankly, some boutique asides, who have expertise, deep expertise in MongoDB, or perhaps deep expertise in mobile or deep expertise, in particular vertical or particular geography. And so we work with boutique SIs as well, if the situation warrant. So, I would say in general the SIs are that business overall is growing, but there's plenty more to do. And one of the challenges of working with these larger sides is that they're very decentralized. So even though you may have success in one geography or even one account doesn't mean that translates very, very quickly across the entire organization. But as we get more credibility as we are more wins as our reputation gets stronger, we're seeing these SIs come to us to work with us and more and more opportunities. Thank you. Well, in the prepared remarks you talked about commerce tools, which is just nice to be really helping retailers and so we're having a lot of success with them. There's a number of other ISVs that we work with. We, in fact, have a dedicated sales team now that's pursuing ISVs. And it's really a two step sales process. One is a sell two [ph] process where we get the -- either the CTO, the CEO, or like the Chief Product officer, or their teams to think about building their new version of their product or re-platform existing product off a legacy database onto MongoDB. And then the second step is then working with them to go close their first set of customers, and then we're the beneficiary of their growth. So that there's a team that's dedicated on doing that. And I don't have our IC count in front of me, but it's numbers in the hundreds. And that's a big opportunity for us. And you're going to see us put more focus, time and resources, serving ISVs. Yes, it's, I would say, in general, we see ISVs. And obviously, there's a segment of them being low code or no code, vendors are using who choosing MongoDB. One because of the data model. The document data model, we would argue quite convincingly I would add is that is the best way to work with data. The flexibility of the data model allows you to really manage data the way developers think in code. Also allows you to make changes very, very easily. So if you talk to anyone who's worked with relational databases, by the time the application gets past rev 1, or rev 2, the data model gets very brittle. And it becomes much harder to make ongoing changes. You do not have that problem with MongoDB. The second point is that MongoDB is by definition, the most distributed and scalable platform available. It was built from the ground up to be a distributed data platform. And so ISVs really appreciate that because they serve a myriad of customers. And so they want a platform that can scale. And the third thing is that the MongoDB can run anywhere. It's not a cloud only platform, it's not an on-premise only platform. So depending on the ISVs business model, they can deploy it as ShrinkWrap software. They can offer it as a service in the cloud, or anything in between. And so MongoDB enables them to maintain a whole host of options. And that's why I think you see ISVs choosing MongoDB. Thanks, Kash. I think we said this last year, and we said I think even more most recently in the last quarter. While we've done well, during the pandemic, we do believe that COVID has been a slight headwind to our business. We know that there's still an enormous amount of deal scrutiny, especially on big deals. We know that approvals still take a long time to get done. We know that if customers are worried about the health of their business, there'll be cautious about making investments in their business with new technology. So as the world opens up, we believe that people will have even more confidence and more conviction in using MongoDB. And we think we're well-positioned because what the pandemic did tell us is that those companies who are adept at using software and data thrive because everyone have to become digital first. And so proficiency and using the software and data and I've said in the past, you can't buy your competitive advantage, you have to build it yourself. And so that means you need to be very proficient in building applications that truly transform your business, adding features quickly, being able to respond to new opportunities and new threats. And so MongoDB is a great platform for enabling you to do that in a very flexible and scalable way. So we think we're well-positioned as the world opens up, and people run the business, leveraging software and data. Thanks, Kash. Yes, So, I just want to make it clear. Atlas is available in 80 regions around the world. It's not just domestic offerings. So we leverage the points of presence of AWS, GCP, and Azure all around the world. And so pretty much in almost every market except China. Atlas is available, with a few other exceptions. And so we have a very wide global reach. What we do recognize is that certain regional players have deep customer relationships, or in some cases like in China and other places like Russia, there may be regulatory issues where we can't offer Atlas directly. And so by definition, we have to partner with a local provider to enable customers to drive the benefits of MongoDB. So I would say our international presence is very strong. We have thousands of international customers. And we partner with other providers when we don't believe we can serve the entire market ourselves through Atlas. And we've done that with people like OVH in Europe, and the cloud provider in Korea and other places around the world. Any other questions? Yes, so our philosophy is to enable customers to run MongoDB anywhere and it really depends on the customer's choice about where they want to run the workloads and why? And so for many reasons, customers are happy to self manage MongoDB themselves using enterprise advanced either managing those workloads in their own data center, or self managing those workloads in the cloud. And so we're not trying to convince every customer that Atlas is the right solution. We're not at all prescriptive about how customers choose MongoDB. We just want to make sure that the needs get -- gets served the best way they see fit. And Atlas obviously has been a great boon to our business in terms of the growth and our ability to innovate on Atlas, being a cloud service is that much easier, because we can ship features more quickly. And we can get feedback more quickly. And those the benefits of that innovation then get driven to our EA [ph] customer. So EA customers also benefit from the innovations from Atlas. Yes. So, I think we've continued to do that over the last several years. And certainly, if you'd ask me, at the time of the IPO, and so that was a big majority of the revenue where do you think gross margins will be I would have guessed a lower number. And so we've out executed relative to sort of the plan and the expectations. There still is a difference. We can't make the infrastructure component zero. So there will be a gross margin difference, but we have made good progress and will continue to turn the various efficiency in the optimization dials and levers that come across a number of flavors. Thank you, Chuck. I just want to again summarize that we're off to a strong start in fiscal '22. Again, with 39% year-over-year revenue growth driven by 73% growth in Atlas. We're seeing strong traction for Atlas in the enterprise channel as customers want a platform that enables them to innovate and scale quickly. And third, our application data platform strategy is resonating in the marketplace as customers see MongoDB's superior document data model as a viable solution for an increasing number of use cases. So we feel very good about the future. So thank you for everyone for joining us, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Take care."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Brian Denyeau from ICR. \nBrian Denyeau: Thank you Josh. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review MongoDB's fourth quarter fiscal 2023 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued at the close of the market today. Joining me on the call today are Dev Ittycheria President and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance and our planned investments. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and including the results of operations and clients that have caused actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2022 followed the SEC on December 8, 2022. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Brian. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our fourth quarter results before giving you a broader company update. Before I do that, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that today's International Women's Day. And in particular I want to acknowledge that all the amazing women at MongoDB who make us a very special company. Now turning to our results. We generated revenue of $361 million, a 36% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 50% year-over-year, representing 65% of revenue and we had another strong quarter of customer growth ending the quarter with over 40,800 customers. Overall, we continue to execute well in Q4 despite a challenging macro environment. Before we dive into the quarter, let me remind you of the framework through how we operate the business and analyze our performance. Our principal focus is acquiring -- or said another way new applications, which is the biggest driver of our long-term growth. In our market, it's important to understand that the unit of competition is the workload, getting both new and existing customers to deploy new workflows in our data platform is our overarching goal. Once the world has been onboarded its consumption growth is not something we can meaningfully influence. Some workloads will grow faster than others depending on the underlying business drivers for their specific application, the macro environment, seasonality and other factors. While we cannot control the rate of growth of existing workloads, we do know workloads typically grow over time. So as long as we keep acquiring new workloads at a healthy rate, we are well-positioned for the long run. With that, let's discuss what we saw in Q4. We had another strong quarter of new business acquisition, adding approximately 500 net new direct sales customers and we continue to have success in new workloads in existing accounts. Unlike many of our peers, we have not seen the macro environment impact our ability to win new business. We believe this is due to a combination of the mission criticality of our platform, strong ROI and the excellent job our go-to-market teams have done navigating incremental hurdles and approvals in sales cycles. Turning to Atlas consumption trends. Q4 was below our expectations. In our Q3 call, we told you we got off to a solid start to Q4 and that we had expected to see a usage-driven holiday slowdown in the back half of Q4. This slowdown did happen, but it was more pronounced than we had anticipated impacting our Q4 results as well as our outlook. Consumption growth in February improved relative to December and January and was broadly in line with the average growth we've seen since the macro slowdown began in Q2 of last year. We continue to believe the recent fluctuations in consumption trends are largely driven by broad-based macroeconomic trends as they are occurring across different geographies, vertical markets and customer segments. Finally, retention rates remained incredibly strong in Q4, which exemplifies the value customers receive from MongoDB. As I look forward into FY 2024 and beyond, I'm excited about the opportunity I see ahead of us. My enthusiasm ultimately comes from our customers. Our value proposition and product vision clearly resonate given our new business activity, our account of 100,000-plus and million-plus customers, and our own customer conversations. For example, some of our largest and most sophisticated customers plan to meaningfully increase their MongoDB deployments. After working with them for a number of years, two global financial institutions are preparing to deploy hundreds of applications both new and existing on Atlas in the coming quarters. It's important to understand that large enterprise customers take a comprehensive and long-term view when deciding to change their operational data platform standards given the scale and complexity of their business. Both customers chose to standardize on MongoDB after a rigorous review of all available choices based on developer preference, the optionality we provide on where they can run their workloads and they're confident that we can address their demanding requirements both today and tomorrow. To remind everyone the core drivers for MongoDB's adopted include: One, customers increasingly find legacy technology and limits how quickly they can respond to changing business needs and recognize that the cost of not addressing this issue now frequently exceeds the near-term friction of making a change. A senior IT executive in the travel industry recently told us that most of the Oracle estate will transition to MongoDB. Two, MongoDB's developer platform enables customers to reduce the complexity and the cost of the technology stack by eliminating point solutions and consolidating workloads onto a single platform. This is especially relevant in the current macro environment where customers are looking to reduce the number of vendors they work with to rationalize their infrastructure and operating costs. Two of Europe's largest retailers are in the process of ripping out a myriad of legacy and niche systems and replacing the large mission critical deployments of Atlas Service and Atlas Device Link. Finally, customers understand that their business strategy directly expressed through their software applications they develop to build new products and services as well as to run their business. MongoDB's modern platform enables them to increase their pace of innovation to deliver better business performance. At a recent customer advisory board meeting, a gaming industry executive said to its peers they are standardizing on MongoDB because simply put, we make it so easy for developers to build great applications. Customer conversations like this and the ongoing strength of our new business performance makes us incredibly confident in our long-term opportunity. We will continue to invest appropriately as we believe it will create the most long-term value for the business. At the same time, we recognize we are operating in a different macro environment. This presents us with an opportunity to assess our org structure, systems and processes to ensure we are effective and efficient as possible. In fiscal 2024, we will raise the bar on our performance, enabling us to further capitalize on our long-term opportunity when macroeconomic conditions normalize. To that end, we are making a number of changes this year. We will significantly slow down our overall headcount growth in fiscal 2023. We grew headcount by 30%. We expect this number to be in the single digits in FY 2024. We remain focused in orienting all our go-to-market activities around our North Star new workload acquisition. We continue to drive cross-functional coordination to build the required systems, tools and compensation structure to acquire workloads more efficiently. We will continue to grow our quota-carrying rep count and as always, prioritize investments in regions and channels where we see the best returns. We will also reduce investments in some supporting areas. In our product and engineering organizations, we'll focus on our key priorities, including enhancing our core database and adding to our search and time series capabilities, as well as planting seeds for future growth areas. In G&A, the focus is investing in systems that can deliver automation, repeatability and scalability to drive further efficiency improvements. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. We have many customers, including companies such as Avalara, Electrolux, Bosch and Telef\u00f3nica Tech who have achieved meaningful cost savings by using MongoDB. Telef\u00f3nica Tech, a subsidiary of Telef\u00f3nica S.A. spearheads Telef\u00f3nica digital transformation service and technology and connectivity. They needed a platform with the capacity to outpace the ever-increasing device usage for 30 million IoT devices that run on their managed connectivity platform. They selected MongoDB as their primary database to deliver uninterrupted user service, while reducing expenses by 40%. Customers across different industries and geographies including Cathay Pacific, Iron Mountain, Polaris and Midland Credit Management are running mission-critical projects on MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of a developer data platform. Iron Mountain turned to MongoDB to support the expansion from providing traditional physical asset storage and shredding solutions into offering an intelligent document processing solution. Iron Mountain needed an agile solution to quickly respond to customer requests and MongoDB's document model gives them the ability to ingest data quickly with a flexible schema. MongoDB's developer data platform enables Iron Mountain's customers to search through tens of millions of documents with queries coming back in milliseconds. Many customers have migrated from legacy technology or clones of MongoDB, including Amadeus, Penske and Clear, a company that helps millions of Indian citizens with their tax returns. Penske, one of the world's largest transportation services companies selected MongoDB Atlas to modernize its customer notification platform that was originally built on relational technology which was too rigid to provide the rapid iterative development that Penske required. After migrating to MongoDB Atlas, Penske experienced increased developer productivity and the team was able to scale seamlessly, resulting in improved platform performance regardless of spikes in traffic and higher overall customer satisfaction. In summary, I am pleased with our execution in the fourth quarter. We are excited and energized about our long-term prospects. I've lived through a number of bad macro environments in my career and I remind our team almost daily that these moments offer precious growth opportunities for frontline employees, for first-time managers, senior leaders and for the entire company. I firmly believe it is in times like these that great companies separate themselves from the pack. We intend to do just that and we will emerge from the slowdown even better positioned to pursue our goal of building a generational software company. With that, here's Michael. \nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the fourth quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth quarter results. And then, finish with our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2024. First, I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $361.3 million, up 36% year-over-year. As Dev mentioned, we continue to see a healthy environment for new business. To us, this is confirmation we remain a top priority for our customers and that our value proposition continues to stand out, even and sometimes especially in this market. Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 50% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 65% of total revenue, up from 58% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and 63% last quarter. As a reminder, we recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely related to end-user activity of the application, which can be impacted by macroeconomic factors. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. As Dev mentioned, consumption growth in Q4 was weaker than we expected. In fact, consumption growth in Q4 was the slowest quarter of the year. As a reminder, in our prior quarterly call, we noted consumption growth in Q4 was off to a solid start with November growth similar to Q3 trends. However, we also noted that we expected to experience a seasonal slowdown for the rest of the quarter, driven by lower usage of applications during the holidays. Broadly speaking, this is what happened in Q4. However, the slowdown is more pronounced than we expected. The holiday slowdown was a global phenomenon and visible across all industries and channels. February trends showed an improvement and were in line with the average growth we've seen since the macro slowdown began in Q2 of last year. In addition, due to slower Atlas consumption growth during fiscal 2023, we recognized several million dollars of incremental revenue in Q4 from a small portion of our customers that reach the end of their contracts without having consumed their entire commitment. Revenue from contract expirations happens in the normal course of our business and is usually not a significant factor affecting our results. The higher level in Q4 is a function of the cumulative impact of lower consumption trends over the course of the year as well as Q4 having the largest number of customer contracts up for renewal. Turning to Enterprise Advanced. As you know, we faced a difficult EA compare in Q4 and that is reflected in our slower year-over-year Enterprise Advanced revenue growth. However, EA once again significantly exceeded our expectations in the quarter as we continue having success selling incremental workloads into our existing EA customer base. The continued strength of EA new business is particularly notable in this environment, given that EA required an upfront commitment. Turning to customer growth. During the fourth quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,700 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 40,800, which is up from over 33,000 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 6,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 4,400 in the year ago period. Q4 was another very strong quarter of direct customer net additions. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform as well as self-service customers with whom we've now established a direct sales relationship. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 39,300 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 31,500 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,651 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,307 in the year ago period. We also finished the year with 213 customers spending $1 million or more on our platform compared to 164 a year ago. Moving down the income statement. I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the fourth quarter, was $280.8 million, representing a gross margin of 78%, which is up from 74% in the year ago period. Our gross margin improvement in Q4 was positively impacted by a one-time benefit of roughly 2.5 percentage points related to one of our cloud partner contracts. We are very pleased with our gross margin progression even excluding the one-time benefit, especially in the context of Atlas representing 65% of our overall business. Our income from operations was $37.2 million, or a 10% operating margin for the fourth quarter compared to a 5% margin in the year ago period. The primary reason for our strong operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. In addition, we benefited from significantly lower-than-expected headcount growth in the fourth quarter, as we slowed down hiring and prioritized hiring to the highest-need areas. Net income in the fourth quarter was $46.4 million, or $0.57 per share based on 80.8 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $8 million, or $0.10 per share on 78.7 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the fourth quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $25.9 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $23.8 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $16.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2024. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $344 million to $348 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to the range of $10 million to $13 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.20 based on 84.3 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.48 billion to $1.51 billion. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect non-GAAP income from operations to the range of $69 million to $84 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to the range of $0.96 to $1.10 based on 85.1 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Note that, the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2024 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more color around our guidance starting with Q1. First, we expect Atlas revenue to be flat to slightly down sequentially in Q1. As a reminder, Q1 has three fewer days than Q4, which represents a revenue headwind. Second, weaker-than-expected Atlas consumption during the holidays will have a bigger impact on Q1 revenue than it did in Q4, thereby negatively impacting sequential revenue growth. Finally, the higher than typical unused commitments that benefited Q4 revenue are making for an incrementally harder sequential compare. On a year-over-year basis, Atlas continues to face a difficult compare as we're lapping last Q1, which is the last quarter of strong consumption growth before the macro slowdown. Second, we expect to see a meaningful sequential decline in EA revenue. As discussed in the past, Q4 is our seasonally highest quarter in terms of our EA renewal base, and our EA renewal base is an excellent indicator of our ability to win new EA business. In Q1, the base is sequentially lower, which we expect to have an impact on our ability to generate new business and the associated license revenue under ASC 606. Next, we expect operating income to decline sequentially because of the lower revenue outlook. In addition in Q1, we see a sequential expense increase because we award annual merit compensation increases to the majority of our employees. Moving on to our full year guidance, a few things to keep in mind. We expect Atlas consumption growth to continue to be impacted by the difficult macroeconomic environment throughout fiscal 2024. Our guidance assumes consumption growth that is in line with the average consumption growth we've experienced since the macro slowdown began in Q2 of last year as well as what we observed in February. Moving on to EA. Similarly to Q4 of fiscal 2023, we will begin facing very difficult compares throughout fiscal 2024. We remain confident in our ability to keep upselling our EA customer base with incremental workloads but last year's strong performance combined with the ASC 606 dynamics will represent a meaningful headwind. In terms of our operating income guidance, the key variable to keep in mind is our headcount growth, as Dev mentioned, we'll meaningfully slow down hiring this year, expecting to grow headcount in the single digits. However, in terms of year-over-year OpEx growth, keep in mind that we'll also be annualizing the impact of the 30% headcount growth we experienced last year. To summarize, MongoDB delivered solid fourth quarter results in a difficult environment. Our new business performance and strong direct customer net additions indicate the robust underlying demand for our developer data platform. The continued macro uncertainty is putting pressure on Atlas consumption and we've incorporated that into our outlook. As a result, we are modulating our pace of investments with laser focus on key priority areas and increasing efficiency across the company while still running the business for the long-term. With that, we'd like to open up to questions. Operator? \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the question. Dev, I want to get an understanding of some of the factors that's driving the weaker consumption trends. As a transactional database, I guess transaction volumes for the MongoDB applications are down. But to what extent is broader slowdown in sort of cloud transformation, cloud migration deals impacting the business? And do you see any impact of any sort of optimization customers sort of downsizing to less powerful causes as a headwind on consumption growth?\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Sanjit. We are going after a really large opportunity. We're really pleased with our new business traction in terms of new customer acquisition and as well as new workload acquisition. But I do want to say that obviously, the new workloads we acquire have very little impact on near-term revenue. In terms of optimization, we've really seen no changes in the dynamic. The value of what we offer is tightly aligned to the value that customers see. When customers build an application they want that application to be used. They want that application to be consumed. And obviously, as it's consumed, that drives more value for them and drives more revenue for us. Now we have seen some corner cases, where some customers under significant financial duress may in a rearchitect their MongoDB clusters to have less resilience or less scale but that obviously comes with a lot more risk. And again, that's not really a sustainable approach. And so in general, our retention trends are very strong and has one CTO said on the buy-side call, we are a necessity not a luxury. So, we feel good about the long-term. It's just a function of the macro environment and the second order effects we're seeing from our own customers.\nSanjit Singh: Yes. Well understood. I appreciate the thoughts and the color, particularly on gross retention. Just a follow-up on the commentary on February being better than the holiday slowdown in January. Is there a way a farmout how February compared to November, which seems pretty -- like it seemed like a pretty good start to the quarter? Was that in line with what you saw to start November and Q3 more broadly, or is that is it the sort of underlying cohort usage below that time here? \nMichael Gordon: Yes. So, one of the things that we'll call out Sanjit is as we have more and more data on Atlas we've tried to expose to everyone the underlying seasonal trends that we see. So, that November period that you're specifically asking about is consistent with the Q3 timeframe, which is one of the seasonally stronger periods. We had mentioned that the latter part of Q4. So, basically December and January tends to be slower and normally those kind of wash each other out. So, November would have been higher in line with Q3. And what we're seeing in February is really consistent with what we've seen since the very beginning, so sort of the average. So, if November Q3 are a little bit on the higher side and inventory is more in line with the average, you can sort of conclude where that is.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate the thoughts Michael. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter. Help us understand Dev and Michael, if you will, a dichotomy between consumption growth slowing down. But at the same time at the other end of the funnel, you are adding new customers. So, help us understand why these two seems to be happening, although you would generally think that during a downturn new customers a lot of hard time making new technology decisions? That's one. Number two when I look at Atlas customer growth in the most recent quarter that loan was up some 25%. So, how do we square that with guidance for 15% to 18% growth rate, it feels like at some point when people start to feel slightly better about the economy, these transaction volumes can pick up, case in point, you did Atlas growth which was pretty significant in the quarter, while going through consumption slowdown. So, despite that you put up good numbers. So, help us understand how to look at the guidance in light of slowing consumption. But this time we're modeling in a pretty significant slowdown in the overall revenue growth. Thank you so much. I hope this question still makes sense.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks Kash. I'll take the first one and then Mike will take your second question. With regards to the divergence between consumption usage or -- versus new customer acquisition, people -- just stepping back, people essentially express their business strategy through the products they build using software -- or the services they build using software and as well as how they run their business. They're striving for more efficiency, they want to capture new business opportunities, they want to respond to new threats. And obviously our platform being very modern, very flexible, highly scalable, enabling high pace of innovation is very attractive for customers to build those applications. But you have to remember most workloads start small. So, the near-term revenue impact is also small. But over time those workloads grow and consequently, that impact is greater over time. What we're seeing in terms of the divergence between new business and consumption is really a function of the second order effects we're seeing with our own customer bases. As we mentioned earlier, we're seeing transaction volumes slow, people buying less things through digital platforms, people traveling less, or maybe they're using other products and services less than they typically have been. And so the customers themselves are not seeing their businesses grow. Consequently, their need to grow their MongoDB per clusters is not as high. And so that's essentially the reason for the divergence in trends. \nMichael Gordon : Yes. The only thing that I would add, you\u2019re definitely right. We continue to have success even in this market winning new customers and winning new workloads, which speaks to the value proposition and the mission criticality. As Dev said, those customers do start out all though. We're continuing to see strong growth out of the gate for new workloads, but all workloads are affected by the macroeconomic environment. And so that's why we -- I sort of revert you back to sort of our framework, which is in the short term the outcomes are more governed by the expansion of existing allocations whereas in the long-term, especially given how -- what little penetration we have in this massive market that we're going after. In the medium to long-term, it's much more governed by our ability to continue to win new customers and new workloads. \nKash Rangan: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. You may proceed.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thank you. You talked about a new dynamic this quarter in terms of customers not kind of fully utilizing their credits and that kind of helped you on revenue. How much of a theme do you think that will be going forward? Is that just a specific one for this year, or do you anticipate that for the coming year? And does that kind of trigger maybe thing to go back to the customers that they kind of want to renegotiate the contract or optimize the contract. Like how much of a real impact is this for you? And then I had a follow-up please. \nDev Ittycheria : Yes. So it's a dynamic that's always been there and it's becoming less over time. But let me explain. As I mentioned, it's something that's sort of always there. As a result of the slower growth that we've seen over the last couple of quarters, you wind up with a higher probability that someone would not have consumed their full commit. And given the preponderance of contracts that end in Q4 given that it's our highest kind of selling quarter, that's what sort of leads to this. And we're really only calling this out, so people can understand the Q1 guide. This is effectively revenue that under a normal consumption model and normal consumption patterns, we would have recognized earlier in the year, but because people were sort of consuming below their commitment level when they hit expiration that happened. To your comment these are -- remember, these are old contractors. These are all things that have been signed at least a year ago. And one of the things that we've been doing for the last couple of years is deemphasizing commitments. And so I think realistically, this is less of a factor over time. It's something that sort of always exists in the business. But given that it was worth several million dollars this quarter, we wanted to call it out just so people could understand the sequential guide for Q1. \nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Okay. And the follow-up is on and it's probably more a question for long-term investors is like if you do like your -- the 5% headcount or the single-digit headcount growth you talked about, can you talk a little bit about the split there, because obviously the risk might be that as we're coming out you might be short on seals capacity? So that's why it's important to understand the other side of the equation. Many thanks.\nDev Ittycheria : Yes, Raimo. I mean, we are basically making decisions across the business and in a surgical way. This is not some sort of broad-based slowdown. We're investing in channels and markets where we see great performance and we're slowing down that pace of investment in areas that maybe we're waiting for things to get better. On the product side, we continue to invest on product and even in new growth areas that we think will pay handsome returns in the future. I would say that we feel pretty good about our ability to respond to the changes in the market. And so we feel like we have the sales capacity we need going into this year. And we're also as we talked about very, very focused on both acquiring new customers and new workloads and we're optimizing for that not served to really increase the rate and pace of new workload acquisition. As we see good returns, we'll continue to adjust accordingly.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to start Dev maybe as you think about usage patterns that you've been seeing, was just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color in terms of uptake of some of the adjacent services around Atlas particularly search as well as Data Lake. Just wanted to see how that's trending? And any moves that you can make to drive more usage or more expansions of existing Atlas customers onto the services? And I've got a quick follow-up.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. So thanks for the question. I mean, our strategy is to evolve from being a database company to a true developer data platform. And the whole strategy behind that is to enable developers to run a broader set of use cases on MongoDB. And the benefits are quite profound, because they can use one approach, a very seamless and integrated way to address a wide variety of applications or use cases all the data stays in one place and it just becomes far easier for the organizations to manage that kind of infrastructure. We're seeing strong uptick in search across the sales force. The customer demand is high. Customers have clearly indicated that they value the fact they can consolidate everything on MongoDB versus having spoke search engine as well as some connectivity between their OLTP database and their search database. So the message is resonating and we're getting feedback on new features and capabilities that customers want to see. So we're very, very focused on the search market and that's a big priority for us to grow that segment of the business even more this coming year. We're seeing a lot of demand for time series again for the same exact reasons; customers don't want to have a bespoke solution. They don't want to have to manage and learn and manage a new technology. They want all the data in one place. And so we're seeing a lot of uptick on search -- I'm sorry, time series. We see the same for mobile. You mentioned Data Lake. We're -- basically a lot of demand for online archive where people as their MongoDB applications accumulate more and more data to be able to offload that data to lower cost storage solutions but still be able to create that data in a very effective way, as well as import other data from other sources into their platform and then be able to create that data as well. So that's an area that we see continued interest more at the higher end of the customer segment. So we're very committed to the platform strategy and customers are really resonating with that message, especially I should add in an environment where customers want to consolidate vendors this is a very effective way for them to do so.\nRishi Jaluria: All right. Wonderful. That's really helpful. And then Dev on the prepared remarks you talked about a few customers where they had migrated some of the relational workloads over MongoDB, maybe can you help us understand kind of the nature of those workloads? Were those workloads that maybe should have never been relational to begin with? Are some of them actually correlational workloads that you're able to take away? And to what extent has a Relational Migrator, which I believe was announced last year, been kind of a help or an accelerant to that part of the business. Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Right. So, there's a few drivers for why people would want to migrate a relational application to MongoDB. One could be performance. The needs of that application are outstripping the ability of that real database to serve great and greater demand. And so they need a more scalable platform or they need to be able to develop new features much more quickly and the data models become so brittle and so hard to add new features that their customers are getting frustrated or frankly the cost. In many situations, the cost of the relational technology is just way too expensive because of the legacy vendors, pricing policies and so customers want to go to a much more cost-effective solution. So that typically -- those are one or three of the main reasons why customers move to MongoDB. In terms of like Relational Migrator, people are starting to use that. I want to be clear that's still used by MongoDB personnel. We have not made it generally available to the market. We still -- because of the wide variety of relational applications, there's still a lot of corner cases where you need a little bit more manual intervention, but we're getting great feedback on Migrator and our whole strategy is to reduce the switching costs of moving off relational applications to MongoDB and you're going to see us continue to invest in that area.\nRishi Jaluria: Perfect. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon. Wanted to ask, Atlas consumption by vertical. Have you seen any sort of variances by industry vertical relative to consumption patterns, or has the slowdown been broad-based? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Thanks, Brent. No, it's been broad-based. The holiday slowdown that we anticipated and was more pronounced was also broad-based really across the board. And then, when we look at the recovery that we observed in February, that was also broad-based. And so I think we're seeing pretty consistent trends across industries.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color. And then one quick follow-up, on EA I know that still ratable recognition of the ASC 606, $427 million contribution from EA in fiscal 2023. What's baked into the assumption around EA next year? Are you assuming that business potentially declines to get to the 15%, 16% growth, just any color around what's baked in? I apologize, if I missed the color there. But any color on EA expectations built in the guide for this year would be helpful.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, sure. As you know, we run the business on a channel basis but just given the ASC 606 dynamics at least try and provide a little bit of color for folks to understand things. So from a Q1 standpoint, we did say we expect EA to be down sequentially Q1 relative to Q4 and that's really a function of the EA renewal base. As you think about meeting the EA renewal basis lower in Q1? And then secondly, if you think about over the course of the full year, EA really is what drove a lot of the outperformance that we've seen this past year in fiscal 2023. And so what that means is that, sets up fairly tough compares for the balance of the year across EA. So I think that's just sort of important to keep in mind, as you think through the modeling and the forecast and that's tried why we provide all that color.\nBrent Bracelin: So year-over-year decline is not out of the question then?\nMichael Gordon: We said in Q1, we expect a sequential decline, yes. Long term just in case, it isn't clear long-term EA continues to be a growth opportunity. While we talk a lot about public cloud and public cloud adoption in these contexts in these settings, there's still a large number of companies, and a large number of applications that people have not yet moved to the cloud and EA continues to find very strong product market fit with those customers. And as we've mentioned before is increasingly seen as an on-ramp to the public cloud. And so I think, it's an important kind of aspect of the MongoDB run anywhere strategy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turits with KeyBanc. You may proceed.\nMichael Turits: Hi, guys. Two questions. One; what's happening, the contracts that were renewed this quarter. What's happening in the level of commits for next year? And then secondly, on margins obviously, your EBIT margins for the full year, the guide is for some expansion but not a lot. And I understand that, you have a delayed impact to the cost of hiring last year, but why not more expansion of those margins? Was it that you just waited too long to start slowing with that headcount growth in December or why are we not able to find more ways to get more margin expansion this year? So commits and margin expansion.\nDev Ittycheria: Great. Thanks. On the commits, we continue to have very high renewal rates. We've not seen any uptick in churn despite sort of the macro environment, which again I think underscores the mission criticality. And as it relates to commitments as I've mentioned for the last several years, last probably at least three years now, we've been deemphasizing commitments. And so that tends not to be the way that, customers think. And the scenario that you're describing, I can give you kind of like an anecdotal insight or perspective. If you think about someone who is sort of under consumed relative to their initial commitment, oftentimes that can be a result of the product that got started late, right? So they were more optimistic about how quickly they could launch their own internal application. They lost a few months, but the application is taken off and performed nicely. And so you can easily see scenarios, where they're renewing at similar or higher levels. So I wouldn't overly read into that unused commitment dynamic. We really are just exposing that to folks so people can understand the sequential guide. On profitability and on margins, maybe I'll say a couple of things. We feel very good about the performance overall. We feel good about the guide. The guide has another 100 basis points of improvement relative to fiscal 2023, once you exclude the one-time credits that we called out, we were able to \u2013 we're pleased we were able to maintain that 100 basis point improvement even after Q4 and all of fiscal 2023 came in stronger than we had expected. And so I think that's sort of important to keep in mind as well. And then the last thing, I'd say is a little bit to Dev's answer to Raimo's question, we are continuing to invest for the long term. And so this is not an attempt to cut all costs or seize all investment in the future. We believe that we're in the early innings of capitalizing on a large market opportunity. We know the cost of capital is higher. Therefore, fewer things clear the bar. We're being really judicious about making sure that we're focusing on the areas of highest return and highest priority so that we can set ourselves up well to capitalize on this long-term opportunity. \nMichael Turits: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. You may proceed.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you just about the strength in the direct customer adds, the direct sales add which was -- remained strong versus last quarter. I'm wondering if there's -- just the trends you're seeing in terms of the segment for your customers -- are you seeing strength more pronounced on the enterprise side or, kind of, mid-market. If you could just kind of comment on the differing trends you're seeing in SMB versus enterprise. That would be great. Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So thanks for the question, Tyler. In terms of new business strength we're actually seeing it generally across the board. Our direct sales customers -- both North America, Europe and the large enterprise and SMB space have been have been quite good. That's also a function of the focus on acquiring new customers because once you get into an account that a customer will pay handsome dividends for us over the long-term. But as part of that also we're really trying to grow our existing installed base by adding new workloads from those existing customers and that's a big part of our strategy as well. And while we have less control over how those workloads grow we know we can directly control how quickly we add new customers and new workloads and that's why we're really focused on the latter. \nTyler Radke: Great. And you talked about some more instances of standardization deals in the quarter where presumably customers are spending millions of dollars on Mongo. I'm just curious in this environment are those -- are you seeing more or less of those? Obviously, it's a challenging environment to get larger deals done. But maybe just talk about how you're how you're approaching those? And any commonality just to the extent you've seen an uptick there. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So what I've said in the past still remains true. Once we're in an account does not mean that we've become a standard. And so the job then of the accounting depending on the size of the account is to then ultimately get that organization to declare us either a de facto standard just by how popular we've become and the preference developers have or that sometimes some organizations have a very formal process to certify a new technology inside their enterprise. In either case when that happens it essentially means developers don't need to seek permission to use MongoDB that they can use MongoDB for pretty much any use case. And that does tend to unlock a wide array of new use cases for us. So for example in our strategic accounts where we've deployed more resources those are accounts that either we become the standard or very close to become the standard. And as we've talked about in the past when we become the standard the volume of new workloads that come to MongoDB just increased meaningfully, which obviously drives also more revenue for us. And so that's -- that's essentially our strategy. In terms of what's happening recently. I would say there's no change in pace in terms of the number of customers declaring as a standard. What I was trying to just explain was that these very, very large customers, when they're declaring the standard just given the scale and complexity of their business, they can't change standards for a very long time. It just doesn't operationally make sense. So when they make a decision to move to a new platform that to some degree is almost like a decade long perspective on the fact that they expect MongoDB to be their standard for the next decade plus. And that's \u2013 and so consequently the way they evaluate us in terms of our ability to address their requirements today and what they think their requirements will be in the future.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. You may proceed.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. First of all for an easy one. Have you made any changes to the comp plan as you enter the new fiscal year? \nDev Ittycheria: We always make small modifications of the comp plan. This year for the sales force we are really focused on new workload acquisition and we're more focused on acquiring and getting those workloads to consume and less focus as Michael mentioned, on driving big commitments. Given how sticky MongoDB workloads tend to be. We know once a customer deploys an app on MongoDB. They tend to stick around for a long time. And so it's all about making it very, very easy for customers to deploy on MongoDB. And then obviously over time, customers will come to us, when they feel like it makes sense for them to negotiate for a better discount based on a volume commitment to us. But our real focus is just getting our sales force to acquire new workloads as fast as possible.\nIttai Kidron: I guess, if that's the case if you talked about in your prepared remarks about trying to separate yourself on the pack and taking advantage of opportunities in markets like this. And clearly you had experience and history in this area. While I understand they need to be very focused in scrutinized expenses. Why not be a bit more aggressive actually go the other way and actually double down on your investment and go after those beachheads that long-term will drive really a good strong market positioning for you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. I think Michael and I and the rest of the leadership team we tend to be a group of people who have seen different environments. And I think we're trying to take a balanced approach I think we're not some people who put their heads and sand and recognize and don't recognize that there's a change in the macro environment and change in the cost of capital. So we want to make sure that we're growing but growing profitably, growing efficiently. And so we're constantly assessing what channels are working or what teams and different channels are working, what adjustments do we need to make. And as you've seen, we've been \u2013 we've not been shy about constantly evolving our business and as well as how we go to market. And so transitioning the business from a predominantly on-prem subscription business to now predominantly consumption business has required us to make lots of changes over time. And so where we take a balanced view of balancing both short-term and long-term, an earlier question you got was why not be more profitable. Now you're asking us why aren't you investing more. So that's a classic example of retention that we have to deal with.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Good luck.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Ittai.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kingsley Crane with Canaccord Genuity. You may proceed.\nKingsley Crane: Hey, thanks for taking the question. So really encouraging to see the expanded partnership with Azure. I wanted to touch on the joint focus and incentive to migrate Mongo to Atlas on Azure. So is this a discussion you're having with customers upon renewal? Are you socializing this with them sooner? And then does this make Azure the de facto preferred platform to run Mongo?\nDev Ittycheria: No. What I would say is the work that we've done with Azure and I really want to complement our partner team who did a lot of work in making that deal happen, but it's really a function of a few things. One Azure like most other cloud providers see how popular MongoDB is both with developers and how popular it is on their own clouds. Two, they recognize that their clones that they offer are just not at the same level of features and performance that MongoDB is. And three, at the risk of trying to push their clones, they can actually lose the whole customer. There remain situations where a cloud provider might push their own clone and the customer decides to run that workload run an Atlas workload on another cloud provider. And so I would say Atlas -- sorry Azure is essentially signing up to what AWS and GCP have already done, which is obviously provide incentives for customers to choose Atlas incentives for their sales force to work with us to go close more deals as well as do product integration. So, I think what this really speaks to and what customers really care about is the platform neutrality that we offer or said another way the optionality we offer for customers to essentially run their workloads anywhere, which is something that they consider very, very important in the space given the history of the space and how strategic the data platform is.\nKingsley Crane: Okay, great. Really well said. That's it for me.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Alliance Bernstein. You may proceed.\nFiroz Valliji: Hi, this is Feroz Valliji from Bernstein. And thanks for taking my question. All right. So, given that the core product is a play infrastructure -- is a core infrastructure product. And generally these kind of products are associated with long visibility in terms of spend and implementation, Is it realistically possible for customers to ramp down their buying that quickly? And then I have a follow-up.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. So, one of the benefits of the cloud is you truly create a variable cost model, right? And so one of the benefits of Atlas is you can scale up or scale down your clusters and essentially your usage based on how your business and ultimately, how the application is doing. What we're talking about is not the business going backwards, what we're talking about is that we're just seeing slower growth of these workloads. And so -- and that's really tied to the fact that our own end customers, their own business is slowing down so their need to upgrade those clusters as they -- either those existing apps grow or as they add new apps is not as high as it was say as it was two years ago. And so that's what's really happening. There's not a -- I don't want to imply that the customers are going backwards, it's just that the rate of growth is slowing down. \nFiroz Valliji: Got it. And one quick follow-up. You talk about consumption pattern being slower in Q4. Is it something that is a very broad-based trend, or is it -- would you highlight any specifics in large enterprises versus let's say digital natives or SMB customers? Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: No. As you mentioned the holiday slowdown was more pronounced. We had very limited growth in those two months and it was broad-based across industries. And then we -- similarly, the rebound that we saw in February was also broad-based. \nFiroz Valliji: Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Cikos with Needham. You may proceed.\nMike Cikos: Hey, guys. You have Mike Cikos here from Needham & Company and thanks for getting me on. I think, the first question that I had, and I know it's a little bit more backwards looking, just given the difficult comps that we're citing in the out year. But can you help us think through Enterprise Advanced? And really what I'd like to get at is, is there any way you guys can explain what drove this strength? Because it really did feel like it carried the mantle as far as the growth and outperformance that you guys were able to demonstrate throughout fiscal 2023. Is there any way to help us conceptualize what drove that from those customers? And then, I have a follow-up as well.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Mike. I don't know that I can add a ton more than what I said in response to Brent's question. But in general, we run the business on a channel basis, right? And different customers are at different spots to their cloud adoption journey. And so, as customers think about -- our goal is to make MongoDB easy for them to deploy regardless of where they are. And so, we want them to use MongoDB. Customers are increasingly looking at MongoDB Enterprise Advanced as an on-ramp to the public cloud. And, I mean, you have to remember, just to put it in the big picture, we're going after an incredibly large market, right? The market is $84 billion per IDC in 2022, going to $138 billion in 2026 and we've got about 1.5% market share. And so, there's just a lot of opportunity, combined with the fact that, even though more and more workloads are moving to the cloud, it's still a minority of workloads. And so, the opportunity set is just very large and very broad. And our goal is to make MongoDB easy for customers to use regardless of what -- where they are and what they're ready for.\nMike Cikos: Thanks for that, Michael. And then, I guess, as a follow-up, one of the things I'm trying to put together on my side and I'm guessing that my peers are doing the same. But given the guidance that we have for 1Q today and then the full year guide, can you help us think through what management thinks about, as far as the shape of consumption throughout fiscal 2024. Especially, since fiscal 2023 we had cited -- I know Q2 was below the historical trend line, 3Q was closer to the historical trend line, but still below it. Is there any way you guys can give us some better construct for the remainder of the year post this Q1 guide that we have today?\nDev Ittycheria: Maybe, a few thoughts that will help. When we look at our guide for the full fiscal year, we now have a few quarters of data under our belt in the current macroeconomic environment. And there's certainly been some sort of puts and takes. It's broadly played out in line with how we thought and there's certainly some seasonal accent points. But, in general, what we're looking at in terms of our outlook for fiscal 2024 is, Atlas cohort growth and Atlas cohort expansion consistent with what we've seen since Q2, when the macro slow down sort of first started. Obviously, if the macro environment improves, we will benefit from that. And conversely, if the environment deteriorates, that will be an adverse development for us. But that's really how we look at it. We've talked about Q3 being seasonally strong. We talked about some of the dynamics in Q4. I think we've been clear about kind of Q1 and -- but not only just in terms of what the sequential impact, but just as you're thinking about it generically just having fewer days not to mention some of the other things were to walk through, as it relates to the Q1 setup. So, I think, there's a fair amount of information, a fair amount of details there. And again, I would also just sort of revert back to the -- we really do run the business on a channel basis, but try and give people a whole bunch of information just given the different dynamics and understanding where people focus and how you're building your models and all those kinds of things.\nMike Cikos: Appreciate the context, Michael. Thank you very much.\nMichael Gordon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. You may proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Sebastian on for Jason. Can you maybe talk about any changes you saw in your ability to acquire customers or add more workloads to the Mongo Duty platform starting in January, specifically as we entered a new budget year? Was there any step-up in deal scrutiny or macro laser weakness? \nDev Ittycheria : We've seen no change in terms of our ability to acquire new workloads. I mean, we do see that the -- and we talked about this in the prepared remarks that obviously there's probably more scrutiny in many organizations about expenditures. But again, given the mission criticality of what we do the ROI that people get. These are things that -- and frankly how effective our go-to-market teams have been in navigating this hurdles has really resulted in another strong quarter of customer adds.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. And Sebastian to your question, I wouldn't assume any of that is unique to January, right. I think it's more just reflective of the current market environment broadly. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Dev Ittycheria for any closing remarks.\nDev Ittycheria : I want to thank everyone for joining our call. I just want to again reiterate that we had another strong quarter of new business performance, while Atlas consumption does remain impacted by macro headwinds. Our new business performance and customer feedback gives us a lot of confidence and optimism about our long-term prospects. We are responding to the macro headwinds by raising the bar on performance and efficiency and slowing down headcount growth and focusing on what we consider to be the highest priority investments. And I do believe that we will emerge from the slowdown stronger and even better positioned to change achieve the long-term opportunity. With that, I want to thank everyone for joining our call, and we'll speak to you soon. Take care. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the fourth quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth quarter results. And then, finish with our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2024. First, I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $361.3 million, up 36% year-over-year. As Dev mentioned, we continue to see a healthy environment for new business. To us, this is confirmation we remain a top priority for our customers and that our value proposition continues to stand out, even and sometimes especially in this market. Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 50% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 65% of total revenue, up from 58% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and 63% last quarter. As a reminder, we recognized Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely related to end-user activity of the application, which can be impacted by macroeconomic factors. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. As Dev mentioned, consumption growth in Q4 was weaker than we expected. In fact, consumption growth in Q4 was the slowest quarter of the year. As a reminder, in our prior quarterly call, we noted consumption growth in Q4 was off to a solid start with November growth similar to Q3 trends. However, we also noted that we expected to experience a seasonal slowdown for the rest of the quarter, driven by lower usage of applications during the holidays. Broadly speaking, this is what happened in Q4. However, the slowdown is more pronounced than we expected. The holiday slowdown was a global phenomenon and visible across all industries and channels. February trends showed an improvement and were in line with the average growth we've seen since the macro slowdown began in Q2 of last year. In addition, due to slower Atlas consumption growth during fiscal 2023, we recognized several million dollars of incremental revenue in Q4 from a small portion of our customers that reach the end of their contracts without having consumed their entire commitment. Revenue from contract expirations happens in the normal course of our business and is usually not a significant factor affecting our results. The higher level in Q4 is a function of the cumulative impact of lower consumption trends over the course of the year as well as Q4 having the largest number of customer contracts up for renewal. Turning to Enterprise Advanced. As you know, we faced a difficult EA compare in Q4 and that is reflected in our slower year-over-year Enterprise Advanced revenue growth. However, EA once again significantly exceeded our expectations in the quarter as we continue having success selling incremental workloads into our existing EA customer base. The continued strength of EA new business is particularly notable in this environment, given that EA required an upfront commitment. Turning to customer growth. During the fourth quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,700 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 40,800, which is up from over 33,000 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 6,400 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 4,400 in the year ago period. Q4 was another very strong quarter of direct customer net additions. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform as well as self-service customers with whom we've now established a direct sales relationship. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 39,300 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 31,500 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,651 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,307 in the year ago period. We also finished the year with 213 customers spending $1 million or more on our platform compared to 164 a year ago. Moving down the income statement. I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the fourth quarter, was $280.8 million, representing a gross margin of 78%, which is up from 74% in the year ago period. Our gross margin improvement in Q4 was positively impacted by a one-time benefit of roughly 2.5 percentage points related to one of our cloud partner contracts. We are very pleased with our gross margin progression even excluding the one-time benefit, especially in the context of Atlas representing 65% of our overall business. Our income from operations was $37.2 million, or a 10% operating margin for the fourth quarter compared to a 5% margin in the year ago period. The primary reason for our strong operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. In addition, we benefited from significantly lower-than-expected headcount growth in the fourth quarter, as we slowed down hiring and prioritized hiring to the highest-need areas. Net income in the fourth quarter was $46.4 million, or $0.57 per share based on 80.8 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $8 million, or $0.10 per share on 78.7 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the fourth quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $25.9 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $23.8 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $16.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2024. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $344 million to $348 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to the range of $10 million to $13 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.17 to $0.20 based on 84.3 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.48 billion to $1.51 billion. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect non-GAAP income from operations to the range of $69 million to $84 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to the range of $0.96 to $1.10 based on 85.1 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Note that, the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2024 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more color around our guidance starting with Q1. First, we expect Atlas revenue to be flat to slightly down sequentially in Q1. As a reminder, Q1 has three fewer days than Q4, which represents a revenue headwind. Second, weaker-than-expected Atlas consumption during the holidays will have a bigger impact on Q1 revenue than it did in Q4, thereby negatively impacting sequential revenue growth. Finally, the higher than typical unused commitments that benefited Q4 revenue are making for an incrementally harder sequential compare. On a year-over-year basis, Atlas continues to face a difficult compare as we're lapping last Q1, which is the last quarter of strong consumption growth before the macro slowdown. Second, we expect to see a meaningful sequential decline in EA revenue. As discussed in the past, Q4 is our seasonally highest quarter in terms of our EA renewal base, and our EA renewal base is an excellent indicator of our ability to win new EA business. In Q1, the base is sequentially lower, which we expect to have an impact on our ability to generate new business and the associated license revenue under ASC 606. Next, we expect operating income to decline sequentially because of the lower revenue outlook. In addition in Q1, we see a sequential expense increase because we award annual merit compensation increases to the majority of our employees. Moving on to our full year guidance, a few things to keep in mind. We expect Atlas consumption growth to continue to be impacted by the difficult macroeconomic environment throughout fiscal 2024. Our guidance assumes consumption growth that is in line with the average consumption growth we've experienced since the macro slowdown began in Q2 of last year as well as what we observed in February. Moving on to EA. Similarly to Q4 of fiscal 2023, we will begin facing very difficult compares throughout fiscal 2024. We remain confident in our ability to keep upselling our EA customer base with incremental workloads but last year's strong performance combined with the ASC 606 dynamics will represent a meaningful headwind. In terms of our operating income guidance, the key variable to keep in mind is our headcount growth, as Dev mentioned, we'll meaningfully slow down hiring this year, expecting to grow headcount in the single digits. However, in terms of year-over-year OpEx growth, keep in mind that we'll also be annualizing the impact of the 30% headcount growth we experienced last year. To summarize, MongoDB delivered solid fourth quarter results in a difficult environment. Our new business performance and strong direct customer net additions indicate the robust underlying demand for our developer data platform. The continued macro uncertainty is putting pressure on Atlas consumption and we've incorporated that into our outlook. As a result, we are modulating our pace of investments with laser focus on key priority areas and increasing efficiency across the company while still running the business for the long-term. With that, we'd like to open up to questions. Operator? Yes. So, one of the things that we'll call out Sanjit is as we have more and more data on Atlas we've tried to expose to everyone the underlying seasonal trends that we see. So, that November period that you're specifically asking about is consistent with the Q3 timeframe, which is one of the seasonally stronger periods. We had mentioned that the latter part of Q4. So, basically December and January tends to be slower and normally those kind of wash each other out. So, November would have been higher in line with Q3. And what we're seeing in February is really consistent with what we've seen since the very beginning, so sort of the average. So, if November Q3 are a little bit on the higher side and inventory is more in line with the average, you can sort of conclude where that is. Yes. The only thing that I would add, you're definitely right. We continue to have success even in this market winning new customers and winning new workloads, which speaks to the value proposition and the mission criticality. As Dev said, those customers do start out all though. We're continuing to see strong growth out of the gate for new workloads, but all workloads are affected by the macroeconomic environment. And so that's why we -- I sort of revert you back to sort of our framework, which is in the short term the outcomes are more governed by the expansion of existing allocations whereas in the long-term, especially given how -- what little penetration we have in this massive market that we're going after. In the medium to long-term, it's much more governed by our ability to continue to win new customers and new workloads. Yes, sure. As you know, we run the business on a channel basis but just given the ASC 606 dynamics at least try and provide a little bit of color for folks to understand things. So from a Q1 standpoint, we did say we expect EA to be down sequentially Q1 relative to Q4 and that's really a function of the EA renewal base. As you think about meeting the EA renewal basis lower in Q1? And then secondly, if you think about over the course of the full year, EA really is what drove a lot of the outperformance that we've seen this past year in fiscal 2023. And so what that means is that, sets up fairly tough compares for the balance of the year across EA. So I think that's just sort of important to keep in mind, as you think through the modeling and the forecast and that's tried why we provide all that color. We said in Q1, we expect a sequential decline, yes. Long term just in case, it isn't clear long-term EA continues to be a growth opportunity. While we talk a lot about public cloud and public cloud adoption in these contexts in these settings, there's still a large number of companies, and a large number of applications that people have not yet moved to the cloud and EA continues to find very strong product market fit with those customers. And as we've mentioned before is increasingly seen as an on-ramp to the public cloud. And so I think, it's an important kind of aspect of the MongoDB run anywhere strategy. Yes. Thanks, Mike. I don't know that I can add a ton more than what I said in response to Brent's question. But in general, we run the business on a channel basis, right? And different customers are at different spots to their cloud adoption journey. And so, as customers think about -- our goal is to make MongoDB easy for them to deploy regardless of where they are. And so, we want them to use MongoDB. Customers are increasingly looking at MongoDB Enterprise Advanced as an on-ramp to the public cloud. And, I mean, you have to remember, just to put it in the big picture, we're going after an incredibly large market, right? The market is $84 billion per IDC in 2022, going to $138 billion in 2026 and we've got about 1.5% market share. And so, there's just a lot of opportunity, combined with the fact that, even though more and more workloads are moving to the cloud, it's still a minority of workloads. And so, the opportunity set is just very large and very broad. And our goal is to make MongoDB easy for customers to use regardless of what -- where they are and what they're ready for. Thank you. Yes. And Sebastian to your question, I wouldn't assume any of that is unique to January, right. I think it's more just reflective of the current market environment broadly."

            "name": "Dev Ittycheria",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our fourth quarter results before giving you a broader company update. Before I do that, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that today's International Women's Day. And in particular I want to acknowledge that all the amazing women at MongoDB who make us a very special company. Now turning to our results. We generated revenue of $361 million, a 36% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 50% year-over-year, representing 65% of revenue and we had another strong quarter of customer growth ending the quarter with over 40,800 customers. Overall, we continue to execute well in Q4 despite a challenging macro environment. Before we dive into the quarter, let me remind you of the framework through how we operate the business and analyze our performance. Our principal focus is acquiring -- or said another way new applications, which is the biggest driver of our long-term growth. In our market, it's important to understand that the unit of competition is the workload, getting both new and existing customers to deploy new workflows in our data platform is our overarching goal. Once the world has been onboarded its consumption growth is not something we can meaningfully influence. Some workloads will grow faster than others depending on the underlying business drivers for their specific application, the macro environment, seasonality and other factors. While we cannot control the rate of growth of existing workloads, we do know workloads typically grow over time. So as long as we keep acquiring new workloads at a healthy rate, we are well-positioned for the long run. With that, let's discuss what we saw in Q4. We had another strong quarter of new business acquisition, adding approximately 500 net new direct sales customers and we continue to have success in new workloads in existing accounts. Unlike many of our peers, we have not seen the macro environment impact our ability to win new business. We believe this is due to a combination of the mission criticality of our platform, strong ROI and the excellent job our go-to-market teams have done navigating incremental hurdles and approvals in sales cycles. Turning to Atlas consumption trends. Q4 was below our expectations. In our Q3 call, we told you we got off to a solid start to Q4 and that we had expected to see a usage-driven holiday slowdown in the back half of Q4. This slowdown did happen, but it was more pronounced than we had anticipated impacting our Q4 results as well as our outlook. Consumption growth in February improved relative to December and January and was broadly in line with the average growth we've seen since the macro slowdown began in Q2 of last year. We continue to believe the recent fluctuations in consumption trends are largely driven by broad-based macroeconomic trends as they are occurring across different geographies, vertical markets and customer segments. Finally, retention rates remained incredibly strong in Q4, which exemplifies the value customers receive from MongoDB. As I look forward into FY 2024 and beyond, I'm excited about the opportunity I see ahead of us. My enthusiasm ultimately comes from our customers. Our value proposition and product vision clearly resonate given our new business activity, our account of 100,000-plus and million-plus customers, and our own customer conversations. For example, some of our largest and most sophisticated customers plan to meaningfully increase their MongoDB deployments. After working with them for a number of years, two global financial institutions are preparing to deploy hundreds of applications both new and existing on Atlas in the coming quarters. It's important to understand that large enterprise customers take a comprehensive and long-term view when deciding to change their operational data platform standards given the scale and complexity of their business. Both customers chose to standardize on MongoDB after a rigorous review of all available choices based on developer preference, the optionality we provide on where they can run their workloads and they're confident that we can address their demanding requirements both today and tomorrow. To remind everyone the core drivers for MongoDB's adopted include: One, customers increasingly find legacy technology and limits how quickly they can respond to changing business needs and recognize that the cost of not addressing this issue now frequently exceeds the near-term friction of making a change. A senior IT executive in the travel industry recently told us that most of the Oracle estate will transition to MongoDB. Two, MongoDB's developer platform enables customers to reduce the complexity and the cost of the technology stack by eliminating point solutions and consolidating workloads onto a single platform. This is especially relevant in the current macro environment where customers are looking to reduce the number of vendors they work with to rationalize their infrastructure and operating costs. Two of Europe's largest retailers are in the process of ripping out a myriad of legacy and niche systems and replacing the large mission critical deployments of Atlas Service and Atlas Device Link. Finally, customers understand that their business strategy directly expressed through their software applications they develop to build new products and services as well as to run their business. MongoDB's modern platform enables them to increase their pace of innovation to deliver better business performance. At a recent customer advisory board meeting, a gaming industry executive said to its peers they are standardizing on MongoDB because simply put, we make it so easy for developers to build great applications. Customer conversations like this and the ongoing strength of our new business performance makes us incredibly confident in our long-term opportunity. We will continue to invest appropriately as we believe it will create the most long-term value for the business. At the same time, we recognize we are operating in a different macro environment. This presents us with an opportunity to assess our org structure, systems and processes to ensure we are effective and efficient as possible. In fiscal 2024, we will raise the bar on our performance, enabling us to further capitalize on our long-term opportunity when macroeconomic conditions normalize. To that end, we are making a number of changes this year. We will significantly slow down our overall headcount growth in fiscal 2023. We grew headcount by 30%. We expect this number to be in the single digits in FY 2024. We remain focused in orienting all our go-to-market activities around our North Star new workload acquisition. We continue to drive cross-functional coordination to build the required systems, tools and compensation structure to acquire workloads more efficiently. We will continue to grow our quota-carrying rep count and as always, prioritize investments in regions and channels where we see the best returns. We will also reduce investments in some supporting areas. In our product and engineering organizations, we'll focus on our key priorities, including enhancing our core database and adding to our search and time series capabilities, as well as planting seeds for future growth areas. In G&A, the focus is investing in systems that can deliver automation, repeatability and scalability to drive further efficiency improvements. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. We have many customers, including companies such as Avalara, Electrolux, Bosch and Telefo\u0301nica Tech who have achieved meaningful cost savings by using MongoDB. Telefo\u0301nica Tech, a subsidiary of Telefo\u0301nica S.A. spearheads Telefo\u0301nica digital transformation service and technology and connectivity. They needed a platform with the capacity to outpace the ever-increasing device usage for 30 million IoT devices that run on their managed connectivity platform. They selected MongoDB as their primary database to deliver uninterrupted user service, while reducing expenses by 40%. Customers across different industries and geographies including Cathay Pacific, Iron Mountain, Polaris and Midland Credit Management are running mission-critical projects on MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of a developer data platform. Iron Mountain turned to MongoDB to support the expansion from providing traditional physical asset storage and shredding solutions into offering an intelligent document processing solution. Iron Mountain needed an agile solution to quickly respond to customer requests and MongoDB's document model gives them the ability to ingest data quickly with a flexible schema. MongoDB's developer data platform enables Iron Mountain's customers to search through tens of millions of documents with queries coming back in milliseconds. Many customers have migrated from legacy technology or clones of MongoDB, including Amadeus, Penske and Clear, a company that helps millions of Indian citizens with their tax returns. Penske, one of the world's largest transportation services companies selected MongoDB Atlas to modernize its customer notification platform that was originally built on relational technology which was too rigid to provide the rapid iterative development that Penske required. After migrating to MongoDB Atlas, Penske experienced increased developer productivity and the team was able to scale seamlessly, resulting in improved platform performance regardless of spikes in traffic and higher overall customer satisfaction. In summary, I am pleased with our execution in the fourth quarter. We are excited and energized about our long-term prospects. I've lived through a number of bad macro environments in my career and I remind our team almost daily that these moments offer precious growth opportunities for frontline employees, for first-time managers, senior leaders and for the entire company. I firmly believe it is in times like these that great companies separate themselves from the pack. We intend to do just that and we will emerge from the slowdown even better positioned to pursue our goal of building a generational software company. With that, here's Michael. Thanks, Sanjit. We are going after a really large opportunity. We're really pleased with our new business traction in terms of new customer acquisition and as well as new workload acquisition. But I do want to say that obviously, the new workloads we acquire have very little impact on near-term revenue. In terms of optimization, we've really seen no changes in the dynamic. The value of what we offer is tightly aligned to the value that customers see. When customers build an application they want that application to be used. They want that application to be consumed. And obviously, as it's consumed, that drives more value for them and drives more revenue for us. Now we have seen some corner cases, where some customers under significant financial duress may in a rearchitect their MongoDB clusters to have less resilience or less scale but that obviously comes with a lot more risk. And again, that's not really a sustainable approach. And so in general, our retention trends are very strong and has one CTO said on the buy-side call, we are a necessity not a luxury. So, we feel good about the long-term. It's just a function of the macro environment and the second order effects we're seeing from our own customers. Thanks Kash. I'll take the first one and then Mike will take your second question. With regards to the divergence between consumption usage or -- versus new customer acquisition, people -- just stepping back, people essentially express their business strategy through the products they build using software -- or the services they build using software and as well as how they run their business. They're striving for more efficiency, they want to capture new business opportunities, they want to respond to new threats. And obviously our platform being very modern, very flexible, highly scalable, enabling high pace of innovation is very attractive for customers to build those applications. But you have to remember most workloads start small. So, the near-term revenue impact is also small. But over time those workloads grow and consequently, that impact is greater over time. What we're seeing in terms of the divergence between new business and consumption is really a function of the second order effects we're seeing with our own customer bases. As we mentioned earlier, we're seeing transaction volumes slow, people buying less things through digital platforms, people traveling less, or maybe they're using other products and services less than they typically have been. And so the customers themselves are not seeing their businesses grow. Consequently, their need to grow their MongoDB per clusters is not as high. And so that's essentially the reason for the divergence in trends. Yes. So it's a dynamic that's always been there and it's becoming less over time. But let me explain. As I mentioned, it's something that's sort of always there. As a result of the slower growth that we've seen over the last couple of quarters, you wind up with a higher probability that someone would not have consumed their full commit. And given the preponderance of contracts that end in Q4 given that it's our highest kind of selling quarter, that's what sort of leads to this. And we're really only calling this out, so people can understand the Q1 guide. This is effectively revenue that under a normal consumption model and normal consumption patterns, we would have recognized earlier in the year, but because people were sort of consuming below their commitment level when they hit expiration that happened. To your comment these are -- remember, these are old contractors. These are all things that have been signed at least a year ago. And one of the things that we've been doing for the last couple of years is deemphasizing commitments. And so I think realistically, this is less of a factor over time. It's something that sort of always exists in the business. But given that it was worth several million dollars this quarter, we wanted to call it out just so people could understand the sequential guide for Q1. Yes, Raimo. I mean, we are basically making decisions across the business and in a surgical way. This is not some sort of broad-based slowdown. We're investing in channels and markets where we see great performance and we're slowing down that pace of investment in areas that maybe we're waiting for things to get better. On the product side, we continue to invest on product and even in new growth areas that we think will pay handsome returns in the future. I would say that we feel pretty good about our ability to respond to the changes in the market. And so we feel like we have the sales capacity we need going into this year. And we're also as we talked about very, very focused on both acquiring new customers and new workloads and we're optimizing for that not served to really increase the rate and pace of new workload acquisition. As we see good returns, we'll continue to adjust accordingly. Sure. So thanks for the question. I mean, our strategy is to evolve from being a database company to a true developer data platform. And the whole strategy behind that is to enable developers to run a broader set of use cases on MongoDB. And the benefits are quite profound, because they can use one approach, a very seamless and integrated way to address a wide variety of applications or use cases all the data stays in one place and it just becomes far easier for the organizations to manage that kind of infrastructure. We're seeing strong uptick in search across the sales force. The customer demand is high. Customers have clearly indicated that they value the fact they can consolidate everything on MongoDB versus having spoke search engine as well as some connectivity between their OLTP database and their search database. So the message is resonating and we're getting feedback on new features and capabilities that customers want to see. So we're very, very focused on the search market and that's a big priority for us to grow that segment of the business even more this coming year. We're seeing a lot of demand for time series again for the same exact reasons; customers don't want to have a bespoke solution. They don't want to have to manage and learn and manage a new technology. They want all the data in one place. And so we're seeing a lot of uptick on search -- I'm sorry, time series. We see the same for mobile. You mentioned Data Lake. We're -- basically a lot of demand for online archive where people as their MongoDB applications accumulate more and more data to be able to offload that data to lower cost storage solutions but still be able to create that data in a very effective way, as well as import other data from other sources into their platform and then be able to create that data as well. So that's an area that we see continued interest more at the higher end of the customer segment. So we're very committed to the platform strategy and customers are really resonating with that message, especially I should add in an environment where customers want to consolidate vendors this is a very effective way for them to do so. Right. So, there's a few drivers for why people would want to migrate a relational application to MongoDB. One could be performance. The needs of that application are outstripping the ability of that real database to serve great and greater demand. And so they need a more scalable platform or they need to be able to develop new features much more quickly and the data models become so brittle and so hard to add new features that their customers are getting frustrated or frankly the cost. In many situations, the cost of the relational technology is just way too expensive because of the legacy vendors, pricing policies and so customers want to go to a much more cost-effective solution. So that typically -- those are one or three of the main reasons why customers move to MongoDB. In terms of like Relational Migrator, people are starting to use that. I want to be clear that's still used by MongoDB personnel. We have not made it generally available to the market. We still -- because of the wide variety of relational applications, there's still a lot of corner cases where you need a little bit more manual intervention, but we're getting great feedback on Migrator and our whole strategy is to reduce the switching costs of moving off relational applications to MongoDB and you're going to see us continue to invest in that area. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Brent. No, it's been broad-based. The holiday slowdown that we anticipated and was more pronounced was also broad-based really across the board. And then, when we look at the recovery that we observed in February, that was also broad-based. And so I think we're seeing pretty consistent trends across industries. Great. Thanks. On the commits, we continue to have very high renewal rates. We've not seen any uptick in churn despite sort of the macro environment, which again I think underscores the mission criticality. And as it relates to commitments as I've mentioned for the last several years, last probably at least three years now, we've been deemphasizing commitments. And so that tends not to be the way that, customers think. And the scenario that you're describing, I can give you kind of like an anecdotal insight or perspective. If you think about someone who is sort of under consumed relative to their initial commitment, oftentimes that can be a result of the product that got started late, right? So they were more optimistic about how quickly they could launch their own internal application. They lost a few months, but the application is taken off and performed nicely. And so you can easily see scenarios, where they're renewing at similar or higher levels. So I wouldn't overly read into that unused commitment dynamic. We really are just exposing that to folks so people can understand the sequential guide. On profitability and on margins, maybe I'll say a couple of things. We feel very good about the performance overall. We feel good about the guide. The guide has another 100 basis points of improvement relative to fiscal 2023, once you exclude the one-time credits that we called out, we were able to \u2013 we're pleased we were able to maintain that 100 basis point improvement even after Q4 and all of fiscal 2023 came in stronger than we had expected. And so I think that's sort of important to keep in mind as well. And then the last thing, I'd say is a little bit to Dev's answer to Raimo's question, we are continuing to invest for the long term. And so this is not an attempt to cut all costs or seize all investment in the future. We believe that we're in the early innings of capitalizing on a large market opportunity. We know the cost of capital is higher. Therefore, fewer things clear the bar. We're being really judicious about making sure that we're focusing on the areas of highest return and highest priority so that we can set ourselves up well to capitalize on this long-term opportunity. Yes. So thanks for the question, Tyler. In terms of new business strength we're actually seeing it generally across the board. Our direct sales customers -- both North America, Europe and the large enterprise and SMB space have been have been quite good. That's also a function of the focus on acquiring new customers because once you get into an account that a customer will pay handsome dividends for us over the long-term. But as part of that also we're really trying to grow our existing installed base by adding new workloads from those existing customers and that's a big part of our strategy as well. And while we have less control over how those workloads grow we know we can directly control how quickly we add new customers and new workloads and that's why we're really focused on the latter. Yes. So what I've said in the past still remains true. Once we're in an account does not mean that we've become a standard. And so the job then of the accounting depending on the size of the account is to then ultimately get that organization to declare us either a de facto standard just by how popular we've become and the preference developers have or that sometimes some organizations have a very formal process to certify a new technology inside their enterprise. In either case when that happens it essentially means developers don't need to seek permission to use MongoDB that they can use MongoDB for pretty much any use case. And that does tend to unlock a wide array of new use cases for us. So for example in our strategic accounts where we've deployed more resources those are accounts that either we become the standard or very close to become the standard. And as we've talked about in the past when we become the standard the volume of new workloads that come to MongoDB just increased meaningfully, which obviously drives also more revenue for us. And so that's -- that's essentially our strategy. In terms of what's happening recently. I would say there's no change in pace in terms of the number of customers declaring as a standard. What I was trying to just explain was that these very, very large customers, when they're declaring the standard just given the scale and complexity of their business, they can't change standards for a very long time. It just doesn't operationally make sense. So when they make a decision to move to a new platform that to some degree is almost like a decade long perspective on the fact that they expect MongoDB to be their standard for the next decade plus. And that's \u2013 and so consequently the way they evaluate us in terms of our ability to address their requirements today and what they think their requirements will be in the future. Thank you. We always make small modifications of the comp plan. This year for the sales force we are really focused on new workload acquisition and we're more focused on acquiring and getting those workloads to consume and less focus as Michael mentioned, on driving big commitments. Given how sticky MongoDB workloads tend to be. We know once a customer deploys an app on MongoDB. They tend to stick around for a long time. And so it's all about making it very, very easy for customers to deploy on MongoDB. And then obviously over time, customers will come to us, when they feel like it makes sense for them to negotiate for a better discount based on a volume commitment to us. But our real focus is just getting our sales force to acquire new workloads as fast as possible. Yes. I think Michael and I and the rest of the leadership team we tend to be a group of people who have seen different environments. And I think we're trying to take a balanced approach I think we're not some people who put their heads and sand and recognize and don't recognize that there's a change in the macro environment and change in the cost of capital. So we want to make sure that we're growing but growing profitably, growing efficiently. And so we're constantly assessing what channels are working or what teams and different channels are working, what adjustments do we need to make. And as you've seen, we've been \u2013 we've not been shy about constantly evolving our business and as well as how we go to market. And so transitioning the business from a predominantly on-prem subscription business to now predominantly consumption business has required us to make lots of changes over time. And so where we take a balanced view of balancing both short-term and long-term, an earlier question you got was why not be more profitable. Now you're asking us why aren't you investing more. So that's a classic example of retention that we have to deal with. Thanks, Ittai. No. What I would say is the work that we've done with Azure and I really want to complement our partner team who did a lot of work in making that deal happen, but it's really a function of a few things. One Azure like most other cloud providers see how popular MongoDB is both with developers and how popular it is on their own clouds. Two, they recognize that their clones that they offer are just not at the same level of features and performance that MongoDB is. And three, at the risk of trying to push their clones, they can actually lose the whole customer. There remain situations where a cloud provider might push their own clone and the customer decides to run that workload run an Atlas workload on another cloud provider. And so I would say Atlas -- sorry Azure is essentially signing up to what AWS and GCP have already done, which is obviously provide incentives for customers to choose Atlas incentives for their sales force to work with us to go close more deals as well as do product integration. So, I think what this really speaks to and what customers really care about is the platform neutrality that we offer or said another way the optionality we offer for customers to essentially run their workloads anywhere, which is something that they consider very, very important in the space given the history of the space and how strategic the data platform is. Thank you. Sure. So, one of the benefits of the cloud is you truly create a variable cost model, right? And so one of the benefits of Atlas is you can scale up or scale down your clusters and essentially your usage based on how your business and ultimately, how the application is doing. What we're talking about is not the business going backwards, what we're talking about is that we're just seeing slower growth of these workloads. And so -- and that's really tied to the fact that our own end customers, their own business is slowing down so their need to upgrade those clusters as they -- either those existing apps grow or as they add new apps is not as high as it was say as it was two years ago. And so that's what's really happening. There's not a -- I don't want to imply that the customers are going backwards, it's just that the rate of growth is slowing down. No. As you mentioned the holiday slowdown was more pronounced. We had very limited growth in those two months and it was broad-based across industries. And then we -- similarly, the rebound that we saw in February was also broad-based. Maybe, a few thoughts that will help. When we look at our guide for the full fiscal year, we now have a few quarters of data under our belt in the current macroeconomic environment. And there's certainly been some sort of puts and takes. It's broadly played out in line with how we thought and there's certainly some seasonal accent points. But, in general, what we're looking at in terms of our outlook for fiscal 2024 is, Atlas cohort growth and Atlas cohort expansion consistent with what we've seen since Q2, when the macro slow down sort of first started. Obviously, if the macro environment improves, we will benefit from that. And conversely, if the environment deteriorates, that will be an adverse development for us. But that's really how we look at it. We've talked about Q3 being seasonally strong. We talked about some of the dynamics in Q4. I think we've been clear about kind of Q1 and -- but not only just in terms of what the sequential impact, but just as you're thinking about it generically just having fewer days not to mention some of the other things were to walk through, as it relates to the Q1 setup. So, I think, there's a fair amount of information, a fair amount of details there. And again, I would also just sort of revert back to the -- we really do run the business on a channel basis, but try and give people a whole bunch of information just given the different dynamics and understanding where people focus and how you're building your models and all those kinds of things. We've seen no change in terms of our ability to acquire new workloads. I mean, we do see that the -- and we talked about this in the prepared remarks that obviously there's probably more scrutiny in many organizations about expenditures. But again, given the mission criticality of what we do the ROI that people get. These are things that -- and frankly how effective our go-to-market teams have been in navigating this hurdles has really resulted in another strong quarter of customer adds. I want to thank everyone for joining our call. I just want to again reiterate that we had another strong quarter of new business performance, while Atlas consumption does remain impacted by macro headwinds. Our new business performance and customer feedback gives us a lot of confidence and optimism about our long-term prospects. We are responding to the macro headwinds by raising the bar on performance and efficiency and slowing down headcount growth and focusing on what we consider to be the highest priority investments. And I do believe that we will emerge from the slowdown stronger and even better positioned to change achieve the long-term opportunity. With that, I want to thank everyone for joining our call, and we'll speak to you soon. Take care."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Brian Denyeau from ICR. Please go ahead.\nBrian Denyeau: Thank you, Carmen. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to review MongoDB's third quarter fiscal 2023 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of market today. Joining me on the call today are Dev Ittycheria, President and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance and our planned investments. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the adverse macroeconomic environment and their impacts on our business, results of operations and clients that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion on certain risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on September 2, 2022. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them, except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $334 million, a 47% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 61% year-over-year, representing 63% of revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 39,100 customers. Overall, we are pleased with our performance and execution in Q3 despite the challenging macro environment. Let me give you a bit more context on what we saw in Q3. We had another strong quarter of new business. We added over 500 direct sales customers, and we keep winning new workloads in existing accounts from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies. Our new business from Enterprise Advanced also significantly exceeds our expectations, which is particularly notable in this environment given that EA requires an upfront commitment. Turning to Atlas consumption trends. We have seen an improvement in Q3 versus Q2, albeit still below historical levels. Michael will cover this in more detail. Finally, retention rates remained very strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission-criticality of our platform. Indeed, our Q3 results are an indication that our value proposition resonates with customers even in a difficult macro environment. Let me remind you of the key pillars of our developer data platform. First, MongoDB enables the customers to unleash developer productivity. The more productive developers are, the faster the organizations can innovate. The document model, which underpins MongoDB, has proven to be the best way for developers to work with data because it aligns well with how developers think and code. Second, MongoDB supports the performance and scale requirements of the most demanding modern applications. MongoDB is built from the ground up as a distributed platform and allows organizations to easily and cost effectively scale their applications to address the most exacting performance requirements. Third, MongoDB allows enterprises to remove enormous complexity and cost out of their technology stack. MongoDB is a general-purpose platform capable of serving a broad array of use cases, including transactional, time series, mobile, search and application-driven analytics. MongoDB continues to be the most popular modern data platform with developers. In the last 12 months alone, our open source community server has been downloaded more than [115 million] times from our website, which is more than in our entire company history through the beginning of 2020. And in Q3 alone, we had over 300,000 sign-ups for Atlas free tier, which is up 15x over the last five years. We also see growing evidence for how our value proposition resonates with IT decision-makers who are known for their focus on ROI, especially in economic environments, such as the one we're in today. Customers who are moving to the cloud at scale such as companies in the financial services industry are increasingly choosing MongoDB as their underlying data platform to modernize their application portfolio. IT decision makers value not being locked into any 1 environment. And by building apps on MongoDB, customers preserve their ability to run these apps on premise, on any cloud and to easily switch between cloud providers. IT decision makers are also increasingly interested in consolidating vendors. By virtue of MongoDB's broad support for a wide variety of use cases as a general purpose platform, customers can run most workloads on MongoDB rather than a disjointed set of narrow point solutions that increase the cost and complexity of the data architecture. Finally, we continue to gain mind share with our partners, and we see them leaning into co-selling with MongoDB as they also want to leverage the popularity and value of our offerings. Starting with the cloud providers. All three hyperscalers now showcase MongoDB Atlas on their consoles to make it easier for the customers to sign up for Atlas given the increasing popularity of using MongoDB in the cloud. A number of large systems integrators are in the process of setting up business units focused on MongoDB given the size of the growing MongoDB practice. A growing number of ISVs continue to build their products in MongoDB. We currently have close to 200 ISVs co-selling relationships, which is up more than 2x compared to two years ago. Our growing popularity has tangible benefits for our business, especially in periods of economic uncertainty. In times like these, customers typically default to vendors they know and trust and with whom they can consolidate spend while reducing overall costs. We see the current environment as an opportunity to establish ourselves as an enterprise standard with more of our customers. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. The following customers are running mission-critical apps in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of developer data platform, incorporating services such as search, in-app analytics and mobile services. These include Toyota Financial Services, Ulta Beauty, Mediastream and Vodafone. Vodafone is the world-leading telecoms company with over 625 million global customers in 65 countries. Vodafone is creating hundreds of new cloud-native apps. Underpinning these apps is MongoDB Atlas, which provides a scalable, resilient and flexible data platform. Atlas also supports Vodafone's IoT ecosystem of 140 million-plus devices. MongoDB is a part of a suite of fully vetted tools that Vodafone allows developers to use to build any application. Several MongoDB customers are embarking on their digital transformation journey by choosing MongoDB Atlas and migrating from on-premise to the cloud, including American Tire Distributors, Schwarz IT and Volvo Group. Schwarz IT, part of the Schwarz Group, uses MongoDB's Enterprise Advanced on-prem to drive innovation and fuel their own cloud service. With more than 13,000 locations across 32 countries and brands like Lidl and Kaufland, Schwarz Group is Europe's largest retail company. Their internal IT arm, Schwarz IT, works both internal teams and external customers to ensure smooth operations of their tech stack. Schwarz IT also runs STACKIT, a cloud provider that offers its customers all the benefits of cloud deployment while ensuring that data is stored in Germany under EU regulations. In 2022, STACKIT launched a MongoDB service to help their customers modernize apps and services and improve performance. Hugging Face, Okta, Washington Post, Cisco and L&T-SuFin, a B2B e-commerce platform, are currently developing a number of applications across different parts of the business and significantly expanded the use of MongoDB Atlas throughout their tech stack. Hugging Face, a fast-growing AI company, migrated from MongoDB Community to MongoDB Atlas to scale their open source platform and online community for machine learning. Their company's shift to Atlas allowed them to rely on our developer data platform for software and security compliance, take advantage of chain streams to speed decision-making, simplify the infrastructure through a single control plane for managing data and reduce time spent on maintenance through Atlas' integrated services. In summary, I am pleased with our execution in the third quarter. We had another strong quarter of new business, demonstrating that our value proposition continues to resonate in the marketplace and with developers, IT decision makers and partners alike. We are pleased to see a rebound in Atlas consumption in Q3, and continue to closely monitor usage trends. We remain focused on winning new workloads with new and existing customers, and are committed to profitable growth as we pursue our enormous market opportunity.  With that, here's Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the third quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $333.6 million, up 47% year-over-year. As Dev mentioned, we continue to see a healthy environment for new business. Thus, this is confirmation that we remain a top priority for our customers, and our value proposition continues to stand out even in this market. Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 61% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 63% of total revenue compared to 58% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and 64% last quarter. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenue based on customer consumption of our platform, and that consumption is closely related to end-user activity of the application, which can be impacted by macroeconomic factors. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. Overall consumption trends improved compared to what we saw in Q2, though they are not back to historical levels. Specifically, there are a couple of trends worth noting. First, we saw a bounce back in areas that were below our expectation in Q2, namely the mid-market channel globally and our enterprise business in Europe. Second, we saw stronger sequential growth in underlying application usage in Q3 versus Q2, a trend observed across most industries and geographies. We observed a similar pattern last year, and we believe that this may be an emerging seasonal effect. Turning to Enterprise Advanced. EA significantly exceeded our expectations in the quarter, and we have continued having success selling incremental workloads into our existing EA customer base. As a reminder, under ASC 606, the term license component of the entire deal value is recognized as revenue upfront. This leads to the increased variability and reduced comparability of our EA results and is particularly impacted by multiyear EA deals. This quarter, we benefited from more multiyear EA deals than anticipated. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by over 2,100 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 39,100, which is up from over 31,000 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 5,900 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 3,900 in the year ago period. Q3 was another very strong quarter of direct customer net additions. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform as well as self-serve customers with whom we've now established a direct sales relationship. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas which had over 37,600 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 29,500 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth rate in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,545 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,201 in the year ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $247.8 million, representing a gross margin of 74%, which is up from 73% in the year ago period. Our year-over-year margin improvement is primarily driven by improved efficiencies that we are realizing in Atlas. Our income from operations was $19.8 million or a 6% operating margin for the third quarter compared to a 3% margin in the year ago period. The primary reason for our strong operating profit results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. In addition, our operating profit benefited from the steps we've taken to moderate the growth rate of expenses as we prudently manage our investments in the current environment. Net income in the third quarter was $18.7 million or $0.23 per share based on 80.4 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $2.6 million or $0.03 per share on 78.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was negative $5.7 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.7 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $8.4 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of negative $9.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2023. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $334 million to $337 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $6 million to $8 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.08 based on [83.3 million] estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.257 billion to $1.26 billion. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $30.8 million to $32.8 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.31 based on 80.2 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. I'll now provide some more context around our guidance. First, in Q4, we expect slower sequential Atlas consumption growth than we experienced in Q3, but better than what we saw in Q2. We're encouraged by the improvement in consumption trends we saw during Q3. But as noted earlier, we believe some of that was driven by seasonality from which we will not benefit in Q4. Second, given the significant outperformance of EA in Q3, we do not expect a sequential uptick in EA revenue between Q3 and Q4. Finally, on a full year basis, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 2.5% at the midpoint of our guidance, about a 1 percentage point improvement compared to last year. We have consistently demonstrated operating leverage each year since going public, improving margins by over 35 percentage points over that time period. We will look to continue improving our margin profile over time, and we are pleased with our rate of progress this year. To summarize, MongoDB delivered strong third quarter results. Our new business performance and strong direct net customer additions indicate the robust underlying demand for our developer data platform. We are pleased to see an improvement in the Atlas consumption trends in Q3. We'll continue monitoring the environment and investing responsibly in pursuit of our long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question please. It's from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan : So Dev and Michael, just wondering what you've seen in the month of November with respect to consumption trends? And what do you make of the new Atlas wins in the quarter? I would assume that given that there was a lot of belt tightening in the quarter from a macro standpoint, rates went up. These new customers are probably even more discerning customers. They've plans with MongoDB are probably even more certain than the customers that might have been part of other cohorts. And as you look into calendar '23, what is your outlook for how you think about consumption patterns as your Atlas customer base becomes bigger and easier to predict, not easy but easier to predict?\nDev Ittycheria : You want to start with the Atlas wins? Yes. So one is the -- Kash, first, thanks for the question. I'm going to first start with the Atlas wins, and then I'll have Michael talk about consumption trends in November. First, the key thing that I think people understand is that software is central to every company's value proposition. And in recent discussions with customers, our own customer advisory board, in the field and more recently last week at re:Invent, our customers are very focused on modernizing to drive more differentiation, operational efficiency and agility. And so the platform message that we are out there with really resonates because, one, it enables high developer productivity, so people can do more with less. The platform enables customers to consolidate on one solution versus connecting and stitching together a point of distorted tools. So it reduces cost and complexity of the data architecture. And all this provides a very compelling ROI, which really drives those new customer additions.\nMichael Gordon : And just on the consumption questions, a few thoughts, Kash. First of all, Q4 generally does not see anything that we would describe as a seasonal benefit. When we look at the November patterns, they were consistent with Q3 and that effectively implies that the latter part of the quarter will be slower growth because in general, we haven't historically seen anything that looks like seasonal growth in Q4. So that will give you a sense for the balance of this year. And as it relates to fiscal '24, we're obviously not providing guidance right now. We'll update that in the March call. It's obviously good to see the continued success in new business as well as the recovery in those growth rates, but it's certainly a very fluid macro environment and we're monitoring the situation closely.\nOperator: It's from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel.\nBrad Reback : So last quarter, you guys talked about the digital-native customers being a big problem from a consumption basis. Have those businesses now sort of stabilized at a consistent level?\nMichael Gordon : Yes. So a couple of things. Thanks for the question, Brad. I wouldn't have described it as a problem, but we did kind of sliced and diced the consumption behavior to see what we were exposed to folks what we're seeing, including what areas where we were seeing slower growth. Of which, that part of the mid-market demonstrated that behavior. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we saw a rebound in consumption across the board, but including the mid-market, everywhere across geographies and across industries and also in Europe. So not all the way back to historical levels, but improved versus Q2.\nBrad Reback : That's great. And then on the OpEx side, I know you guys aren't guiding for next year, but Dev and Michael, you both talked about the leverage you guys have generated since IPO, and the results this quarter were astounding. Is there any reason to believe that OpEx won't meaningfully grow slower than revenue next year?\nMichael Gordon : Yes. So as I said, we're not going to guide as it relates to fiscal '24. You can see that the implied guide for fiscal '23 is 100 basis points improvement in terms of the year-over-year margin on the op income side. We're very pleased with that, and we'll obviously, as we work through our plans over next year, monitor the environment and everything else. I would just add that we have always had a fairly granular view of things in terms of our returns framework and the returns, evaluating and assessing the returns that we're getting out of different investments. We continue to apply that framework, although obviously, the market environment has changed, which sort of implicitly means that the return threshold has gone up. And we've applied that scrutiny, and we'll likely do that as we get through the fiscal '24 guide.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And it comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin : Dev, the big surprise for us here is the momentum you're seeing in that EA business. We're seeing some of the peers obviously see moderation just as the overall tech market starts to do more belt tightening. What drove the strength in EA this quarter, specifically? And if you could provide any color by industry, that's really the question here, what type of industry is driving the momentum and driving the upside here in EA specifically?\nDev Ittycheria : Yes. Thanks, Brent. I think what we saw in EA is just evidence that customers are really viewing MongoDB to be an important part, if not a standard, in their tech stack. And once you are viewed as a critical element of the tech stack, people are more comfortable investing more aggressively, especially in this environment where people do need to modernize their legacy platforms to drive more efficiency and lower cost as well as drive more agility. So I think that's, I think, why we're seeing the upside on EA. And so we feel good about that. And obviously, this shows you that customers also like optionality by building apps on MongoDB, they can truly run their apps anywhere, not only on-premise but on any hyperscaler and obviously switch between on-premise or any hyperscalers. So that is also a very compelling benefit to customers in this environment.\nBrent Bracelin : Helpful color. And then a quick follow-up for Michael here. Short-term deferred growth did slow. I didn't know if there was an impact on payment timing or if you saw a similar slowdown in RPO. So could you just kind of walk through short-term deferred and why it slowed? And if we should expect a similar slowdown in RPO?\nMichael Gordon : Yes. So what I would just point you to, Brent, is that we've talked about that deferred in general and sort of calculated billings more broadly, is not a particularly relevant metric for us, as we've talked about for a few years now, as we continue to make it as easy as possible for customers to adopt usage of our platform, which then allows them to subsequently expand. We have deemphasized upfront commitments and tried to streamline that sort of upfront part of the negotiation. And so that has a natural consequence from a balance sheet perspective as sort of flowing through there. And that's where you see it. And that's why we tend to talk about that as being less relevant for our business.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And it comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow : Congrats from me as well, and two quick questions. Michael, on staying on that EA, one, was there anything like in terms of Q4 deals that kind of got pulled into Q3, et cetera, that make like the Q3 performance like that there were one-off? I consider or was it just like a general performance being better. And then one for Dev, like in this sort of environment, there tends to be -- well, there is a tendency to go back to the established platform. What are you seeing in terms of new customer projects starting and going to Mongo, but also in terms of cleanup of like legacy Oracle, legacy IBM and stuff like that and people consolidating on the platforms of those movements? Are those initiatives happening as we speak?\nMichael Gordon: Raimo, thanks for the question. On the pull forwards, no, we did not see any particular pull activity. The only thing I'd call out, which I mentioned in the script on the EA, is we saw a little more multiyear in EA, which under 606, drives a little more revenue, but no pull forwards.\nDev Ittycheria : Yes. In regards to the question about...\nMichael Gordon : Engagement at current level.\nDev Ittycheria : Yes, platform. So we are definitely seeing customers continue to choose us and standardize us in terms of using Atlas. And the breadth of the platform is really attracting customers to use MongoDB in a wide variety of ways. And so we feel really good about the win rates. We feel really good about our engagement with customers. And obviously, you saw that in the new customer wins. The new customer wins were quite strong.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And it comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the question and very impressive set of Q3 results. Dev, if I go back to the pandemic, some of the initiatives that you guys put in place that really served you well coming out of the pandemic, you saw the new customer adds really accelerate in 2020 as you sort of focus on sort of just onboarding customers at lower overall spend levels. In terms of the playbooks that could unfold in 2023, what sort of your playbook that you're going to be focusing the team more on sort of the app modernization use case? Is it going to be about further accelerating the customer adds? How are you sort of thinking about the sales playbook as we go into calendar 2023?\nDev Ittycheria : Right. Thanks, Sanjit. I just want to make the point that it was actually pre-pandemic that we decided to make it much more easy for customers to engage with us by both changing sales compensation incentives as well as making it easier for customers to commercially engage with us. And obviously, that paid, to your point, paid huge dividends for us during the pandemic. What I will tell you is that it's really more of the same. We're really hyper focused on acquiring new customers and adding more workloads from existing customers, and that's across the board, across every channel, every industry and every customer segment. So that is something that we care a lot about. And we're seeing that now and expand in terms of getting customers now to adopt some of the new capabilities we've rolled out to the marketplace. So as I talked about in my prepared remarks, we're seeing a lot of customers embrace the full suite of the platform. So that drives incremental workloads that we would not have gotten in the past. And so we feel really good about that, and that's our real focus. It's all about acquiring new workloads and getting more and more people to build apps on MongoDB.\nSanjit Singh : And then just one quick follow-up for Michael. You referred to the sort of ROI framework and what sort of alluding to like a higher bar, given the current environment. Could you give us a sense of like what the team is prioritizing more and what may be following kind of below the line or being deprioritized as you think about driving both sustaining growth, but also extracting more efficiencies in the business?\nMichael Gordon : Yes. I'll do my best to try and kind of walk you through it. I mean I think you kind of have to run sort of type of investment versus type of investment. And obviously, ultimately, we look across the entirety of the portfolio, whether it's go to market or R&D or things like that. But it's probably easiest to think about within the different buckets and flavors as it relates today as sort of those teams effectively compete for capital. And so within the go-to-market, we obviously are looking at the returns that we're generating. We are continuing to invest. We are continuing to hire and grow within the teams, but we're backing the areas that are having the most success in delivering us the highest returns. Go-to-market is a little bit easier to measure quantitatively and on a short-term basis. On the R&D side, things take a little bit longer to play out. And you've got a little bit of a lag between when you make the investment and when you see the payback. But we certainly have conversations at a fairly detailed and granular level, even within the R&D side about where do we think we're seeing the most success and the most traction in which areas do we want to incrementally lean into versus which areas do you maybe want to deprioritize relative to the areas generating the highest returns.\nDev Ittycheria : Yes. If I can just add, it's like, for example, like in the marketing side of this digital programs, we were -- we do a lot of experimentation of what's working. So we have a certain return thresholds. And so if we don't see those programs working, we'll shut them down. Similarly, in the sales organization, there are certain teams that are outperforming, we'll invest more. In other teams, they are not and will potentially slow down. So we're just really doing more of the same and just being very rigorous about that.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And it comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhil Winslow : Congrats on a great quarter. A question for you Michael and a follow-up for Dev. When you think about just new workloads, new application go-lives and the trends that you're seeing there, wondering if you can cross that with what you've maybe seen in previous quarters, or maybe even last year? Obviously, you talked about just overall consumption, but curious about the new apps, the go-lives and the ramp of those. In terms of what you can control in go-to-market, Dev, how do you feel about sales productivity relative to the sort of these new apps, those go lives, new customer wins, et cetera?\nDev Ittycheria : Yes. I mean I think what we're really seeing in terms of these new workloads and sales productivity is that our customer base is very diversified both in terms of the types of customers as well as the types of use cases. That's the benefit of having a general-purpose platform. So clearly, we have start-ups who are building potentially new industries or disrupting existing ones. And then we have large companies moving quickly to transform different parts of their business. So it really varies. So clearly, with the platform play now, we're seeing a lot more interest in search, in search workloads and consolidating search workloads on top of MongoDB. We're seeing a lot of interest in time series, being able to again have one unified developer experience. Time series leads to things that what I talked about is application-driven analytics where people want to be able to get meaningful insights of their business, automates human decision-making into applications. So those use cases are getting more and more popular with customers. But then we have still a lot of the classic bread and butter use cases that customers are using us for. And in terms of sales productivity, what I would say is it's really a function of their -- the quality of their pipeline and how quickly they can add new workloads to our platform and how quickly we can acquire new customers. So we're really focused, and the sales leadership team is very, very focused on both things, acquiring new customers and acquiring these workloads. It's less about is one workload providing a better ROI than other? It's really a function of the customers' requirements and what they're most interested and focused on.\nMichael Gordon : And Phil, just to the cohort part of your question, it really -- it's probably easiest to think about in the context of when you bring a new customer on, and you think about the changes that we made a few years ago and how that drove incremental velocity. We've continued to see good and consistent behavior with those cohorts. I would just remind you and call out that those changes and where sort of the bulk of the customer adds come from is more in the mid-market, right? And so those tend to be spending less than the average direct sales customer. And so it's just important to keep that in mind as people are building their models and thinking about the long-term impact of that.\nPhil Winslow : Congrats again. Really awesome.\nDev Ittycheria : Thanks, Phil.\nMichael Gordon : Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our question. And it comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair.\nJason Ader : So how do you interpret the bounce back, especially mid-market European enterprise when seemingly macro is getting worse? And I have a follow-up.\nMichael Gordon : Yes. So the first thing I'd say, with Jason is it really relates to the underlying usage of the application, right? If you think about sort of what drives consumption within Atlas, I think that's the critical thing. And so when you think about the usage, we're seeing stronger underlying usage. We were always in a growth environment. What we saw in Q2 was slower growth in the mid-market and in Europe. Those rebounded again, not all the way back to historic levels, but improved levels relative to Q2. Part of our thought process, which we shared in the prepared remarks, is that we believe it's a bit of an emerging seasonal trend, which particularly relates to sort of people coming back from summer vacations and things of that because you'll recall in our September call, we talked about August being in line with what we've seen in Q2. And so that sort of suggests the improvement that we saw in September and October. We saw that same dynamic in the year ago period. And while we only have a couple of years that are COVID affected where we've got Atlas at scale, that's kind of our best current working theory. But we can see it in terms of the underlying usage of the applications. The other thing I'd say more broadly from a macro standpoint that I think is impressive, is on the new business side. We continue to win there. We continue to have our value prop resonate. We haven't seen sort of those increasing deal cycles and other things like that, that others have seen. We obviously are monitoring the situation closely, but we've been really pleased from that standpoint.\nJason Ader : Great. And then one quick follow-up for you, Dev, just on cloud marketplaces. Is that something that you guys are going to be able to talk about in terms of, I don't know, any metrics, growth rates, percentage of business going through cloud marketplaces? Because it does seem like, broadly speaking, more third-party software is going through these marketplaces, and it seems like that's a really good thing at a lot of levels.\nDev Ittycheria : Yes, I'm not sure that we're going to be sharing like quarterly stats on how things are going, but we definitely provide color. I think what -- the fact that across all three hyperscalers, customers can go to their consoles and be able to sign up for Atlas is a meaningful thing. It gives us an access to a whole new customer base that we may not have direct relationship with, and also speaks to the popularity of customers wanting to use MongoDB in the cloud. And so I think those two things have really driven that. There's not many companies who can say that they are on the consoles of all three hyperscalers.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. That comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke : I wanted to ask you first about the EA performance. Obviously, a really strong number on pretty tough comps. As we think about Q4, it looks like you're guiding Q4 to be flat sequentially from Q3, which in the last two years you've kind of guided up 7% last year and 4%. Is there something you're seeing in terms of timing on the EA business that would drive a sub-seasonal guide for Q4? Or maybe you're just layering in more macro conservatism given the environment out there? But if you could just kind of unpack your view on the EA business and overall outlook in Q4.\nMichael Gordon : Sure. Thanks, Tyler. We obviously don't guide by product, but maybe a couple of things I can say about Q4. First of all, as I mentioned, it was obviously an incredibly strong EA quarter, with EA growing 26% year-over-year. And so as we look out at Q4, it doesn't make a ton of sense to -- as we look at the business, to think that we're going to meaningfully improve sequentially from an EA perspective, given how incredibly strong Q3 was. And then we talked a little bit on the Atlas side around Q4 doesn't benefit from the seasonal tailwinds that Q3 does. And so I think on a sequential basis, those are the key factors to keep in mind.\nTyler Radke : Great. And it sounded like you talked about some -- certainly some improvements in consumption on Atlas. But if I look at the sequential dollar growth in Atlas in Q3 versus Q2, it was down a bit. Could you just kind of square with improving expansion rates, why would the sequential dollar adds be down? Is it kind of a reflection of new business? Or just help us understand the moving pieces there?\nDev Ittycheria : Yes. I think it's mostly a reflection of the starting ARR. So you're basically starting with the compounding slower growth. And so when you think about the entry point, whether it's Q3 in terms of for the second half of the year or Q4 for the final quarter of the year, you've seen several months of slower growth. And so that means at the beginning ARR is lower on an absolute basis. And even if the growth rates were to revert, the number would be lower just by virtue of the fact that the starting ARR is lower.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] One moment for our next question please. And it comes from the line of Fred Havemeyer with Macquarie.\nFred Havemeyer : I was interested also in cloud marketplaces and just kind of a follow-up around that. With the announcement of cloud marketplaces, even today, you're showing more integration with -- for example, today, like Microsoft's entire data platform. What is it that is drawing these -- or what are you doing correctly here that's drawing these hyperscalers that have their own competitive database offerings to not just sell your product, but potentially partner with MongoDB and provide it through the platform? And then I have a follow-up as well.\nDev Ittycheria : Yes. Fred, I think what that really speaks to is just the power of the MongoDB platform and the product market fit that's evidenced by how popular we are. I mean we are truly the most popular modern data platform in the world. And so -- and a lot of -- majority of those users tend to run MongoDB in the cloud. So each of the hyperscalers see a lot of MongoDB usage on each of the clouds. Yes, you're right. In the early days, they tried more to compete than to partner. And frankly, a lot of people, when we first went public, were skeptical about how we could actually build a cloud business when trying to compete with the hyperscalers. Obviously, we've proven the ability to do that. And I think that's also evidence of the fact that customers are also more discerning, and they're not just going to take the a la carte in many choice. They're going to be very judicious in their evaluation process. And given our -- the value we provide, I think you're seeing the hyperscalers recognize that. And by the way, the hyperscalers also benefit from our growth. They benefit both from the underlying consumption of storage and compute of Atlas as well as that those customers that they win, who are running Atlas workloads in their clouds, then buy other ancillary services themselves. So it ends up truly being a win-win relationship. And I think that's why you're seeing the hyperscalers essentially engage with us more deeply.\nFred Havemeyer : And then a follow-up, it's multi-cloud again related. But I wanted to ask about multi-cloud clusters because I think it's one of the more unique offerings that you have Atlas out of the box. Just generally, could you help us or just describe where you're seeing customer adoption trends with your multi-cloud cluster capability and replicase capabilities? .\nDev Ittycheria : Yes. I mean, the trend is -- I mean what we're seeing is there's a lot of customer interest on this capability. One, depending on the customers' needs, they could be -- they may have a preferred hyperscaler, but they're expanding into a geographic region where that hyperscaler may only have one region or no regions and they want some diversity across hyperscales in case that region goes down. And so they want the benefit of being able to quickly switch over to another hyperscaler. The other thing that we see is, obviously, as these hyperscalers compete with each other and offer a differentiated set of services, customers want to be able to leverage some services offer in one hyperscaler versus another, even though maybe they're preferred hyperscaler does not offer such a service. And then third, there's always the benefit of avoiding lock in and being able to diversify their workloads across different hyperscalers. And again, just to be clear, the multi-cloud cluster essentially enables customers to run one app or one workload across multiple clouds. So that is profoundly different than what most people can offer today.\nFred Havemeyer : Congratulations on a strong quarter.\nMichael Gordon : Thanks, Fred.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. It's from Mike Cikos with Needham & Company.\nMike Cikos : I had a two quarter to start, and I just wanted to come back to the Atlas consumption trends improving quarter-over-quarter in Q3. It sounds like things really began to improve in September. I just wanted to see, was it stable from there on out? Or did you see continuing strength even from September when we think about how October and November played out? And then on a relative basis, are there certain pockets of the market which have maybe a larger delta versus those historical consumption trends you're talking to? And then I do have a follow-up.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So generally, I would say it was broad-based as we described. The rebound was most perceptible in the sense of the mid-market globally and Europe, but only because those are the areas where we had seen slower growth that we called out in Q2. And we talked about, like I said, August being in line with Q2. And so September and October were stronger. And then just to continue, I don't want to get into like a day-by-day reading here, but we did see that behavior. And so -- and that shows up in the results, and that's also consistent with what we saw sort of in the year ago period. Hence, the commentary about this emerging seasonal trend.\nMike Cikos : And the follow-up I had, I just kind of wanted to paint out a scenario for you guys and just to soundboard an idea, if you will. I'm looking at where we have the 4Q guide today. Call this year-to-year growth rate you guys are targeting for about 26% at the midpoint. And the reason I'm bringing this up if I think about how this year has played out, you guys are going to have a tough comp in the first half of next year with 50% plus growth that you guys delivered in the first half of this year as well as strength from EA. And so the reason I'm bringing this up is if I look at next year, the consensus is currently at, call it, mid- to high 20s percent growth rate versus the exit velocity of this year where we're looking at 26%. And at least from a qualitative perspective, can you provide us any directional comments as far as whether or not that appears to be the right ballpark? Is that aggressive? How should we be thinking about next year's growth?\nMichael Gordon : Yes. I think the key thing is we'll obviously update that in the March call. We've tried to give you the best lay of the land as we can for the current fiscal year and what we see for Q4. It certainly is a fluid and uncertain macro environment. We're monitoring that closely, and we'll obviously update everyone in the March call around our outlook.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. That comes from Steve Koenig with SMBC Nikko.\nSteve Koenig : I'll just ask one here. Congrats on the quarter and the rebound here. I'm wondering when it comes to new customers and/or new workloads, given kind of the macro environment and the pressures on business, both SMB and enterprise, what are you guys seeing in terms of customer behavior with respect to how they size the deals or the versions they choose? How does kind of that economic sensitivity manifesting itself in terms of those new deals kind of pricing wise or kind of the scale of the deal?\nDev Ittycheria : Yes. So Steve, thanks for your question. We haven't seen any discernible change in deal dynamics in Q3. And clearly, our EA results, in our opinion, it demonstrates the power of our platform and the ability for customers and the interest of customers running workloads anywhere. What I will say is we've been through -- I personally have been through, in the public company context, 2008, and also lived through 2000 as well. And in these kinds of situations, we definitely recognize that there's more scrutiny by customers on deals and probably approval levels go up the food chain. And so what we are obviously working closely with our sales teams on is to making sure that they rigorously qualify their forecast and to make sure that they really understand the decision process that customers have to go through to get deals done. But that is something that we have lived through in previous cycles, and that's something that we are going to be very focused on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with KeyBanc.\nMichael Turits : I want to come back to seasonality. So there's all different seasonality in different parts of your underlying business. To the extent your customers are B2B customers, I guess, I get -- well, coming back from vacation, it makes sense to get projects going again. But I would also think that in B2C, as we go into the holiday season, that you would get a boost out of that also. So why wouldn't we see sort of continuing in a very typical fourth quarter positive seasonality at this point given how much of your business is focused on consumption?\nDev Ittycheria : Yes. Thanks, Michael. Just to clarify, I wouldn't say it's coming back and starting new projects. What we're talking about here, again, is the underlying usage of the database. And so whether it's internal applications or B2B applications or consumer-facing applications or whatever, what we see is an increase in the underlying database activity. So this is a different dynamic than people kicking off new projects, right? It's reflecting the underlying activity in the workload or in the application. And given that we've seen this now for two years in a row, we're highlighting it given the behaviors that we're seeing. I want to kind of call that out for folks as what appears to be an emerging seasonal trend.\nMichael Turits : Okay. And then Mike, can you quantify the impact of on rev rec -- upfront rev rec of the shift to a larger percentage of -- or a larger percent of multiyear EA deals because obviously, as you said, that pulls things forward a bit in terms of rev rec. So how much does from that shift could we have seen in terms of benefits in the quarter?\nMichael Gordon : Yes. We're not going to quantify an exact number. Part of this is also based off of -- we assume some level of multiyear deals in our forecast, in our guidance, obviously. We saw a little bit more than that. It was material enough to bother to call out just so people don't extrapolate inaccurately. And so that's why we wanted to make sure people understood the dynamic.\nOperator: One moment for our next question please. It comes from the line of Will Power with R.W. Baird.\nWill Power : Maybe just bigger picture. I know you touched on this a bit. But as customers increasingly focus on TCO in this environment, I'm just kind of curious how much more aggressive customers are getting at moving legacy databases and workloads over to Mongo versus maybe what you've seen six, nine months ago? Any real change in pace of that type of activity?\nDev Ittycheria : Yes. So Will, thanks for your question. We recently had a customer advisory board where we had some more -- some are larger customers with us for a number of days in Europe. And I would tell you the feedback there was that there's even more interest in moving off legacy platforms to more modern platforms in this environment because the cost structure and the brittleness of those architectures really are inhibitor for those companies to be able to move quickly and to seize new opportunities or to respond to new threats. And so in this environment, there's actually even more interest. We're actually seeing that also in say, an industry like financial services where they're starting to move to the cloud at scale. And that's a catalyst for them to be more aggressive in modernizing their tech portfolio. And that's more of a recent phenomenon, and we're obviously pleased about the engagements we're having with that vertical as well.\nOperator: I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back to Dev Ittycheria for his final comments.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you. So we're really happy with our new business performance and see it as evidence that our value proposition resonates with developers, IT decision makers and our partners. We're obviously pleased to see the rebound in Atlas consumption during the quarter and expect a continued macro impacts, and so we're closely monitoring consumption trends. And we will deliver another year of operating margin expansion despite the macro headwinds, and we are committed to profitable growth. With that, thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Everyone, thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the third quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023. First, I'll start with our third quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $333.6 million, up 47% year-over-year. As Dev mentioned, we continue to see a healthy environment for new business. Thus, this is confirmation that we remain a top priority for our customers, and our value proposition continues to stand out even in this market. Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 61% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 63% of total revenue compared to 58% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and 64% last quarter. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenue based on customer consumption of our platform, and that consumption is closely related to end-user activity of the application, which can be impacted by macroeconomic factors. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. Overall consumption trends improved compared to what we saw in Q2, though they are not back to historical levels. Specifically, there are a couple of trends worth noting. First, we saw a bounce back in areas that were below our expectation in Q2, namely the mid-market channel globally and our enterprise business in Europe. Second, we saw stronger sequential growth in underlying application usage in Q3 versus Q2, a trend observed across most industries and geographies. We observed a similar pattern last year, and we believe that this may be an emerging seasonal effect. Turning to Enterprise Advanced. EA significantly exceeded our expectations in the quarter, and we have continued having success selling incremental workloads into our existing EA customer base. As a reminder, under ASC 606, the term license component of the entire deal value is recognized as revenue upfront. This leads to the increased variability and reduced comparability of our EA results and is particularly impacted by multiyear EA deals. This quarter, we benefited from more multiyear EA deals than anticipated. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by over 2,100 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 39,100, which is up from over 31,000 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 5,900 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 3,900 in the year ago period. Q3 was another very strong quarter of direct customer net additions. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform as well as self-serve customers with whom we've now established a direct sales relationship. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas which had over 37,600 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 29,500 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth rate in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,545 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,201 in the year ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $247.8 million, representing a gross margin of 74%, which is up from 73% in the year ago period. Our year-over-year margin improvement is primarily driven by improved efficiencies that we are realizing in Atlas. Our income from operations was $19.8 million or a 6% operating margin for the third quarter compared to a 3% margin in the year ago period. The primary reason for our strong operating profit results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. In addition, our operating profit benefited from the steps we've taken to moderate the growth rate of expenses as we prudently manage our investments in the current environment. Net income in the third quarter was $18.7 million or $0.23 per share based on 80.4 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $2.6 million or $0.03 per share on 78.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was negative $5.7 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2.7 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $8.4 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of negative $9.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2023. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $334 million to $337 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $6 million to $8 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.08 based on [83.3 million] estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.257 billion to $1.26 billion. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $30.8 million to $32.8 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.29 to $0.31 based on 80.2 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. I'll now provide some more context around our guidance. First, in Q4, we expect slower sequential Atlas consumption growth than we experienced in Q3, but better than what we saw in Q2. We're encouraged by the improvement in consumption trends we saw during Q3. But as noted earlier, we believe some of that was driven by seasonality from which we will not benefit in Q4. Second, given the significant outperformance of EA in Q3, we do not expect a sequential uptick in EA revenue between Q3 and Q4. Finally, on a full year basis, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 2.5% at the midpoint of our guidance, about a 1 percentage point improvement compared to last year. We have consistently demonstrated operating leverage each year since going public, improving margins by over 35 percentage points over that time period. We will look to continue improving our margin profile over time, and we are pleased with our rate of progress this year. To summarize, MongoDB delivered strong third quarter results. Our new business performance and strong direct net customer additions indicate the robust underlying demand for our developer data platform. We are pleased to see an improvement in the Atlas consumption trends in Q3. We'll continue monitoring the environment and investing responsibly in pursuit of our long-term opportunity. With that, we'd like to open up to questions. Operator? And just on the consumption questions, a few thoughts, Kash. First of all, Q4 generally does not see anything that we would describe as a seasonal benefit. When we look at the November patterns, they were consistent with Q3 and that effectively implies that the latter part of the quarter will be slower growth because in general, we haven't historically seen anything that looks like seasonal growth in Q4. So that will give you a sense for the balance of this year. And as it relates to fiscal '24, we're obviously not providing guidance right now. We'll update that in the March call. It's obviously good to see the continued success in new business as well as the recovery in those growth rates, but it's certainly a very fluid macro environment and we're monitoring the situation closely. Yes. So a couple of things. Thanks for the question, Brad. I wouldn't have described it as a problem, but we did kind of sliced and diced the consumption behavior to see what we were exposed to folks what we're seeing, including what areas where we were seeing slower growth. Of which, that part of the mid-market demonstrated that behavior. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we saw a rebound in consumption across the board, but including the mid-market, everywhere across geographies and across industries and also in Europe. So not all the way back to historical levels, but improved versus Q2. Yes. So as I said, we're not going to guide as it relates to fiscal '24. You can see that the implied guide for fiscal '23 is 100 basis points improvement in terms of the year-over-year margin on the op income side. We're very pleased with that, and we'll obviously, as we work through our plans over next year, monitor the environment and everything else. I would just add that we have always had a fairly granular view of things in terms of our returns framework and the returns, evaluating and assessing the returns that we're getting out of different investments. We continue to apply that framework, although obviously, the market environment has changed, which sort of implicitly means that the return threshold has gone up. And we've applied that scrutiny, and we'll likely do that as we get through the fiscal '24 guide. Yes. So what I would just point you to, Brent, is that we've talked about that deferred in general and sort of calculated billings more broadly, is not a particularly relevant metric for us, as we've talked about for a few years now, as we continue to make it as easy as possible for customers to adopt usage of our platform, which then allows them to subsequently expand. We have deemphasized upfront commitments and tried to streamline that sort of upfront part of the negotiation. And so that has a natural consequence from a balance sheet perspective as sort of flowing through there. And that's where you see it. And that's why we tend to talk about that as being less relevant for our business. Raimo, thanks for the question. On the pull forwards, no, we did not see any particular pull activity. The only thing I'd call out, which I mentioned in the script on the EA, is we saw a little more multiyear in EA, which under 606, drives a little more revenue, but no pull forwards. Engagement at current level. Yes. I'll do my best to try and kind of walk you through it. I mean I think you kind of have to run sort of type of investment versus type of investment. And obviously, ultimately, we look across the entirety of the portfolio, whether it's go to market or R&D or things like that. But it's probably easiest to think about within the different buckets and flavors as it relates today as sort of those teams effectively compete for capital. And so within the go-to-market, we obviously are looking at the returns that we're generating. We are continuing to invest. We are continuing to hire and grow within the teams, but we're backing the areas that are having the most success in delivering us the highest returns. Go-to-market is a little bit easier to measure quantitatively and on a short-term basis. On the R&D side, things take a little bit longer to play out. And you've got a little bit of a lag between when you make the investment and when you see the payback. But we certainly have conversations at a fairly detailed and granular level, even within the R&D side about where do we think we're seeing the most success and the most traction in which areas do we want to incrementally lean into versus which areas do you maybe want to deprioritize relative to the areas generating the highest returns. And Phil, just to the cohort part of your question, it really -- it's probably easiest to think about in the context of when you bring a new customer on, and you think about the changes that we made a few years ago and how that drove incremental velocity. We've continued to see good and consistent behavior with those cohorts. I would just remind you and call out that those changes and where sort of the bulk of the customer adds come from is more in the mid-market, right? And so those tend to be spending less than the average direct sales customer. And so it's just important to keep that in mind as people are building their models and thinking about the long-term impact of that. Thank you. Yes. So the first thing I'd say, with Jason is it really relates to the underlying usage of the application, right? If you think about sort of what drives consumption within Atlas, I think that's the critical thing. And so when you think about the usage, we're seeing stronger underlying usage. We were always in a growth environment. What we saw in Q2 was slower growth in the mid-market and in Europe. Those rebounded again, not all the way back to historic levels, but improved levels relative to Q2. Part of our thought process, which we shared in the prepared remarks, is that we believe it's a bit of an emerging seasonal trend, which particularly relates to sort of people coming back from summer vacations and things of that because you'll recall in our September call, we talked about August being in line with what we've seen in Q2. And so that sort of suggests the improvement that we saw in September and October. We saw that same dynamic in the year ago period. And while we only have a couple of years that are COVID affected where we've got Atlas at scale, that's kind of our best current working theory. But we can see it in terms of the underlying usage of the applications. The other thing I'd say more broadly from a macro standpoint that I think is impressive, is on the new business side. We continue to win there. We continue to have our value prop resonate. We haven't seen sort of those increasing deal cycles and other things like that, that others have seen. We obviously are monitoring the situation closely, but we've been really pleased from that standpoint. Sure. Thanks, Tyler. We obviously don't guide by product, but maybe a couple of things I can say about Q4. First of all, as I mentioned, it was obviously an incredibly strong EA quarter, with EA growing 26% year-over-year. And so as we look out at Q4, it doesn't make a ton of sense to -- as we look at the business, to think that we're going to meaningfully improve sequentially from an EA perspective, given how incredibly strong Q3 was. And then we talked a little bit on the Atlas side around Q4 doesn't benefit from the seasonal tailwinds that Q3 does. And so I think on a sequential basis, those are the key factors to keep in mind. Thanks, Fred. Yes. So generally, I would say it was broad-based as we described. The rebound was most perceptible in the sense of the mid-market globally and Europe, but only because those are the areas where we had seen slower growth that we called out in Q2. And we talked about, like I said, August being in line with Q2. And so September and October were stronger. And then just to continue, I don't want to get into like a day-by-day reading here, but we did see that behavior. And so -- and that shows up in the results, and that's also consistent with what we saw sort of in the year ago period. Hence, the commentary about this emerging seasonal trend. Yes. I think the key thing is we'll obviously update that in the March call. We've tried to give you the best lay of the land as we can for the current fiscal year and what we see for Q4. It certainly is a fluid and uncertain macro environment. We're monitoring that closely, and we'll obviously update everyone in the March call around our outlook. Yes. We're not going to quantify an exact number. Part of this is also based off of -- we assume some level of multiyear deals in our forecast, in our guidance, obviously. We saw a little bit more than that. It was material enough to bother to call out just so people don't extrapolate inaccurately. And so that's why we wanted to make sure people understood the dynamic."

            "name": "Dev Ittycheria",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our third quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $334 million, a 47% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 61% year-over-year, representing 63% of revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 39,100 customers. Overall, we are pleased with our performance and execution in Q3 despite the challenging macro environment. Let me give you a bit more context on what we saw in Q3. We had another strong quarter of new business. We added over 500 direct sales customers, and we keep winning new workloads in existing accounts from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies. Our new business from Enterprise Advanced also significantly exceeds our expectations, which is particularly notable in this environment given that EA requires an upfront commitment. Turning to Atlas consumption trends. We have seen an improvement in Q3 versus Q2, albeit still below historical levels. Michael will cover this in more detail. Finally, retention rates remained very strong in Q3, demonstrating the mission-criticality of our platform. Indeed, our Q3 results are an indication that our value proposition resonates with customers even in a difficult macro environment. Let me remind you of the key pillars of our developer data platform. First, MongoDB enables the customers to unleash developer productivity. The more productive developers are, the faster the organizations can innovate. The document model, which underpins MongoDB, has proven to be the best way for developers to work with data because it aligns well with how developers think and code. Second, MongoDB supports the performance and scale requirements of the most demanding modern applications. MongoDB is built from the ground up as a distributed platform and allows organizations to easily and cost effectively scale their applications to address the most exacting performance requirements. Third, MongoDB allows enterprises to remove enormous complexity and cost out of their technology stack. MongoDB is a general-purpose platform capable of serving a broad array of use cases, including transactional, time series, mobile, search and application-driven analytics. MongoDB continues to be the most popular modern data platform with developers. In the last 12 months alone, our open source community server has been downloaded more than [115 million] times from our website, which is more than in our entire company history through the beginning of 2020. And in Q3 alone, we had over 300,000 sign-ups for Atlas free tier, which is up 15x over the last five years. We also see growing evidence for how our value proposition resonates with IT decision-makers who are known for their focus on ROI, especially in economic environments, such as the one we're in today. Customers who are moving to the cloud at scale such as companies in the financial services industry are increasingly choosing MongoDB as their underlying data platform to modernize their application portfolio. IT decision makers value not being locked into any 1 environment. And by building apps on MongoDB, customers preserve their ability to run these apps on premise, on any cloud and to easily switch between cloud providers. IT decision makers are also increasingly interested in consolidating vendors. By virtue of MongoDB's broad support for a wide variety of use cases as a general purpose platform, customers can run most workloads on MongoDB rather than a disjointed set of narrow point solutions that increase the cost and complexity of the data architecture. Finally, we continue to gain mind share with our partners, and we see them leaning into co-selling with MongoDB as they also want to leverage the popularity and value of our offerings. Starting with the cloud providers. All three hyperscalers now showcase MongoDB Atlas on their consoles to make it easier for the customers to sign up for Atlas given the increasing popularity of using MongoDB in the cloud. A number of large systems integrators are in the process of setting up business units focused on MongoDB given the size of the growing MongoDB practice. A growing number of ISVs continue to build their products in MongoDB. We currently have close to 200 ISVs co-selling relationships, which is up more than 2x compared to two years ago. Our growing popularity has tangible benefits for our business, especially in periods of economic uncertainty. In times like these, customers typically default to vendors they know and trust and with whom they can consolidate spend while reducing overall costs. We see the current environment as an opportunity to establish ourselves as an enterprise standard with more of our customers. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. The following customers are running mission-critical apps in MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of developer data platform, incorporating services such as search, in-app analytics and mobile services. These include Toyota Financial Services, Ulta Beauty, Mediastream and Vodafone. Vodafone is the world-leading telecoms company with over 625 million global customers in 65 countries. Vodafone is creating hundreds of new cloud-native apps. Underpinning these apps is MongoDB Atlas, which provides a scalable, resilient and flexible data platform. Atlas also supports Vodafone's IoT ecosystem of 140 million-plus devices. MongoDB is a part of a suite of fully vetted tools that Vodafone allows developers to use to build any application. Several MongoDB customers are embarking on their digital transformation journey by choosing MongoDB Atlas and migrating from on-premise to the cloud, including American Tire Distributors, Schwarz IT and Volvo Group. Schwarz IT, part of the Schwarz Group, uses MongoDB's Enterprise Advanced on-prem to drive innovation and fuel their own cloud service. With more than 13,000 locations across 32 countries and brands like Lidl and Kaufland, Schwarz Group is Europe's largest retail company. Their internal IT arm, Schwarz IT, works both internal teams and external customers to ensure smooth operations of their tech stack. Schwarz IT also runs STACKIT, a cloud provider that offers its customers all the benefits of cloud deployment while ensuring that data is stored in Germany under EU regulations. In 2022, STACKIT launched a MongoDB service to help their customers modernize apps and services and improve performance. Hugging Face, Okta, Washington Post, Cisco and L&T-SuFin, a B2B e-commerce platform, are currently developing a number of applications across different parts of the business and significantly expanded the use of MongoDB Atlas throughout their tech stack. Hugging Face, a fast-growing AI company, migrated from MongoDB Community to MongoDB Atlas to scale their open source platform and online community for machine learning. Their company's shift to Atlas allowed them to rely on our developer data platform for software and security compliance, take advantage of chain streams to speed decision-making, simplify the infrastructure through a single control plane for managing data and reduce time spent on maintenance through Atlas' integrated services. In summary, I am pleased with our execution in the third quarter. We had another strong quarter of new business, demonstrating that our value proposition continues to resonate in the marketplace and with developers, IT decision makers and partners alike. We are pleased to see a rebound in Atlas consumption in Q3, and continue to closely monitor usage trends. We remain focused on winning new workloads with new and existing customers, and are committed to profitable growth as we pursue our enormous market opportunity.  With that, here's Michael. You want to start with the Atlas wins? Yes. So one is the -- Kash, first, thanks for the question. I'm going to first start with the Atlas wins, and then I'll have Michael talk about consumption trends in November. First, the key thing that I think people understand is that software is central to every company's value proposition. And in recent discussions with customers, our own customer advisory board, in the field and more recently last week at re:Invent, our customers are very focused on modernizing to drive more differentiation, operational efficiency and agility. And so the platform message that we are out there with really resonates because, one, it enables high developer productivity, so people can do more with less. The platform enables customers to consolidate on one solution versus connecting and stitching together a point of distorted tools. So it reduces cost and complexity of the data architecture. And all this provides a very compelling ROI, which really drives those new customer additions. Yes. Thanks, Brent. I think what we saw in EA is just evidence that customers are really viewing MongoDB to be an important part, if not a standard, in their tech stack. And once you are viewed as a critical element of the tech stack, people are more comfortable investing more aggressively, especially in this environment where people do need to modernize their legacy platforms to drive more efficiency and lower cost as well as drive more agility. So I think that's, I think, why we're seeing the upside on EA. And so we feel good about that. And obviously, this shows you that customers also like optionality by building apps on MongoDB, they can truly run their apps anywhere, not only on-premise but on any hyperscaler and obviously switch between on-premise or any hyperscalers. So that is also a very compelling benefit to customers in this environment. Yes. In regards to the question about... Yes, platform. So we are definitely seeing customers continue to choose us and standardize us in terms of using Atlas. And the breadth of the platform is really attracting customers to use MongoDB in a wide variety of ways. And so we feel really good about the win rates. We feel really good about our engagement with customers. And obviously, you saw that in the new customer wins. The new customer wins were quite strong. Right. Thanks, Sanjit. I just want to make the point that it was actually pre-pandemic that we decided to make it much more easy for customers to engage with us by both changing sales compensation incentives as well as making it easier for customers to commercially engage with us. And obviously, that paid, to your point, paid huge dividends for us during the pandemic. What I will tell you is that it's really more of the same. We're really hyper focused on acquiring new customers and adding more workloads from existing customers, and that's across the board, across every channel, every industry and every customer segment. So that is something that we care a lot about. And we're seeing that now and expand in terms of getting customers now to adopt some of the new capabilities we've rolled out to the marketplace. So as I talked about in my prepared remarks, we're seeing a lot of customers embrace the full suite of the platform. So that drives incremental workloads that we would not have gotten in the past. And so we feel really good about that, and that's our real focus. It's all about acquiring new workloads and getting more and more people to build apps on MongoDB. Yes. If I can just add, it's like, for example, like in the marketing side of this digital programs, we were -- we do a lot of experimentation of what's working. So we have a certain return thresholds. And so if we don't see those programs working, we'll shut them down. Similarly, in the sales organization, there are certain teams that are outperforming, we'll invest more. In other teams, they are not and will potentially slow down. So we're just really doing more of the same and just being very rigorous about that. Yes. I mean I think what we're really seeing in terms of these new workloads and sales productivity is that our customer base is very diversified both in terms of the types of customers as well as the types of use cases. That's the benefit of having a general-purpose platform. So clearly, we have start-ups who are building potentially new industries or disrupting existing ones. And then we have large companies moving quickly to transform different parts of their business. So it really varies. So clearly, with the platform play now, we're seeing a lot more interest in search, in search workloads and consolidating search workloads on top of MongoDB. We're seeing a lot of interest in time series, being able to again have one unified developer experience. Time series leads to things that what I talked about is application-driven analytics where people want to be able to get meaningful insights of their business, automates human decision-making into applications. So those use cases are getting more and more popular with customers. But then we have still a lot of the classic bread and butter use cases that customers are using us for. And in terms of sales productivity, what I would say is it's really a function of their -- the quality of their pipeline and how quickly they can add new workloads to our platform and how quickly we can acquire new customers. So we're really focused, and the sales leadership team is very, very focused on both things, acquiring new customers and acquiring these workloads. It's less about is one workload providing a better ROI than other? It's really a function of the customers' requirements and what they're most interested and focused on. Thanks, Phil. Yes, I'm not sure that we're going to be sharing like quarterly stats on how things are going, but we definitely provide color. I think what -- the fact that across all three hyperscalers, customers can go to their consoles and be able to sign up for Atlas is a meaningful thing. It gives us an access to a whole new customer base that we may not have direct relationship with, and also speaks to the popularity of customers wanting to use MongoDB in the cloud. And so I think those two things have really driven that. There's not many companies who can say that they are on the consoles of all three hyperscalers. Yes. I think it's mostly a reflection of the starting ARR. So you're basically starting with the compounding slower growth. And so when you think about the entry point, whether it's Q3 in terms of for the second half of the year or Q4 for the final quarter of the year, you've seen several months of slower growth. And so that means at the beginning ARR is lower on an absolute basis. And even if the growth rates were to revert, the number would be lower just by virtue of the fact that the starting ARR is lower. Yes. Fred, I think what that really speaks to is just the power of the MongoDB platform and the product market fit that's evidenced by how popular we are. I mean we are truly the most popular modern data platform in the world. And so -- and a lot of -- majority of those users tend to run MongoDB in the cloud. So each of the hyperscalers see a lot of MongoDB usage on each of the clouds. Yes, you're right. In the early days, they tried more to compete than to partner. And frankly, a lot of people, when we first went public, were skeptical about how we could actually build a cloud business when trying to compete with the hyperscalers. Obviously, we've proven the ability to do that. And I think that's also evidence of the fact that customers are also more discerning, and they're not just going to take the a la carte in many choice. They're going to be very judicious in their evaluation process. And given our -- the value we provide, I think you're seeing the hyperscalers recognize that. And by the way, the hyperscalers also benefit from our growth. They benefit both from the underlying consumption of storage and compute of Atlas as well as that those customers that they win, who are running Atlas workloads in their clouds, then buy other ancillary services themselves. So it ends up truly being a win-win relationship. And I think that's why you're seeing the hyperscalers essentially engage with us more deeply. Yes. I mean, the trend is -- I mean what we're seeing is there's a lot of customer interest on this capability. One, depending on the customers' needs, they could be -- they may have a preferred hyperscaler, but they're expanding into a geographic region where that hyperscaler may only have one region or no regions and they want some diversity across hyperscales in case that region goes down. And so they want the benefit of being able to quickly switch over to another hyperscaler. The other thing that we see is, obviously, as these hyperscalers compete with each other and offer a differentiated set of services, customers want to be able to leverage some services offer in one hyperscaler versus another, even though maybe they're preferred hyperscaler does not offer such a service. And then third, there's always the benefit of avoiding lock in and being able to diversify their workloads across different hyperscalers. And again, just to be clear, the multi-cloud cluster essentially enables customers to run one app or one workload across multiple clouds. So that is profoundly different than what most people can offer today. Yes. So Steve, thanks for your question. We haven't seen any discernible change in deal dynamics in Q3. And clearly, our EA results, in our opinion, it demonstrates the power of our platform and the ability for customers and the interest of customers running workloads anywhere. What I will say is we've been through -- I personally have been through, in the public company context, 2008, and also lived through 2000 as well. And in these kinds of situations, we definitely recognize that there's more scrutiny by customers on deals and probably approval levels go up the food chain. And so what we are obviously working closely with our sales teams on is to making sure that they rigorously qualify their forecast and to make sure that they really understand the decision process that customers have to go through to get deals done. But that is something that we have lived through in previous cycles, and that's something that we are going to be very focused on. Yes. Thanks, Michael. Just to clarify, I wouldn't say it's coming back and starting new projects. What we're talking about here, again, is the underlying usage of the database. And so whether it's internal applications or B2B applications or consumer-facing applications or whatever, what we see is an increase in the underlying database activity. So this is a different dynamic than people kicking off new projects, right? It's reflecting the underlying activity in the workload or in the application. And given that we've seen this now for two years in a row, we're highlighting it given the behaviors that we're seeing. I want to kind of call that out for folks as what appears to be an emerging seasonal trend. Yes. So Will, thanks for your question. We recently had a customer advisory board where we had some more -- some are larger customers with us for a number of days in Europe. And I would tell you the feedback there was that there's even more interest in moving off legacy platforms to more modern platforms in this environment because the cost structure and the brittleness of those architectures really are inhibitor for those companies to be able to move quickly and to seize new opportunities or to respond to new threats. And so in this environment, there's actually even more interest. We're actually seeing that also in say, an industry like financial services where they're starting to move to the cloud at scale. And that's a catalyst for them to be more aggressive in modernizing their tech portfolio. And that's more of a recent phenomenon, and we're obviously pleased about the engagements we're having with that vertical as well. Thank you. So we're really happy with our new business performance and see it as evidence that our value proposition resonates with developers, IT decision makers and our partners. We're obviously pleased to see the rebound in Atlas consumption during the quarter and expect a continued macro impacts, and so we're closely monitoring consumption trends. And we will deliver another year of operating margin expansion despite the macro headwinds, and we are committed to profitable growth. With that, thank you for your time today."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session where you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Brian Denyeau of ICR. Please go ahead.\nBrian Denyeau: Thank you, Latif. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to view MongoDB's second quarter fiscal 2023 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of the market today. Joining the call today are Dev Ittycheria, President and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance and our planned investments. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, results of operations, clients and the macroeconomic environment that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2022, filed with the SEC on June 30, 2022. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them, except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our second quarter results before giving you a broader company update. Let's start with our second quarter financial results. We generated revenue of $304 million, a 53% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 73% year-over-year, representing 64% of revenue, and we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 37,000 customers. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in execution in Q2 despite the challenging macro environment. Let me give you a bit more context on what we saw in Q2. The new business environment remains robust as evidenced by our record increase in direct sales customer account. We have seen no change in deal activity in sales cycles. We believe our strong new sales performance is a demonstration of the critical business value our developer data platform delivers and our superior go-to-market execution. As we have said in the past, nearly every organization uses software to drive their value proposition. Consequently, these organizations seek modern solutions that make their developers more productive. Furthermore, expansion rates remain strong, further evidence that MongoDB is a non-discretionary spend for our customers. As expected, we did see the macro environment weigh on the growth of Atlas consumption. As we discussed last quarter, it's important to understand that the slower than historical consumption growth is a result of slower usage growth of our customers' underlying applications due to macro conditions. Our customers spend on our platform is well aligned with the performance of their business. In the current environment, some businesses and consequently, their applications are growing more slowly. Michael will address the second quarter consumption trends in more detail. Let me tell you how we are navigating the current environment. First, we are doubling down on velocity. As we discussed with you in the past, we are in the business of bringing new workloads onto our platform and then focus on making those workloads successful. In the current environment, we are even more focused on removing friction in acquiring workloads from new and existing customers. The strength of our new business performance in the first half of the year demonstrates our success in this area. Second, we will continue to invest for the long term, and we'll make investments in our growth initiatives and platform capabilities where we are generating strong returns. We have never taken a growth at all cost approach and we will remain vigilant and prioritize our highest return areas. We are confident that the recent consumption trends will improve as the macro environment normalizes over time. The value proposition of the MongoDB developer data platform has never been stronger. Our conviction comes not only from our results, but also from the success our customers are having with our platform. Customers are very focused on removing complexity from the technology stack. They understand that complexity is a [tax] (ph) that increases expenses, creates risks and slows down innovation. They are increasingly turning to our developer data platform to address this challenge. A multinational trillion-dollar financial services company chose MongoDB to power the next-generation trading platform to cover all of their various trading businesses with one solution. Since launching the new service, the customer has been able to decommission eight legacy trading systems and realized cost savings of almost $50 million in annualized expenses. A leading Canadian security provider migrated its IoT and AI security platform away from an open source relational database to Atlas. With the ability to use MongoDB's native charting to distribute their database over lower cost instances, the Company has been able to significantly reduce their database spend by 60%, which is particularly compelling given the open source nature of their prior solutions. Another one of our customer priorities is to invest in their core competencies and outsource or eliminate everything else. They understand that clinging to the old ways of delivering innovation is not only time-consuming, but also incredibly expensive. A global travel technology leader is in the process of getting out of the business of managing their own data centers. They turn to MongoDB in order to modernize a key legacy application and move it to the cloud. The monolithic application was originally built on Oracle and Elasticsearch but the customer decided to migrate the application to Atlas because they couldn't meet their timeline and performance requirements with their existing solution. A web 3.0 pioneer start off by building and managing their own computing infrastructure. However, the development team quickly reached a point where they overwhelmed by day-to-day task of managing infrastructure. By migrating to MongoDB Atlas the company saved three years in development time and reduced the need to hire 40 developers. Finally, in this environment, as any other, customers understand that high performance and scalability are critical to their success. A Fortune 500 consumer technology leader turned to MongoDB to replace its existing compliance platform as it needed to double the performance while lowering cost and enabling real-time visibility of operations. MongoDB was able to address the performance requirements while lowering costs by 70%. One of the world's largest health care companies, historically an Oracle shop, was unable to meet their desired performance expectations and had to spend tens of thousands of hours just to maintain their existing environment. Over the last few years, they have implemented MongoDB for the most demanding new projects, such as the COVID vaccine application as well as their digital health app. Perhaps the best way to illustrate how the perception MongoDB has changed is to review our relationship with one of the world's premier commercial investment banks. Four years ago, a senior executive of the bank told me that he didn't think MongoDB was ready to be declared a standard for their mission-critical applications. At the time, they had a myriad of relational and non-relational technologies deployed across the organization. Since then, not only does the bank become more focused on and confident in moving workloads to cloud, but the bank's leadership team also observed how overwhelmingly popular MongoDB had become with their development teams across the organization. As a result, they decided to make MongoDB one of their enterprise standard offerings as part of the journey to the cloud. In the second quarter, they signed a multimillion dollar agreement as a sign of their desire to use MongoDB as a preferred platform for mission-critical workloads. Our customers are not only excited about our current product offering, but also by our road map. We received enthusiastic feedback at this year's MongoDB World about our developer data platform vision as well as our product announcements. To highlight a few, we announced Queryable Encryption, an industry-first feature that allows customers to query data while it remains encrypted. Given the heightened focus on security and privacy, this announcement received a lot of attention from both customers and the academic community. And currently, over 60 companies, the majority of whom are Fortune 500 customers, are in development with this feature. We also announced Relational Migrator, a product that simplifies the process of migrating workloads off relational databases and on to MongoDB. Our early access program is oversubscribed, and we're getting great customer feedback. Given most companies increased focus on cost management, we believe this technology will accelerate customer confidence in replatforming applications of relational databases. We also received positive feedback related to our analytics announcements. Most notably, Atlas Data Federation and Atlas Data Lake storage are seeing healthy early adoption in use cases related to the ingestion, data transformation, and querying of large volumes of data to provide greater insights from data generated by applications on Atlas. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some additional customer wins and interesting use cases from the second quarter. A leading German retailer, Conrad Electronic, built an online B2B marketplace on MongoDB. Turning to MongoDB for simplicity as the marketplace grew it moved from MongoDB Community Edition to Atlas for further scalability and to reduce management complexity. Conrad Electronics database now hosts over 8 million active SKUs, which is estimated to reach 100 million SKUs by 2024. Locus Robotics, a leading warehouse robotics company leverages Atlas to store data uploaded from their physical warehouses, including metadata, logs, configurations and reports. Their Locus Cloud warehouse orchestration platform utilizes Atlas to store and access data for operational reports, ensuring seamless and reliable functionality for their customers. Locus Robotics were selected MongoDB Atlas because they needed a fully managed data platform to allow them to build faster and handle vast amounts of data. In their efforts to improve their automation processes, e-commerce platform Rent the Runway selected and implemented MongoDB Atlas as a database platform to streamline how garments were sorted and cleaned in their fulfillment centers. With Atlas, Rent the Runway is able to seamlessly extract data and real-time analytics from the robotic sorting arm and X-ray machines, resulting in a 67% decrease in processing time. In summary, I am pleased with our execution in the second quarter. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, we are focusing on what we can directly control, namely bring new customers and new workloads onto our platform. The breadth of adoption across many use cases gives us continued confidence to judiciously invest across our business to best position ourselves to fully capitalize on our long-term market opportunity. With that, here's Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our second quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2023. First, I'll start with our second quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $303.7 million, up 53% year-over-year. As Dev mentioned, we saw a continued strong new business environment and experienced no noticeable change in sales cycles. To us, this is an indication that we remain a top priority for our customers. Shifting to our product mix. Enterprise Advanced exceeded our expectations driven by upsells to existing customers. Moving on to Atlas. Atlas grew 73% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 64% of total revenue compared to 56% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and 60% last quarter. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenue based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely related to end-user activity of the application, which can be impacted by the macroeconomic environment. Overall, our performance this quarter was strong, and we're pleased with our results. We do think it's helpful to provide investors some incremental context around the puts and takes that we are seeing in consumption trends. As you probably recall, on our Q1 call, we shared with you that we were starting to see the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty on Atlas consumption in certain pockets of our business and discuss with you the framework on how we expected the macro impact to play out for the rest of the year. Let me update you on our performance compared to this framework in Q2. Starting with our self-service channel. You'll recall that we experienced slower than historical consumption growth in Europe in Q1 and in the U.S. in May. The May consumption patterns generally continued for the remainder of Q2 and self-serve did modestly better than our expectations. Moving on to the mid-market channel. For context, the customers in this channel tend to be traditional medium-sized businesses. This channel included -- tend not to be traditional medium-sized businesses. This channel includes a disproportionate share of digital native, fast-growth companies that have built their businesses on MongoDB. Our expectation that the mid-market slowdown we saw in Europe in Q1 would become global in Q2. This is what we experienced, but the slowdown was more significant than we had expected, specifically the digit layer subset of the mid-market experienced slower growth in their applications as a result of macroeconomic conditions, and therefore, their underlying consumption growth of MongoDB slowed as well. Finally, turning to enterprise, our largest channel. As in Q1, we had not seen an impact on consumption but we expected a modest impact to manifest itself in Q2. Here, consumption growth was above our expectations in North America, while in Europe, we experienced greater-than-expected macroeconomic headwinds. The slowdown in Europe was evidenced across all sub-regions and industries. Turning to customer growth. During the second quarter, we grew our customer base by over 1,800 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 37,000, which is up from over 29,000 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 5,400 are direct sales customers, which compared to over 3,600 in the year ago period. Q1 was a record quarter of direct customer net additions, which speaks to the popularity of our platform, and the relevance of our value proposition. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform as well as self-service customers with whom we've now established a direct sales relationship. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 35,500 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 27,500 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter of our net AR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,462 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,126 in the year ago period. Moving down to the income statement. I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the second quarter was $223.2 million, representing a gross margin of 73%, which is up from 72% in the year-ago period. Our year-over-year margin improvement is primarily driven by improved efficiencies that we are realizing in Atlas. Our loss from operations was $12.4 million or a negative 4%. Operating margin for the second quarter compared to a negative 2% operating margin in the year ago period. As a reminder, in Q2, we saw the return of large in-person events most notably our flagship event MongoDB World, which attracted approximately 3,000 attendees to the Javits Center in New York. Net loss in the second quarter was $15.6 million or $0.23 per share based on 68.3 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $7.7 million or $0.12 per share on 63.4 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was negative $44.7 million after taking into consideration approximately $3.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities. Free cash flow was negative $48.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of negative $22.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2023. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $300 million to $303 million. We expect non-GAAP loss operations to be in the range of $10 million to $8 million. And non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.19 to $0.16 based on 68.9 million estimated weighted average share count. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.196 billion to $1.206 billion. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be in the range of $13 million to $8 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.28 based on $68.6 million estimated weighted average shares outstanding. I'll now provide some more context around our guidance. First, we expect the Atlas consumption trends we experienced in Q2 to continue for the remainder of the year. Second, in the second half of last year, as we called out at the time, we had exceptionally strong Atlas consumption growth leading to difficult Atlas year-over-year compares to the back half of the year. And third, we expect a sequential decline in Enterprise Advance in Q3 as the renewal base is sequentially lower. Looking into Q4, we expect a seasonal uptick in revenue from EA. But recall, we faced a very difficult year-over-year comparison given strong EA new business activity we saw last year. To summarize, MongoDB delivered strong second quarter results. Our new business performance and record direct customer net additions indicate the strong underlying demand for our developer data platform. We will continue investing responsibly in pursuit of our long-term opportunity. And with that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Sanjit Singh, your line is open.\nSanjit Singh: Congrats on the strong deal activity and momentum in Q2. I had a couple of clarifying questions, Michael, on kind of the profile in terms of the different trends that we see across the business. How much of the mid-market -- how much does the mid-market represents as a percentage of ARR? I think self-serve is pretty straightforward to figure that out. But between the split between mid-market and enterprise what's the relative size of those? And did you see going into August being sort of sustaining coming out of July? Or did things get worse? Or did things modestly improve?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So in general, the mid-market is a small portion of the overall direct business and therefore, their business overall. And in terms of August, August was consistent with what we experienced in Q2.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. And then just a question on the operating income guidance. That did come down versus your prior guidance. I was wondering if you could provide more context there on what seems to be a higher level of OpEx spend in the back half. What's driving that? Where are those investments going?\nMichael Gordon: Yes, a couple of different things. From a macro standpoint, if you take a step back, we're investing relative to our long-term opportunity. We have very fractional penetration and continue to see robust new business. As you think about the business more holistically, new customers and new workloads are what really determine the long-term outcome and the long-term success. And so, we continue to invest in sales and marketing and in the R&D of the platform to position ourselves to capitalize on that long-term opportunity. As it relates to expansion of existing workloads, which is sort of the other piece of the equation, that's more relevant in the short term not as relevant in the long term. And so, that's where we've seen the slower growth that we've described. And so, we're continuing to take a long-term orientation. We're obviously not doing that in a vacuum or with blinders on. We've always maintained a high level of financial discipline and scrutiny, and we continue to prioritize the highest level investments and constantly monitor things to make sure that we're being appropriate in terms of positioning ourselves for the long run.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Raimo Lenschow, your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Two quick questions for me as well. Dev, can you talk a little bit about the -- in your prepared remarks, you had quite a few interesting customer stories in terms of people standardizing on use some very big deployments on Atlas enterprise. What are you seeing in terms of where you are on that journey there in terms of people kind of putting much bigger workloads onto the platform than a few years ago when people were trying and testing it out versus now putting like proper stuff on there, like what are you seeing there on that journey? And then one for Michael and on EA, like you kind of talked about sequential decline in Q3 as well. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers there because is that kind of cloud - as more and more guys going to the cloud now that's impacting that negatively? Is that consumption? Can you just give us an idea so that we get a better idea about the run rate there?\nDev Ittycheria: Raimo, to your first question, we've been essentially being used for mission-critical applications for some time now. And that's evidenced by almost every bank on Wall Street is using us for some important use case. We have large Fortune 500 companies in industries like telecom, media, tech, health care, et cetera, who are using us for very mission-critical use cases. I would say that we're still early in the journey in terms of having greater share in those large accounts. And you've heard us talk about our focus on focus accounts. We are bringing more resources to bear to really drive the expansion of those existing accounts and get more workloads on our platform. And that's, as Michael mentioned, going well. But in terms of MongoDB's readiness for mission-critical platforms, we feel like we're really well positioned. We've added some new capabilities, which we announced at MongoDB World, and our road map is very rich with features. So our customers truly view us as a strategic platform, and that's why you're seeing more and more customers standardize on MongoDB.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. And Raimo, on your question on EA, as you know, we manage the business on a channel basis, not a product basis, but certainly want to try and call out some of the trends so that people can kind of put the guide in context and some of the things that we're thinking about. The new business environment continues to be robust. But EA continues to be a smaller and smaller percentage of that overall new business environment. And so as you look at the back half of the year, that continuing sort of evolution and share is sort of important to take into account. In addition, EA is subject to 606 accounting and the term license component there, which adds into the increased variability and reduced comparability that we see period-to-period. And then lastly, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did have very strong performance of EA in the second half of last year. And so not only does that set up a tough compare in the classic sense but depending on the nature of the structure of a deal, that's a multiyear deal, the term license revenue can be recognized upfront. And so not only does it boost the current period that now becomes the year ago period, but the current period, which is now the present period in the back half of this year doesn't have that license revenue. And so you sort of got a two-factor impact there. I'm just trying to call that out for folks so they understand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Kash Rangan, your line is open.\nKashIRangan: One for Dev and one for Michael. Dev, you talked about these big customer wins. At what point are we set up for an inflection point in the database market where less expensive but technologically very compelling solutions like MongoDB? You hit the tipping point and during a downturn as the one we're going through, initially, you see the pullback in spending. But as customers realize the value, are we set up for a P times Q or in the customer's mind that there is an inflection point in that you could actually reap the benefits typically doing these transitions, the compelling price performance technologies gained share relative to the more expensive incumbent. So wondering what your thoughts are in that regard. And Michael, one for you, as you walk through the tougher comparisons in the second half of the year, is that because of Atlas momentum? And if so, how does the -- how does calendar '23 shape up if you project out these Atlas trends? And what are the things that we should be expecting as first normalization of growth rates are concerned?\nDev Ittycheria: Kash, thanks for your question. On your first question, I just want to remind everyone, we're not seeing any change in deal sizes or sales cycle times. I think your point about as customers face this macro headwind, is there an opportunity for them to essentially drive more efficiency in their business? And we're definitely seeing customers starting to do that. We're definitely seeing customers look at their legacy platforms and recognize how expensive and brittle those platforms are and are more motivated to move on to more modern platforms like MongoDB. Frankly, to help customers in that journey, that was a motivation for us to release the Relational Migrator product because this is not a new trend to help customers just reduce the cost of moving off relational to MongoDB. And I think you're going to see more and more customers take a hard look at their legacy infrastructure and think about modernizing potentially sooner than later.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I would just -- to your second question about sort of second half and compares. I walked through the EA compare on the Atlas compare, yes, last year, we had very strong cohort expansion in Q3 and in Q4 that leads to difficult compares. But also -- and I think this is part of your point, Kash. As you think about where we're entering the second half of the year, right, as we start off the third quarter, given some of the slower growth that we've seen and the expansion of existing cohorts, that starting ARR is at a lower point as we look at the second half of the year, and so that will also affect fiscal '23 results. Obviously, we're not providing fiscal '24 guidance on this call, and we'll look to do that on the March call. But certainly, how the next six months play out will impact kind of the starting position for fiscal '24.\nOperator: Our next question comes from DJ Hynes of Canaccord Genuity. DJ Hynes, Your line is open.\nDJ Hynes: So Dev, Snowflake has increasingly talked about its evolution to a cloud app development platform. In some ways, it sounds similar to the vision you've laid out for Mongo's developer data cloud. I know you and I have talked about this, but I still get the question from investors. Can you just talk about where you see the intersection of those efforts and where the key differences lie today?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Thanks, DJ. So first of all, I want to make it clear to everyone that we don't see Snowflake in any deals, right? So in terms of customer buying behavior, there's no confusion. Obviously, there is acknowledgment that there is potentially some -- a trend of some overlap between analytics and operational OLTP stores. And what we believe is that the future analytics will really be powering more intelligent applications, which is essentially automating human decision-making that is done today using existing BI tools and data warehouses. So when you think about how apps become more sophisticated, it's really all about software and automation, which is really a developer challenge. And one thing I think we've proven is to know how to build tools for developers to be more productive and more effective. And so, that's what we plan to do. And I should also point out that this trend of developers doing more, we've already seen, say, in the DevOps space where developers have taken on more of the operational responsibility that operators and data centers use to do or in the security space where developers are taking on more responsibility for security and as a whole advent of new security-focused developer tools. And we think the same thing will happen in analytics, where developers will basically embed more analytics into building smarter applications.\nDJ Hynes: Yes. Yes, that's great color and a helpful explanation. Michael, a follow-up for you. Just what does the strategy become with the mid-market digital natives that seem to be getting hit the hardest in terms of their consumption trends? I mean is it just about waiting it out? Or how do your conversations with those customers change given that dynamic?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I think it's a couple of different things. There are two flavors here. And again, I would just sort of go back to this way to look at the market and how it flows through in terms of the numbers. There are new customer wins, right? So, that new companies are obviously being created regularly in that digital native part of the mid-market, that subset. And we continue to have a very strong value proposition there. We continue to resonate. We continue to be a platform of choice as it relates to that. In terms of the consumption side, and that's ultimately what's most important for the long term. And so our ability to land those customers to continue to have success with those customers is a long-term asset and accretes to sort of long-term value proposition. In the short term, depending on how long the current macroeconomic environment goes on as we see slower growth from those customers that will impact numbers in the short term, but that's a relatively small part of the equation. If I think about the long-term opportunity and what relative market share we have and everything else, it's fairly early on. And so obviously, we've got to sort of navigate through that period, and we talked about sort of our desire to keep an ability to keep sort of a close pulse on things, but that's really how we think about it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Keirstead of UBS. Your question please, Karl Keirstead\nKarl Keirstead: So maybe I could just ask you about what assumptions you're embedding in your guidance. I think one thing that investors took comfort from, at least I did on the last call, is your assumption that things get worse. So I just wanted to make sure I understand what you're assuming. Are you indeed assuming that things get worse in the second half from what you saw in July? One would assume so, given that you didn't carry the full 2Q beat into your full year raise, but I just would love to clarify.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, sure. So I think when you think about our second half assumptions, we generally think that they're broadly in line with what we experienced in Q2.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Got it. And then if I could ask a follow-up. Just building on the last question around these digital native customers, you probably don't want to specifically size it, but I think it might be helpful, like what does MongoDB's exposure to that customer segment? And was there any -- anything specific to your vertical exposure that is worth calling out in 2Q?\nMichael Gordon: As I look at the vertical exposure and the regional exposure across the mid-market, it was pretty broad-based. And so, I don't think there's anything specific worth calling out there. In terms of -- the mid-market overall is a small portion of the direct business and those digital natives are just a subset of the overall mid-market. And so, we're sort of talking about fractions of fractions here as we kind of winnow down. But what we saw in terms of the slower growth was across regions and across industries.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. I also want to add that we view this segment to be an important part of our business. We expect to add more customers in this segment over time. And this segment is frankly a great signal for our future prospects. When the next generation of companies are building on top of MongoDB that makes, frankly, us sleep a lot better at night. And so this is a segment that we'll continue to put a lot of focus on. But clearly, as Michael discussed, there's some short-term headwinds.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse. Your question please, Phil Winslow\nPhil Winslow: My question is, obviously, you highlighted some of the announcements from earlier the summer at MongoDB World. Dev, you touched on the relational migrate, but wondering if you could give us some of the early feedback that you're hearing from customers, whether it be the geographic indexing, secondary improvements around time series, search, et cetera. Anything that you're getting positive feedback on that you think is resonating with customers?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So we're getting a lot of positive feedback on time series, much like in search, where essentially customers like the one unified and seamless platform, a very elegant developer experience and the ability to essentially drive cost out of the business. We're seeing the same phenomenon in time series. There's a lot of demand. Again, we're taking things slowly. It's a new product. Obviously, we're already seeing customers starting to use it. But it's in the early days, and we get -- expect to get a lot of feedback. And as you know, in this space, this is a multiyear journey, but we're really excited about the opportunity to drive more time series workloads on MongoDB. And I should also say we used to do -- we always had many customers use us for time series workloads, especially in the IoT area, but we just expect that to happen even more now that we have more capability to address these sophisticated workloads.\nPhil Winslow: And then just a follow-up on that. Obviously, you highlighted vendor consolidation from a relational -- no SQL perspective. But when you think about these multiple new tools that you just mentioned, the potential of MongoDB to consolidate those. How do you think about that opportunity once again, not just relational on to SQL, but consolidation of call it, multiple no SQL functions and, call it, other functions as well?\nDJ Hynes: Yes. So to your point, we do view the developer data platform in some ways, not just a benefit for customers in terms of having one unified and elegant developer experience. One data silo versus multiple silos, but it also enables customers to consolidate vendors and drive more efficiency in their business. I do believe some of these niche companies are going to struggle in this environment because -- we've always talked about this, and I think it only becomes even more imperative is customers don't want to use a net new technology for every net use case. It just doesn't scale as much more complexity to the environment, makes the developer's life much more difficult. And I think that's going to be resonate even more now in this environment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Ader of William Blair. Jason Ader, your line is open.\nJason Ader: Guys, in thinking about the lower op income guide, are you basically saying that the mix of new customers versus existing customers is different than what you expected a quarter or two ago and basically new customers are more expensive to transact with? Is that the right way to think about the lower op income for the year guidance?\nMichael Gordon: No, that's not how I think about it. I think about it as being -- we are continuing to see good customer wins and strong receptivity in the market that underscores or translates into strong customer unit economics. And so, we are continuing to invest in building out sales. And as you think about what the implication is in terms of rolling through some of the slower cohort expansion of existing Atlas customers that we're seeing. And when you run the math through, that winds up having a slight impact to our full year op income guide. So I wouldn't take it as any kind of judgment or try to do any math unless some sort of incremental value of workloads or slicing and dicing it that way, just simply us, saying, us looking at the market, having a long-term orientation, continuing to see strong new wins, no increases in customer churn, continuing to have the value proposition resonate and being sort of at the top of the customer priority list. And so, wanting to continue to invest in that as well as also continuing to invest in our product capabilities and executing against our platform vision, all of which, of course monitoring how the whole package comes together. And to Dev's point, we've never taken a growth at all cost approach. It's always been a very financially disciplined oriented one, but that's just sort of how the numbers run through to wind up with sort of a slight decrease in the op income guide.\nJason Ader: Was that a tough decision to make right now, Michael, just given the optics of the revenue guide and then the op income as well?\nMichael Gordon: No. I think when you're looking at the long term when you see the underlying returns that we're seeing and the success we're having in the market, no.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham & Company. Please go ahead, Mike Cikos.\nMike Cikos: I do apologize if this was recapped already. I've just been juggling a couple of different earnings calls tonight. But I did want to ask, I know that on these investments in the second half of the year when you're looking at the sales and marketing and the R&D. So specifically on sales and marketing in that go-to-market. Is there a way to help us think through the anticipated, whether it's head count growth or those assumptions around productivity? And maybe as a much more basic question, what is the anticipated time for those new hires to ramp? And then the follow-up I had is on the strategic collaborations you guys have. I know last quarter we were talking about the AWS announcement in this current press release we're talking about Google. How do those strategic relationships continue to evolve for MongoDB?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Sure. So I think on the first question, while we always, regardless of environment continue to sort of tweak and optimize which channels and which roles we want to prioritize and allocate, we won't tackle that any differently than we have previously. While we always, regardless of environment continue to sort of tweak and optimize which channels and which roles we want to prioritize and allocate, we won't tackle that any differently than we have previously. And the overall unit economics continue to be strong, sort of as I mentioned. So, I wouldn't think of there being any kind of radical rephasing of the sales and marketing. And when we think about the new customer wins that we're having, you saw it was a record quarter for new customer net new additions in customer count. And when we've sort of crossed 1% market share and are closing in 2% market share, and our biggest challenge is we've talked about sort of each call probably, is that our footprint coverage is very thin. When we are in conversations and in dialogues, our win rates are exceptionally high. And when you marry that with some of the anecdotes and vignettes that Dev shared about customers really responding to our developer data platform, we want to continue pursuing that for the benefit of the long-term outcome.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. And Mike, to your second question about our strategic relationships with the hyperscale vendors, they're very strong. One is the function of how popular MongoDB is on their respective platforms. We've been constantly told that we are one of the most popular technologies that developers are running on their platforms. Two, what they've also seen is that they're the net beneficiary of our growth and the Atlas growth on their platforms because customers not only -- obviously, Atlas drives more underlying consumption of storage and compute but customers themselves end up using other ancillary services. So for the hyperscale vendor, it truly becomes a win-win relationship. And so you talked about the AWS relationship. That relationship is going really, really well. There's so much engagement happening in literally almost every theater of the world. The GCP relationship has historically been strong and remains so. And the Azure relationship is actually picking up, and we're seeing a lot more activity with the Microsoft Azure team. And so in general, I would frame the relationships with the hyperscale vendors to be very, very good.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, Rishi Jaluria\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. I wanted to ask first, maybe just thinking through the consumption patterns and the visibility there. Can you remind us within Atlas, how much spending is maybe in control of the Company or the developers versus those where the usage or consumption is dependent on the usage of the end application itself and by the consumers? Anything directional would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. The underlying usage is extremely tied to the database activity and the underlying usage and application of the application. And so, the value that we're driving is highly aligned to the value that the customers are seeing out of it.\nRishi Jaluria: Okay. Great. And then on the call, you did mention an example of a customer migrating a legacy monolithic app to the cloud, and you called out displacing both Oracle and Elastic in that. Can you maybe talk -- since you announced Atlas Search at the conference, how does the replacement opportunity look? How do you think about that in the long run? And what sort of early momentum have you seen with that product?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So the opportunity is quite big. The momentum -- I just want to remind you, we Elasticsearch offers other capabilities outside of application sources, which is our particular focus there in logs and some security use cases, which we're not pursuing. We're really focused on again, the persona of the developer. But in that area, we see a big opportunity. And that example kind of makes the point rather than using an OLTP platform and a bolt-on search database with MongoDB now you can have one seamless and unified platform, a very elegant developer experience and you don't have to invest in tooling to move data between your OLTP platform and your search database and vice versa. So that enables the customer to have a much more effective and performance system than using multiple solutions and customers are really resonating with that. And to your question about how things are going. We don't see any market constraints. Frankly, we're trying to enable our sales force as quickly as possible around the world to really get comfortable and conversant and kind of addressing this use case with our customers, and we're quite excited about the opportunity.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Koenig of SMBC Nikko Securities. Your line is open, Steve Koenig\nSteve Koenig: Steve Koenig here. Let's see. Well, I wanted to thank you first for the high degree of transparency around the trends in your business, very helpful. One question for Dev and one for Michael. Dev, as you're talking with existing customers that know you well, and they're looking at deploying Atlas for new workloads, new applications. What's the tone of those conversations? And how is that aspect of your business kind of trended in Q2? That -- and kind of what bigger picture, kind of what are your customers saying about their willingness to invest kind of given macro uncertainties here?\nDev Ittycheria: I would say the tone is very positive, and we feel really, really good about winning new workloads. The morale of our sales force is very high. They're very excited about the opportunity in front of them. And so, we feel really, really good about the opportunity to add both new customers as well as new workloads onto our platform, and that's a huge priority for us in the back half of the year as well.\nSteve Koenig: Terrific. Terrific. And Michael, for you. So you helped us understand what was behind the lower operating income guide with some granularity. But maybe if I could just back up and just make it super kind of simple for me. So you're raising your revenue guidance, but you're lowering the operating income guidance. And so, the Delta is spending. And so I guess, would I be correct in conclusion -- in concluding that you're accelerating the pace of spending in the second half versus what you previously anticipated? And if so kind of in what areas? So that's all I have.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Steve. It's not quite how I think about it. I think when you look at the investments that we're planning on making, there primarily in both sales and marketing and R&D for all the reasons that we've previously discussed, both in terms of increasing our footprint coverage as well as executing against our product road map. I think really what you see is you see the -- as we look at the revenue for the second half of the year by the fact that we took our guide up by less than the beat in Q2, right? You can see that there's implied less revenue in the second half, but we are executing against the long-term opportunity, in particular against those two areas. And so, I think it's just a sort of mathematical consequence of that more than anything else. We're quite aware of the current environment, and we keep a close pulse on everything, but we're not radically pivoting given that we're seeing incredibly strong customer reception. We're seeing record new customer wins. The value proposition is resonating not just despite the current environment, but in some cases because of the current environment, as we've talked about. And so as we position ourselves for the long term, that's really kind of how that plays out over the next couple of quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Your line is open, Brent Bracelin.\nBrent Bracelin: So I wanted to, Michael, start with you here. If I look at the implied second half guidance and actually drilled down into the implied Q4 revenue guide. It is well below the normal Q4 seasonal uptick that we typically see in this business. How much of that guide is tied to EA, the ratable components of EA and the fact that there's less visibility you have into some of those larger EA ratable deals? Just trying to -- it does look like that the guide implies Q4 will be well, well below normal seasonal patterns. So just trying to double click into what you factored in there on EA.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So a few different things. Thanks, Brent. A few different things. One, yes, we have continued to assume the EA continues to be a lower portion of the business. And we talked about our expectations for Q3 in terms of EA being down sequentially. And so that's certainly a factor. Secondly, I probably should have started with this. But as you know, we do run the business on a channel basis and the sort of products have to come out, but we do have to have some point of view on product in order to come up with our revenue forecast. And so that's what's happening as it relates to EA. In terms of Atlas, you're seeing two things. One, just like EA, they also have very tough Atlas compares year-over-year. Again, remember that in Q3 and Q4, that's when we saw the significant acceleration in cohort expansion from existing applications in the year ago period. And then the third thing that I'd say is we're entering the back half of the year, meaning we start Q3 with less in the way of ARR than we would have had we seen historical trends. And then when you start to flow that through, even if you instantly reverted to normalized levels, you would wind up with less revenue in the back half of the year. We are also assuming that the trends that we saw in Q2 continue in the second half of the year. And so the guidance that we provided for the second half of the year really is the output of all of that.\nBrent Bracelin: Got it. That's helpful color. And then just, Dev, as a quick follow-up for you here as we think about financial services vertical, in particular, that's an area where we've seen some job postings really start to pop up at some higher profile financial's customers. I think Snowflake specifically called out financial services as an area of strength for them as they kind of lean into some of these emerging technologies. What are you seeing in financial services? And maybe just DoubleClick a little bit more on that specific vertical and what you're seeing?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So financial services has historically been a strong vertical for us, and it remains as such. In fact, we feel really bullish about the opportunities in Financial Services, there were a lot of regulatory constraints about how quickly customers could move certain workloads to the cloud. A lot of those customers are much more inclined to move workloads to the cloud now than they say they were two, three, four years ago. So that's a trend as a tailwind for us. In general, financial services customers are also very apt to try and drive more innovation as they see, obviously, competitive pressures from the next generation of companies. So they're also very quick to recognize when they need to drive their innovation agenda more aggressively. Obviously, MongoDB becomes to play. And then in terms three, financial services historically is a company to try a lot of technologies to see ultimately who's going to be the winner in any particular sector. As we clearly become the leading player in this next-generation data platform space, it's clear that financial services companies are now more comfortable on standardizing on MongoDB, so we're starting to see that phenomenon as well. And so I think in general, we expect Financial Services to be a big part of our plans for the long term.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tyler Radke of Citi. Tyler Radke, your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Michael, I just wanted to go back to make sure I understood kind of what your underlying assumptions and commentary are on the macro environment. So I guess just, first, how should we think about the relative sizing of these digital-native customers that you're calling out? Is this kind of mid-single-digit percent of revenue? And then last quarter, I think you talked about a $30 million to $35 million macro headwind for the full year. I just want to clarify, are you saying it's a little bit worse than that? Or that's kind of the same expectations as last quarter?\nMichael Gordon: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Tyler. So remember, the mid-market is the smallest piece of the overall direct customer sales channel and the digital natives are a small subset of the mid-market. So again, as I mentioned earlier, we're sort of talking about fractions of fractions. And then in terms of your question around how did Q2 and how did Q -- basically, how does the back half of the year compare. As we -- as I called out in the prepared remarks, we had some areas that were better than expected. So self-serve enterprise in North America. Overall new business activity in general were all to the positive. In terms of the existing consumption or the sort of growth of existing applications, it was weaker in Europe across the board, meaning both enterprise and mid-market and then mid-market sort of without regard to industry or geography. And so a little bit of pluses and minuses as you think, relative to sort of the stake that we put in the ground back in June. And then in terms of the second half of the year, obviously, as I mentioned earlier, we have -- our effective outlook is worse than it was in June, but we're assuming that the trends that we saw in Q2 continue for the balance of the year.\nTyler Radke: Okay. And as I think about your largest customers, your enterprise customers, not necessarily enterprise advanced revenue. How are you thinking about that consumption maintaining in the back half of this year? And I guess, billings was really strong again, north of 50%. So do you have better visibility? Is more of that revenue kind of coming from pre-committed contracts or from the balance sheet?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So if you think about the enterprise channel on a product mix basis, obviously, it will be disproportionate or more representative of EA relative to Atlas, although we are increasingly seeing Atlas and the Atlas value proposition resonate at the high end of the market as well. And so I don't think it's just as simple as trying to slice that channel by product. We continue to see strong new business in enterprise globally. And then on the consumption patterns, North American Enterprise has been very strong and is better than our expectations. And as I mentioned Europe being a little weaker.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Fred Havemeyer of Macquarie. Your line is open, Fred Havemeyer.\nFred Havemeyer: When you look at your Atlas consumption model, do you think that Atlas' alignment with your end customers' demand trend means that you're more or less seeing the macro downturn in essentially real time, something that maybe is a little more unique here versus other software vendors? Do you think that this alignment also means that you can see the benefits of economic recovery sooner than other annual subscription software models?\nMichael Gordon: So, I think the short answer, Fred is yes. We do think it's a more real-time reflection given that we're really sort of a second order effect of the underlying activity in their applications. And obviously, we're not macroeconomists, and so I'm not forecasting recovery, we guess theoretically that if there were increases in activity and increases in underlying usage, that would drive incremental consumption of our platform.\nFred Havemeyer: And I'll fire one more out there quickly. We got quite excited about Queryable Encryption. And I wanted to ask, less about Queryable Encryption, but more about just generally your innovation because using structured encryption, very interesting, you're always at kind of the bleeding edge in already technical market in terms of products and functionality. So I wanted to ask, how do you think about investing into R&D spend generally for technical innovation versus kind of incremental platform updates? And do you think that in this labor market with tech layoffs rising, do you see tactical hiring opportunities?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So I will answer the second part of your question first. Clearly, we feel really good about the team we had, and we tend to hire some of the best and brightest engineers in the marketplace. Clearly, in this macro environment, we will be opportunistic as an opportunity to do some acqui-hiring. We'll certainly pursue that path if it makes sense. In terms of your question around our R&D philosophy, I would say that it's really driven, first and foremost, by one customer feedback with 37,000 customers. We have a lot of customers that give us feedback. It's also driven by essentially our instincts about where the market is going and what developers may need going forward. And as I talked about earlier, answering one of the other questions, we think the scope of the role of developer is only expanding over time. And we think that the developer can do more, especially in the area of analytics. With regards to Queryable Encryption, this is one of the classic challenges that we've had in software is encrypting data is nice because it secures the data, but then it becomes very hard to use that data. And so if you can kind of almost have your cake and eat it too by making that data queryable while keeping it secure especially in an environment where people care a lot about security and privacy, that becomes a win-win. So obviously, we have a team, a very strong team in the security space. And we were able to leverage some very cutting-edge work going on in academia to leverage a couple of people to join us and help us build this feature. So, we're really excited about the opportunity that we have in front of us.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dev Ittycheria for closing remarks. Sir?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We obviously had a really strong Q2. The new business environment really remains quite robust and customers continue to gravitate to the developer data platform to reduce complexity, outsource undifferentiated work, and drive more efficiencies. We did see some consumption headwinds in the quarter, and that's really tied to the growth of the underlying applications. And those applications are growing more slowly than historical trends, but we remain incredibly optimistic about the opportunities in front of us, and we will be investing for the long slice of opportunity. So, thank you very much for your time and we'll talk to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the second quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our second quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2023. First, I'll start with our second quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $303.7 million, up 53% year-over-year. As Dev mentioned, we saw a continued strong new business environment and experienced no noticeable change in sales cycles. To us, this is an indication that we remain a top priority for our customers. Shifting to our product mix. Enterprise Advanced exceeded our expectations driven by upsells to existing customers. Moving on to Atlas. Atlas grew 73% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 64% of total revenue compared to 56% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and 60% last quarter. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenue based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely related to end-user activity of the application, which can be impacted by the macroeconomic environment. Overall, our performance this quarter was strong, and we're pleased with our results. We do think it's helpful to provide investors some incremental context around the puts and takes that we are seeing in consumption trends. As you probably recall, on our Q1 call, we shared with you that we were starting to see the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty on Atlas consumption in certain pockets of our business and discuss with you the framework on how we expected the macro impact to play out for the rest of the year. Let me update you on our performance compared to this framework in Q2. Starting with our self-service channel. You'll recall that we experienced slower than historical consumption growth in Europe in Q1 and in the U.S. in May. The May consumption patterns generally continued for the remainder of Q2 and self-serve did modestly better than our expectations. Moving on to the mid-market channel. For context, the customers in this channel tend to be traditional medium-sized businesses. This channel included -- tend not to be traditional medium-sized businesses. This channel includes a disproportionate share of digital native, fast-growth companies that have built their businesses on MongoDB. Our expectation that the mid-market slowdown we saw in Europe in Q1 would become global in Q2. This is what we experienced, but the slowdown was more significant than we had expected, specifically the digit layer subset of the mid-market experienced slower growth in their applications as a result of macroeconomic conditions, and therefore, their underlying consumption growth of MongoDB slowed as well. Finally, turning to enterprise, our largest channel. As in Q1, we had not seen an impact on consumption but we expected a modest impact to manifest itself in Q2. Here, consumption growth was above our expectations in North America, while in Europe, we experienced greater-than-expected macroeconomic headwinds. The slowdown in Europe was evidenced across all sub-regions and industries. Turning to customer growth. During the second quarter, we grew our customer base by over 1,800 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 37,000, which is up from over 29,000 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count, over 5,400 are direct sales customers, which compared to over 3,600 in the year ago period. Q1 was a record quarter of direct customer net additions, which speaks to the popularity of our platform, and the relevance of our value proposition. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform as well as self-service customers with whom we've now established a direct sales relationship. The growth in our total customer count is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 35,500 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 27,500 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter of our net AR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,462 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,126 in the year ago period. Moving down to the income statement. I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the second quarter was $223.2 million, representing a gross margin of 73%, which is up from 72% in the year-ago period. Our year-over-year margin improvement is primarily driven by improved efficiencies that we are realizing in Atlas. Our loss from operations was $12.4 million or a negative 4%. Operating margin for the second quarter compared to a negative 2% operating margin in the year ago period. As a reminder, in Q2, we saw the return of large in-person events most notably our flagship event MongoDB World, which attracted approximately 3,000 attendees to the Javits Center in New York. Net loss in the second quarter was $15.6 million or $0.23 per share based on 68.3 million weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $7.7 million or $0.12 per share on 63.4 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was negative $44.7 million after taking into consideration approximately $3.9 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities. Free cash flow was negative $48.6 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of negative $22.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2023. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $300 million to $303 million. We expect non-GAAP loss operations to be in the range of $10 million to $8 million. And non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.19 to $0.16 based on 68.9 million estimated weighted average share count. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.196 billion to $1.206 billion. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be in the range of $13 million to $8 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.28 based on $68.6 million estimated weighted average shares outstanding. I'll now provide some more context around our guidance. First, we expect the Atlas consumption trends we experienced in Q2 to continue for the remainder of the year. Second, in the second half of last year, as we called out at the time, we had exceptionally strong Atlas consumption growth leading to difficult Atlas year-over-year compares to the back half of the year. And third, we expect a sequential decline in Enterprise Advance in Q3 as the renewal base is sequentially lower. Looking into Q4, we expect a seasonal uptick in revenue from EA. But recall, we faced a very difficult year-over-year comparison given strong EA new business activity we saw last year. To summarize, MongoDB delivered strong second quarter results. Our new business performance and record direct customer net additions indicate the strong underlying demand for our developer data platform. We will continue investing responsibly in pursuit of our long-term opportunity. And with that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Yes. So in general, the mid-market is a small portion of the overall direct business and therefore, their business overall. And in terms of August, August was consistent with what we experienced in Q2. Yes, a couple of different things. From a macro standpoint, if you take a step back, we're investing relative to our long-term opportunity. We have very fractional penetration and continue to see robust new business. As you think about the business more holistically, new customers and new workloads are what really determine the long-term outcome and the long-term success. And so, we continue to invest in sales and marketing and in the R&D of the platform to position ourselves to capitalize on that long-term opportunity. As it relates to expansion of existing workloads, which is sort of the other piece of the equation, that's more relevant in the short term not as relevant in the long term. And so, that's where we've seen the slower growth that we've described. And so, we're continuing to take a long-term orientation. We're obviously not doing that in a vacuum or with blinders on. We've always maintained a high level of financial discipline and scrutiny, and we continue to prioritize the highest level investments and constantly monitor things to make sure that we're being appropriate in terms of positioning ourselves for the long run. Yes. And Raimo, on your question on EA, as you know, we manage the business on a channel basis, not a product basis, but certainly want to try and call out some of the trends so that people can kind of put the guide in context and some of the things that we're thinking about. The new business environment continues to be robust. But EA continues to be a smaller and smaller percentage of that overall new business environment. And so as you look at the back half of the year, that continuing sort of evolution and share is sort of important to take into account. In addition, EA is subject to 606 accounting and the term license component there, which adds into the increased variability and reduced comparability that we see period-to-period. And then lastly, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did have very strong performance of EA in the second half of last year. And so not only does that set up a tough compare in the classic sense but depending on the nature of the structure of a deal, that's a multiyear deal, the term license revenue can be recognized upfront. And so not only does it boost the current period that now becomes the year ago period, but the current period, which is now the present period in the back half of this year doesn't have that license revenue. And so you sort of got a two-factor impact there. I'm just trying to call that out for folks so they understand. Yes. I would just -- to your second question about sort of second half and compares. I walked through the EA compare on the Atlas compare, yes, last year, we had very strong cohort expansion in Q3 and in Q4 that leads to difficult compares. But also -- and I think this is part of your point, Kash. As you think about where we're entering the second half of the year, right, as we start off the third quarter, given some of the slower growth that we've seen and the expansion of existing cohorts, that starting ARR is at a lower point as we look at the second half of the year, and so that will also affect fiscal '23 results. Obviously, we're not providing fiscal '24 guidance on this call, and we'll look to do that on the March call. But certainly, how the next six months play out will impact kind of the starting position for fiscal '24. Yes. I think it's a couple of different things. There are two flavors here. And again, I would just sort of go back to this way to look at the market and how it flows through in terms of the numbers. There are new customer wins, right? So, that new companies are obviously being created regularly in that digital native part of the mid-market, that subset. And we continue to have a very strong value proposition there. We continue to resonate. We continue to be a platform of choice as it relates to that. In terms of the consumption side, and that's ultimately what's most important for the long term. And so our ability to land those customers to continue to have success with those customers is a long-term asset and accretes to sort of long-term value proposition. In the short term, depending on how long the current macroeconomic environment goes on as we see slower growth from those customers that will impact numbers in the short term, but that's a relatively small part of the equation. If I think about the long-term opportunity and what relative market share we have and everything else, it's fairly early on. And so obviously, we've got to sort of navigate through that period, and we talked about sort of our desire to keep an ability to keep sort of a close pulse on things, but that's really how we think about it. Yes, sure. So I think when you think about our second half assumptions, we generally think that they're broadly in line with what we experienced in Q2. As I look at the vertical exposure and the regional exposure across the mid-market, it was pretty broad-based. And so, I don't think there's anything specific worth calling out there. In terms of -- the mid-market overall is a small portion of the direct business and those digital natives are just a subset of the overall mid-market. And so, we're sort of talking about fractions of fractions here as we kind of winnow down. But what we saw in terms of the slower growth was across regions and across industries. No, that's not how I think about it. I think about it as being -- we are continuing to see good customer wins and strong receptivity in the market that underscores or translates into strong customer unit economics. And so, we are continuing to invest in building out sales. And as you think about what the implication is in terms of rolling through some of the slower cohort expansion of existing Atlas customers that we're seeing. And when you run the math through, that winds up having a slight impact to our full year op income guide. So I wouldn't take it as any kind of judgment or try to do any math unless some sort of incremental value of workloads or slicing and dicing it that way, just simply us, saying, us looking at the market, having a long-term orientation, continuing to see strong new wins, no increases in customer churn, continuing to have the value proposition resonate and being sort of at the top of the customer priority list. And so, wanting to continue to invest in that as well as also continuing to invest in our product capabilities and executing against our platform vision, all of which, of course monitoring how the whole package comes together. And to Dev's point, we've never taken a growth at all cost approach. It's always been a very financially disciplined oriented one, but that's just sort of how the numbers run through to wind up with sort of a slight decrease in the op income guide. No. I think when you're looking at the long term when you see the underlying returns that we're seeing and the success we're having in the market, no. Yes. Thanks, Steve. It's not quite how I think about it. I think when you look at the investments that we're planning on making, there primarily in both sales and marketing and R&D for all the reasons that we've previously discussed, both in terms of increasing our footprint coverage as well as executing against our product road map. I think really what you see is you see the -- as we look at the revenue for the second half of the year by the fact that we took our guide up by less than the beat in Q2, right? You can see that there's implied less revenue in the second half, but we are executing against the long-term opportunity, in particular against those two areas. And so, I think it's just a sort of mathematical consequence of that more than anything else. We're quite aware of the current environment, and we keep a close pulse on everything, but we're not radically pivoting given that we're seeing incredibly strong customer reception. We're seeing record new customer wins. The value proposition is resonating not just despite the current environment, but in some cases because of the current environment, as we've talked about. And so as we position ourselves for the long term, that's really kind of how that plays out over the next couple of quarters. Yes. So a few different things. Thanks, Brent. A few different things. One, yes, we have continued to assume the EA continues to be a lower portion of the business. And we talked about our expectations for Q3 in terms of EA being down sequentially. And so that's certainly a factor. Secondly, I probably should have started with this. But as you know, we do run the business on a channel basis and the sort of products have to come out, but we do have to have some point of view on product in order to come up with our revenue forecast. And so that's what's happening as it relates to EA. In terms of Atlas, you're seeing two things. One, just like EA, they also have very tough Atlas compares year-over-year. Again, remember that in Q3 and Q4, that's when we saw the significant acceleration in cohort expansion from existing applications in the year ago period. And then the third thing that I'd say is we're entering the back half of the year, meaning we start Q3 with less in the way of ARR than we would have had we seen historical trends. And then when you start to flow that through, even if you instantly reverted to normalized levels, you would wind up with less revenue in the back half of the year. We are also assuming that the trends that we saw in Q2 continue in the second half of the year. And so the guidance that we provided for the second half of the year really is the output of all of that. Sure. Yes. Thanks, Tyler. So remember, the mid-market is the smallest piece of the overall direct customer sales channel and the digital natives are a small subset of the mid-market. So again, as I mentioned earlier, we're sort of talking about fractions of fractions. And then in terms of your question around how did Q2 and how did Q -- basically, how does the back half of the year compare. As we -- as I called out in the prepared remarks, we had some areas that were better than expected. So self-serve enterprise in North America. Overall new business activity in general were all to the positive. In terms of the existing consumption or the sort of growth of existing applications, it was weaker in Europe across the board, meaning both enterprise and mid-market and then mid-market sort of without regard to industry or geography. And so a little bit of pluses and minuses as you think, relative to sort of the stake that we put in the ground back in June. And then in terms of the second half of the year, obviously, as I mentioned earlier, we have -- our effective outlook is worse than it was in June, but we're assuming that the trends that we saw in Q2 continue for the balance of the year. Yes. So if you think about the enterprise channel on a product mix basis, obviously, it will be disproportionate or more representative of EA relative to Atlas, although we are increasingly seeing Atlas and the Atlas value proposition resonate at the high end of the market as well. And so I don't think it's just as simple as trying to slice that channel by product. We continue to see strong new business in enterprise globally. And then on the consumption patterns, North American Enterprise has been very strong and is better than our expectations. And as I mentioned Europe being a little weaker. So, I think the short answer, Fred is yes. We do think it's a more real-time reflection given that we're really sort of a second order effect of the underlying activity in their applications. And obviously, we're not macroeconomists, and so I'm not forecasting recovery, we guess theoretically that if there were increases in activity and increases in underlying usage, that would drive incremental consumption of our platform."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our second quarter results before giving you a broader company update. Let's start with our second quarter financial results. We generated revenue of $304 million, a 53% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 73% year-over-year, representing 64% of revenue, and we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 37,000 customers. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in execution in Q2 despite the challenging macro environment. Let me give you a bit more context on what we saw in Q2. The new business environment remains robust as evidenced by our record increase in direct sales customer account. We have seen no change in deal activity in sales cycles. We believe our strong new sales performance is a demonstration of the critical business value our developer data platform delivers and our superior go-to-market execution. As we have said in the past, nearly every organization uses software to drive their value proposition. Consequently, these organizations seek modern solutions that make their developers more productive. Furthermore, expansion rates remain strong, further evidence that MongoDB is a non-discretionary spend for our customers. As expected, we did see the macro environment weigh on the growth of Atlas consumption. As we discussed last quarter, it's important to understand that the slower than historical consumption growth is a result of slower usage growth of our customers' underlying applications due to macro conditions. Our customers spend on our platform is well aligned with the performance of their business. In the current environment, some businesses and consequently, their applications are growing more slowly. Michael will address the second quarter consumption trends in more detail. Let me tell you how we are navigating the current environment. First, we are doubling down on velocity. As we discussed with you in the past, we are in the business of bringing new workloads onto our platform and then focus on making those workloads successful. In the current environment, we are even more focused on removing friction in acquiring workloads from new and existing customers. The strength of our new business performance in the first half of the year demonstrates our success in this area. Second, we will continue to invest for the long term, and we'll make investments in our growth initiatives and platform capabilities where we are generating strong returns. We have never taken a growth at all cost approach and we will remain vigilant and prioritize our highest return areas. We are confident that the recent consumption trends will improve as the macro environment normalizes over time. The value proposition of the MongoDB developer data platform has never been stronger. Our conviction comes not only from our results, but also from the success our customers are having with our platform. Customers are very focused on removing complexity from the technology stack. They understand that complexity is a [tax] (ph) that increases expenses, creates risks and slows down innovation. They are increasingly turning to our developer data platform to address this challenge. A multinational trillion-dollar financial services company chose MongoDB to power the next-generation trading platform to cover all of their various trading businesses with one solution. Since launching the new service, the customer has been able to decommission eight legacy trading systems and realized cost savings of almost $50 million in annualized expenses. A leading Canadian security provider migrated its IoT and AI security platform away from an open source relational database to Atlas. With the ability to use MongoDB's native charting to distribute their database over lower cost instances, the Company has been able to significantly reduce their database spend by 60%, which is particularly compelling given the open source nature of their prior solutions. Another one of our customer priorities is to invest in their core competencies and outsource or eliminate everything else. They understand that clinging to the old ways of delivering innovation is not only time-consuming, but also incredibly expensive. A global travel technology leader is in the process of getting out of the business of managing their own data centers. They turn to MongoDB in order to modernize a key legacy application and move it to the cloud. The monolithic application was originally built on Oracle and Elasticsearch but the customer decided to migrate the application to Atlas because they couldn't meet their timeline and performance requirements with their existing solution. A web 3.0 pioneer start off by building and managing their own computing infrastructure. However, the development team quickly reached a point where they overwhelmed by day-to-day task of managing infrastructure. By migrating to MongoDB Atlas the company saved three years in development time and reduced the need to hire 40 developers. Finally, in this environment, as any other, customers understand that high performance and scalability are critical to their success. A Fortune 500 consumer technology leader turned to MongoDB to replace its existing compliance platform as it needed to double the performance while lowering cost and enabling real-time visibility of operations. MongoDB was able to address the performance requirements while lowering costs by 70%. One of the world's largest health care companies, historically an Oracle shop, was unable to meet their desired performance expectations and had to spend tens of thousands of hours just to maintain their existing environment. Over the last few years, they have implemented MongoDB for the most demanding new projects, such as the COVID vaccine application as well as their digital health app. Perhaps the best way to illustrate how the perception MongoDB has changed is to review our relationship with one of the world's premier commercial investment banks. Four years ago, a senior executive of the bank told me that he didn't think MongoDB was ready to be declared a standard for their mission-critical applications. At the time, they had a myriad of relational and non-relational technologies deployed across the organization. Since then, not only does the bank become more focused on and confident in moving workloads to cloud, but the bank's leadership team also observed how overwhelmingly popular MongoDB had become with their development teams across the organization. As a result, they decided to make MongoDB one of their enterprise standard offerings as part of the journey to the cloud. In the second quarter, they signed a multimillion dollar agreement as a sign of their desire to use MongoDB as a preferred platform for mission-critical workloads. Our customers are not only excited about our current product offering, but also by our road map. We received enthusiastic feedback at this year's MongoDB World about our developer data platform vision as well as our product announcements. To highlight a few, we announced Queryable Encryption, an industry-first feature that allows customers to query data while it remains encrypted. Given the heightened focus on security and privacy, this announcement received a lot of attention from both customers and the academic community. And currently, over 60 companies, the majority of whom are Fortune 500 customers, are in development with this feature. We also announced Relational Migrator, a product that simplifies the process of migrating workloads off relational databases and on to MongoDB. Our early access program is oversubscribed, and we're getting great customer feedback. Given most companies increased focus on cost management, we believe this technology will accelerate customer confidence in replatforming applications of relational databases. We also received positive feedback related to our analytics announcements. Most notably, Atlas Data Federation and Atlas Data Lake storage are seeing healthy early adoption in use cases related to the ingestion, data transformation, and querying of large volumes of data to provide greater insights from data generated by applications on Atlas. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some additional customer wins and interesting use cases from the second quarter. A leading German retailer, Conrad Electronic, built an online B2B marketplace on MongoDB. Turning to MongoDB for simplicity as the marketplace grew it moved from MongoDB Community Edition to Atlas for further scalability and to reduce management complexity. Conrad Electronics database now hosts over 8 million active SKUs, which is estimated to reach 100 million SKUs by 2024. Locus Robotics, a leading warehouse robotics company leverages Atlas to store data uploaded from their physical warehouses, including metadata, logs, configurations and reports. Their Locus Cloud warehouse orchestration platform utilizes Atlas to store and access data for operational reports, ensuring seamless and reliable functionality for their customers. Locus Robotics were selected MongoDB Atlas because they needed a fully managed data platform to allow them to build faster and handle vast amounts of data. In their efforts to improve their automation processes, e-commerce platform Rent the Runway selected and implemented MongoDB Atlas as a database platform to streamline how garments were sorted and cleaned in their fulfillment centers. With Atlas, Rent the Runway is able to seamlessly extract data and real-time analytics from the robotic sorting arm and X-ray machines, resulting in a 67% decrease in processing time. In summary, I am pleased with our execution in the second quarter. Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, we are focusing on what we can directly control, namely bring new customers and new workloads onto our platform. The breadth of adoption across many use cases gives us continued confidence to judiciously invest across our business to best position ourselves to fully capitalize on our long-term market opportunity. With that, here's Michael. Raimo, to your first question, we've been essentially being used for mission-critical applications for some time now. And that's evidenced by almost every bank on Wall Street is using us for some important use case. We have large Fortune 500 companies in industries like telecom, media, tech, health care, et cetera, who are using us for very mission-critical use cases. I would say that we're still early in the journey in terms of having greater share in those large accounts. And you've heard us talk about our focus on focus accounts. We are bringing more resources to bear to really drive the expansion of those existing accounts and get more workloads on our platform. And that's, as Michael mentioned, going well. But in terms of MongoDB's readiness for mission-critical platforms, we feel like we're really well positioned. We've added some new capabilities, which we announced at MongoDB World, and our road map is very rich with features. So our customers truly view us as a strategic platform, and that's why you're seeing more and more customers standardize on MongoDB. Kash, thanks for your question. On your first question, I just want to remind everyone, we're not seeing any change in deal sizes or sales cycle times. I think your point about as customers face this macro headwind, is there an opportunity for them to essentially drive more efficiency in their business? And we're definitely seeing customers starting to do that. We're definitely seeing customers look at their legacy platforms and recognize how expensive and brittle those platforms are and are more motivated to move on to more modern platforms like MongoDB. Frankly, to help customers in that journey, that was a motivation for us to release the Relational Migrator product because this is not a new trend to help customers just reduce the cost of moving off relational to MongoDB. And I think you're going to see more and more customers take a hard look at their legacy infrastructure and think about modernizing potentially sooner than later. Yes. Thanks, DJ. So first of all, I want to make it clear to everyone that we don't see Snowflake in any deals, right? So in terms of customer buying behavior, there's no confusion. Obviously, there is acknowledgment that there is potentially some -- a trend of some overlap between analytics and operational OLTP stores. And what we believe is that the future analytics will really be powering more intelligent applications, which is essentially automating human decision-making that is done today using existing BI tools and data warehouses. So when you think about how apps become more sophisticated, it's really all about software and automation, which is really a developer challenge. And one thing I think we've proven is to know how to build tools for developers to be more productive and more effective. And so, that's what we plan to do. And I should also point out that this trend of developers doing more, we've already seen, say, in the DevOps space where developers have taken on more of the operational responsibility that operators and data centers use to do or in the security space where developers are taking on more responsibility for security and as a whole advent of new security-focused developer tools. And we think the same thing will happen in analytics, where developers will basically embed more analytics into building smarter applications. Yes. I also want to add that we view this segment to be an important part of our business. We expect to add more customers in this segment over time. And this segment is frankly a great signal for our future prospects. When the next generation of companies are building on top of MongoDB that makes, frankly, us sleep a lot better at night. And so this is a segment that we'll continue to put a lot of focus on. But clearly, as Michael discussed, there's some short-term headwinds. Yes. So we're getting a lot of positive feedback on time series, much like in search, where essentially customers like the one unified and seamless platform, a very elegant developer experience and the ability to essentially drive cost out of the business. We're seeing the same phenomenon in time series. There's a lot of demand. Again, we're taking things slowly. It's a new product. Obviously, we're already seeing customers starting to use it. But it's in the early days, and we get -- expect to get a lot of feedback. And as you know, in this space, this is a multiyear journey, but we're really excited about the opportunity to drive more time series workloads on MongoDB. And I should also say we used to do -- we always had many customers use us for time series workloads, especially in the IoT area, but we just expect that to happen even more now that we have more capability to address these sophisticated workloads. Yes. Sure. So I think on the first question, while we always, regardless of environment continue to sort of tweak and optimize which channels and which roles we want to prioritize and allocate, we won't tackle that any differently than we have previously. While we always, regardless of environment continue to sort of tweak and optimize which channels and which roles we want to prioritize and allocate, we won't tackle that any differently than we have previously. And the overall unit economics continue to be strong, sort of as I mentioned. So, I wouldn't think of there being any kind of radical rephasing of the sales and marketing. And when we think about the new customer wins that we're having, you saw it was a record quarter for new customer net new additions in customer count. And when we've sort of crossed 1% market share and are closing in 2% market share, and our biggest challenge is we've talked about sort of each call probably, is that our footprint coverage is very thin. When we are in conversations and in dialogues, our win rates are exceptionally high. And when you marry that with some of the anecdotes and vignettes that Dev shared about customers really responding to our developer data platform, we want to continue pursuing that for the benefit of the long-term outcome. Yes. And Mike, to your second question about our strategic relationships with the hyperscale vendors, they're very strong. One is the function of how popular MongoDB is on their respective platforms. We've been constantly told that we are one of the most popular technologies that developers are running on their platforms. Two, what they've also seen is that they're the net beneficiary of our growth and the Atlas growth on their platforms because customers not only -- obviously, Atlas drives more underlying consumption of storage and compute but customers themselves end up using other ancillary services. So for the hyperscale vendor, it truly becomes a win-win relationship. And so you talked about the AWS relationship. That relationship is going really, really well. There's so much engagement happening in literally almost every theater of the world. The GCP relationship has historically been strong and remains so. And the Azure relationship is actually picking up, and we're seeing a lot more activity with the Microsoft Azure team. And so in general, I would frame the relationships with the hyperscale vendors to be very, very good. Yes. The underlying usage is extremely tied to the database activity and the underlying usage and application of the application. And so, the value that we're driving is highly aligned to the value that the customers are seeing out of it. Yes. So the opportunity is quite big. The momentum -- I just want to remind you, we Elasticsearch offers other capabilities outside of application sources, which is our particular focus there in logs and some security use cases, which we're not pursuing. We're really focused on again, the persona of the developer. But in that area, we see a big opportunity. And that example kind of makes the point rather than using an OLTP platform and a bolt-on search database with MongoDB now you can have one seamless and unified platform, a very elegant developer experience and you don't have to invest in tooling to move data between your OLTP platform and your search database and vice versa. So that enables the customer to have a much more effective and performance system than using multiple solutions and customers are really resonating with that. And to your question about how things are going. We don't see any market constraints. Frankly, we're trying to enable our sales force as quickly as possible around the world to really get comfortable and conversant and kind of addressing this use case with our customers, and we're quite excited about the opportunity. I would say the tone is very positive, and we feel really, really good about winning new workloads. The morale of our sales force is very high. They're very excited about the opportunity in front of them. And so, we feel really, really good about the opportunity to add both new customers as well as new workloads onto our platform, and that's a huge priority for us in the back half of the year as well. Yes. So financial services has historically been a strong vertical for us, and it remains as such. In fact, we feel really bullish about the opportunities in Financial Services, there were a lot of regulatory constraints about how quickly customers could move certain workloads to the cloud. A lot of those customers are much more inclined to move workloads to the cloud now than they say they were two, three, four years ago. So that's a trend as a tailwind for us. In general, financial services customers are also very apt to try and drive more innovation as they see, obviously, competitive pressures from the next generation of companies. So they're also very quick to recognize when they need to drive their innovation agenda more aggressively. Obviously, MongoDB becomes to play. And then in terms three, financial services historically is a company to try a lot of technologies to see ultimately who's going to be the winner in any particular sector. As we clearly become the leading player in this next-generation data platform space, it's clear that financial services companies are now more comfortable on standardizing on MongoDB, so we're starting to see that phenomenon as well. And so I think in general, we expect Financial Services to be a big part of our plans for the long term. Yes. So I will answer the second part of your question first. Clearly, we feel really good about the team we had, and we tend to hire some of the best and brightest engineers in the marketplace. Clearly, in this macro environment, we will be opportunistic as an opportunity to do some acqui-hiring. We'll certainly pursue that path if it makes sense. In terms of your question around our R&D philosophy, I would say that it's really driven, first and foremost, by one customer feedback with 37,000 customers. We have a lot of customers that give us feedback. It's also driven by essentially our instincts about where the market is going and what developers may need going forward. And as I talked about earlier, answering one of the other questions, we think the scope of the role of developer is only expanding over time. And we think that the developer can do more, especially in the area of analytics. With regards to Queryable Encryption, this is one of the classic challenges that we've had in software is encrypting data is nice because it secures the data, but then it becomes very hard to use that data. And so if you can kind of almost have your cake and eat it too by making that data queryable while keeping it secure especially in an environment where people care a lot about security and privacy, that becomes a win-win. So obviously, we have a team, a very strong team in the security space. And we were able to leverage some very cutting-edge work going on in academia to leverage a couple of people to join us and help us build this feature. So, we're really excited about the opportunity that we have in front of us. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We obviously had a really strong Q2. The new business environment really remains quite robust and customers continue to gravitate to the developer data platform to reduce complexity, outsource undifferentiated work, and drive more efficiencies. We did see some consumption headwinds in the quarter, and that's really tied to the growth of the underlying applications. And those applications are growing more slowly than historical trends, but we remain incredibly optimistic about the opportunities in front of us, and we will be investing for the long slice of opportunity. So, thank you very much for your time and we'll talk to you soon."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our first quarter results before giving you a broader company update. But first, I want to note that we are hosting MongoDB World from June 7 to June 9 at the Javits Center in New York City. After three long years, we are incredibly excited to be able to gather the MongoDB community in person to share our vision, discuss our latest product innovations, have the community meet the engineers, building the products, and to learn from others in our community who are using MongoDB to transform their organizations and businesses. I would like to personally invite you to the investor session at World next Tuesday, June 7, please email ir@mongodb.com, if you are interested in attending.  Now back to our first quarter financial results. We generated revenue of $285 million or 57% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 82% year-over-year, representing 60% of revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ended the quarter with over 35,200 customers. We are really pleased with our Q1 performance and see it as continued validation of the massive market we are pursuing, our strong product market fit and our ability to execute. Atlas continues to be our key growth engine as new and existing customers run more and more of their mission critical workloads on Atlas. In addition to the strong customer adoption Atlas, many customers also continue to self manage MongoDB, driving a strong quarter for our enterprise advanced product as well. We believe that our Q1 performance is additional evidence that MongoDB is leading the market through a major secular transition, which is still in the very early innings. Let me remind you how we see the market changing. First, the limitations of legacy relational databases are painfully obvious, developers building modern applications find that the relational database simply cannot serve all their needs. Relational databases hinder the ability to innovate quickly, are too expensive and don't scale to meet the performance demands of today's modern applications. Second, to compensate for the limitations of the relational database, there has been a proliferation of point solution databases, using point solutions creates a disjointed developer experience, a far more complex architecture with multiple data silos and higher costs in order to manage and support a myriad of different technologies. Third, in contrast to other technologies, the document model has proven to be the easiest way to work with data as it aligns well with how developers think and code, a modern and elegant developer experience, broad support for a large variety of use cases and a distributed architecture that delivers the highest levels of performance and scale differentiates MongoDB from all other solutions. The evolution of the market is in its early stages and will provide a strong tailwind to the adoption of MongoDB platform over the long-term. We are off to a strong start in FY2023 and we continue to execute according to our plan. That being said, we understand that there is heightened focus on the macroeconomic outlook because of geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and the risks of a slowing global economy. Since macro related questions are dominating investor conversations it makes sense to share with you what we are seeing as well as to discuss our framework on how we plan to manage through this macro uncertainty. Starting with what we're seeing in the market, first quarter was a robust quarter for new business. Driving innovation remains a top priority for our customers and they're investing in modern technologies to facilitate this. We had strong engagement with the C-suite and our deal cycles were in line with normal patterns. The tone of our quarterly business review meetings at the start of the second quarter was that of confidence. Our sales force indicated that our messages resonated in the marketplace and they remain bullish about the opportunities to win new business. Turning from new business to expansion of existing customers, we saw a strong continued growth from existing customers in Q1. As the market went on, however, we did see a modestly lower than normal growth rate in certain parts of our business, we experienced the slow growth in our self-serve and mid-market channels primarily in Europe. The slowdown is a result of slower usage growth of underlying applications and is a reflection of the macro environment. Michael will address this dynamic in more detail. Overall, our market opportunity is robust and unchanged from when we last spoke to you. Having lived through a few macro downturns in my career, I'm confident in our ability to win workloads, even environment where IT budgets could come under pressure. My confidence is based on three reasons, first and foremost is that our customers use us for mission critical initiatives. As the economy becomes increasingly enabled by digitalization, we believe companies will continue to prioritize building custom software that provides a better customer experience, enables new capabilities or drives greater operational efficiency in their business. Consequently, the MongoDB data platform is an essential component of these applications and it's truly a critical investment priority for companies that are focused on using software to enhance their value proposition. The second reason is that we operate in a very large market and despite our success, still have tiny share. We are fortunate to have significant growth opportunity in this market, including the ability to continue to acquire new customers and expand our footprint by adding new workloads within our installed base of more than 35,000 customers. The workload by workload decision process in our market is different from most top down software purchase decisions and gives us an open-ended opportunity to increase our wallet share for the foreseeable future. The size of our opportunity and the way customers buy gives us a long runway for growth. The third reason for my confidence is that we have adjusted and executed through uncertainty before. Our sales organization knows how to build a high quality pipeline, develop strong champions and qualifying opportunities well to ensure there's high rigor in the forecasting process. And when we see conditions on the ground change, we react quickly. In the past, we prioritized positioning use cases that better resonate in a more challenging macro environment, emphasize different sales motions for different channels and change sales rep territories when circumstances warranted. It is this resilience that gives me the confidence that we can pivot should circumstances warranted. We also understand that the growth of existing applications, our platform can be a source of volatility. It is helpful to think of our Atlas business at any given point in time as a portfolio of applications. The near-term growth of that portfolio is primarily driven by the underlying demand for each of those applications. As we said many times in the past that portfolio of applications diversified across industries, geographies, customer segments and use cases. Our customers range from small startups in Asia to large Fortune 500 companies in North America with every conceivable flavor in between. As we've also said in the past, our interests are well aligned with those of our customers. When the underlying application grows in usage, which in turn delivers more value, the customer pays us more. It's as simple as that. We've historically seen strong growth in Atlas consumption across this diversified portfolio of applications. However, we also know there are some variability in the expansion of existing apps. And we've called out that variability in the past when it has had an impact on our performance. While we understand that external events can impact the growth rate of our existing portfolio of applications, our past experience suggests that any such impact is temporary. Growth of existing applications is a much smaller contributor to our medium and long-term growth than the addition of new workloads. In a world where modern applications continue to push the envelope on innovation, massive scale, we are confident that MongoDB will increasingly become the data platform of choice. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the first quarter. Boots is an iconic British retailer with more than 2,200 stores in the United Kingdom. For context more than 90% of the UK population is within 10 minutes of a Boots location. Early in the pandemic, the company's brick-and-mortar retail locations show order shift from in-person to online almost overnight. The company chose MongoDB Atlas to power the rapid development of an order management system to route web orders from Boots.com to its retail stores for fulfillment. Boots is further expanding its relationship with MongoDB to support transactional, search, analytics and mobile use cases while using a common query interface with MongoDB.  A leading global semiconductor company chose MongoDB's data platform to power its new business unit that focuses on next-generation technology geared towards AI, robotics and autonomous with vehicles. The group chose MongoDB Atlas to provide real-time alerts on the manufacturing floor, as well as implement search capabilities to their end customers all while improving performance. With more than 7,500 drivers, Yodel is a leading delivery company in the UK. Yodel is using MongoDB to support modern microservices that underpin their on the road and under the roof applications. These apps are designed to store, organize and manage the events at Yodel service centers, warehouses and delivery routes. Yodel estimates that these apps have assisted with greater productivity to help save time, save each driver time in a service center each day, which has enabled them to be more efficient and productive out on the road. A global luxury car manufacturer chose MongoDB Atlas as the backend for an application that collects metadata from cars, mobile applications and car owners. The application provides insight into user behavior and usage of features that have been sold with the car. The company chose MongoDB Atlas because it was looking for a platform that would enable real-time analytics on the collected data without interruption and at high performance levels from millions of endpoints. In summary, we had an excellent quarter, while the macro environment has become more challenging. We are confident as we have ever been in our market opportunity, our strong product market fit and our ability to build a seminal software company. As always, you can expect us to closely monitor the business and be judicious stewards of capital with an eye from maximizing long-term value for our shareholders. With that, here's Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the first quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with the detailed review of our first quarter results. And then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2023. First, I'll start with our first quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $285.4 million, up 57% year-over-year. Starting with our enterprise advanced product, we saw a particularly strong quarter with 30% year-over-year growth, which was well above our expectations. To put our EA performance in perspective, we expected a sequential decline in our EA business, but instead saw sequential increase despite the renewal base being lower in Q1 compared to Q4. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, the size of our renewal base is a good indicator of our EA new business potential because most new EA sales are related to expansion in existing customers. So to buck this seasonal trend is an indication of the strength of the new business environment, as well as our ability to execute. Moving on to Atlas. Atlas grew 82% in the quarter compared to the previous year, and now represents 60% of total revenue compared to 51% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and 58% last quarter. Q1 was another strong quarter for Atlas and we continue to see strong overall in quarter expansion, consistent with historical ranges. As a reminder, we face a seasonal headwind in Atlas sequential revenue growth as Atlas revenue is based on consumption and Q1 had fewer days than Q4. In addition, as Dev mentioned towards the end of the quarter, we saw slower than normal expansion of existing customers in the self-serve and mid-market channels, primarily in Europe. In our enterprise channel, we observed typical expansion trends throughout the quarter. In addition, we saw no impact to new customer acquisition or churn just slower than normal expansion of existing customers in certain channels. The root cause of slower expansion is slower growth in usage of the underlying applications, which is consistent with a macro slowdown. This pattern is similar to the early days of COVID, although the cause of disruption was different and the impact is neither as ubiquitous, nor as severe as it was in March of 2020. To put things in perspective, the slower than normal growth in self-serve in mid-market was a little more than a 1% headwind to our sequential Atlas growth. During the first quarter, we again grew our customer base by over 2,200 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer account to over 35,200, which is up from over 26,800 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count over 4,800 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 3,300 in the year ago period. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform, as well as self-service customers with whom we now have established a direct sales relationship. The growth that our total customer account is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 33,700 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 25,300 in the year ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB. In addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,379 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,057 in the year ago period. Moving down the income statement, I\u2019ll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $214.3 million representing a gross margin of 75%, which is up from the last quarter and up from 72% in the year ago period. Our strong year-over-year margin improvement is primarily driven by improved efficiencies that we were realizing in our Atlas business. Our income from operations was $17.5 million or a positive 6% operating margin for the first quarter compared to a negative 2% margin in the year ago period. Our strong bottom line results demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our model and our clear indication of our strong underlying unit economics. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was primarily driven by our revenue out performance. We also benefited in Q1 from the timing of certain expenses, which we now expect to occur later in the year. Net income in the first quarter was $15.2 million or $0.20 per share based on 77 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $3.9 million or $0.06 per share on 61.4 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $11.6 million. After taking into consideration, approximately $3.1 million in capital expenditures and principle repayments of finance lease liabilities free cash flow was $8.4 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $8.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. I\u2019d now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2023. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $279 million to $282 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be in the range of $18 million to $16 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.28 based on 68.3 million estimated weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.172 billion to $1.192 billion. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of negative $9 million to positive $1 million and a non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of negative $0.31 to negative $0.16 based on 68.6 million estimated weighted average shares outstanding. I\u2019ll now provide some more contexts around our guidance. First, let me address the seasonal effects impacting Q2 revenues and expenses. Atlas revenue in Q2 will benefit from more days in the quarter compared to Q1. By contrast, we expect to see a significant sequential EA decline as the renewal base in Q2 is meaningfully lower than Q1, which means we have fewer opportunities to pursue new business from existing customers. There\u2019s also seasonality in expenses. Keep in mind that we have some of our largest sales and marketing events in Q2, most notably MongoDB World. Second, we do anticipate that the current macro slowdown we\u2019re seeing in self-serve and the mid-market and primarily in Europe will eventually impact all geographies and all channels. Simply put, it is our experience and our assumption that it would be inappropriate to think that a macro slowdown would be confined to the low end of the market. However, we also don\u2019t expect that impact will be the same across all channels. So to be more specific, we assume that the lower than normal growth rate in self-serve and mid-market channels that we primarily saw in Europe in the latter part of Q1 continues and expands to all geographies for the rest of the fiscal year. Our guidance also assumes that the enterprise channel will begin to be impacted by the macroenvironment starting in Q2 and continue through the end of the fiscal year. However, we expect less of an impact in the enterprise channel because usage growth in larger customers is less sensitive and we have more ability to capture incremental workloads. For context, our assumptions about the macroeconomic environment result in a negative $4 million to $5 million impact to our Q2 revenue and a negative $30 million to $35 million impact to our fiscal 2023 revenue guide. Third, we will continue to invest in our strategic growth priorities in fiscal 2023. Over the years, we\u2019ve demonstrated an ability to balance healthy investments in the business with improving profitability and we expect this year to be no exception. We are confident in the returns we are getting on our investments, but we will, of course, continue monitoring our returns and adjust investment levels as needed. As a reminder, our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes that post-COVID normalization of travel, event and office expenses starting in Q2 resulting in an incremental $45 million to $55 million in those expenses in fiscal 2023. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent first quarter results. We\u2019re showing remarkable growth given our scale and demonstrating the operating leverage inherent in our model. We are mindful of macroeconomic environment and will continue to be transparent with investors about our thinking. We remain incredibly optimistic about the long-term prospects for MongoDB and will continue investing to fully capitalize on this opportunity. With that we\u2019d like to open up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Sanjit Singh from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the question and congrats to the team on a really outstanding set of results in Q1. I wanted to pick up on some of the dynamics of how MongoDB grows versus some of the other data platforms in the enterprise software space. And so Dev, when you think about potentially heading into a slowdown for the balance of the year, how\u2019s that sort of operationalized? I think you sort of discussed this in your script about thinking about Atlas as a portfolio of applications. To what extent is there ability for customers who may have to become more operation efficient themselves to ration usage of MongoDB the way they might do with a data warehousing solution or potentially a log analytics solution? To what extent can they do that? And just if you sort of walk through, how does the slow down potentially get reflected in the MongoDB model versus some of the other data platforms?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Hi, Sanjit. Thanks for your question. So what I would say is, first of all, we \u2013 the value we provide is well aligned with the value customers derive from their applications. In fact, when we talk to our customers, their development teams and obviously even the senior executives get upset if their applications are not being used sufficiently. Because by definition, they have built an application to improve a customer experience, to enable new capabilities, to drive more operational efficiency through increased automation. So the people are not using their application, something has gone wrong. So the more they use the application, the more value they\u2019re seeing. So there\u2019s a direct correlation between the value they get from the apps running on MongoDB and the value we get from those customers. Other software companies that you mentioned, I think are being forced to consider alternatives to be because there\u2019s a trend where there\u2019s a slight mismatch between price to value because as they suck in more data, it\u2019s not completely clear how much incremental value that data is providing. So we don\u2019t see that problem. What we do see is a second order effects of end customers, maybe slowing down the usage of those applications. It could be consumer applications, it could be trading applications, could be a wide variety of applications. And what we\u2019re seeing are the second order effects. And as both Michael and I mentioned right now, we\u2019ve kind of seen those effects more in the self-serve and the lower end of the market, primarily in Europe, but that\u2019s why we\u2019ve used some judgment to give you the guidance that we have provided.\nSanjit Singh: Yes. Thank you, Dev. And that framework was very, very useful in terms of thinking about some of the puts and takes going on for the rest of the year. As we think in this sort of new regime that\u2019s driven by higher interest rates, which had an impact on valuation and multiples. Sort of two questions there. As you think about operating the business and sort of you mentioned as being a steward of capital, how are you thinking about operating MongoDB in the sort of newer regime with respect to the growth versus profitability trade-offs? And then the corollary to that is that there\u2019s more software companies that might be interesting, that might look significantly cheaper than they were before. So, if you could talk to about how this might impact your thinking on M&A? That\u2019s it for me. Really appreciate the response.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. Thanks, Sanjit. So on the first question, in terms of how we think about the business, we frankly are remaining fairly consistent. Obviously, we\u2019re focused on the fundamentals. We know we have a great product. We\u2019re expanding and innovating the product set every day. You\u2019ll hear about some great announcements next week. Hopefully, you and others on this call can attend the conference next week. And so we feel really good about our product road map and investments we\u2019re making. And a lot of that road map is driven by direct customer feedback. So, we know that as we build these new capabilities, they\u2019ll drive even greater adoption of MongoDB in these organizations. And we\u2019ve also said that we have a tiny share of the market. We\u2019re vastly underpenetrated. We have a really seasoned team. We know how to execute. And so we\u2019re continuing to add more capacity into our sales organization across all the different geos and the segments. Now, we look at all these investments constantly. We\u2019re constantly evaluating our investments to making sure we\u2019re getting the right returns. And if we see a certain team not performing, we\u2019re going to slow down investments and really dig in as to what\u2019s going on there. And I would say that we\u2019re just obviously going to continue to do that and be very careful. Mike and I have been around a long time, so we\u2019ve seen the vicissitudes of the different markets, and we know that it\u2019s important to be disciplined and maintain our focus. With regards to your second question around, you\u2019re hinting at M&A, first, I just want to say that the organic opportunity for us is amazing. We still have tiny share. We are remaining very, very focused on growing our business. We have a huge opportunity to acquire lots of customers, and we also have a lot of headroom in those customer counts to grow our share of wallet as well. That being said, clearly, there could be some opportunities that arise. We will be very disciplined. We\u2019ll potentially look at companies that potentially accelerate our product road map, because there\u2019ll be a classic buy versus build decision. And we\u2019ll also look at ways that maybe we can get access to unique talent. And maybe we\u2019ll also look at ways to expand into adjacencies that maybe we\u2019re in a longer-term road map that if an opportunity presents itself, that we would consider. But right now, we\u2019re really focused on the organic opportunity because we still see a big opportunity in front of us.\nSanjit Singh: Appreciate of all that. Thanks guys.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Sanjit.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Brad Reback of Stifel. Please proceed.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Maybe getting a little tactical with the first question. Any sense of what consumption trends look like in the month of May from a high level? Were they consistent with April or did they change? And did they change across the customer base at all?\nMichael Gordon: Yes, sure. So just to quickly recap for everyone, what we described in terms of what we saw in Q1 was a moderation in the growth in the latter part of the quarter, particularly among self-serve and mid-market, primarily in EMEA and that slower growth in Europe. That slower growth maps the underlying usage activity of the application and is consistent with that macro slowdown. We saw very strong new business throughout and we saw no increases in churn. In May, when you kind of scroll forward and say, okay, that was the behavior at the latter part of Q1, anything incrementally changed in Q2 in May. I think the only things worth calling out in May were that slower self-serve growth started to manifest itself in the U.S. and was not contained to Europe. And then the second thing I would say is as it relates to Europe, Europe did not grow more slowly, it did not further deteriorate. And so EMEA stabilized and that\u2019s really kind of the key incremental insight for the early May data.\nBrad Reback: That\u2019s great. Super helpful. And then, Dev, maybe from a high level, obviously, Atlas is the key to growth here going forward and has been a phenomenal engine. As you look forward, do you think it can become 90% of the business down the road or 80%. Maybe I\u2019m getting ahead of the Analyst Day here, but any way to sort of size that up? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. I would say, Brad, that Atlas is the key growth engine for our business. You will expect us to definitely get to those kinds of share of revenue over time. I\u2019m not ready to commit as to how quickly that will happen. As you know, our EA business is quite strong. We still have lots of large customers who are aggressively deploying our EA product. And we don\u2019t see that changing with our installed base. But clearly, the long-term trend is for Atlas to become a bigger and bigger piece of our business. There\u2019s no question about that.\nBrad Reback: Awesome. Thanks very much guys.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays.\nDev Ittycheria: Raimo, we can\u2019t hear you, if you\u2019re in mute.\nRaimo Lenschow: Sorry about that. Thank you. A question I had is like, as we kind of you talked about the macro volatility, et cetera. What are you seeing in terms of people thinking about migration projects from like the higher costs, Oracle, et cetera, in this sort of environment? Is that a demand driver for you? Or do you see that slowing down because people are just kind of more inward looking, like how do we have to think about that? Because that was something that was kind of really starting to get good momentum.\nDev Ittycheria: No. As we mentioned in our sales QBRs at the beginning of Q2, there\u2019s a lot of confidence about the opportunity to win new business. One of those areas is potentially going after a lot of the legacy tech stacks, who are very expensive, very brittle. And in some ways, this macro environment can be a catalyst for them to potentially re-platform off those legacy platforms. We have many use cases where we should demonstrate 40%-plus cost savings off the existing tech stack and also allows the customer to be on a much more modern, agile and scalable infrastructure. So it\u2019s not going to be the only sales motion we pursue, but clearly, it\u2019s a sales motion that we will \u2013 especially at the large enterprise, have a lot of focus on.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. And then 1 follow-up for Michael. If you think about the changing environment, can you talk a little bit about your approach to investment in the time period? Like how much is the macro environment kind of driving the investment in different parts of the investment? Can you speak to that in terms of like the flexibility that you have here? Thank you and all the best.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, certainly. So, I think our general approach to investment has been specifically oriented towards the long term, and we\u2019ve talked about this many times over the years, that we\u2019ve taken this approach to sort of balanced or sustainable growth, if you will. We\u2019re very early on in penetrating our market opportunity. And so it continues to make sense to build out our footprint covered, specifically within the sales and market side. We have very, very thin footprint coverage. We have exceptionally high win rates for transactions when we\u2019re in the mix and we just want to make sure we are in them enough. We continue to like the unit economics and the returns that we\u2019re getting on those investments. And as Dev and I have mentioned many times before, we monitor those very closely and very granularly. That\u2019s not a new or recent behavior at MongoDB, but it\u2019s one that we\u2019ve observed for many, many years. And then on the R&D side, as we\u2019ll talk obviously more about it at MongoDB World, we\u2019re continuing to build out the platform. We have made meaningful investments in R&D and have gotten good returns on those. Those take a little longer to prove out and aren\u2019t quite as easy to model in a spreadsheet. But if you look at, obviously, launching and building MongoDB in the first place, launching Atlas several years ago, now expanding the platform, et cetera, we feel really good about what we\u2019re seeing and the customer adoption. And as Dev mentioned, a lot of our road map is really customer driven. And so we continue to see good returns there. And so we\u2019re not radically altering our perception to try and keep up with either the current market environment or current investor sentiment under the view that we, as the long-term stewards of the business need to have an outlook and our goal is to sort of maximize the long-term opportunity, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re continuing to do.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. Good afternoon. First question here, Michael, a little surprised to see Atlas growth, I think, for the fourth straight quarter, remain above 80%. We\u2019ve seen other consumption models start to see bigger moderations. Can you just parse out the durability of Atlas growth across new workloads and then existing workloads? You flagged a potential slowdown that you expect in the pace of new workloads this quarter in self-serve and mid-market. Do you see any sort of big major changes to existing customers that are running on Atlas? Just trying to parse those two parts of the business. And is the consumption durability different for new versus existing? Thanks.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So most of the growth in any given quarter comes from the applications that you have at the beginning of the quarter. And when we talk about sort of the \u2013 what we expect kind of cohort behavior, that is what we\u2019re speaking about. There\u2019s very little generally \u2013 generalizing, but there\u2019s very little impact that new applications have because those new workloads tend to start smaller unless it\u2019s a large migration or something like that. And so we do those trends that we were describing about that slower growth from the existing applications in self-serve and mid-market in Europe are describing that pattern, that behavior. In terms of looking ahead and trying to apply our best judgment about where do we see things happening in the latter part, the remainder of this year, we\u2019re assuming that self-serve moderation and growth that moved in May from only being in Europe to being in the U.S. We\u2019re assuming that persists. We\u2019re assuming that the mid-market mirrors that behavior in terms of migrating from EMEA to the U.S. and that exhibits that slower growth that we\u2019ve seen in Europe in the mid-market. And we\u2019re also assuming that the enterprise is not immune to these macroeconomic factors, although it\u2019s \u2013 they tend to be not as affected as much. And that\u2019s what leads to the impact on the full year. And so that a little more than 1% sequential headwind on Atlas, that\u2019s about $2 million, when quantified and then given, the compounding of Atlas growth rates, winds up being about 4 million to 5 million of an impact in Q2. And when you add in further compounding and then the broadening, as we\u2019re assuming winds up being about 30 million to 35 million for the full year. Obviously, I\u2019d also throw in as you\u2019re starting to talk about kind of durability. Usually that means people thinking about growth rates. We talked about sort of the strength in Atlas growth in Q3 and in Q4 in particular. So the back half of the year also has very strong comparables when you start to think about year-over-year growth rates and everything else. But the sort of underlying fundamentals of Atlas continue to be quite strong. The new business market has been very strong as we win new workloads. And the existing workloads are growing, just not quite as robustly as we\u2019ve historically seen. So hopefully that\u2019s helpful, Brent.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color, a lot of detail. Just quick follow-up for Dev here. I get baking in risk into the forecast makes a ton of sense, but direct customer growth was still up 45%, added 4,400 new direct customers, what\u2019s driving enterprise adoption so far you\u2019re seeing these sort of change. And I suspect we\u2019ll hear a lot more from customers next week, but what are you hearing on the enterprise side given those metrics there continue to be very strong?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so, Brent, what I\u2019d say is some ways what I said prepared remarks, as companies continue embed software into their value proposition, they need to build those custom software applications on a more modern platform that enables them to innovate quickly. We\u2019ve clearly proven that, especially during COVID that the fastest way to have a digital presence is to use MongoDB. We enable a broad set of workloads. So people don\u2019t have to learn new technologies and have a very convoluted backend architecture and for those applications that need, really push the limits of performance of scale, there\u2019s no other platform that\u2019s better. So when it comes to all those things, we feel like we\u2019re really well positioned. And I would tell you that, our sales force is quite bullish about the opportunity to win new workloads for those exact reasons. And that\u2019s why we feel really good about the long-term health of this business.\nBrent Bracelin: Got it. Very clear. Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: The other thing I would just add Brent, maybe to sort of go back to your other question, just to make sure that it\u2019s clear is that we think about the behavior of new workloads and then the growth of existing workloads. Obviously, the growth of existing workloads is most relevant in the short term. When you think about the long-term impact or the long-term opportunity, the biggest growth driver there is winning of new workloads as you were sort of indicating.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nPhil Winslow: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong start to the year. You\u2019ve talked about different demands being placed on databases from simple key value lookups to complex analytics, aggregations, aircraft, transversals, et cetera. And in that context, you\u2019ve talked about the industry moving towards the concept of just multimodal databases. Obviously, you\u2019ve had some pretty significant enhancements there at Atlas Search comes to mind, obviously. What are you hearing Dev from customers about is we\u2019re consolidating these multiple data models on MongoDB, especially as let\u2019s say budgets get tied and people look to consolidate vendors. And then Michael in terms of a follow-up, I appreciate the color on self-service and mid-market, but curious, you\u2019ve had a lot of success on these focus, very large accounts, curious what you\u2019re seeing and hearing from them? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Phil. So first of all, I would tell you that is core to our strategies to enable customers to run more and more types of workloads on MongoDB. We think the document model is truly the best way to work with data and that we enable so many different capabilities to your point in a key value graph, time series, search, et cetera. And we\u2019re continued to build out the platform, stay tuned for some really interesting and cool announcements next week, hopefully you can attend. And it\u2019s parcel of our strategy. And we think that message is even more relevant and has more resonance in a more challenging macro environment because the cost of learning, managing, and supporting all these bespoke technologies just becomes untenable for most customers. No customer I talk to wants to run, let alone four versus seven or 17 different databases. And so the fact that they can consolidate onto one platform have one elegant developer experience, one unified data, set of data as well as a platform that can scale to support the most demanding requirements becomes very attractive and oh by the way also runs across different cloud providers, right. So they\u2019re not limited to anyone cloud provider or they have a diversity of geographic coverage. So for all those reasons, we feel like we\u2019re really well positioned, especially in environment where these individual point solutions will look far less attractive. Michael, you want to [indiscernible]\nMichael Gordon: Phil on your question on the focus \u2013 yes, yes, yes. And Phil on your question on the focus accounts we\u2019ve seen very good progress on those. As a reminder, these are accounts where there\u2019s already clear MongoDB attraction. And so the focus here is increasing our footprint within those accounts, right? So this is really about expanding new workloads, gaining additional mission, critical applications, perhaps penetrating other business lines or divisions within the account. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re now in the third year of doing, we\u2019ve continued to expand that to a wider and wider range of accounts and gotten more and more intelligent, but at what prerequisites need to be in place in order to make sure that as we add the additional resources around those accounts, that we can get the most out of those and so far we\u2019ve been very pleased.\nPhil Winslow: Awesome. Thanks guys. And see you next week.\nDev Ittycheria: Terrific. Thanks, Phil.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Karl Keirstead of UBS. Please proceed.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Okay. Great, thanks. Michael, just to put my positive hat on here, you\u2019re absorbing a $30 million, $35 million revenue hit in fiscal 2023, but you raised your full year revenue guidance by $11 million. So that tells me that X the macro impact you\u2019re actually raising by $41 million to $46 million, which is substantially above the Q1 beat and substantially above the full your guidance raise last April quarter. So clearly something\u2019s going very right in the business. So I wanted to ask you what that is, one or two things contributed to that X macro implied raise? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, thanks Karl. No, we feel really good about the business. As both Dev and I talked about in the prepared remarks, when we think about our \u2013 the market opportunity that we\u2019re going after the product market fit of the success that we\u2019re having within accounts, whether that\u2019s Atlas accounts, which obviously get a lot of the headlines, but as you\u2019ve seen over the last probably three quarters, the strength and resilience of VA as well, and people who want to still self-manage and aren\u2019t ready for public cloud adoption regardless of sort of mode of consumption or engagement with us, the MongoDB value prop resonates. And so again, I think it mostly just speaks to the size of the market, the success that we\u2019re having. I always worry about words like inflection or some of these other things, but we\u2019re seeing real traction in account. And I think about the breadth of use cases, the types of workloads, the mission criticality that were being selected for whether it\u2019s a de-novo application or a migration of an existing application speaks to the traction and success that we\u2019re having in the market. And then overlay that with a lot of just good execution in market and it all adds up to a very positive picture.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then go ahead, Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Sorry, Karl. Yes, I just want to add. There is couple other data points. Our software has now been downloaded at least from our site alone 265 million times. That\u2019s more downloads this year than the first 11 years of the company\u2019s history. The second thing is the platform message is really resonating to the earlier question, customers want to consolidate on the leading platform and we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest and demand from customers to consolidate more and more workloads on top of MongoDB. And the third data point is that we\u2019re seeing broad based performance across the sales force. We\u2019re not a sales organization where there\u2019s a 80:20 rule where 20% of the sales people are killing it and 80% are trying to get their first deal. We\u2019re really seeing broad based performance across the sales organization, which gives us really again, incremental confidence about pursuing this large market opportunity.\nKarl Keirstead: Great. And then maybe as a follow-up, Dev and Mike, one of the risks that I was trying to evaluate, and I think investors were \u2013 was basically MongoDB\u2019s exposure to call it the next gen cloud internet FinTech companies, kind of the loosely, the coin bases of the world. You\u2019re well aware that snowflake called out that customer cohort as you know hitting the breaks on spending and that translated to a usage hit for snowflake. Did that cohort impact your revenue performance in the quarter? And maybe you could comment about your exposure to that group. I think that might be of interest. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So the short answer is no. We didn\u2019t see any impact from that cohort. I would tell you again, a database or an OLTP platform is very different than a data warehouse where really well aligned to the value that customers derive from their site or their application or their platform. And so there\u2019s a strong alignment there, and we feel really good about our business because it\u2019s highly diversified. We have no real revenue concentration and we have customers, we have to the company you mentioned, we have six times as many more customers as they do. So we\u2019re highly diversified across industries, geos, sectors, and customer segment types.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. Thanks for that.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Karl.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jason Ader of William Blair. Please proceed.\nJason Ader: Thank you. And just to be clear, guys, have you seen any leading indicators or warning signs in the enterprise market? And then beyond usage of existing apps, have you seen any impact on new app starts?\nDev Ittycheria: The short answer is we have not seen any signs \u2013 sorry. Sorry, maybe I'll start and then you can add. So the short answer is we're not seeing any impact on the enterprise side and our \u2013 in terms of acquisition, new workloads was very strong in Q1. And so on both fronts, we feel good about the business. But again, per Michael's comments earlier, we're not presuming that this macroeconomic impact is just going to be limited to the low end. So we are assuming that there will be some modest impact to the high end of the market.\nJason Ader: Got you, okay. Michael, did you want to say something?\nMichael Gordon: No. That was \u2013 I would have said the exact same thing.\nJason Ader: Okay. All right. And then one quick follow-up just on the previous question. I know that \u2013 talk about some of the fintech and the crypto stuff. But when you talked about May being a little slower in the U.S. kind of in the mid-market, self-serve, do you think some of that is kind of the Silicon Valley, I don't want to say bubble, but just a lot of these start-ups maybe are pulling back and we start to see some layoffs and there's obviously some revaluation going on. Did you see any of that and do you expect that to be a significant headwind?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So I would say that the modest pullback in growth rates we saw was not around like pricing or optimization of their infrastructure is really second-order effects of their own app growth. So that's \u2013 so it's not about them shutting down apps or them turning off the parts of their infrastructure. It's really moderation of the expansion rates of those applications. Again, databases are not things that you turn on and turn off. And frankly, even if a start-up is having challenges, we will be \u2013 I mean, most of the start-ups were built on MongoDB, that's their main business. So the last thing they're going to shut off is going to be the MongoDB application. And again, I want to remind you that our customer base is highly diversified. Our exposure to the \u2013 this early stage market is quite low, and again, we would be in the must-have category in terms of expenditures.\nMichael Gordon: And just to clarify, Jason, just to clarify what we said in terms of the incremental observations that we've seen from the early May results, are just a self-service started to mirror \u2013 self-service in the U.S. started to mirror the patterns of self-service in EMEA, not the mid-market, just to be clear or avoid any confusion there.\nJason Ader: Understood. Thank you guys. Good luck.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter. I'm curious to get your perspective, Dev or Michael, whoever wants to jump in. When you look at the consumption side of the business and the after-site, what are the sensitivities that you're modeling if indeed we enter a slow economic environment? What's the best way to think about what kinds of industries, maybe that's cut or what kinds of use cases do you anticipate slower consumption growth rates? And how does your model behave in response to those kinds of changes? I mean, are you capped with respect to the downside in the event that those consumption trends start to go south? Or how does your model zigzag with what's happening at the customer level? What degree of installation, do you have to ensure that your business is protected? Thank you so much. \nDev Ittycheria: Yes, sure. We talked about this. In the end, what really drives the consumption is the underlying behavior of the customer's application. And so there don't tend to be these extreme changes. And if I look back to COVID, which is the early start of COVID, which is probably the greatest point of short-term disruption, even in that period, what we saw was a sort of broad-based but modest decline in the growth rate. And so \u2013 and even in COVID, when you had very specific situations as it related to travel and hospitality industries and everything else, we still wound up finding those people needing to pivot and adapt their business. And I remember doing a meaningful deal with a large U.S. airline, which is sort of shocking in those early days and other things. And so I think it's more about broadly mapping the macroeconomic activity as opposed to some much more abrupt shift up or down. I think partly that's the benefit of having a very diversified customer base, not just geographically, not just by industry and size of the company and everything else, but also by application. And so we've talked about this behavior before, the same kinds of things that prevent people from flying drive people indoors and to do more gaming or \u2013 so as you have a larger and larger portfolio, you may not be perfectly hedged or perfectly offset, but there's a wide range of different underlying macro factors that drive different use cases in different directions. And again, that's the benefit of having a large portfolio across tens and tens of thousands of customers and across the breadth of use cases. And so I think the best thing to say is that it most closely maps and approximates what we see in terms of underlying application usage, which most directly ties to macroeconomic activity.\nKash Rangan: Got it. Very, very clear. With respect to your model, is there any consideration at all to make the model maybe a bit more subscription-like and a bit less consumption since the economic downturn is at least \u2013 a little bit more unpredictability to consumption models? If not, that's totally okay, but just curious to get your perspective on any changes that you might be contemplating.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. I think for customers, they've \u2013 one of the value propositions that they appreciate about cloud products is you only pay for what you consume. I think for us compared to some others, it's not quite as big an issue or as big a disconnect because the value associated with the consumption is so directly tied to the value that they're getting out of the application that, that's \u2013 we don't really tend to suffer from some of the divergences that other people do in terms of what happens with runaway consumption and therefore, bills that seem quite disproportionate relative to the value. And so I think it's a fairly, at this point, fundamental part of cloud business models is that you're only paying for what you consume. And so I wouldn't foresee any near-term changes to that.\nKash Rangan: Wonderful, thanks Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Please proceed.\nFred Havemeyer: Hey, thank you very much. Congratulations on the Q1 results. I wanted to ask about, as I think all of us have asked about consumption trends. But I'm curious to ask about some of the pre-committed trends or consumption plans that we have discussed. I recall that a couple of quarters ago, you had an outsized cohort of customers that decided to prepurchase some substantial quantities of utilization just ahead of their own expansion and net new workload plan. So when we're talking about the consumption trends that you're discussing, of course, in the self-serve channel, do you see any sort of change in the cadence of consumption or plans or expansion or net new workloads that are coming online for those existing customers you have that already had expansion plans in place?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Thanks for that. No, in general, what we see for folks who are willing and want to make commitments, there's obviously a high degree of confidence in their deployment and usage, and so we see very robust consumption patterns with those folks. Typically, even when you're on \u2013 even when you're committing in excess of current consumption, you're usually not committing in excess of intended consumption. And so whether that's you're the customer and you believe an application is growing or you know you're going to be moving over a bunch of other applications, and so the underlying consumption of behaviors in those customers continues to perform well.\nFred Havemeyer: Thank you. And if I can get one more in here, I'd just like to ask. You also recently launched self-service adoption through or adoption through GCP as another channel. I just wanted to ask, generally, how are those cloud channels progressing across the self-serve marketplaces there?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So we've launched \u2013 we're on the console of both GCP and AWS and the early signs are very promising. Obviously allows us to access. As you can imagine, both those companies have incredibly large customer bases and people are on their consoles all the time. So now that when they do a search for MongoDB, they'll see Atlas. And so the early signs have been very promising, and it's just an additive channel for us.\nFred Havemeyer: Thanks, Michael. Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Thank you, Fred.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our time of Q&A. I will now pass the conference back over to Dev Ittycheria for closing remarks.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Daniel. Again, thank you for your time. I just want to reiterate, we had an excellent quarter. Customers across different industries, geos segments are using MongoDB to run the most mission-critical workloads. Our confidence in winning new business continues to be high. We remain on track to deliver another year of strong growth as well as improving profitability in spite of a more challenging macroeconomic environment. And last but not least, I would like to invite all of you to our investor session that we're going to have on June 7 in New York City at MongoDB World. With that, thank you for your time today. Take care. Bye-bye.\nOperator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered another strong performance in the first quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with the detailed review of our first quarter results. And then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2023. First, I'll start with our first quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $285.4 million, up 57% year-over-year. Starting with our enterprise advanced product, we saw a particularly strong quarter with 30% year-over-year growth, which was well above our expectations. To put our EA performance in perspective, we expected a sequential decline in our EA business, but instead saw sequential increase despite the renewal base being lower in Q1 compared to Q4. As we've discussed in the past, the size of our renewal base is a good indicator of our EA new business potential because most new EA sales are related to expansion in existing customers. So to buck this seasonal trend is an indication of the strength of the new business environment, as well as our ability to execute. Moving on to Atlas. Atlas grew 82% in the quarter compared to the previous year, and now represents 60% of total revenue compared to 51% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and 58% last quarter. Q1 was another strong quarter for Atlas and we continue to see strong overall in quarter expansion, consistent with historical ranges. As a reminder, we face a seasonal headwind in Atlas sequential revenue growth as Atlas revenue is based on consumption and Q1 had fewer days than Q4. In addition, as Dev mentioned towards the end of the quarter, we saw slower than normal expansion of existing customers in the self-serve and mid-market channels, primarily in Europe. In our enterprise channel, we observed typical expansion trends throughout the quarter. In addition, we saw no impact to new customer acquisition or churn just slower than normal expansion of existing customers in certain channels. The root cause of slower expansion is slower growth in usage of the underlying applications, which is consistent with a macro slowdown. This pattern is similar to the early days of COVID, although the cause of disruption was different and the impact is neither as ubiquitous, nor as severe as it was in March of 2020. To put things in perspective, the slower than normal growth in self-serve in mid-market was a little more than a 1% headwind to our sequential Atlas growth. During the first quarter, we again grew our customer base by over 2,200 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer account to over 35,200, which is up from over 26,800 in the year ago period. Of our total customer count over 4,800 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 3,300 in the year ago period. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net new to our platform, as well as self-service customers with whom we now have established a direct sales relationship. The growth that our total customer account is being driven in large part by Atlas, which had over 33,700 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 25,300 in the year ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB. In addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,379 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,057 in the year ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $214.3 million representing a gross margin of 75%, which is up from the last quarter and up from 72% in the year ago period. Our strong year-over-year margin improvement is primarily driven by improved efficiencies that we were realizing in our Atlas business. Our income from operations was $17.5 million or a positive 6% operating margin for the first quarter compared to a negative 2% margin in the year ago period. Our strong bottom line results demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our model and our clear indication of our strong underlying unit economics. Our outperformance versus our operating loss guidance was primarily driven by our revenue out performance. We also benefited in Q1 from the timing of certain expenses, which we now expect to occur later in the year. Net income in the first quarter was $15.2 million or $0.20 per share based on 77 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $3.9 million or $0.06 per share on 61.4 million weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the first quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $11.6 million. After taking into consideration, approximately $3.1 million in capital expenditures and principle repayments of finance lease liabilities free cash flow was $8.4 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $8.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2023. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $279 million to $282 million. We expect non-GAAP loss from operations to be in the range of $18 million to $16 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.28 based on 68.3 million estimated weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.172 billion to $1.192 billion. For the full fiscal year 2023, we expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of negative $9 million to positive $1 million and a non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of negative $0.31 to negative $0.16 based on 68.6 million estimated weighted average shares outstanding. I'll now provide some more contexts around our guidance. First, let me address the seasonal effects impacting Q2 revenues and expenses. Atlas revenue in Q2 will benefit from more days in the quarter compared to Q1. By contrast, we expect to see a significant sequential EA decline as the renewal base in Q2 is meaningfully lower than Q1, which means we have fewer opportunities to pursue new business from existing customers. There's also seasonality in expenses. Keep in mind that we have some of our largest sales and marketing events in Q2, most notably MongoDB World. Second, we do anticipate that the current macro slowdown we're seeing in self-serve and the mid-market and primarily in Europe will eventually impact all geographies and all channels. Simply put, it is our experience and our assumption that it would be inappropriate to think that a macro slowdown would be confined to the low end of the market. However, we also don't expect that impact will be the same across all channels. So to be more specific, we assume that the lower than normal growth rate in self-serve and mid-market channels that we primarily saw in Europe in the latter part of Q1 continues and expands to all geographies for the rest of the fiscal year. Our guidance also assumes that the enterprise channel will begin to be impacted by the macroenvironment starting in Q2 and continue through the end of the fiscal year. However, we expect less of an impact in the enterprise channel because usage growth in larger customers is less sensitive and we have more ability to capture incremental workloads. For context, our assumptions about the macroeconomic environment result in a negative $4 million to $5 million impact to our Q2 revenue and a negative $30 million to $35 million impact to our fiscal 2023 revenue guide. Third, we will continue to invest in our strategic growth priorities in fiscal 2023. Over the years, we've demonstrated an ability to balance healthy investments in the business with improving profitability and we expect this year to be no exception. We are confident in the returns we are getting on our investments, but we will, of course, continue monitoring our returns and adjust investment levels as needed. As a reminder, our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes that post-COVID normalization of travel, event and office expenses starting in Q2 resulting in an incremental $45 million to $55 million in those expenses in fiscal 2023. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent first quarter results. We're showing remarkable growth given our scale and demonstrating the operating leverage inherent in our model. We are mindful of macroeconomic environment and will continue to be transparent with investors about our thinking. We remain incredibly optimistic about the long-term prospects for MongoDB and will continue investing to fully capitalize on this opportunity. With that we'd like to open up to questions. Operator? Yes, sure. So just to quickly recap for everyone, what we described in terms of what we saw in Q1 was a moderation in the growth in the latter part of the quarter, particularly among self-serve and mid-market, primarily in EMEA and that slower growth in Europe. That slower growth maps the underlying usage activity of the application and is consistent with that macro slowdown. We saw very strong new business throughout and we saw no increases in churn. In May, when you kind of scroll forward and say, okay, that was the behavior at the latter part of Q1, anything incrementally changed in Q2 in May. I think the only things worth calling out in May were that slower self-serve growth started to manifest itself in the U.S. and was not contained to Europe. And then the second thing I would say is as it relates to Europe, Europe did not grow more slowly, it did not further deteriorate. And so EMEA stabilized and that's really kind of the key incremental insight for the early May data. Yes, certainly. So, I think our general approach to investment has been specifically oriented towards the long term, and we've talked about this many times over the years, that we've taken this approach to sort of balanced or sustainable growth, if you will. We're very early on in penetrating our market opportunity. And so it continues to make sense to build out our footprint covered, specifically within the sales and market side. We have very, very thin footprint coverage. We have exceptionally high win rates for transactions when we're in the mix and we just want to make sure we are in them enough. We continue to like the unit economics and the returns that we're getting on those investments. And as Dev and I have mentioned many times before, we monitor those very closely and very granularly. That's not a new or recent behavior at MongoDB, but it's one that we've observed for many, many years. And then on the R&D side, as we'll talk obviously more about it at MongoDB World, we're continuing to build out the platform. We have made meaningful investments in R&D and have gotten good returns on those. Those take a little longer to prove out and aren't quite as easy to model in a spreadsheet. But if you look at, obviously, launching and building MongoDB in the first place, launching Atlas several years ago, now expanding the platform, et cetera, we feel really good about what we're seeing and the customer adoption. And as Dev mentioned, a lot of our road map is really customer driven. And so we continue to see good returns there. And so we're not radically altering our perception to try and keep up with either the current market environment or current investor sentiment under the view that we, as the long-term stewards of the business need to have an outlook and our goal is to sort of maximize the long-term opportunity, and that's what we're continuing to do. Yes. So most of the growth in any given quarter comes from the applications that you have at the beginning of the quarter. And when we talk about sort of the \u2013 what we expect kind of cohort behavior, that is what we're speaking about. There's very little generally \u2013 generalizing, but there's very little impact that new applications have because those new workloads tend to start smaller unless it's a large migration or something like that. And so we do those trends that we were describing about that slower growth from the existing applications in self-serve and mid-market in Europe are describing that pattern, that behavior. In terms of looking ahead and trying to apply our best judgment about where do we see things happening in the latter part, the remainder of this year, we're assuming that self-serve moderation and growth that moved in May from only being in Europe to being in the U.S. We're assuming that persists. We're assuming that the mid-market mirrors that behavior in terms of migrating from EMEA to the U.S. and that exhibits that slower growth that we've seen in Europe in the mid-market. And we're also assuming that the enterprise is not immune to these macroeconomic factors, although it's \u2013 they tend to be not as affected as much. And that's what leads to the impact on the full year. And so that a little more than 1% sequential headwind on Atlas, that's about $2 million, when quantified and then given, the compounding of Atlas growth rates, winds up being about 4 million to 5 million of an impact in Q2. And when you add in further compounding and then the broadening, as we're assuming winds up being about 30 million to 35 million for the full year. Obviously, I'd also throw in as you're starting to talk about kind of durability. Usually that means people thinking about growth rates. We talked about sort of the strength in Atlas growth in Q3 and in Q4 in particular. So the back half of the year also has very strong comparables when you start to think about year-over-year growth rates and everything else. But the sort of underlying fundamentals of Atlas continue to be quite strong. The new business market has been very strong as we win new workloads. And the existing workloads are growing, just not quite as robustly as we've historically seen. So hopefully that's helpful, Brent. The other thing I would just add Brent, maybe to sort of go back to your other question, just to make sure that it's clear is that we think about the behavior of new workloads and then the growth of existing workloads. Obviously, the growth of existing workloads is most relevant in the short term. When you think about the long-term impact or the long-term opportunity, the biggest growth driver there is winning of new workloads as you were sort of indicating. Phil on your question on the focus \u2013 yes, yes, yes. And Phil on your question on the focus accounts we've seen very good progress on those. As a reminder, these are accounts where there's already clear MongoDB attraction. And so the focus here is increasing our footprint within those accounts, right? So this is really about expanding new workloads, gaining additional mission, critical applications, perhaps penetrating other business lines or divisions within the account. It's something that we're now in the third year of doing, we've continued to expand that to a wider and wider range of accounts and gotten more and more intelligent, but at what prerequisites need to be in place in order to make sure that as we add the additional resources around those accounts, that we can get the most out of those and so far we've been very pleased. Yes, thanks Karl. No, we feel really good about the business. As both Dev and I talked about in the prepared remarks, when we think about our \u2013 the market opportunity that we're going after the product market fit of the success that we're having within accounts, whether that's Atlas accounts, which obviously get a lot of the headlines, but as you've seen over the last probably three quarters, the strength and resilience of VA as well, and people who want to still self-manage and aren't ready for public cloud adoption regardless of sort of mode of consumption or engagement with us, the MongoDB value prop resonates. And so again, I think it mostly just speaks to the size of the market, the success that we're having. I always worry about words like inflection or some of these other things, but we're seeing real traction in account. And I think about the breadth of use cases, the types of workloads, the mission criticality that were being selected for whether it's a de-novo application or a migration of an existing application speaks to the traction and success that we're having in the market. And then overlay that with a lot of just good execution in market and it all adds up to a very positive picture. No. That was \u2013 I would have said the exact same thing. And just to clarify, Jason, just to clarify what we said in terms of the incremental observations that we've seen from the early May results, are just a self-service started to mirror \u2013 self-service in the U.S. started to mirror the patterns of self-service in EMEA, not the mid-market, just to be clear or avoid any confusion there. Yes. So we've launched \u2013 we're on the console of both GCP and AWS and the early signs are very promising. Obviously allows us to access. As you can imagine, both those companies have incredibly large customer bases and people are on their consoles all the time. So now that when they do a search for MongoDB, they'll see Atlas. And so the early signs have been very promising, and it's just an additive channel for us. Thank you, Fred."

            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I will start by reviewing our first quarter results before giving you a broader company update. But first, I want to note that we are hosting MongoDB World from June 7 to June 9 at the Javits Center in New York City. After three long years, we are incredibly excited to be able to gather the MongoDB community in person to share our vision, discuss our latest product innovations, have the community meet the engineers, building the products, and to learn from others in our community who are using MongoDB to transform their organizations and businesses. I would like to personally invite you to the investor session at World next Tuesday, June 7, please email ir@mongodb.com, if you are interested in attending.  Now back to our first quarter financial results. We generated revenue of $285 million or 57% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 82% year-over-year, representing 60% of revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ended the quarter with over 35,200 customers. We are really pleased with our Q1 performance and see it as continued validation of the massive market we are pursuing, our strong product market fit and our ability to execute. Atlas continues to be our key growth engine as new and existing customers run more and more of their mission critical workloads on Atlas. In addition to the strong customer adoption Atlas, many customers also continue to self manage MongoDB, driving a strong quarter for our enterprise advanced product as well. We believe that our Q1 performance is additional evidence that MongoDB is leading the market through a major secular transition, which is still in the very early innings. Let me remind you how we see the market changing. First, the limitations of legacy relational databases are painfully obvious, developers building modern applications find that the relational database simply cannot serve all their needs. Relational databases hinder the ability to innovate quickly, are too expensive and don't scale to meet the performance demands of today's modern applications. Second, to compensate for the limitations of the relational database, there has been a proliferation of point solution databases, using point solutions creates a disjointed developer experience, a far more complex architecture with multiple data silos and higher costs in order to manage and support a myriad of different technologies. Third, in contrast to other technologies, the document model has proven to be the easiest way to work with data as it aligns well with how developers think and code, a modern and elegant developer experience, broad support for a large variety of use cases and a distributed architecture that delivers the highest levels of performance and scale differentiates MongoDB from all other solutions. The evolution of the market is in its early stages and will provide a strong tailwind to the adoption of MongoDB platform over the long-term. We are off to a strong start in FY2023 and we continue to execute according to our plan. That being said, we understand that there is heightened focus on the macroeconomic outlook because of geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and the risks of a slowing global economy. Since macro related questions are dominating investor conversations it makes sense to share with you what we are seeing as well as to discuss our framework on how we plan to manage through this macro uncertainty. Starting with what we're seeing in the market, first quarter was a robust quarter for new business. Driving innovation remains a top priority for our customers and they're investing in modern technologies to facilitate this. We had strong engagement with the C-suite and our deal cycles were in line with normal patterns. The tone of our quarterly business review meetings at the start of the second quarter was that of confidence. Our sales force indicated that our messages resonated in the marketplace and they remain bullish about the opportunities to win new business. Turning from new business to expansion of existing customers, we saw a strong continued growth from existing customers in Q1. As the market went on, however, we did see a modestly lower than normal growth rate in certain parts of our business, we experienced the slow growth in our self-serve and mid-market channels primarily in Europe. The slowdown is a result of slower usage growth of underlying applications and is a reflection of the macro environment. Michael will address this dynamic in more detail. Overall, our market opportunity is robust and unchanged from when we last spoke to you. Having lived through a few macro downturns in my career, I'm confident in our ability to win workloads, even environment where IT budgets could come under pressure. My confidence is based on three reasons, first and foremost is that our customers use us for mission critical initiatives. As the economy becomes increasingly enabled by digitalization, we believe companies will continue to prioritize building custom software that provides a better customer experience, enables new capabilities or drives greater operational efficiency in their business. Consequently, the MongoDB data platform is an essential component of these applications and it's truly a critical investment priority for companies that are focused on using software to enhance their value proposition. The second reason is that we operate in a very large market and despite our success, still have tiny share. We are fortunate to have significant growth opportunity in this market, including the ability to continue to acquire new customers and expand our footprint by adding new workloads within our installed base of more than 35,000 customers. The workload by workload decision process in our market is different from most top down software purchase decisions and gives us an open-ended opportunity to increase our wallet share for the foreseeable future. The size of our opportunity and the way customers buy gives us a long runway for growth. The third reason for my confidence is that we have adjusted and executed through uncertainty before. Our sales organization knows how to build a high quality pipeline, develop strong champions and qualifying opportunities well to ensure there's high rigor in the forecasting process. And when we see conditions on the ground change, we react quickly. In the past, we prioritized positioning use cases that better resonate in a more challenging macro environment, emphasize different sales motions for different channels and change sales rep territories when circumstances warranted. It is this resilience that gives me the confidence that we can pivot should circumstances warranted. We also understand that the growth of existing applications, our platform can be a source of volatility. It is helpful to think of our Atlas business at any given point in time as a portfolio of applications. The near-term growth of that portfolio is primarily driven by the underlying demand for each of those applications. As we said many times in the past that portfolio of applications diversified across industries, geographies, customer segments and use cases. Our customers range from small startups in Asia to large Fortune 500 companies in North America with every conceivable flavor in between. As we've also said in the past, our interests are well aligned with those of our customers. When the underlying application grows in usage, which in turn delivers more value, the customer pays us more. It's as simple as that. We've historically seen strong growth in Atlas consumption across this diversified portfolio of applications. However, we also know there are some variability in the expansion of existing apps. And we've called out that variability in the past when it has had an impact on our performance. While we understand that external events can impact the growth rate of our existing portfolio of applications, our past experience suggests that any such impact is temporary. Growth of existing applications is a much smaller contributor to our medium and long-term growth than the addition of new workloads. In a world where modern applications continue to push the envelope on innovation, massive scale, we are confident that MongoDB will increasingly become the data platform of choice. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing some customer wins and interesting use cases from the first quarter. Boots is an iconic British retailer with more than 2,200 stores in the United Kingdom. For context more than 90% of the UK population is within 10 minutes of a Boots location. Early in the pandemic, the company's brick-and-mortar retail locations show order shift from in-person to online almost overnight. The company chose MongoDB Atlas to power the rapid development of an order management system to route web orders from Boots.com to its retail stores for fulfillment. Boots is further expanding its relationship with MongoDB to support transactional, search, analytics and mobile use cases while using a common query interface with MongoDB.  A leading global semiconductor company chose MongoDB's data platform to power its new business unit that focuses on next-generation technology geared towards AI, robotics and autonomous with vehicles. The group chose MongoDB Atlas to provide real-time alerts on the manufacturing floor, as well as implement search capabilities to their end customers all while improving performance. With more than 7,500 drivers, Yodel is a leading delivery company in the UK. Yodel is using MongoDB to support modern microservices that underpin their on the road and under the roof applications. These apps are designed to store, organize and manage the events at Yodel service centers, warehouses and delivery routes. Yodel estimates that these apps have assisted with greater productivity to help save time, save each driver time in a service center each day, which has enabled them to be more efficient and productive out on the road. A global luxury car manufacturer chose MongoDB Atlas as the backend for an application that collects metadata from cars, mobile applications and car owners. The application provides insight into user behavior and usage of features that have been sold with the car. The company chose MongoDB Atlas because it was looking for a platform that would enable real-time analytics on the collected data without interruption and at high performance levels from millions of endpoints. In summary, we had an excellent quarter, while the macro environment has become more challenging. We are confident as we have ever been in our market opportunity, our strong product market fit and our ability to build a seminal software company. As always, you can expect us to closely monitor the business and be judicious stewards of capital with an eye from maximizing long-term value for our shareholders. With that, here's Michael. Yes. Hi, Sanjit. Thanks for your question. So what I would say is, first of all, we \u2013 the value we provide is well aligned with the value customers derive from their applications. In fact, when we talk to our customers, their development teams and obviously even the senior executives get upset if their applications are not being used sufficiently. Because by definition, they have built an application to improve a customer experience, to enable new capabilities, to drive more operational efficiency through increased automation. So the people are not using their application, something has gone wrong. So the more they use the application, the more value they're seeing. So there's a direct correlation between the value they get from the apps running on MongoDB and the value we get from those customers. Other software companies that you mentioned, I think are being forced to consider alternatives to be because there's a trend where there's a slight mismatch between price to value because as they suck in more data, it's not completely clear how much incremental value that data is providing. So we don't see that problem. What we do see is a second order effects of end customers, maybe slowing down the usage of those applications. It could be consumer applications, it could be trading applications, could be a wide variety of applications. And what we're seeing are the second order effects. And as both Michael and I mentioned right now, we've kind of seen those effects more in the self-serve and the lower end of the market, primarily in Europe, but that's why we've used some judgment to give you the guidance that we have provided. Sure. Thanks, Sanjit. So on the first question, in terms of how we think about the business, we frankly are remaining fairly consistent. Obviously, we're focused on the fundamentals. We know we have a great product. We're expanding and innovating the product set every day. You'll hear about some great announcements next week. Hopefully, you and others on this call can attend the conference next week. And so we feel really good about our product road map and investments we're making. And a lot of that road map is driven by direct customer feedback. So, we know that as we build these new capabilities, they'll drive even greater adoption of MongoDB in these organizations. And we've also said that we have a tiny share of the market. We're vastly underpenetrated. We have a really seasoned team. We know how to execute. And so we're continuing to add more capacity into our sales organization across all the different geos and the segments. Now, we look at all these investments constantly. We're constantly evaluating our investments to making sure we're getting the right returns. And if we see a certain team not performing, we're going to slow down investments and really dig in as to what's going on there. And I would say that we're just obviously going to continue to do that and be very careful. Mike and I have been around a long time, so we've seen the vicissitudes of the different markets, and we know that it's important to be disciplined and maintain our focus. With regards to your second question around, you're hinting at M&A, first, I just want to say that the organic opportunity for us is amazing. We still have tiny share. We are remaining very, very focused on growing our business. We have a huge opportunity to acquire lots of customers, and we also have a lot of headroom in those customer counts to grow our share of wallet as well. That being said, clearly, there could be some opportunities that arise. We will be very disciplined. We'll potentially look at companies that potentially accelerate our product road map, because there'll be a classic buy versus build decision. And we'll also look at ways that maybe we can get access to unique talent. And maybe we'll also look at ways to expand into adjacencies that maybe we're in a longer-term road map that if an opportunity presents itself, that we would consider. But right now, we're really focused on the organic opportunity because we still see a big opportunity in front of us. Thank you, Sanjit. Yes. I would say, Brad, that Atlas is the key growth engine for our business. You will expect us to definitely get to those kinds of share of revenue over time. I'm not ready to commit as to how quickly that will happen. As you know, our EA business is quite strong. We still have lots of large customers who are aggressively deploying our EA product. And we don't see that changing with our installed base. But clearly, the long-term trend is for Atlas to become a bigger and bigger piece of our business. There's no question about that. Thanks, Brad. Raimo, we can't hear you, if you're in mute. No. As we mentioned in our sales QBRs at the beginning of Q2, there's a lot of confidence about the opportunity to win new business. One of those areas is potentially going after a lot of the legacy tech stacks, who are very expensive, very brittle. And in some ways, this macro environment can be a catalyst for them to potentially re-platform off those legacy platforms. We have many use cases where we should demonstrate 40%-plus cost savings off the existing tech stack and also allows the customer to be on a much more modern, agile and scalable infrastructure. So it's not going to be the only sales motion we pursue, but clearly, it's a sales motion that we will \u2013 especially at the large enterprise, have a lot of focus on. Yes, so, Brent, what I'd say is some ways what I said prepared remarks, as companies continue embed software into their value proposition, they need to build those custom software applications on a more modern platform that enables them to innovate quickly. We've clearly proven that, especially during COVID that the fastest way to have a digital presence is to use MongoDB. We enable a broad set of workloads. So people don't have to learn new technologies and have a very convoluted backend architecture and for those applications that need, really push the limits of performance of scale, there's no other platform that's better. So when it comes to all those things, we feel like we're really well positioned. And I would tell you that, our sales force is quite bullish about the opportunity to win new workloads for those exact reasons. And that's why we feel really good about the long-term health of this business. Thanks, Phil. So first of all, I would tell you that is core to our strategies to enable customers to run more and more types of workloads on MongoDB. We think the document model is truly the best way to work with data and that we enable so many different capabilities to your point in a key value graph, time series, search, et cetera. And we're continued to build out the platform, stay tuned for some really interesting and cool announcements next week, hopefully you can attend. And it's parcel of our strategy. And we think that message is even more relevant and has more resonance in a more challenging macro environment because the cost of learning, managing, and supporting all these bespoke technologies just becomes untenable for most customers. No customer I talk to wants to run, let alone four versus seven or 17 different databases. And so the fact that they can consolidate onto one platform have one elegant developer experience, one unified data, set of data as well as a platform that can scale to support the most demanding requirements becomes very attractive and oh by the way also runs across different cloud providers, right. So they're not limited to anyone cloud provider or they have a diversity of geographic coverage. So for all those reasons, we feel like we're really well positioned, especially in environment where these individual point solutions will look far less attractive. Michael, you want to [indiscernible] Terrific. Thanks, Phil. Sorry, Karl. Yes, I just want to add. There is couple other data points. Our software has now been downloaded at least from our site alone 265 million times. That's more downloads this year than the first 11 years of the company's history. The second thing is the platform message is really resonating to the earlier question, customers want to consolidate on the leading platform and we're seeing a lot of interest and demand from customers to consolidate more and more workloads on top of MongoDB. And the third data point is that we're seeing broad based performance across the sales force. We're not a sales organization where there's a 80:20 rule where 20% of the sales people are killing it and 80% are trying to get their first deal. We're really seeing broad based performance across the sales organization, which gives us really again, incremental confidence about pursuing this large market opportunity. Yes. So the short answer is no. We didn't see any impact from that cohort. I would tell you again, a database or an OLTP platform is very different than a data warehouse where really well aligned to the value that customers derive from their site or their application or their platform. And so there's a strong alignment there, and we feel really good about our business because it's highly diversified. We have no real revenue concentration and we have customers, we have to the company you mentioned, we have six times as many more customers as they do. So we're highly diversified across industries, geos, sectors, and customer segment types. Thanks, Karl. The short answer is we have not seen any signs \u2013 sorry. Sorry, maybe I'll start and then you can add. So the short answer is we're not seeing any impact on the enterprise side and our \u2013 in terms of acquisition, new workloads was very strong in Q1. And so on both fronts, we feel good about the business. But again, per Michael's comments earlier, we're not presuming that this macroeconomic impact is just going to be limited to the low end. So we are assuming that there will be some modest impact to the high end of the market. Yes. So I would say that the modest pullback in growth rates we saw was not around like pricing or optimization of their infrastructure is really second-order effects of their own app growth. So that's \u2013 so it's not about them shutting down apps or them turning off the parts of their infrastructure. It's really moderation of the expansion rates of those applications. Again, databases are not things that you turn on and turn off. And frankly, even if a start-up is having challenges, we will be \u2013 I mean, most of the start-ups were built on MongoDB, that's their main business. So the last thing they're going to shut off is going to be the MongoDB application. And again, I want to remind you that our customer base is highly diversified. Our exposure to the \u2013 this early stage market is quite low, and again, we would be in the must-have category in terms of expenditures. Thank you, Jason. Yes, sure. We talked about this. In the end, what really drives the consumption is the underlying behavior of the customer's application. And so there don't tend to be these extreme changes. And if I look back to COVID, which is the early start of COVID, which is probably the greatest point of short-term disruption, even in that period, what we saw was a sort of broad-based but modest decline in the growth rate. And so \u2013 and even in COVID, when you had very specific situations as it related to travel and hospitality industries and everything else, we still wound up finding those people needing to pivot and adapt their business. And I remember doing a meaningful deal with a large U.S. airline, which is sort of shocking in those early days and other things. And so I think it's more about broadly mapping the macroeconomic activity as opposed to some much more abrupt shift up or down. I think partly that's the benefit of having a very diversified customer base, not just geographically, not just by industry and size of the company and everything else, but also by application. And so we've talked about this behavior before, the same kinds of things that prevent people from flying drive people indoors and to do more gaming or \u2013 so as you have a larger and larger portfolio, you may not be perfectly hedged or perfectly offset, but there's a wide range of different underlying macro factors that drive different use cases in different directions. And again, that's the benefit of having a large portfolio across tens and tens of thousands of customers and across the breadth of use cases. And so I think the best thing to say is that it most closely maps and approximates what we see in terms of underlying application usage, which most directly ties to macroeconomic activity. Yes. I think for customers, they've \u2013 one of the value propositions that they appreciate about cloud products is you only pay for what you consume. I think for us compared to some others, it's not quite as big an issue or as big a disconnect because the value associated with the consumption is so directly tied to the value that they're getting out of the application that, that's \u2013 we don't really tend to suffer from some of the divergences that other people do in terms of what happens with runaway consumption and therefore, bills that seem quite disproportionate relative to the value. And so I think it's a fairly, at this point, fundamental part of cloud business models is that you're only paying for what you consume. And so I wouldn't foresee any near-term changes to that. Yes. Thanks for that. No, in general, what we see for folks who are willing and want to make commitments, there's obviously a high degree of confidence in their deployment and usage, and so we see very robust consumption patterns with those folks. Typically, even when you're on \u2013 even when you're committing in excess of current consumption, you're usually not committing in excess of intended consumption. And so whether that's you're the customer and you believe an application is growing or you know you're going to be moving over a bunch of other applications, and so the underlying consumption of behaviors in those customers continues to perform well. Thanks, Daniel. Again, thank you for your time. I just want to reiterate, we had an excellent quarter. Customers across different industries, geos segments are using MongoDB to run the most mission-critical workloads. Our confidence in winning new business continues to be high. We remain on track to deliver another year of strong growth as well as improving profitability in spite of a more challenging macroeconomic environment. And last but not least, I would like to invite all of you to our investor session that we're going to have on June 7 in New York City at MongoDB World. With that, thank you for your time today. Take care. Bye-bye."

I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter that capped off an impressive year as we continue to execute well to capture a large market opportunity. I will start by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results before giving you a broader company update. Starting with the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $458 million, a 27% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 34% year-over-year, representing 68% of revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $69.2 million for a 15% non-GAAP operating margin, and we ended the quarter with over 47,800 customers. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter. We had a healthy quarter of new business led by continued strength in new workload acquisition within our existing Atlas customers. In addition, our Enterprise Advanced business again exceeded our expectations, demonstrating strong demand for our platform and the appeal of our run anywhere strategy. Moving on to Atlas consumption trends, the quarter played out in line with our expectations and we saw a stronger consumption than in Q4 last year. Michael will discuss consumption trends in more detail. Finally, retention rates remained strong in Q4, reinforcing the quality of our product and the mission criticality of our platform. Stepping back and looking at fiscal \u201824 as a whole, I'm proud of what we accomplished. We achieved revenue growth of 31% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 16%, well above our initial expectations. Atlas grew 37% year-over-year, and we added over 7,000 customers, ranging from AI startups to Fortune 500 companies. We had a record year of fast-paced innovative product releases such as Vector Search, Queryable Encryption, and the preview of Atlas Stream Processing, reinforcing why so many customers and developers choose MongoDB's developer data platform. Finally, we continue to innovate on our go-to-market motion to drive workload acquisition. As we look into fiscal \u201825, let me share with you what I see in the market. First, I'm excited about our opportunity to win new business. In today's digital world, customers express their business strategy through software. The software [indiscernible] strategy that one of the most important investments a company can make is in the productivity of its software developers. Consequently, customers are gravitating towards MongoDB as their next generation developer data platform standard. Second, I see stable consumption growth going into next year. Atlas consumption trends have been steady for several quarters now, and we experienced less consumption variability in fiscal \u201824 compared to fiscal \u201823. Ultimately, the main driver of Atlas consumption is the growth in the underlying application usage and we see stable usage growth across our portfolio of workloads. Third, while I strongly believe that AI will be a significant driver of long-term growth for MongoDB, we are in the early days of AI, akin to the dial-up phase of the Internet era. To put things in context, it's important to understand that there are three layers to the AI stack. The first layer is the underlying compute and LLMs. The second layer is the fine-tuning of models and building of AI applications. And the third layer is deploying and running applications that end users interact with. MongoDB\u2019s strategy is to operate at the second and third layers to enable customers to build AI applications by using their own proprietary data together with any LLM, close or open source, on any computing infrastructure. Today the vast majority of AI spend is happening in the first layer, that is investments in compute to train and run LLMs. Neither are areas in which we compete. Our enterprise customers today are still largely in the experimentation and prototyping stages of building their initial AI applications, first focus on driving efficiencies by automating existing workloads. We expect that it will take time for enterprises to deploy production workloads at scale. However, as organizations look to realize the full benefit of these AI investments, they will turn to companies like MongoDB, offering differentiated capabilities in the upper layers of the AI stack. Similar to what happened in the internet era, when value accrued over time to companies offering services and applications leveraging the built-out Internet infrastructure, platforms like MongoDB will benefit as customers build AI applications to drive meaningful operating efficiencies, create compelling customer experiences, and pursue new growth opportunities. We already see our platform resonating with innovative AI startups building exciting applications for use cases such as real-time patient diagnostics for personalized medicine, cyber threat data analysis for risk mitigation, predictive maintenance for maritime fleets, and auto-generated animations for personalized marketing campaigns. Finally, our competitive position is getting stronger. Our win rates remain very high across all competitors. We rarely compete with legacy database providers as enterprises understand that they need to move away from inefficient and brittle legacy technology. We also rarely run into niche database players since customers are overwhelmed by the proliferation of point solutions that are hard to manage and add limited value. Our main competition remains the cloud players. They offer a wide array of database options, relational and non-relational, and benefit from their size and reach. We compete well against these players due to the flexibility and scalability of our document architecture. The fact that our open platform can run anywhere and avoids lock-in and MongoDB's popularity among developers all around the world. Finally, when you look at our newer products, we see increased success competing against the established players in those markets. We find that the same principle applies as in the core database market. Customers don't want to manage a myriad of point solutions and prefer consolidating their spend with strategic vendors, especially in the current cost conscious environment. In summary, we expect the environment in fiscal \u201825 to be largely similar to the environment we experienced in fiscal \u201824. With that backdrop, let me tell you what our priorities are going to next year. First, we'll continue pressing our product advantage in the core database, since we believe customers will place an even greater premium on performance and scalability in the AI enabled world. In addition, we'll continue maturing our newer products, including additional features of Vector Search, GA of Atlas Stream Processing, and enhancements to other offerings. Second, we will remain singularly focused on new workload acquisition as the key long-term driver of our business. We will continue fine-tuning incentives to ensure that our entire go-to-market organization is focused on identifying and sourcing new workload opportunities. In addition, we will leverage our expertise and learnings from our self-serve business to use product-led growth techniques to increase the adoption of Atlas by other development teams within our existing large enterprise accounts. Third, we are focused on growing sales capacity. As we told you in the past, we were slow to grow capacity in fiscal \u201824, especially in the first half due to macro uncertainty. Given that the market is more stable now and that we remain under-penetrated compared to our opportunity, we'll increase the pace of go-to-market investments in fiscal \u201825. Fourth, we will continue investing to become a standard in more of our customer base. We intend to double the size of our strategic account program and dramatically expand our account-based marketing efforts in our largest accounts. Finally, we remain focused on locking the relational migration opportunity. To remind everyone, there are three elements to migrating an application, transforming the schema, moving the data, and rewriting the application code. Our current relational migrator offering is designed to automate large parts of the first two elements, but rewriting application code is the most manually intensive element. GenAI holds tremendous promise to meaningfully reduce the cost and time of rewriting application code. We will continue building AI capabilities into Relational Migrator, but our view is that the end solution will be a mix of products and services. This year, we are investing in a number of pilots leveraging AI for relational migrations paired with services to substantially simplify and scale the process. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries around the world are running mission-critical projects on MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of a developer data platform, including ZF, Forbes, and Swiss Federal Railways. ZF, a global technology company supplying systems for passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and industrial technology, needed a central database solution with broad functionality to support more than 300,000 commercial vehicles connected to ZF infrastructure. ZF originally began using MongoDB on-premise in 2014 and migrated to MongoDB Atlas to modernize the architecture behind its new fleet orchestration solution. The team now uses time series and online archive to reduce the overall data storage size, as well as MongoDB Atlas Search to manage indexes and Atlas Charts to display billing information. MongoDB's developer data platform enables ZF to release new features faster as innovative technologies like drones and autonomous vehicles continue to come to market. In any -- PicPay and Anywhere Real Estate are examples of customers turning to MongoDB to free up the developers' time for innovation while achieving significant cost savings. Anywhere Real Estate, a global leader in residential real estate services whose brand portfolio includes Better Homes and Gardens, Century 21, Coldwell Banker, Corcoran, ERA, Sotheby's International Realty, is leveraging MongoDB Atlas and Atlas Search to greatly enhance its search capabilities. Their previous solution was too costly and operationally burdensome to maintain. Now with Atlas Search, they can ingest data from hundreds of MLS sources, aggregate the data and provide customers with a search solution that efficiently delivers accurate and up-to-date information, saving time and lowering costs. Anywhere is also exploring the use of Atlas Vector Search to provide semantic search and GenAI features to millions of consumers. Samsung Electronics, ArcelorMittal and Citizens Bank are turning to MongoDB to marinize applications. Samsung Electronics digital appliances division transitioned from their previous MySQL database to MongoDB Atlas to manage their clients data more effectively. By leveraging MongoDB's document model, Samsung\u2019s smart home service can collect real-time data from the team's AI-powered home appliances and use it for a variety of data-driven initiatives such as training AI services. Their migration to MongoDB Atlas improved response times by more than 50% and disk read latency was reduced from 3 seconds to 18 millisecond, significantly improving availability and developer productivity. Let me wrap up by saying that I remain highly confident about our ability to execute on our long-term growth opportunity. We are pursuing one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software, with significant expansion opportunities in both new and existing customer accounts. While it's early days, we expect that AI will not only support the overall growth of the market, but also compel customers to revisit both their legacy workloads and build more ambitious applications. This will allow us to win more new and existing workloads and to ultimately continue to establish MongoDB as a standard in enterprise accounts. Before I turn it over to Michael, I would like to personally invite all of you to attend the investor session at MongoDB.localNYC to be held at the Javits Center on May 2nd. Please email ir@mongodb.com if you're interested in attending. With that, here's Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the fourth quarter both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $458 million, up 27% year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance. As Dev mentioned, we had another quarter of healthy new business acquisition, demonstrating our product market fit and the mission criticality of our platform. Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 34% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 65% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and 66% last quarter. We recognize Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform, and that consumption is closely related to end user activity of the application. As a reminder, in Q4 fiscal \u201823, we had a higher than normal amount of revenue from unused commitments, making this a tough year-over-year comparison. Excluding the impact of unused commitments, Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4 was in line with the growth that we observed in Q3. Let me provide some additional context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. As we shared in our guidance last quarter, we were expecting consumption to be impacted by the seasonal slowdown in Q4 around the holidays. Week-over-week consumption growth in Q4 was stronger than in Q4 of last year and in line with our expectations. We've seen less consumption variability this year, and so as in Q3 we forecasted less of a seasonal impact than in prior years and that's exactly what we saw. Turning to non-Atlas revenue, EA exceeded our expectations in the quarter and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing EA customer base. Ongoing EA strength speaks to the appeal and success of our run anywhere strategy. The EA revenue app performance was in part a result of more multi-year deals than we had expected. As a reminder, the term license component for multi-year deals is recognized as upfront revenue at the start of the contract and therefore includes term license revenue related to future years. Turning to customer growth, during the fourth quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,400 customers sequentially bringing our total customer count to over 47,800, which is up from over 40,800 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,000 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,400 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 46,300 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 39,300 in the year-ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth of our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB, in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. Moving on to ARR, we had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,052 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,651 in the year-ago period. We also finished the year with 259 customers spending a million dollars or more annualized on our platform compared to over 213 a year ago. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $353.6 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is down from 78% in the year-ago period. As we said at the time, our gross margin in the year-ago period reflected a one-time benefit of roughly 2.5 percentage points related to one of our cloud partner contracts. Our income from operations was $69.2 million, or a 15% operating margin for the fourth quarter, compared to a 10% margin in the year-ago period. Our strong bottom-line results demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our model and are a clear indication of the strength in our underlying unit economics. The primary reason for our operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. Net income in the fourth quarter was $71.1 million, or $0.86 per share, based on 82.9 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to net income of $46.4 million, or $0.57 per share, on 80.8 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the fourth quarter with $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $54.6 million and $121.5 million for the full fiscal year 2024. After taking into consideration approximately $4.1 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $50.5 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $23.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. For the full fiscal year \u201824, free cash flow was $109.9 million compared to negative $24.7 million in fiscal \u201823. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $436 million to $440 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $22 million to $25 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.39 based on 83.8 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $1.93 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $186 million to $201 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $2.27 to $2.49, based on 85.1 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP income per share guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context on our guidance, starting with the full year fiscal \u201825, where we're facing difficult compares in two ways. First, we expect to recognize close to zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments in fiscal 25, compared to over $40 million in fiscal \u201824. As you may recall, in fiscal \u201824, we changed our sales incentive structure to reduce the importance of upfront commitments. And so we saw far fewer upfront commitments. Therefore, as those fiscal \u201925 -- \u201824 deals come up for renewal in fiscal \u201825, we expect to see limited revenue related to unused commitments. Second, in fiscal \u201824, we recognized approximately $40 million more in multiyear license revenue than we did in fiscal \u201823. As you know, our fiscal year \u201824 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a higher-than-usual amount of license revenue related to multi-year contracts, including our extended partnership with Alibaba. Clearly we are pleased with the fiscal \u201824 performance, but it was unusual in terms of the magnitude of multi-year deals and we don't expect similar performance in fiscal \u201825. As a result, we expect non-Atlas revenues to be modestly down in fiscal \u201825. Next, we expect Atlas consumption growth to be in line with the consumption growth we've experienced in fiscal \u201824. Finally, I want to provide some context to better understand our operating margin guidance. The $80-plus-million of fiscal \u201824 revenue that won't repeat in fiscal \u201825 was very high margin, making for an exceptionally tough operating margin compare. In addition, as we mentioned in the past, in fiscal \u201824 we began increasing our pace of hiring relatively late in the year. So the full cost from those investments will impact our fiscal \u201825 operating margin. We're expecting headcount growth in the mid-teens versus 9% growth in fiscal \u201824. And as Dev mentioned, we are prioritizing growth in sales productive capacity. Consequently, we expect to see a year-over-year operating margin decline while still delivering 500 basis points of margin expansion on a two year basis. We believe this is the most appropriate way to understand our continued margin progression. Moving on to our Q1 guidance, a few things to keep in mind. First, we expect Atlas revenue to be flat to slightly down sequentially. Q1 has two fewer days than Q4 this year, which represents a revenue headwind. Also, the slower Atlas consumption growth during the holidays will have a bigger impact on Q1 revenue than it did in Q4, thereby negatively impacting sequential revenue growth. Finally, the sequential impact from the expected decline in unused Atlas commitments will be most pronounced in Q1, given that we made the changes in Q1 of last year. Second, we expect to see a meaningful sequential decline in EA revenue. As discussed in past years, Q4 is our seasonally highest quarter in terms of our EA renewal base, which is an excellent indicator of our ability to win new EA business. In Q1, the EA renewal base is sequentially much lower. Finally, we expect operating income to decline sequentially due to lower revenue as well as our increased pace of hiring. To summarize, MongoDB delivered strong fourth quarter results. We're pleased with our ability to win new business and see stable consumption trends in Atlas. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead and will continue to invest responsibly to maximize our long-term value. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the question. Michael, I wanted to walk through the guidance with you a little bit. This time last year, coming out of Q4 \u201823, it was a pretty different environment, a much more cautious environment. I think usage growth was particularly impacted in Atlas last year. This year coming into fiscal year \u201825, things feel a little bit healthier or at least stable in sort of how you guys are framing it. And yet the guidance, the initial guidance for growth looks a lot like the initial guidance growth for last year. Just trying to understand, and I know you talked about some of the one-time impacts from last year, but just in terms of a better spending environment versus an initial guide that looks also pretty similar to last year, could you sort of frame out like the conservatism that you have embedded in guidance.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So a couple of things. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think the key thing is, once you adjust for those one-time items that we called out, we see a stable environment. That's what we described and experienced in Q4 compared to Q3. So we feel good about that. I think just to underscore, there's the $80 million in revenue that won't repeat both from the unused commitments as well as from the multi-year deals. And when you adjust from those, we feel good about the dynamic. To your question, which is sort of embedded in that around, sort of I'll call it, guidance approach or approach to guidance, we haven't changed our view as it relates to guidance. We have seen more stable consumption that obviously gives us higher confidence, in part given the less variability that we've seen over the course of fiscal \u201824. I think we also have a better understanding of the underlying seasonality of the business. We had updated at the end of last year in our call, in our Q3 call, around the success that we're having on EA, and we had updated those EA new business assumptions, and so that our guidance reflects kind of continued strength there. So I think that's how we approach it, but there are no fundamental changes, but hopefully we've given you a fair amount of the piece parts so people can help do the math.\nSanjit Singh: Yeah, I really appreciate that. And thank you for breaking out that $80 million between unused commitments and the multi-year term license field. On the unused commitment side of the house, that $40 million, can you give us a sense of how that flowed through to the balance of the year? Obviously, it doesn't look like it all came in Q4, But the prior year in Q4, you also mentioned a $7 million impact to Atlas revenue that quarter. Was that impact worse or better this year when we think about the unused commitment contribution to this quarter's Atlas results?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, so I think the key thing is the $40 million will happen over the course of the year. It obviously tracks to the actual contracts. It affects a relatively small number of customers and a small percentage of the commitments. It's a dynamic that goes away over time as we've discussed. We do -- we particularly called out that on a sequential basis it'll be most obvious and most pronounced in Q1 because we're basically hitting the first wave of those renewals where we don't have commits. And so especially as people are trying to do the sequential math, we just wanted to call that out and make sure people sort of understood that dynamic.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. Congrats on the Q4.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. One moment. [Technical Difficulty] Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Congrats on a nice Q4. Question also a little bit on guidance, Mike. The last two quarters before Q4, we talked about EA seeing a little bit of a tailwind from customers kind of maybe modernizing on-premise rather than going to Atlas to kind of still modernize but maybe not spending all the money to go to the cloud. Is that trend still valid? And if you think about the multi-year commitments, obviously you had the $10 million, $15 million for the Alibaba deal, but then the other stuff is like customers that are just doing this work. Do you think that will change and people go back to like shorter commitments or is it just more that you're kind of thinking about the renewal pool? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, so a few different things embedded in there. On the multi-year, it's always been a dynamic, and as we've seen deals or variability, we've tried to call that out, and that's why we sort of call out, given under the ASC 606, that increased variability and reduced comparability that comes from EA. Obviously, Atlas has grown as a percentage of the business, but that continues to be the dynamic for the EA portion. I expect that we will continue to see multi-year deals, but we -- just in fiscal \u201824, it was just so many more than we thought, and to your point, not just EA, but broadly non-Atlas. And it's just -- it's not something that we'll repeat in fiscal \u201825. And so that's why we wanted to call it out and quantified it. On the first part of your question on modernization, the way I would think about it is, customers all have their own IT strategies including deployment including their cloud postures and things like that. That's for them to decide. We want to make MongoDB easy for them to consume. Our run Anywhere strategy has proven to be successful. And we've seen that in the EA performance. And so I think the other thing I'd add is we have increasingly seen people appreciate, even if they're operating in a business or maybe in a regulated environment where they can't fully move to the cloud, where they do want to start to modernize applications and modernize infrastructure, and MongoDB is seen -- Enterprise Advance is seen now as an on-ramp to the cloud, even if you can't fully modernize and put yourself into a public cloud setting, EA can help that. Because eventually, given the [run-in to our] (ph) strategy, it will make it easier for your ultimate move to the cloud if that's what you wind up doing.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Hey, thank you very much. Congrats on the results. One quick one for Dev and one hopefully quick one for Michael as well. Dev, you talked about Generative AI applications. You described the three layer architecture. When do you think it hits the sweet spot of how MongoDB is positioned from a timing standpoint? When do these Generative AI applications start to really drive underlying need for the kind of databases that you're best suited for? One for Michael. In your assumptions, when I take away the $40 million of the upfront, that's like a couple of percentage points of growth. I'm just trying to understand what kind of consumption trends you are using to build guidance? Was it average of fiscal \u201824 consumption trends or weighted more to its second half or exiting fourth quarter? Any color there would be tremendously useful. And also want to ensure the sales force is still selling EA and can get comp for EA because it does not look like you're giving much weight for EA in your forecast. That's it for me. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Kash. I'll take the first question. In regards to when we see enterprises deploying [indiscernible] production, I think it's a combination of customers getting comfortable with the technology and also these technologies maturing from both a performance and from a cost point of view. If you played with ChatGPT or any of the other chatbots out there or large language models, you'll know that the performance of these applications, you need to get response time in the one to two to three seconds, depending on the type of question you're asking. And so naturally a chatbot is a very simple but easy to understand use case, but to embed that technology into a sophisticated application, making real-time decisions based on real-time data, the performance and to some degree, the cost of these architectures are still not there. Also, customers are still in the learning phase. They're experimenting, they're prototyping, but I would say you're not seeing a lot of customers really deploy AI applications at scale. So I think it's going to take them, I would say this year is a year where they're going to do, you know, probably roll out a few applications, learn, and then as they get more experience, become more comfortable in rolling out more and more applications as they get -- as both these technologies mature and the costs come down. We feel very good about our positioning because from an architecture point of view, the document model, the flexible schema, the ability to handle real time data, performance at scale, the unified platform, the ability to handle data, metadata, and vector data with the same query language, same semantics, et cetera, is something that makes us very, very attractive. The other thing that we're finding is unlike a typical sale where someone's deciding to either build a new workload or monetize a workload, the AI decision is more of a central decision -- centralized decision more than ever. So it allows us to actually go higher in the organization. So we're actually engaging with customers at much more senior levels because obviously this is coming down as a top down initiative. And so this allows us to position us as a very modern platform designed for these new modern use cases and workloads. So we feel good about a positioning, but as I said this year I think is going to be continued experimentation and rollout of some individual applications.\nMichael Gordon: And then on the consumption questions, Kash, thanks for that. Overall, if you look at the guidance and the piece parts that we've tried to share with you, when you take into account the $80 million of impact from the unused commitments and the multi-year outperformance, you'll see at the top line level around 500 basis points of headwind. And then we also walked you through our expectations that the non-Atlas will be modestly down, given the $40 million of that part that isn't recurring. So when you kind of piece all those together, you'll wind up probably coming to a conclusion that Atlas looks consistent from a consumption growth standpoint, and that's in line with the stable trends we've seen over the course of fiscal \u201824. So we're using those fiscal \u201824 numbers. Obviously there's some seasonal adjustments that we have factored in there, but that's really what we're seeing there. And then the last part of your question around EA, we are -- we do still sell EA, we don't tend to sell EA into new accounts, it tends to be into an existing account, expanding their MongoDB footprint, sellers do get compensated on EA. In part it goes back to the comment from the earlier question that our sales rep really can't dictate the IT deployment environment at a customer. And so yeah, they get paid on that. And to your comment about the sort of, EA results or expectations, that's really just as a result of the difficult compare, in part given that multi-year dynamic.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from Alana Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon. Thank you. Michael, we're going to stick with the guide scene here. If I look at last year, you guided to, I think, 16% growth. You ended up doing 31% for the full year. Even if I take out the $80 million tailwind you talked about, that's still 25% growth. You're guiding to 14% growth this year, again 5% headwind, so closer to 19% organically. Are you more confident kind of going into this year than last year just as you think about the trends. Is the 14% comparable to the 16% initial guide last year? Is it really more like 19% adjusted basis comparing to 16%? I know it's a little confusing, but getting a lot of questions on it, thanks.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, no, it's fine. I go back to what I said in response to, I think it was Sanjit\u2019s question. There's been no fundamental change or approach in terms of how we're looking and determining our guidance. I do think to the confidence point, I think that that is correct. We do have more confidence. We have more data. We -- if you think back a year ago, as one of the questions indicated, there was much more macro uncertainty. I think over the course of fiscal \u201824, we saw narrower variability. We saw more consistent results that does give us increased confidence. I think we also have another year under our belt in terms of understanding the seasonality trends of Atlas. I know Atlas is a big business, but it's still a relatively young one, especially when you think about getting quarterly data points. And so I think we have more confidence and better handle on that. And then lastly, while there is a difficult compare on EA, I think, we talked about this in the second half of last year where we were, at some point you could only be -- continue to be surprised by EA so much. And so as we looked at our, I think it was in our third quarter call, we talked about how we were upping our views on what EA could do. And so all that sort of baked into the guide.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color there. And then just, Dev, as you think about the million dollar question, when do you think these AI tailwinds, the interest in Vector starts to really impact your business? It sounded like you think another -- we'll see another year of more experimentation before we see big production moves. Is that the right take? Just walk us through your current thinking on when AI really starts to show up in your business. Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah, I think it's going to show up in a business when people are deploying AI apps at scale, right? So I think that's going to be at least another year. But that being said, we do see some really interesting startups who are building on top of MongoDB, so it gives us confidence about our platform fit for these sophisticated workloads. But, given all the noise around AI, you have to remember we're still in the very, very early days. The performance of some of these systems is, I would classify as okay, not great. The cost of inference is quite expensive, so people have to be quite careful about the types of applications they deploy. There's some debate about open versus closed source LLMs. Do they use case specific LLMs or more general purpose LLMs? So there's a lot of learnings going on. And obviously, there's an announcement today that yet another company had delivered better performance than GPT-4. So, people are -- there's a lot going on in this space. So, for people to really get comfortable in picking a stack and deploying workloads in mass is going to take a bit of time. There are obviously some outliers who are obviously being far more aggressive. But that's essentially what we see across our customer base. But the good news is that we feel like we're well positioned. We feel that people really resonate with a unified platform. One way to handle data, metadata and vector data, that we are open and composable, that we integrate to not only all the different LLMs, we integrate to different embedding models. And we also -- essentially also integrate with some of the emerging application frameworks that developers want to use. So we think we're well positioned and you'll see us continue to expand and broaden our reach in this category, but I do think it's going to take a little bit of time.\nBrent Bracelin: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Karl [Technical Difficulty] of UBS. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Maybe one for Dev and one for Mike. Dev, just because my first question follows on that, I'll go to you first. There are certainly some voices in the industry that would argue that even in advance of AI applications being deployed at scale, which you just said might take a year, enterprises might look to spend more to modernize their existing data stack and on data readiness in advance of those AI apps going into production. Are you seeing any of that type of behavior that could proceed the in-production deployment timeframe?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah, I touched a little bit about relational migrations. I mean, that's one way where a lot of people feel like they have a lot of data trapped in these legacy platforms. As we've shared, we've always had customers migrate from legacy SQL apps to MongoDB, But the hardest part was basically rewriting the application. Generative AI essentially lowers the cost to do so. We are running a bunch of pilots with customers. Customers are very aligned. We have access to senior level decision makers. And we're learning a lot. Obviously, we're learning about the effectiveness of some of these AI technologies. We're learning about how you have to handle old languages, old libraries, old packages, the different versions. And so the variability and all that makes it clear that this will require a mix of product and services. Product alone today will not solve the problem. So we do think this is a big opportunity, but we're in the early days. And as I said in the past, even when I talked to investors about this pre-AI, there was no big red easy button to press to kind of migrate a SQL app to MongoDB. And while GenAI makes that easier, it's still going to take a little bit of time, but it's definitely exciting and there's a lot of customers leaning in. And so, we're excited about the option, but it's a lot of work to do.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Dev. And then for Mike. Mike, could you just because we're all trying to set up our models by quarter for fiscal \u201825, is there any way to be more descriptive about how that $80 million, the sum of those two pieces, tracked by quarter and in particular how much of the $80 million landed in the fourth quarter you just reported?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, so I don't have a quarterly breakdown. I guess what I would offer is throughout our life as a public company, including over the three prior quarters of this year, when there have been unusual trends, we've tried to call them out, so that people could understand both what was driving the results and looking forward what would impact the compares. And so, I think our historic comments should sort of leave a pretty good bread-cum-trail relative to things. I think we've been very clear on the multi-year deals and the EA outperformance when that's happened. And if you needed sort of a rule of thumb, credits would typically -- unused credits or unused commitments would typically, they map to the renewal cycle and we've called out the very seasonality as it relates to that. So those would probably be the big things on the EA and other non-Atlas, obviously Q2 last year was a big quarter. We talked about Alibaba and other deals that hit in Q2. And so I think you can -- it's not -- I wouldn't just divide by four. There are some differences quarter to quarter. And then lastly, we did call out the -- for folks who look at the business on a sequential basis, the impact of Atlas on the Atlas numbers for Q1, given that there'll be a much more pronounced effect, given this is the first quarter where we'll see the impact of that change.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, awesome. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: [Technical Difficulty]\nUnidentified Analyst: Hello, Can you guys -- can you hear me? Because the line's cutting out a bit.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, we can hear you. Unfortunately, we can't hear the moderator, but we can hear you.\nUnidentified Analyst: Terrific. Okay, well, thank you for having me on. I'd like to ask about Atlas Stream Processing. So that was announced in June 2023. I guess, can you just remind us of like what is Mongo's reason to win in that segment of the market and then any idea of when that product will likely go GA?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so we announced -- as you said, we announced the private preview of Stream Processing where we ended up having hundreds of development teams use the product. Now we're in a public preview, so if customers are interested, they can actually start using the product today. Why are we in a position to win? For a couple reasons. One, this is purely focused on the developer market. The data is mainly in JSON. It requires a flexible schema and is for real-time applications. Given all those things are kind of coordinating, we feel really well positioned because most of the alternatives have a very rigid or fixed schema. And with the variability of data coming from these kind of events, that becomes much more problematic for customers to manage. So we feel very good about our position there. In terms of timing of when we're going to go GA, we're just currently getting feedback and responding to feedback. And we want to be very sure that we've addressed kind of the low-hanging fruit before we go generally available, but we're really sexcited about the opportunity that stream processing offers us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah, ideal. I might just also follow on to that and then add in my kind of proper second question. The follow-on is, is Stream Processing embedded in the guidance for fiscal \u201825? And then the question I had is about the bottom line. The guidance, if I'm not mistaken, is a 10% op margins in fiscal \u201825. Assuming the same beat as you guys did this year, so if 6 points of beat would put us at about 16 points of op margin exiting fiscal \u201825, so kind of net-net flat year-on-year. Is that due to this kind of putting the kind of foot on the gas in terms of hiring and really trying to be aggressive at adding headcount? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, so a couple different questions there. Let me try and get them all. So obviously our plans related to Stream Processing are included in our guidance, but we don\u2019t -- most of that will show up in Atlas overall when you think about the results. And certainly, whether it's new workloads or anything else, they tend to start off small and grow quickly in those first couple of quarters. But I wouldn't think of it as a major needle mover in the context of the fiscal \u201825 results, but we're very excited about it over the long term. In terms of the op margin, yes, our guidance is to go backwards on operating margin relative to fiscal \u201824. It will result in 500 basis points improvement over the two-year basis. And the thinking and the rationale related to that is the fact that if you take a step back and you look at us relative to the IPO, we had mapped out needing around 55 points of margin improvement to get to our target margins. With the fiscal \u201824 results, we effectively delivered 50 of those 55 points and yet are still at 2% market share and so it makes sense to continue investing in the opportunity, particularly on the sales productive capacity as we talked about but also to execute against the product roadmap. And so we will continue to do that, and that will take us backwards relative to last year, but positive 500 basis points on the two-year basis.\nUnidentified Analyst: Tremendous. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes to the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around the sales capacity. It sounds like, at some point last year, you realized that you had under-invested, maybe pivoted too much towards margin expansion and then are now catching up. In the guidance, if you could assume you had the sales capacity that you would prefer to be at this point, given the demand that you're seeing, would we be at a higher level of growth? I'm just trying to parse out how much of the guide is factoring in those constraints on sales capacity that you've talked about?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah, so thanks for your question. Yes, we, given the macro uncertainty, especially coming out off Q4 of last year, we did slow down hiring quite meaningfully. And obviously that showed up in our numbers to the point that Michael talked about in our op margin as well. We obviously know that we have a big opportunity in front of us. So we are growing our headcount between the mid and high teens. We think that's appropriate relative to the opportunities we see. And yes, if we had more productive sales capacity, the guidance would probably be higher. There's no question about that.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, I would just -- Brad, I would just make sure it's clear. The slowing down and hiring was really macro related and just sort of concerns about the environment. If you think back then, there were broadscale layoffs happening across the industry and everything else. And obviously we successfully weathered the storm. I think we talked about on the last call how with the benefit of hindsight and the results that we put up and how quickly, at least for us, things stabilized, we could have started investing sooner. And so I think in the call -- the year-ago call, we talked about adding single digit headcount growth relative to I think 30% headcount growth in the prior year. We wound up adding 9%. So obviously at the high end of what would constitute single digits in part because of the stabilization that we did see, but to the comments that affect the op income guide and everything else, that was very back-end loaded, right? So those investments will much more affect the fiscal \u201825 P&L, and that's really what we're reflecting into.\nBrad Sills: Understood, thanks so much for that. And then one more, if I may please. You guys have such broad exposure to different industries. With the advent of AI coming into your business and some of the early progress you're seeing, are there any verticals that you would point to where you're seeing more activity perhaps than others, any use cases you might point to, just to give us a sense for where that early adopter might come from? Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah, in regards to use cases, we're seeing most customers focus on driving efficiencies in their business because their existing baseline of costs are well known. So it's much easier for them to determine how much value they can derive by using some of these new AI technologies. So I see the first wave of applications being around reducing costs. You've seen some announcements by some customers saying, focusing on things like customer support and customer service, they really have -- they have found ways to dramatically reduce their costs. That's not surprising to me. I think cogeneration and this increasing developer productivity is another area. I think those are going to be kind of two areas where there's low hanging fruit. But then I think you're going to see customers focus on delivering better experiences for their customers and then find new streams of growth. And so I think it will be common phases. And so in terms of across industries, I think it's obviously there's some constraints and some customers based on the regulated nature of their industry, but in general we see basically high interest across almost every industry that we operate in.\nBrad Sills: That's exciting. Thank you so much, Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Brad. Give me a moment. Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria of RBC. [Technical Difficulty] is open.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Hey, Dev. Hey, Michael. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to first start with relational migrator. Dev, can you talk a little bit about what demand for that looks like? And when customers are talking to you, are they more focused around the value prop being around cost savings that they get from moving from legacy relational databases over to MongoDB? Is it more about the flexibility around the technology itself? And maybe if you could tie in, how you expect now with GenAI's accelerator, how that can impact the timeline of migrating workloads from relational over to MongoDB? And then I've got a quick follow-up to Michael.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. When we talk to customers, and remember, even at our IPO, we had a meaningful number of customers migrating off relational to MongoDB. So they tend to come in three categories of reasons why. First is that the data models become so brittle with the relational architecture that it's very hard to build new features and be responsive to their customers. And so they just feel like their ability to innovate has slowed down. The second reason is that the system is just not scaling or performing given the increased number of users or the large amount of data that they have to process, that they realize that they have to get off a legacy platform. And the third reason is just the cost of the underlying platform and relative to the ROI that application is providing. So typically falls in one of those three buckets. Sometimes customers may have all three or maybe two of the three that are driving that demand. And then there's typically some compelling event, maybe there's some milestones they want to hit, maybe there's a renewal coming up with the incumbent vendor that's driving them to potentially move off that vendor as quickly as possible. As I said, with relational migrator, there's three parts to it. There's mapping of the schema from a tabular, relational schema to a document-based schema in MongoDB. Then there's actually moving the data, mapping to the new schema, and then there's the rewriting of the application. And so we have done lots of those already pre-GenAI, and some customers take a -- I want to rewrite everything. Some customers take a, I'll do it on a microservices basis, where I'll start peeling off functionality of the existing application and move that functionality to the new application and do that over time. It really depends on the customer's use case and their business needs. And yes, with GenAI, we do expect that rewriting the application has become easier and hence lower the cost of essentially switching, which by definition then expands the amount of customers and workloads you can go after. The other, I would say, on top of the three reasons I gave you in terms of why people move, there's now an emerging fourth reason, which is enabling their data and their applications to be more AI enabled. And so it's not just moving to more modern platform, but making them more AI enabled. And so that's also something that's getting customers' interest. And to your question on timing, as I said, I think this year we're going to see a lot of pilots and people trying out these new AI capabilities. And I think as the technology improves, as we learn more, I think you're going to see that scale much more quickly after that.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Really helpful. And then, Michael, just quickly, you put up your first free cash flow positive year in public company history. Just as we think about the margin guidance for next year, how should we be thinking about cash conversion going forward? Thanks.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, so I think the two factors to think about in terms of cash conversion are, within Atlas, there's this dynamic where we are reducing and continuing to see less upfront Atlas. Obviously, we're hitting the anniversary of that, and that's what's creating the headwind on the revenue front and the tough compare. But that's with Atlas at 68% of revenue. And so if you assume that Atlas is going to increase as a percent of revenue, I think that will sort of further drive the divergence. And then the only other big delta is things related to SBC and stuff like that. But I think it's the Atlas dynamic when you think about potential changes from a cash conversion standpoint, I think is where I'd focus and the impact, if you assume that Atlas is going to be a larger percent of the business.\nRishi Jaluria: All right, very helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. [Technical Difficulty] comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Hey, can you hear me okay?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. Hey, Tyler. Good evening.\nTyler Radke: Okay. Cool. Okay, sorry, the line was a little choppy. Dev, I wanted to ask you just a question as it relates to competition. Obviously, it's been a busy week at both Snowflake and Databricks with Frank Slootman retiring. I hope you're not going anywhere soon. But Databricks announcing pretty impressive growth. I guess, how do you think about your positioning relative to those two vendors, especially with the new CEO, kind of more of a technical focus at Snowflake, and new store product coming out later this year, do you expect to compete more, just frame for us how you're thinking about it, especially as the GenAI momentum increases over the coming years?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah, so first of all, I'm very committed to MongoDB. I'm very excited about the opportunity here, so I have no plans to go anywhere. Second, in regards to Snowflake and Databricks, we don't typically compete with them, right? Because they're focused on analytical workloads. We're focused on operational workloads. So those are two very different sets of use cases. The big difference in terms of how customer buy, typically data warehouses and data lakes tends to be a centralized decision, organizations standardize on one platform, and then basically move their existing data to those platforms where I would say, operational platforms tend to be a more decentralized decision where different development teams, different lines of businesses, et cetera, based on the requirements for their application, will choose, will make their own independent decisions about what they think they need to do. And we've always talked about how we start with one team and then try and expand from there, and why there's so much focus on expanding within accounts and becoming a standard within an account, because then that accelerates the amount of workloads we capture. But those are two very different kind of customer buying behaviors in terms of analytical versus operational. With regards to the potential overlap, we are embedding more analytics capabilities. We have a very sophisticated aggregation framework, so people can do real-time processing of analytics on our platform with real-time data. Remember, data lakes and data warehouses have a batch process to get that data into their platforms, so they're not dealing with the real-time data. And then with regards to Unistore, listen, there's like over 300 databases in the marketplace, so not sure, I have a lot of respect for the Snowflake people. I'm not sure, we've heard noises about Unistore for a long time, but we feel very comfortable and confident about our position just given the investments we made on our platform and the large customers we have. And frankly, the popularity of our platform with developers. And remember, developers are not a persona that these other players typically go after. They go after more the analysts and the data scientist community. We're very, very focused on developers.\nTyler Radke: That's helpful. Michael, just a quick follow-up for you on the overage comments you made. I guess a couple questions. First of all, the $40 million is what I think you called out. That seems pretty high for last year, just considering we hadn't really heard about it, since Q4 of last year, we called out only several million of overage credit figures. Can you just frame for us, was that consistent with what you've seen in prior years? And I guess, you're obviously embedding that that doesn't continue next year. Is that a change in the way that you're recognizing overage revenue or is that just -- you don't expect that to happen because all your contracts have been reset? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, so just two quick things in the interest of time. So a reminder, the several was the incremental amount over and above the normal amount that we experienced. So that's the sort of the principle that we take where we try and call out differences or variations from sort of the normal behavior. And so it was several million more than what we would normally see. The $40 million is the amount that was recognized in fiscal \u201824. We do see that going to zero effectively. And you're right, that's directly as a result of the changes that we've made in the go-to market and the fact that we are not prioritizing commitments and haven't since the start of last fiscal year. And so the result of that is that you have many fewer commitments and unused -- the revenue for unused credits simply just reflects the revenue at the end of that contract period that you haven't realized or recognized through consumption. And so we expect that to go away because we've taken a different approach to the market to drive greater adoption of workloads and all the other things that we've talked about, which is the rationale for doing that in the first place. So hopefully that helps put all that in context.\nTyler Radke: It does. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Dev, CEO, for any closing remarks.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you. Again, I thank everyone for joining us today. I just want to reiterate that we had a strong quarter and year as we executed our opportunity. We do expect fiscal \u201825 to play out similarly to fiscal \u201824 with a healthy new business and stable consumption trends. We are very excited about the long-term AI opportunity, but still believe it's early days as customers are mainly in the experimentation and prototyping stages of building AI applications. And our priorities for fiscal \u201825 are to invest in deepening our product advantage while remaining focused on acquiring new workloads and establishing ourselves as the standard for building modern applications. So thank you again for joining us and we'll talk to you soon. Take care. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the fourth quarter both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $458 million, up 27% year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance. As Dev mentioned, we had another quarter of healthy new business acquisition, demonstrating our product market fit and the mission criticality of our platform. Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 34% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 65% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and 66% last quarter. We recognize Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform, and that consumption is closely related to end user activity of the application. As a reminder, in Q4 fiscal \u201823, we had a higher than normal amount of revenue from unused commitments, making this a tough year-over-year comparison. Excluding the impact of unused commitments, Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4 was in line with the growth that we observed in Q3. Let me provide some additional context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. As we shared in our guidance last quarter, we were expecting consumption to be impacted by the seasonal slowdown in Q4 around the holidays. Week-over-week consumption growth in Q4 was stronger than in Q4 of last year and in line with our expectations. We've seen less consumption variability this year, and so as in Q3 we forecasted less of a seasonal impact than in prior years and that's exactly what we saw. Turning to non-Atlas revenue, EA exceeded our expectations in the quarter and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing EA customer base. Ongoing EA strength speaks to the appeal and success of our run anywhere strategy. The EA revenue app performance was in part a result of more multi-year deals than we had expected. As a reminder, the term license component for multi-year deals is recognized as upfront revenue at the start of the contract and therefore includes term license revenue related to future years. Turning to customer growth, during the fourth quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,400 customers sequentially bringing our total customer count to over 47,800, which is up from over 40,800 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,000 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,400 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 46,300 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 39,300 in the year-ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth of our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB, in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. Moving on to ARR, we had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,052 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,651 in the year-ago period. We also finished the year with 259 customers spending a million dollars or more annualized on our platform compared to over 213 a year ago. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $353.6 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is down from 78% in the year-ago period. As we said at the time, our gross margin in the year-ago period reflected a one-time benefit of roughly 2.5 percentage points related to one of our cloud partner contracts. Our income from operations was $69.2 million, or a 15% operating margin for the fourth quarter, compared to a 10% margin in the year-ago period. Our strong bottom-line results demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our model and are a clear indication of the strength in our underlying unit economics. The primary reason for our operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. Net income in the fourth quarter was $71.1 million, or $0.86 per share, based on 82.9 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to net income of $46.4 million, or $0.57 per share, on 80.8 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the fourth quarter with $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $54.6 million and $121.5 million for the full fiscal year 2024. After taking into consideration approximately $4.1 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $50.5 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $23.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. For the full fiscal year \u201824, free cash flow was $109.9 million compared to negative $24.7 million in fiscal \u201823. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $436 million to $440 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $22 million to $25 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.39 based on 83.8 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $1.93 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $186 million to $201 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $2.27 to $2.49, based on 85.1 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP income per share guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context on our guidance, starting with the full year fiscal \u201825, where we're facing difficult compares in two ways. First, we expect to recognize close to zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments in fiscal 25, compared to over $40 million in fiscal \u201824. As you may recall, in fiscal \u201824, we changed our sales incentive structure to reduce the importance of upfront commitments. And so we saw far fewer upfront commitments. Therefore, as those fiscal '25 -- \u201824 deals come up for renewal in fiscal \u201825, we expect to see limited revenue related to unused commitments. Second, in fiscal \u201824, we recognized approximately $40 million more in multiyear license revenue than we did in fiscal \u201823. As you know, our fiscal year \u201824 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a higher-than-usual amount of license revenue related to multi-year contracts, including our extended partnership with Alibaba. Clearly we are pleased with the fiscal \u201824 performance, but it was unusual in terms of the magnitude of multi-year deals and we don't expect similar performance in fiscal \u201825. As a result, we expect non-Atlas revenues to be modestly down in fiscal \u201825. Next, we expect Atlas consumption growth to be in line with the consumption growth we've experienced in fiscal \u201824. Finally, I want to provide some context to better understand our operating margin guidance. The $80-plus-million of fiscal \u201824 revenue that won't repeat in fiscal \u201825 was very high margin, making for an exceptionally tough operating margin compare. In addition, as we mentioned in the past, in fiscal \u201824 we began increasing our pace of hiring relatively late in the year. So the full cost from those investments will impact our fiscal \u201825 operating margin. We're expecting headcount growth in the mid-teens versus 9% growth in fiscal \u201824. And as Dev mentioned, we are prioritizing growth in sales productive capacity. Consequently, we expect to see a year-over-year operating margin decline while still delivering 500 basis points of margin expansion on a two year basis. We believe this is the most appropriate way to understand our continued margin progression. Moving on to our Q1 guidance, a few things to keep in mind. First, we expect Atlas revenue to be flat to slightly down sequentially. Q1 has two fewer days than Q4 this year, which represents a revenue headwind. Also, the slower Atlas consumption growth during the holidays will have a bigger impact on Q1 revenue than it did in Q4, thereby negatively impacting sequential revenue growth. Finally, the sequential impact from the expected decline in unused Atlas commitments will be most pronounced in Q1, given that we made the changes in Q1 of last year. Second, we expect to see a meaningful sequential decline in EA revenue. As discussed in past years, Q4 is our seasonally highest quarter in terms of our EA renewal base, which is an excellent indicator of our ability to win new EA business. In Q1, the EA renewal base is sequentially much lower. Finally, we expect operating income to decline sequentially due to lower revenue as well as our increased pace of hiring. To summarize, MongoDB delivered strong fourth quarter results. We're pleased with our ability to win new business and see stable consumption trends in Atlas. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead and will continue to invest responsibly to maximize our long-term value. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Yeah. So a couple of things. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think the key thing is, once you adjust for those one-time items that we called out, we see a stable environment. That's what we described and experienced in Q4 compared to Q3. So we feel good about that. I think just to underscore, there's the $80 million in revenue that won't repeat both from the unused commitments as well as from the multi-year deals. And when you adjust from those, we feel good about the dynamic. To your question, which is sort of embedded in that around, sort of I'll call it, guidance approach or approach to guidance, we haven't changed our view as it relates to guidance. We have seen more stable consumption that obviously gives us higher confidence, in part given the less variability that we've seen over the course of fiscal \u201824. I think we also have a better understanding of the underlying seasonality of the business. We had updated at the end of last year in our call, in our Q3 call, around the success that we're having on EA, and we had updated those EA new business assumptions, and so that our guidance reflects kind of continued strength there. So I think that's how we approach it, but there are no fundamental changes, but hopefully we've given you a fair amount of the piece parts so people can help do the math. Yeah, so I think the key thing is the $40 million will happen over the course of the year. It obviously tracks to the actual contracts. It affects a relatively small number of customers and a small percentage of the commitments. It's a dynamic that goes away over time as we've discussed. We do -- we particularly called out that on a sequential basis it'll be most obvious and most pronounced in Q1 because we're basically hitting the first wave of those renewals where we don't have commits. And so especially as people are trying to do the sequential math, we just wanted to call that out and make sure people sort of understood that dynamic. Thanks. Yeah, so a few different things embedded in there. On the multi-year, it's always been a dynamic, and as we've seen deals or variability, we've tried to call that out, and that's why we sort of call out, given under the ASC 606, that increased variability and reduced comparability that comes from EA. Obviously, Atlas has grown as a percentage of the business, but that continues to be the dynamic for the EA portion. I expect that we will continue to see multi-year deals, but we -- just in fiscal \u201824, it was just so many more than we thought, and to your point, not just EA, but broadly non-Atlas. And it's just -- it's not something that we'll repeat in fiscal \u201825. And so that's why we wanted to call it out and quantified it. On the first part of your question on modernization, the way I would think about it is, customers all have their own IT strategies including deployment including their cloud postures and things like that. That's for them to decide. We want to make MongoDB easy for them to consume. Our run Anywhere strategy has proven to be successful. And we've seen that in the EA performance. And so I think the other thing I'd add is we have increasingly seen people appreciate, even if they're operating in a business or maybe in a regulated environment where they can't fully move to the cloud, where they do want to start to modernize applications and modernize infrastructure, and MongoDB is seen -- Enterprise Advance is seen now as an on-ramp to the cloud, even if you can't fully modernize and put yourself into a public cloud setting, EA can help that. Because eventually, given the [run-in to our] (ph) strategy, it will make it easier for your ultimate move to the cloud if that's what you wind up doing. And then on the consumption questions, Kash, thanks for that. Overall, if you look at the guidance and the piece parts that we've tried to share with you, when you take into account the $80 million of impact from the unused commitments and the multi-year outperformance, you'll see at the top line level around 500 basis points of headwind. And then we also walked you through our expectations that the non-Atlas will be modestly down, given the $40 million of that part that isn't recurring. So when you kind of piece all those together, you'll wind up probably coming to a conclusion that Atlas looks consistent from a consumption growth standpoint, and that's in line with the stable trends we've seen over the course of fiscal \u201824. So we're using those fiscal \u201824 numbers. Obviously there's some seasonal adjustments that we have factored in there, but that's really what we're seeing there. And then the last part of your question around EA, we are -- we do still sell EA, we don't tend to sell EA into new accounts, it tends to be into an existing account, expanding their MongoDB footprint, sellers do get compensated on EA. In part it goes back to the comment from the earlier question that our sales rep really can't dictate the IT deployment environment at a customer. And so yeah, they get paid on that. And to your comment about the sort of, EA results or expectations, that's really just as a result of the difficult compare, in part given that multi-year dynamic. Yeah, no, it's fine. I go back to what I said in response to, I think it was Sanjit's question. There's been no fundamental change or approach in terms of how we're looking and determining our guidance. I do think to the confidence point, I think that that is correct. We do have more confidence. We have more data. We -- if you think back a year ago, as one of the questions indicated, there was much more macro uncertainty. I think over the course of fiscal \u201824, we saw narrower variability. We saw more consistent results that does give us increased confidence. I think we also have another year under our belt in terms of understanding the seasonality trends of Atlas. I know Atlas is a big business, but it's still a relatively young one, especially when you think about getting quarterly data points. And so I think we have more confidence and better handle on that. And then lastly, while there is a difficult compare on EA, I think, we talked about this in the second half of last year where we were, at some point you could only be -- continue to be surprised by EA so much. And so as we looked at our, I think it was in our third quarter call, we talked about how we were upping our views on what EA could do. And so all that sort of baked into the guide. Yeah, so I don't have a quarterly breakdown. I guess what I would offer is throughout our life as a public company, including over the three prior quarters of this year, when there have been unusual trends, we've tried to call them out, so that people could understand both what was driving the results and looking forward what would impact the compares. And so, I think our historic comments should sort of leave a pretty good bread-cum-trail relative to things. I think we've been very clear on the multi-year deals and the EA outperformance when that's happened. And if you needed sort of a rule of thumb, credits would typically -- unused credits or unused commitments would typically, they map to the renewal cycle and we've called out the very seasonality as it relates to that. So those would probably be the big things on the EA and other non-Atlas, obviously Q2 last year was a big quarter. We talked about Alibaba and other deals that hit in Q2. And so I think you can -- it's not -- I wouldn't just divide by four. There are some differences quarter to quarter. And then lastly, we did call out the -- for folks who look at the business on a sequential basis, the impact of Atlas on the Atlas numbers for Q1, given that there'll be a much more pronounced effect, given this is the first quarter where we'll see the impact of that change. Yeah, so a couple different questions there. Let me try and get them all. So obviously our plans related to Stream Processing are included in our guidance, but we don't -- most of that will show up in Atlas overall when you think about the results. And certainly, whether it's new workloads or anything else, they tend to start off small and grow quickly in those first couple of quarters. But I wouldn't think of it as a major needle mover in the context of the fiscal \u201825 results, but we're very excited about it over the long term. In terms of the op margin, yes, our guidance is to go backwards on operating margin relative to fiscal \u201824. It will result in 500 basis points improvement over the two-year basis. And the thinking and the rationale related to that is the fact that if you take a step back and you look at us relative to the IPO, we had mapped out needing around 55 points of margin improvement to get to our target margins. With the fiscal \u201824 results, we effectively delivered 50 of those 55 points and yet are still at 2% market share and so it makes sense to continue investing in the opportunity, particularly on the sales productive capacity as we talked about but also to execute against the product roadmap. And so we will continue to do that, and that will take us backwards relative to last year, but positive 500 basis points on the two-year basis. Yeah, I would just -- Brad, I would just make sure it's clear. The slowing down and hiring was really macro related and just sort of concerns about the environment. If you think back then, there were broadscale layoffs happening across the industry and everything else. And obviously we successfully weathered the storm. I think we talked about on the last call how with the benefit of hindsight and the results that we put up and how quickly, at least for us, things stabilized, we could have started investing sooner. And so I think in the call -- the year-ago call, we talked about adding single digit headcount growth relative to I think 30% headcount growth in the prior year. We wound up adding 9%. So obviously at the high end of what would constitute single digits in part because of the stabilization that we did see, but to the comments that affect the op income guide and everything else, that was very back-end loaded, right? So those investments will much more affect the fiscal \u201825 P&L, and that's really what we're reflecting into. Yeah, so I think the two factors to think about in terms of cash conversion are, within Atlas, there's this dynamic where we are reducing and continuing to see less upfront Atlas. Obviously, we're hitting the anniversary of that, and that's what's creating the headwind on the revenue front and the tough compare. But that's with Atlas at 68% of revenue. And so if you assume that Atlas is going to increase as a percent of revenue, I think that will sort of further drive the divergence. And then the only other big delta is things related to SBC and stuff like that. But I think it's the Atlas dynamic when you think about potential changes from a cash conversion standpoint, I think is where I'd focus and the impact, if you assume that Atlas is going to be a larger percent of the business. Yeah, so just two quick things in the interest of time. So a reminder, the several was the incremental amount over and above the normal amount that we experienced. So that's the sort of the principle that we take where we try and call out differences or variations from sort of the normal behavior. And so it was several million more than what we would normally see. The $40 million is the amount that was recognized in fiscal \u201824. We do see that going to zero effectively. And you're right, that's directly as a result of the changes that we've made in the go-to market and the fact that we are not prioritizing commitments and haven't since the start of last fiscal year. And so the result of that is that you have many fewer commitments and unused -- the revenue for unused credits simply just reflects the revenue at the end of that contract period that you haven't realized or recognized through consumption. And so we expect that to go away because we've taken a different approach to the market to drive greater adoption of workloads and all the other things that we've talked about, which is the rationale for doing that in the first place. So hopefully that helps put all that in context."

            "name": "Dev Ittycheria",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter that capped off an impressive year as we continue to execute well to capture a large market opportunity. I will start by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results before giving you a broader company update. Starting with the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $458 million, a 27% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 34% year-over-year, representing 68% of revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $69.2 million for a 15% non-GAAP operating margin, and we ended the quarter with over 47,800 customers. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter. We had a healthy quarter of new business led by continued strength in new workload acquisition within our existing Atlas customers. In addition, our Enterprise Advanced business again exceeded our expectations, demonstrating strong demand for our platform and the appeal of our run anywhere strategy. Moving on to Atlas consumption trends, the quarter played out in line with our expectations and we saw a stronger consumption than in Q4 last year. Michael will discuss consumption trends in more detail. Finally, retention rates remained strong in Q4, reinforcing the quality of our product and the mission criticality of our platform. Stepping back and looking at fiscal \u201824 as a whole, I'm proud of what we accomplished. We achieved revenue growth of 31% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 16%, well above our initial expectations. Atlas grew 37% year-over-year, and we added over 7,000 customers, ranging from AI startups to Fortune 500 companies. We had a record year of fast-paced innovative product releases such as Vector Search, Queryable Encryption, and the preview of Atlas Stream Processing, reinforcing why so many customers and developers choose MongoDB's developer data platform. Finally, we continue to innovate on our go-to-market motion to drive workload acquisition. As we look into fiscal \u201825, let me share with you what I see in the market. First, I'm excited about our opportunity to win new business. In today's digital world, customers express their business strategy through software. The software [indiscernible] strategy that one of the most important investments a company can make is in the productivity of its software developers. Consequently, customers are gravitating towards MongoDB as their next generation developer data platform standard. Second, I see stable consumption growth going into next year. Atlas consumption trends have been steady for several quarters now, and we experienced less consumption variability in fiscal \u201824 compared to fiscal \u201823. Ultimately, the main driver of Atlas consumption is the growth in the underlying application usage and we see stable usage growth across our portfolio of workloads. Third, while I strongly believe that AI will be a significant driver of long-term growth for MongoDB, we are in the early days of AI, akin to the dial-up phase of the Internet era. To put things in context, it's important to understand that there are three layers to the AI stack. The first layer is the underlying compute and LLMs. The second layer is the fine-tuning of models and building of AI applications. And the third layer is deploying and running applications that end users interact with. MongoDB's strategy is to operate at the second and third layers to enable customers to build AI applications by using their own proprietary data together with any LLM, close or open source, on any computing infrastructure. Today the vast majority of AI spend is happening in the first layer, that is investments in compute to train and run LLMs. Neither are areas in which we compete. Our enterprise customers today are still largely in the experimentation and prototyping stages of building their initial AI applications, first focus on driving efficiencies by automating existing workloads. We expect that it will take time for enterprises to deploy production workloads at scale. However, as organizations look to realize the full benefit of these AI investments, they will turn to companies like MongoDB, offering differentiated capabilities in the upper layers of the AI stack. Similar to what happened in the internet era, when value accrued over time to companies offering services and applications leveraging the built-out Internet infrastructure, platforms like MongoDB will benefit as customers build AI applications to drive meaningful operating efficiencies, create compelling customer experiences, and pursue new growth opportunities. We already see our platform resonating with innovative AI startups building exciting applications for use cases such as real-time patient diagnostics for personalized medicine, cyber threat data analysis for risk mitigation, predictive maintenance for maritime fleets, and auto-generated animations for personalized marketing campaigns. Finally, our competitive position is getting stronger. Our win rates remain very high across all competitors. We rarely compete with legacy database providers as enterprises understand that they need to move away from inefficient and brittle legacy technology. We also rarely run into niche database players since customers are overwhelmed by the proliferation of point solutions that are hard to manage and add limited value. Our main competition remains the cloud players. They offer a wide array of database options, relational and non-relational, and benefit from their size and reach. We compete well against these players due to the flexibility and scalability of our document architecture. The fact that our open platform can run anywhere and avoids lock-in and MongoDB's popularity among developers all around the world. Finally, when you look at our newer products, we see increased success competing against the established players in those markets. We find that the same principle applies as in the core database market. Customers don't want to manage a myriad of point solutions and prefer consolidating their spend with strategic vendors, especially in the current cost conscious environment. In summary, we expect the environment in fiscal \u201825 to be largely similar to the environment we experienced in fiscal \u201824. With that backdrop, let me tell you what our priorities are going to next year. First, we'll continue pressing our product advantage in the core database, since we believe customers will place an even greater premium on performance and scalability in the AI enabled world. In addition, we'll continue maturing our newer products, including additional features of Vector Search, GA of Atlas Stream Processing, and enhancements to other offerings. Second, we will remain singularly focused on new workload acquisition as the key long-term driver of our business. We will continue fine-tuning incentives to ensure that our entire go-to-market organization is focused on identifying and sourcing new workload opportunities. In addition, we will leverage our expertise and learnings from our self-serve business to use product-led growth techniques to increase the adoption of Atlas by other development teams within our existing large enterprise accounts. Third, we are focused on growing sales capacity. As we told you in the past, we were slow to grow capacity in fiscal \u201824, especially in the first half due to macro uncertainty. Given that the market is more stable now and that we remain under-penetrated compared to our opportunity, we'll increase the pace of go-to-market investments in fiscal \u201825. Fourth, we will continue investing to become a standard in more of our customer base. We intend to double the size of our strategic account program and dramatically expand our account-based marketing efforts in our largest accounts. Finally, we remain focused on locking the relational migration opportunity. To remind everyone, there are three elements to migrating an application, transforming the schema, moving the data, and rewriting the application code. Our current relational migrator offering is designed to automate large parts of the first two elements, but rewriting application code is the most manually intensive element. GenAI holds tremendous promise to meaningfully reduce the cost and time of rewriting application code. We will continue building AI capabilities into Relational Migrator, but our view is that the end solution will be a mix of products and services. This year, we are investing in a number of pilots leveraging AI for relational migrations paired with services to substantially simplify and scale the process. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries around the world are running mission-critical projects on MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of a developer data platform, including ZF, Forbes, and Swiss Federal Railways. ZF, a global technology company supplying systems for passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and industrial technology, needed a central database solution with broad functionality to support more than 300,000 commercial vehicles connected to ZF infrastructure. ZF originally began using MongoDB on-premise in 2014 and migrated to MongoDB Atlas to modernize the architecture behind its new fleet orchestration solution. The team now uses time series and online archive to reduce the overall data storage size, as well as MongoDB Atlas Search to manage indexes and Atlas Charts to display billing information. MongoDB's developer data platform enables ZF to release new features faster as innovative technologies like drones and autonomous vehicles continue to come to market. In any -- PicPay and Anywhere Real Estate are examples of customers turning to MongoDB to free up the developers' time for innovation while achieving significant cost savings. Anywhere Real Estate, a global leader in residential real estate services whose brand portfolio includes Better Homes and Gardens, Century 21, Coldwell Banker, Corcoran, ERA, Sotheby's International Realty, is leveraging MongoDB Atlas and Atlas Search to greatly enhance its search capabilities. Their previous solution was too costly and operationally burdensome to maintain. Now with Atlas Search, they can ingest data from hundreds of MLS sources, aggregate the data and provide customers with a search solution that efficiently delivers accurate and up-to-date information, saving time and lowering costs. Anywhere is also exploring the use of Atlas Vector Search to provide semantic search and GenAI features to millions of consumers. Samsung Electronics, ArcelorMittal and Citizens Bank are turning to MongoDB to marinize applications. Samsung Electronics digital appliances division transitioned from their previous MySQL database to MongoDB Atlas to manage their clients data more effectively. By leveraging MongoDB's document model, Samsung's smart home service can collect real-time data from the team's AI-powered home appliances and use it for a variety of data-driven initiatives such as training AI services. Their migration to MongoDB Atlas improved response times by more than 50% and disk read latency was reduced from 3 seconds to 18 millisecond, significantly improving availability and developer productivity. Let me wrap up by saying that I remain highly confident about our ability to execute on our long-term growth opportunity. We are pursuing one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software, with significant expansion opportunities in both new and existing customer accounts. While it's early days, we expect that AI will not only support the overall growth of the market, but also compel customers to revisit both their legacy workloads and build more ambitious applications. This will allow us to win more new and existing workloads and to ultimately continue to establish MongoDB as a standard in enterprise accounts. Before I turn it over to Michael, I would like to personally invite all of you to attend the investor session at MongoDB.localNYC to be held at the Javits Center on May 2nd. Please email ir@mongodb.com if you're interested in attending. With that, here's Michael. Thanks, Kash. I'll take the first question. In regards to when we see enterprises deploying [indiscernible] production, I think it's a combination of customers getting comfortable with the technology and also these technologies maturing from both a performance and from a cost point of view. If you played with ChatGPT or any of the other chatbots out there or large language models, you'll know that the performance of these applications, you need to get response time in the one to two to three seconds, depending on the type of question you're asking. And so naturally a chatbot is a very simple but easy to understand use case, but to embed that technology into a sophisticated application, making real-time decisions based on real-time data, the performance and to some degree, the cost of these architectures are still not there. Also, customers are still in the learning phase. They're experimenting, they're prototyping, but I would say you're not seeing a lot of customers really deploy AI applications at scale. So I think it's going to take them, I would say this year is a year where they're going to do, you know, probably roll out a few applications, learn, and then as they get more experience, become more comfortable in rolling out more and more applications as they get -- as both these technologies mature and the costs come down. We feel very good about our positioning because from an architecture point of view, the document model, the flexible schema, the ability to handle real time data, performance at scale, the unified platform, the ability to handle data, metadata, and vector data with the same query language, same semantics, et cetera, is something that makes us very, very attractive. The other thing that we're finding is unlike a typical sale where someone's deciding to either build a new workload or monetize a workload, the AI decision is more of a central decision -- centralized decision more than ever. So it allows us to actually go higher in the organization. So we're actually engaging with customers at much more senior levels because obviously this is coming down as a top down initiative. And so this allows us to position us as a very modern platform designed for these new modern use cases and workloads. So we feel good about a positioning, but as I said this year I think is going to be continued experimentation and rollout of some individual applications. Yeah, I think it's going to show up in a business when people are deploying AI apps at scale, right? So I think that's going to be at least another year. But that being said, we do see some really interesting startups who are building on top of MongoDB, so it gives us confidence about our platform fit for these sophisticated workloads. But, given all the noise around AI, you have to remember we're still in the very, very early days. The performance of some of these systems is, I would classify as okay, not great. The cost of inference is quite expensive, so people have to be quite careful about the types of applications they deploy. There's some debate about open versus closed source LLMs. Do they use case specific LLMs or more general purpose LLMs? So there's a lot of learnings going on. And obviously, there's an announcement today that yet another company had delivered better performance than GPT-4. So, people are -- there's a lot going on in this space. So, for people to really get comfortable in picking a stack and deploying workloads in mass is going to take a bit of time. There are obviously some outliers who are obviously being far more aggressive. But that's essentially what we see across our customer base. But the good news is that we feel like we're well positioned. We feel that people really resonate with a unified platform. One way to handle data, metadata and vector data, that we are open and composable, that we integrate to not only all the different LLMs, we integrate to different embedding models. And we also -- essentially also integrate with some of the emerging application frameworks that developers want to use. So we think we're well positioned and you'll see us continue to expand and broaden our reach in this category, but I do think it's going to take a little bit of time. Yeah, I touched a little bit about relational migrations. I mean, that's one way where a lot of people feel like they have a lot of data trapped in these legacy platforms. As we've shared, we've always had customers migrate from legacy SQL apps to MongoDB, But the hardest part was basically rewriting the application. Generative AI essentially lowers the cost to do so. We are running a bunch of pilots with customers. Customers are very aligned. We have access to senior level decision makers. And we're learning a lot. Obviously, we're learning about the effectiveness of some of these AI technologies. We're learning about how you have to handle old languages, old libraries, old packages, the different versions. And so the variability and all that makes it clear that this will require a mix of product and services. Product alone today will not solve the problem. So we do think this is a big opportunity, but we're in the early days. And as I said in the past, even when I talked to investors about this pre-AI, there was no big red easy button to press to kind of migrate a SQL app to MongoDB. And while GenAI makes that easier, it's still going to take a little bit of time, but it's definitely exciting and there's a lot of customers leaning in. And so, we're excited about the option, but it's a lot of work to do. Yes, we can hear you. Unfortunately, we can't hear the moderator, but we can hear you. Yes, so we announced -- as you said, we announced the private preview of Stream Processing where we ended up having hundreds of development teams use the product. Now we're in a public preview, so if customers are interested, they can actually start using the product today. Why are we in a position to win? For a couple reasons. One, this is purely focused on the developer market. The data is mainly in JSON. It requires a flexible schema and is for real-time applications. Given all those things are kind of coordinating, we feel really well positioned because most of the alternatives have a very rigid or fixed schema. And with the variability of data coming from these kind of events, that becomes much more problematic for customers to manage. So we feel very good about our position there. In terms of timing of when we're going to go GA, we're just currently getting feedback and responding to feedback. And we want to be very sure that we've addressed kind of the low-hanging fruit before we go generally available, but we're really sexcited about the opportunity that stream processing offers us. Yeah, so thanks for your question. Yes, we, given the macro uncertainty, especially coming out off Q4 of last year, we did slow down hiring quite meaningfully. And obviously that showed up in our numbers to the point that Michael talked about in our op margin as well. We obviously know that we have a big opportunity in front of us. So we are growing our headcount between the mid and high teens. We think that's appropriate relative to the opportunities we see. And yes, if we had more productive sales capacity, the guidance would probably be higher. There's no question about that. Yeah, in regards to use cases, we're seeing most customers focus on driving efficiencies in their business because their existing baseline of costs are well known. So it's much easier for them to determine how much value they can derive by using some of these new AI technologies. So I see the first wave of applications being around reducing costs. You've seen some announcements by some customers saying, focusing on things like customer support and customer service, they really have -- they have found ways to dramatically reduce their costs. That's not surprising to me. I think cogeneration and this increasing developer productivity is another area. I think those are going to be kind of two areas where there's low hanging fruit. But then I think you're going to see customers focus on delivering better experiences for their customers and then find new streams of growth. And so I think it will be common phases. And so in terms of across industries, I think it's obviously there's some constraints and some customers based on the regulated nature of their industry, but in general we see basically high interest across almost every industry that we operate in. Thank you. Sure. When we talk to customers, and remember, even at our IPO, we had a meaningful number of customers migrating off relational to MongoDB. So they tend to come in three categories of reasons why. First is that the data models become so brittle with the relational architecture that it's very hard to build new features and be responsive to their customers. And so they just feel like their ability to innovate has slowed down. The second reason is that the system is just not scaling or performing given the increased number of users or the large amount of data that they have to process, that they realize that they have to get off a legacy platform. And the third reason is just the cost of the underlying platform and relative to the ROI that application is providing. So typically falls in one of those three buckets. Sometimes customers may have all three or maybe two of the three that are driving that demand. And then there's typically some compelling event, maybe there's some milestones they want to hit, maybe there's a renewal coming up with the incumbent vendor that's driving them to potentially move off that vendor as quickly as possible. As I said, with relational migrator, there's three parts to it. There's mapping of the schema from a tabular, relational schema to a document-based schema in MongoDB. Then there's actually moving the data, mapping to the new schema, and then there's the rewriting of the application. And so we have done lots of those already pre-GenAI, and some customers take a -- I want to rewrite everything. Some customers take a, I'll do it on a microservices basis, where I'll start peeling off functionality of the existing application and move that functionality to the new application and do that over time. It really depends on the customer's use case and their business needs. And yes, with GenAI, we do expect that rewriting the application has become easier and hence lower the cost of essentially switching, which by definition then expands the amount of customers and workloads you can go after. The other, I would say, on top of the three reasons I gave you in terms of why people move, there's now an emerging fourth reason, which is enabling their data and their applications to be more AI enabled. And so it's not just moving to more modern platform, but making them more AI enabled. And so that's also something that's getting customers' interest. And to your question on timing, as I said, I think this year we're going to see a lot of pilots and people trying out these new AI capabilities. And I think as the technology improves, as we learn more, I think you're going to see that scale much more quickly after that. Yeah. Hey, Tyler. Good evening. Yeah, so first of all, I'm very committed to MongoDB. I'm very excited about the opportunity here, so I have no plans to go anywhere. Second, in regards to Snowflake and Databricks, we don't typically compete with them, right? Because they're focused on analytical workloads. We're focused on operational workloads. So those are two very different sets of use cases. The big difference in terms of how customer buy, typically data warehouses and data lakes tends to be a centralized decision, organizations standardize on one platform, and then basically move their existing data to those platforms where I would say, operational platforms tend to be a more decentralized decision where different development teams, different lines of businesses, et cetera, based on the requirements for their application, will choose, will make their own independent decisions about what they think they need to do. And we've always talked about how we start with one team and then try and expand from there, and why there's so much focus on expanding within accounts and becoming a standard within an account, because then that accelerates the amount of workloads we capture. But those are two very different kind of customer buying behaviors in terms of analytical versus operational. With regards to the potential overlap, we are embedding more analytics capabilities. We have a very sophisticated aggregation framework, so people can do real-time processing of analytics on our platform with real-time data. Remember, data lakes and data warehouses have a batch process to get that data into their platforms, so they're not dealing with the real-time data. And then with regards to Unistore, listen, there's like over 300 databases in the marketplace, so not sure, I have a lot of respect for the Snowflake people. I'm not sure, we've heard noises about Unistore for a long time, but we feel very comfortable and confident about our position just given the investments we made on our platform and the large customers we have. And frankly, the popularity of our platform with developers. And remember, developers are not a persona that these other players typically go after. They go after more the analysts and the data scientist community. We're very, very focused on developers. Thank you. Again, I thank everyone for joining us today. I just want to reiterate that we had a strong quarter and year as we executed our opportunity. We do expect fiscal \u201825 to play out similarly to fiscal \u201824 with a healthy new business and stable consumption trends. We are very excited about the long-term AI opportunity, but still believe it's early days as customers are mainly in the experimentation and prototyping stages of building AI applications. And our priorities for fiscal \u201825 are to invest in deepening our product advantage while remaining focused on acquiring new workloads and establishing ourselves as the standard for building modern applications. So thank you again for joining us and we'll talk to you soon. Take care. Bye-bye."

I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter as we continue to execute well, despite challenging market conditions. I will start by reviewing our third-quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $433 million, a 30% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 36% Year-over-Year, representing 66% of total revenue. We generated a non-GAAP operating income of $79 million for an 18% non-GAAP operating margin and we had another solid quarter of customer growth and in the quarter with over 46,400 customers. Overall, we delivered a strong Q3. We had a healthy quarter of new business acquisitions, led by continued strength in new workload acquisition within our existing customers. In addition, our Enterprise Advanced business again exceeded our expectations, demonstrating strong demand for our platform and the appeal of our run-anywhere strategy. Moving on to Atlas consumption trends, the quarter played out in line with our expectations. Michael will discuss consumption trends in more detail later. Finally, retention rates remained strong in Q3, reinforcing the mission criticality of our platform, even in a difficult spending environment. This quarter, we held our most recent global customer advisory board meeting, where customers across various geographies and industries came together to share feedback and insight about the experience using MongoDB. From these discussions, as well as our ongoing C-Suite dialog with our customers a few themes emerged. First, AI is in nearly every conversation with customers of all sizes. We're seeing great early feedback from our partnership with AWS's CodeWhisperer, the AI-powered coding companion that is now trained on MongoDB data to generate code suggestions based on MongoDB's best practices from over 15 years of history. Microsoft GitHub Copilot is also proficient at generating code suggestions that reflect best practices, enabling developers to build highly-performing applications even faster on MongoDB. And with the recent advances in Gen AI, building AI applications is no longer the sole domain of AI or ML experts, increasingly it\u2019s software developers who are being asked to build powerful AI functionality directly into their applications. We are well-positioned to help them do just that. We saw exceptional interest in our Vector Search public preview and we announced general availability yesterday. Customers are building a range of AI use cases from semantic search to retrieval augmented generation or RAG where organizations can leverage the use of their private data, to increase the accuracy of LLMs. For example, UKG, a human capital and workflows management technology serves over 80,000 plus customers around the globe chose to use MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for an AI-powered assistant that helps guide their customers employees, people managers, and HR leaders. They chose Atlas Vector Search because of its minimal added architectural complexity, flexibility to handle the rapidly changing data as applications evolve and the scale to handle large workloads. UKG is not alone. In our recent state of AI survey report by Retool, Atlas Vector Search received by far the highest net promoter score from developers compared to all other vector databases available in the market. Moreover, developers can combine Vector Search with any other query capabilities available on MongoDB, namely analytics, tech search, geospatial, and time series. This provides powerful ways of defining additional filters and vector-based queries that other solutions just cannot provide. For example, you can run complex AI enriched queries such as find pants, shirt, shoes in my size that look like the outfit in this image within the particular price range and have free shipping or find real-estate listings with houses that look like this image that were built in the last five years and/or in that area within seven miles west of Downtown Chicago with top-rated schools. Second, customers feel more pressure than ever to modernize their data infrastructure, they are aware that their legacy platforms are holding them back from building modern applications designed for an AI future. However, customers also tell us that they lack the skills and the capacity to modernize. They all want to become modern but are daunted by the challenges as they are aware it's complex -- it's a complex endeavor that involves technology, process, and people. Consequently, customers are increasingly looking to MongoDB, to help them modernize successfully. We launched Relational Migrator early this year to help customers successfully migrate data from the legacy relational databases to MongoDB. Now, we're looking beyond data migrations to the full lifecycle of application modernization. At our local London event, we unveiled a Query Converter, which uses genetic AI to analyze existing sequel queries and stored procedures and convert them to work with MongoDB's query API. Customers already use the tool successfully to convert decades-old procedures to modernize their back-end with minimal need for manual changes. While it's still early days, we're continuing to invest in the Query Converter and other AI features with the goal of significantly reducing the effort involved in monetizing legacy applications to run on MongoDB. To be clear, application modernization will take time to ramp, but as one of the largest long-term growth opportunities for our business. Third, our run-anywhere strategy continues to be a real differentiator as customers greatly appreciate the optionality that our platform provides as they manage often conflicting priorities on the way to the cloud. On one hand, the movement to the cloud continues unabated. Customers in industries and geographies were at first hesitant to move to cloud, such as financial services in Southern Europe are Now moving to the cloud with urgency to become more nimble and to reduce costs. Many of our customers find that the all-in cost of maintaining legacy workloads on-prem is higher than the cost of migrating them to the cloud. On the other hand, our largest enterprise customers tell us they are planning to maintain a meaningful on-prem footprint for the foreseeable future. The reason for keeping workloads on-prem include regulatory requirements, the desire to keep using their existing on-prem infrastructure, or the enormity of the task of migrating all their apps to cloud. In the meantime, they still want to modern data platform to deploy new and existing applications, the continued outperformance of EA business demonstrates that our customers value our ability to run anywhere and to future-proof their eventual move to the cloud by building on EA. Finally, our customers remain focused on cost management, they're looking to do more with less by consolidating vendors and reducing the complexity of the data architecture. MongoDB dramatically increases developer productivity and supports a wide variety of use cases, eliminating the need for many point solutions. This combination resonates with customers in this macro-environment. For example, Atlas search now powers the homepage of one of the most recognizable sports media brands in the world. The customer replaced an incumbent search technology with Atlas search, because they were drawn to the operational ease of running search queries alongside other queries on Atlas as well as the overall cost-savings from consolidating functionality onto a single platform. In short, customers view MongoDB as a true partner, a partner that not only accelerate the pace of innovation, but also drives them to become more efficient. We are deepening investments in our product, partnerships, and customer-facing teams to continue to enable customers to do both. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical applications on Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform. These customers include AT&T, Fishbowl by Glassdoor, and Trend Micro. AT&T selected Atlas as a key element of their modernization journey. The location match and application validates 380 million unique customer addresses and handles about 14 million transactions per day. But the various disparate data management solutions led to technical depth and there were duplicative sources of information. The company turned to Atlas as a developer data platform to simplify their data infrastructure, merged their data into a single view, and freed their teams from managing database operations. Now they rely on Atlas change streams to easily track changes with data as well as Atlas's native search capabilities and built-in geospatial functions to quickly identify location information and accelerate time-to-market for mission-critical products and services. EY, Delivery Hero, and ASAP Log are examples of customers turning to MongoDB to free up their developer's time for innovation, while achieving significant cost-savings. One of the 2023 MongoDB Innovation Award winners is EY. Ernst & Young LLP manages high volumes of transactional data and its clients and internal teams work under strict timelines to file taxes and meet regulatory deadlines. The cloud-based global VAT reporting tool or GVRT automates and digitizes the preparation of 242 different types of returns across 79 countries. EY migrated from their previous non-relational database solution to Atlas and experienced a significant performance boost, reduced cost by as much as 50% and are able to scale without limitations to handle increased data volumes, transactional loads, and concurrent user requests during peak periods. Evernorth Health Services, a division of the Cigna Group Manulife and [indiscernible] are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Manulife, one of the largest life insurance companies in the world, migrated to Atlas when it became clear that their relational database caused a drag on innovation and increased the time to bring new digital products to market. Manulife selected Atlas, because of the flexible document model speeds up development, scales easily, supports asset transactions, and offers seamless data migration. Using Atlas Device Sync, they successfully launched one critical app's offline mode to ensure uninterrupted app usage went offline or in low connectivity areas to improve mobile data synchronization. Using Atlas allows Manulife to broaden its digital capabilities and enhance the [indiscernible] of customer interactions cost-effectively. In summary, I'm pleased with our third-quarter results, our run-anywhere strategy allows customers flexibility over where they deploy and MongoDB is emerging as a platform of choice for their AI-powered applications and customers are using MongoDB to modernize and become more efficient. Before I turn it over to Michael I'm excited to share that Ann Lewnes, the former Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Vice-President of Corporate Strategy and Development at Adobe just joined MongoDB's Board of Directors, and her leadership roles at Adobe from 2006 to 2023, she was instrumental in driving Adobe's transition from a perpetual to subscription-based business model, and as experienced marketing to creative professionals, whether they are in a small agency, a medium-sized business, or very large enterprise. If you replace creative professionals with developers, this strategy is very similar to what MongoDB is doing and Ann did it at the next level of scale. Prior to Adobe, Ann held a variety of leadership positions at Intel during that 20-year tenure at the company, including Vice-President of Sales and Marketing. We're thrilled for the exceptional perspective Ann will bring to the Board. With that, here's Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dave. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the third quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results, and then finish with our outlook for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2024. First I'll start with the third-quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $433 million, up 30% year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance. As Dev mentioned, we continue to see a healthy new business environment demonstrating our product market fit and the mission criticality of our platform. Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 36% in the quarter compared to the previous year and represents 66% of total revenue compared to 63% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 63% last quarter. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely related to-end user activity of the application, which can be impacted by macroeconomic factors. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. Week-over-week consumption growth in Q3 was in line with our expectations and stronger than Q2. As a reminder, we were expecting a seasonal uptick in consumption in Q3 compared to Q2 based on what we've experienced and shared with you last year. We had forecasted that seasonal improvement to be less pronounced this year compared to last year. Given that overall, we've seen less consumption variability this year and that is exactly how the quarter played out. Turning to non-Atlas revenues, EA exceeded our expectations in the quarter as we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing EA customer base. Ongoing EA strength speaks to the appeal and the success of our run-anywhere strategy. The EA revenue outperformance was in part a result of more multiyear deals than we had expected. As a reminder, the term license component for multiyear deals is recognized as upfront revenue at the start of the contract and therefore includes term license revenues from future years. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,400 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 46,400, which is up from over 39,100 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count over 6,900 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 5,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 44,900 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 37,600 customers in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. During the quarter, we moved approximately 350 accounts, representing negligible ARR. Out of our self-serve customer count because they're better classified as subsidiaries of other customers or they are now users of our free tier. Taking that into account our self-serve net additions and overall net additions remain consistent with our historic healthy trends. In terms of our direct sales, net additions, new sales activity remains healthy. Our reported direct sales net-adds continue to reflect the dynamics we discussed last quarter related to leveraging cloud provider marketplaces to fulfill new direct sales, customer additions and the movement of some small mid-market direct sales accounts to self-serve. Moving onto ARR, we had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%, we ended the quarter with 1,972 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,545 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $335.3 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is up from 74% in the year-ago period. Our year-over-year margin improvement is primarily driven by improved efficiencies that we're realizing in Atlas. Our income from operations was $78.5 million or an 18% operating margin for the third quarter compared to a 6% margin in the year-ago period. Our strong bottom-line results demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our model and are a clear indication of the strength in our underlying unit economics. The primary reason for our operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. In addition, our operating income benefited from the timing of new hires. Finally, Q3 benefited from the timing of marketing programs, internal events, and other expenses, which we now expect to incur in Q4. Net income in the third quarter was $79.1 million or $0.96 per share, based on 82.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $18.7 million or $0.23 per share on 80.4 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter was $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $38.4 million, after taking into consideration, approximately $3.5 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities free cash flow was $35 million in the quarter. This compares to a negative free cash flow of $8.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal year 2024. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $429 million to $433 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $35 million to $38 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.46 based on $83.2 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-year fiscal 2024, we are increasing our outlook across the board. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $1.654 billion to $1.658 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $236.3 million to $239.3 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $2.89 to $2.91 based on $82.5 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2024 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some context on our guidance. First, we expect Q4 Atlas consumption growth to be impacted by the seasonal slowdown around the holidays. Second, as you think about both the sequential and year-over-year revenue growth of Atlas in Q4, keep in mind that in Q4 last year, we had several million dollars more of revenue coming from unused commitments, which we do not expect to occur this quarter. Third; as a result of our strong execution so far this year, we are again raising our non-Atlas revenue expectations for Q4. However, we expect that our non-Atlas revenues will decline sequentially, Q4 versus Q3. This is different from our normal pattern as we usually see a seasonal uptick in Q4 due to greater renewal activity. The reason for the sequential decline this year is because of the strength we've seen in Q3, including the benefit of multiyear EA deals. Finally, thanks to the strong performance in Q3, and increased revenue outlook again, we're again increasing our assumption for operating margins in fiscal 2024 to 14% at the midpoint of our guidance, an improvement of more than 900 basis points compared to fiscal 2023. Our significant margin improvement this year is primarily driven by our revenue outperformance and the fact that we didn't increase our pace of investment as the revenue outlook improved until relatively late in the year. As a result, we achieved greater margin expansion this year than we think is desirable in the short term given the long-term market opportunity ahead of us. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent third-quarter results in a difficult environment, we're pleased with our ability to win new business and are demonstrating the operating leverage inherent in our model, while we will continue to monitor the macro-environment we remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead and we'll continue to invest responsibly to maximize our long-term value. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions, operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the results in Q3. When we look at the Atlas growth this quarter, Michael, I know you mentioned that -- that the consumption trends were better than expectations, in terms of the seasonality that you were anticipating what has shown up in the business for the past two years, was that more pronounced than you expected, or did that come in below in terms of the seasonal uplift that you've seen in Q3.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, so just to clarify Q3 for Atlas came in line with our expectations. We had seen and called out last year seasonal -- seasonality for Q3. We had expected that and incorporated that into our forecast. What we have seen is less variability over the course of the year and so, we assume that Q3 seasonality would be more muted this year and that's exactly what happened and how the quarter played out.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. Thank you, Michael, for the clarification. And then, Dev I guess a much bigger-picture question, it's -- I think the company was started in 2007, so it's about 17 years into the journey. And if you compare that to some of the large and competitive players in the space like an Oracle, around this time 17 to kind of 20 years, they started to move away from like the data management database space and into like the application software market. Is that a vision, particularly as we are in the dawn of the e-compute cycle with AI, is that an analogy that applies to Mongo in terms of its long-term roadmap in your view?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, thanks for your question Sanjit, what I would say is we've been very clear that we're really pushing our developer data platform strategy and we think the market is way larger today than it was for Oracle, when they were essentially 17 years old and our developer data platform strategy is really very simply enabling developers to use MongoDB for a wide variety of use cases across a wide variety of deployment models, whether it's on-prem, on the cloud, multi-cloud or even at the Edge. And so that's really our strategy. We don't see any need to get into quote-unquote the application space itself. And we think that we have a lot of runway ahead of us.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate it. Thanks, Dev. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Sanjit.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Congrats from me as well. I wanted to ask on EA first. Another very strong quarter there, can you talk a little bit more on the drivers here, because I do seem to remember you kind of double down on sales capacity I think it was [indiscernible] guide that you wanted to put on existing accounts, is that kind of a main driver or is it more like modernization or kind of picking up a lot more than what we thought would be possible. Can you speak to that, because it's like the second quarter and early where we kind of have better numbers and I have one follow-up for Michael.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah, Raimo. With regards to our EA outperformance, I think it really speaks to our run-anywhere strategy where customers really value the ability to build on MongoDB and essentially future-proof their deployment model, whether they stay on-prem or to move to the cloud or move from one cloud to another cloud and the fact that they can do that without having to rewrite the application is very compelling for customers. As you also said, a lot of customers still, especially the largest customer, still have a lot of sunk costs and they want to leverage that -- their existing data infrastructure. So, lot of customers have told us that they will still deploy infrastructure on-prem for the foreseeable future, but what -- but by building on MongoDB, they get the benefits of a modern platform and the optionality to also move to cloud when they're ready to do so.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, the other thing which I know you know, Raimo, but just for the broader audience, we run the business on a channel basis, sales isn't oriented around products and then also, as we've said before, EA tends to be -- the additional sales of EA tend to be to existing customers, we don't tend to land a ton of new brand-new customers on EA.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. And then the follow-up is more, it's around AI, so, if I look at the demos that you guys have on Vector Search and how Search is getting a lot better, that seems very compelling and it seems like really straightforward for a client to improve their customer experience they use it for a customer [indiscernible] up for example, what is the -- what are the implications for gross margins for you Michael like, do you have to do a lot more compute here to be able to handle it. How should we think about that in terms of extra revenue, but also extra costs coming through? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So I think it's a little too early to tell, there's obviously plenty of variability in the workloads depending on the nature of what the underlying application is. So, I think it's a little early to give a strong direction to that. I think more broadly on margins, we've certainly been very happy with the margin progress that we've made I referenced, continued efficiencies that we're driving in Atlas. Atlas is roughly two-thirds of the business, so as that continues to increase Atlas still is lower-margin overall. And so that will have some impact over the next several years. But we're really pleased on the margin front, but I think too early to make a specific call or quantification on the gross margin impact of AI.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. And Raimo, just to add to that. One of the announcements we also made was that we can now do workload isolation. So, for Search or Vector Search functionality you can scale those nodes independently of the overall cluster. So, what that really does is allow customers to really configure those clusters to have the right level of performance at the most efficient cost. So, we've been very sensitive to making sure that based on the different use cases you can scale up and down different nodes based on your application needs, by definition that will be a very compelling value proposition for customers.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead of UBS. Your line is open.\nKarl Keirstead: Great, thanks. Maybe I'll direct this question to Dev. Dev, I think a lot of people on the line are hearing this refrain about Customer's enterprises wanting to get their data states in order in advance of moving forward on AI initiatives and you even spoke about customers feeling pressure to modernize their data infrastructure. I'd just like to ask, where we are in that journey Is this. Is this a conversation that your sales teams are having or do you feel like this is actually beginning to result in deals and revenue pull-through and if it isn't yet roughly, when do you think that might start to translate to an actual revenue lift?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So I'll make a couple of points. Karl, you're absolutely right, there is a lot of focus on data because with AI, data in some ways becomes the new code, you can train your models with your proprietary data that allows you to really drive much more value and build smarter applications. Now, the key thing is that it's operational data because with applications, this data is always constantly being updated and for many customers, most of those applications are right now running on legacy platforms, so that operational data is trapped in those legacy platforms. And you can really do a batch process of e-tailing all that data into some sort of warehouse and then still be able to leverage the real-time use of that data. That's why customers are now much more interested in potentially modernizing legacy platforms than they ever have before. I would say, Karl, to your second part of your question, I would say it's still very, very early days. We definitely believe that this will be one of the largest long-term opportunities for our business, but we're in the very early days and as I've said in the past, there is a risk of overestimating the impact of the short-term but underestimating the impact long-term, we definitely think this is a long-term impact.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. And if I could ask a follow-up to Mike on a different subject. Mike, you had talked on the last call a little bit more about this mix-shift away from multi-year Atlas commits and you were pointing to that as a reason for some of your metrics like DR and I think even cash flow to come under a little pressure. This quarter I see DR is still under pressure, cash flow was a little bit better, can you maybe revisit that phenomenon and describe how it's impacting some of these metrics?\nMichael Gordon: Yes, a couple of things. As we've said from the beginning. Some of those like calculated billings are deferred revenue metrics aren't super helpful or don't provide a ton of insight in terms of how we run the business. We've also talked about how over the last couple of years, one of the things we've been trying to do is reduce friction for the sales force. Some of that includes reducing the emphasis around upfront commitments. And so that helps accelerate you know lending new workloads and things like that and that will flow through or does flow through the financial statements as less upfront deferred and things like that. And so -- but allows us to sort of synthetically cover more ground from a salesforce perspective. And so you do see that, continue to go through, we shared the statistics last quarter that Atlas revenue growth last quarter was 38%, but dollars of committed Atlas declined 15% year-over-year, just as one way to try and help dimensionalize it, we also talked, I think, earlier in the year about how roughly 80% of Atlas doesn't flow-through deferred and so I think all of those data points help kind of lineup to explain the rest of what you're seeing and why that's not sort of helpful forward-looking metrics like it might be in other companies. It doesn't kind of give you the insight that maybe people are used to or hope that it will provide.\nKarl Keirstead: Yes. That's clear. Thanks a lot.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Karl.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great, thanks very much, Michael, maybe following up on that last question in your commentary. At what point should DR stop being a headwind from a financial perspective, when should it stabilize or is this a multi-year trend as you kind of bleed it down?\nMichael Gordon: So I'd say there are a couple of things, obviously it's not something we guide to, it's not a key thing that we focus on, but I think the trends will be. You've got sort of two factors, one is overall Atlas mix, right, and so to the extent that Atlas continues to grow, that will provide a headwind on this dynamic. And then similarly, even within the current Atlas footprint, there's this historic commitments that we need to run-through renewal cycles and everything else and so I think this will take a little while still to play out.\nBrad Reback: Great. And then switching gears. Dev, as customers begin to trial -- excuse me, some of these Copilot code tools, we'll say, what type of feedback have you gotten from them as it relates to the pace with which they've been able to reduce net new workload time-to-market. How much faster or efficient are customers getting using these tools?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. We get different answers from different customers, really depends on which tool, they're using without commenting on who is better or who is worst, we definitely see a difference in the quality of the output between different tools. I think it's going to take some time for these tools to mature. So I think we're seeing a lot of customers do a lot of testing and prototyping. I would also tell you that doing a lot of this on internal facing applications, because there's still lots of questions about IP rights and what is potentially copyright-able then ultimately licensable, they offer this as a shrink-wrap software or service to their end-customers. So, we're seeing more of this work on internally facing applications. But the productivity gains, really do vary by tool and also very -- do vary by the sophistication of the app being built. So, it's hard for me to give you a real number. I know there are people out there to toating 30% or 40% improvements. But it really depends on the customer, and the use-case and the tool that they're trying to use. It'd be hard for me to give you a specific number.\nBrad Reback: Okay, thanks very much.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Yes, thanks for taking the question. So, earlier this quarter, you hired Mark Porter's replacement, Jim Scharf from AWS, a lot of experience in the database industry. Can you just talk about some of his priorities, what you're kind of accelerating in terms of the product roadmap to sell to larger enterprises?\nMichael Gordon: Yes, so for those people who don't know Jim's background, he spent about 17 years at AWS. He had a variety of roles but last two meaningful roles was he ran the Dynamo business at AWS which is AWS's fastest-growing and largest non-relational database business. And then he ultimately then took over that identity access management business, which if you think about it, every AWS customer has to use as a service that has to not only perform but perform at massive scale. The fact EV has dealt and built two mission-critical services for AWS was very appealing to us given our ambitions to kind of the level of scale that we expect our business ultimately get to at some point in time. He, obviously, brings us very strong technical DNA, he obviously has a lot of network of relationships in the industry. So, we expect him to help us grow the team around the world leveraging his relationships and in terms of priorities. I mean, right now, he still kind of really assessing the current state of the business. He has been quite impressed with the quality of talent that we have. But he is really kind of what I have encouraged him to do is we need to go slow to go fast to take his time in terms of really understanding the business, understanding the team, understanding the code base before he starts really prioritizing what to do and it's not like there's some things massively broken, it's really helping us set-up to scale to the next level.\nTyler Radke: Great. And a follow-up for Michael. I know you talked about how Atlas consumption during Q3 was in line with your expectations. I'm just curious, given there were a lot of volatility in at least the equity markets and the economy, did it -- was there any more variability within the quarter, in other words, did it start weaker and stronger and then I'm just curious throughout the month of November, have things kind of further improved ahead of the holiday seasonality? Just any additional color would be helpful. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So it like you said, Q3 Atlas results were in line with our expectations there was a seasonal benefit to Q3 relative to Q2. But given the fact that we've seen less variability in consumption in fiscal 2024, we had expected that to be smaller than it was in fiscal 2023 and that's exactly how it played out. The seasonal improvement, as it relates to Q3 is a little bit more in the back-half of the of the -- of the quarter. As it relates to Q4, typically the back half is weaker, given the holiday slowdown and I hope that helps people understand a little bit.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Hey, thank you very much, Dev and Michael. Happy holidays. Congrats on the results. So, going into calendar 2024, how does the management team feel relative to going into calendar 2023 with respect to how macro conditions are no longer impacting or maybe they are impacting some aspects of the business, any verticals that stand-out that you feel particularly excited about? So just wanted to understand how MongoDB is therefore fitting into customer priorities as you get into 2024. Thank you so much.\nDev Ittycheria: Hey, Kash. Thanks for the question. I think compared from last year, this year we don't see things getting worse, but we don't see things getting better. Where I said, last year with the Fed raising rates, you could really sense that people are getting much more cautious and there was probably more negativity in terms of the outlook coming into calendar 2023. So, that being said, we definitely see innovation, being a priority for customers. We clearly are. I would say the distinction between must-to-have and nice-to-have clearly, in the first category. But customers are also, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks remain focused on being sensitive to costs and ensuring that any investments that may have a high ROI. So we feel that we're well-positioned in terms of use cases or segments. I would say in general there is no real kind of material change in any across any vertical industry or geography. We do see. I mean we were at Reinvent last week and we had an amazing set of conversations with lots of senior-level customers. I think we're really viewed as a mission-critical platform by all our customers, and I think people view us as a platform that they can bet on long-term. And so we see less I would say focus on like point solutions and more about like trying to leverage MongoDB for more and more use cases and I would say that's pretty consistent across industries and geographies.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, the only other thing I'd add Kash is clearly, things have stabilized, we are not guiding fiscal 2025. But just looking out there is clearly a difficult EA and non-EA compare that people should sort of keep in mind, and. I think the big assumption or the big determinant will be people's macro outlook in terms of how that affects the fiscal 2025 numbers. But those are probably the key things to keep in mind.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Hey guys, nice numbers. Michael, I wanted to go back to one of the comments in your prepared remarks. I think you've talked about how you expect non-Atlas business to be down quarter-over-quarter in the fourth-quarter, because I think the third-quarter had multiple multiyear deals, correct me if I've got this wrong. I guess my question is, why would that affect 4Q unless there was a pull-forward also not just multi-years, is there a pull-forward element from 4Q into 3Q in your non-Atlas business?\nMichael Gordon: No, it's not about a pull-forward. It's just when you take into account the 606 impact of a multi-year deal, you wind up recognizing a lot of upfront license revenue. And so when you think about what that means on a sequential basis, you see the difference in the delta there.\nIttai Kidron: Got it, helpful and then, therefore --\nMichael Gordon: I think the only other thing, Ittai, just for people is, given the strength that we've seen of EA throughout the year, but including Q3 we effectively raised our outlook, if you will in Q4, in part given the strength of EA. Even though we don't guide to product, Atlas is in line with our expectations. EA outperformed in Q3. And our full-year raise was more than the beat in Q3 and I think that shows that kind of continued strength of EA.\nIttai Kidron: Got it, helpful. And then, Dev, on Vector Search, I know this is kind of fresh out of the oven here, but maybe you can talk about the opportunity here on a per-customer basis. How do we think about the dollar potential here and is there one common vendor out there that you expect to see more in competition for those types of use cases?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so let me start with the second question first. I would say that I think six to nine months ago, there was a lot of interest in vector databases and there were some point solutions that got a lot of name recognition and a lot of people wondering is there a risk that could be disrupted by them. And at that point in time, we've made it clear that we believed vectors were really another form of an index and that every database platform would ultimately incorporate vectors into their architecture and the winner really would be the technology that made the vector functionality very integrated and cohesive as part of the development workflow. I would I would argue that that's really played out. As I've said in the prepared remarks, there was a recent analysis done by a consultancy firm called Retool that really spoke to lots of customers and we came out on top in terms of NPS and by the way, our product is a preview product, it wasn't even the GA product. We've seen a lot of demand from customers and we feel like this is a big, big opportunity. Again, it's early days, it's going to take time to materialize, but this is again one of the other big growth opportunities for our business. That being said, in terms of the revenue opportunity, it is really hard to quantify now because the use cases that customers are starting with are still kind of, I would say, early in development, so because people are still playing around with the technology. But we are seeing you know as I mentioned, UKG, is using it to essentially provide a AI-powered assistance for its people, you know one energy -- European energy company is using -- has terabytes of geospatial data and is using vectors to basically get better insights in terms of the images that they're getting from the work they're doing in terms of drilling for oil. So, it's still very, very, early days. So, hard to give you like an exact number, even today even in our general non-AI workloads, the workload variety can vary a lot depending on the customer, the number of users, the amount of data. So, I think it's going to be similar to our core business, which is that just really depends on the use case.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thanks so much. Wanted to ask a question around the customer count, greater than 100K, it looks like a real nice result this quarter. Is there any change going on there in terms of the trajectory or the path for customers to get to that level. In other words, are they starting bigger, are they landing bigger or are they just getting to that point faster and what would be driving those two things?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, I'm glad you called that out, Brad. Yeah, we're -- I think we added 117 100K customers this quarter, which is the largest add. I think in the company's history. What I think it really speaks to is that customers are increasingly viewing MongoDB as a mission-critical platform. They're going to run more and more workloads on MongoDB. So, by definition, it's rare that one workload on its own will drive that kind of revenue. So, the multiple workloads and really dealing us as a standard part of their infrastructure stack is what's really driving that number. And we're obviously happy to see the results of that and we think that that's just indication, as I said earlier, where people are consolidating onto a few vendors. They recognize that we offer support for a broad set of use cases, we're truly a general-purpose mission-critical platform and that their developers really love using MongoDB.\nBrad Sills: Wonderful to hear. And then one more if I may please. On the commentary around customers viewing Mongo as that platform with some of these newer workloads besides Search like relational migrator, Atlas streaming, do you -- are you finding that receptivity for customers who want to run Search within you know one single solution, is that also the case for streaming and relational, just trying to get a sense for those cycles and how those might ramp on that platform capability. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so. Actually, yeah, one of the reasons we actually built Search is because we got feedback from our customers in many Instances lot of our customers were dual-homing data to MongoDB and to some sort of search database. So consequently, now that they had to manage two databases, keep that data in sync, but also manage the plumbing, the connected those two database platforms and customers told us [indiscernible] like, we don't understand why you're not offering a solution, because we much rather have it all in one platform with one API and that ultimately drove our desire to build-out our search functionality, which is really becoming more-and-more popular. So, the point for customers is that, if you can remove friction in terms of how they can use the platform, leverage the platform, have one set of kind of semantics In terms of -- to address a broad set of use cases, it really simplifies the data architecture and the more you simplify data architecture, the more nimble, you can be and the more cost-effective you can be, and I think that's what's really resonating with customers.\nBrad Sills: Thanks so much, Dev.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria of RBC. Your line is open.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful, thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe I want to start by diving a little bit into relational migrator, Dev, I know you said it definitely early days, but where you are seeing usage of it, maybe can you give us a little bit of color, what sort of workloads are these customers are utilizing the tool for, what is kind of that timeline look like; any color you can give there in terms of early adoption would be really helpful and then I've got a quick follow-up.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so -- again, as you can imagine, given the lot of these legacy platforms have been around four between 30 to 40 years. Lot of people have large repository of legacy apps and migrating off a legacy platform to another platform does require some work, it requires essentially three things; one, you have to map the scheme of the old platform onto the new platform, you then have to map move the data and then you have to rewrite the application code. And those three things took some time. So, we heard feedback. When we took the company public, you might remember that 30% of our net new business at the time we went public was actually relational migration. So customers were undertaking that heavy lifting because they were in such pain and wanted to move to a more modern platform. But clearly, that pain can basically be a bit of a tax on switching costs. And so essentially rebuilt tooling based on feedback from customers to start automating the schema mapping and the data movement. Now, with the availability of Gen AI. You can also now start automating the code generation associated with rebuilding or rebuilding an application and essentially what rather than thing, but just moving the app in one last step, we can actually break down a monolithic relational app into microservices and start cleaning off different parts of the services first. So it can be a much more efficient and also more ROI, quicker ROI and some of the investments we're making. So, there is a big, big opportunity here for us to do that, but again I want to be very clear, we view this as a long-term growth opportunity. We're still in the very early days. We've got some really interested customers who are doing some interesting things and working with us on pilots. Our engineering and product and field teams are really focused on this, but we are in the very, very early days of really automating relational migrated to the next level leveraging Gen AI.\nRishi Jaluria: All right, wonderful. That's really helpful. And then I wanted to ask about MongoDB Serverless. I know this is something you've kind of had at least been talking about for a while, given a lot of the concerns around cloud optimization and rationalization, customers overpaying, and having to figure out how to optimize our footprint. It feels like that could be a natural tailwind for MongoDB Serverless especially because you were early to embrace it, can you talk a little bit about what you're -- what you're seeing in terms of adoption there? How we should be thinking about that opportunity and maybe just kind of what this could look like over the next several years in terms of service adoption versus traditional consumption adoption in Atlas. Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so just to be clear, when we talk about serverless, basically what customers think about is that they don't have to start thinking about capacity planning that the workload can scale-up and scale-down based on the needs of whatever the use cases and what the compute and other resource needs are, and so there's been a lot of interest from customers. At first stage, there was a lot of the similar workloads, where they didn't want to go provision a dedicated cluster. They wanted to be able to leverage our serverless functionality, we think long-term that almost every workload will become serverless because over time that'll be the way most applications are provisioned. But we're in the early days and the receptivity and use of our serverless functionality has been very high. And you're right, it's -- for those legacy platforms that they can offer similar solutions MongoDB becomes that much more attractive because a development team and architecture team doesn't have to worry about capacity planning, they can just build the app and they know the background our infrastructure can scale-up and down as their usage -- as the usage -- as the usage goes up and down.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Brent Bracelin, your line is open.\nHannah Rudoff: Hi guys, this is Hannah on for Brent. Thanks for taking my question. Just one from me. The Subscription gross margins remained above 80% for the second straight quarter, even with that continued mix-shift to Atlas. I know you mentioned efficiency improvement to Atlas, but are we at a structural point, Michael, where the scale of gross margins can remain at that 80% plus range into the next year?\nMichael Gordon: Yes, so what I would say is, I do not think -- I think if you think about it, Atlas gross margins continue to be lower than Enterprise Advanced gross margins, and while we're very pleased with that 80% margin performance on a subscription margin basis in Q3, Atlas is quote-unquote only two-thirds and so there is still a delta between the two and so I think that that will have a slightly dilutive effect on margins as Atlas increases as a percent of overall revenue.\nHannah Rudoff: Okay, it makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville of Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nJoe Vandrick: Hi, this is Joe Vandrick on for Patrick Coleville. As of 3Q, it looks like about 29% of direct sales customers are spending over 100K on the platform. Just curious where you think that percentage can trend over the longer term and kind of how big the opportunity is within these existing direct sales customer accounts. Thanks.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, Joe. I would say that we still believe that we have a very small percentage of wallet share in most accounts. And so, obviously the smaller customer the bigger the wallet share. But in most direct sales customers, our percent of wallet share is still quite small. So we see a big opportunity there and as we talked about in terms of our new business, a big part of our new business came from acquiring new workloads with existing customers. And that is a big focus for our go-to-market teams and the runway is quite long for that trend to continue.\nJoe Vandrick: Great and just one more for me. I mean, you kind of touched on this but what's the feedback been from those customers who have used Vector Search in preview, and then obviously with Vector Search comes quite a bit more data. So, how are you making sure that customers don't receive a surprise bill and end up unhappy?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so, as we mentioned earlier the feedback on our Vector Search has been very-high, even when it was in public preview, we're getting a lot of feedback and then we saw this report that came out, obviously, we don't talk to people who are using alternatives, we just talk focus on our own customers, but it was -- we're pleased to see that out of all the products available in the marketplace, our own preview product had the highest NPS score. So then if you unpack that. Why do customers like using MongoDB, because it is one tightly integrated solution, you can tightly integrate capturing Vector data, metadata, and then data regarding a particular use case and that becomes very, very attractive, it just becomes much more seamless and easier to use versus either using point solutions or some kludgy solution that's been put together. So, I think that's a big reason about how we remove friction from a developers workflow and why the MongoDB approach makes it so much better to use instead of any other alternative approach. In terms of your question around the amount of data and data bills, obviously vectors can be memory intensive and the amount of vectors you generate will obviously drive the amount of usage on those nodes, that's one of the reasons we also introduced dedicated search knows. So you can asymmetrically scale particular nodes of your application especially Search nodes without having to increase the overall size of your cluster. So you're not -- to your point, shocked with a big bill for underlying usage -- for non-usage, right. So, you only scale to nodes that are really -- need that incremental compute and memory versus nodes that don't and that becomes a much more cost-effective way for people to do this and obviously that's another differentiator for MongoDB.\nJoe Vandrick: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. So, that is all the time that we have today for today's conference, I would turn the call-back over to Dev Ittycheria, CEO for any closing remarks.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you. I appreciate everyone joining the call today. Again. I just want to reiterate that we had another strong quarter of new business performance, validating the value proposition of our developer data platform and our run-anywhere strategy. We're seeing strong momentum on our AI strategy, especially Atlas Vector Search, which is emerging as a best-in-class solution for building powerful AI applications. And we continue to help customers drive greater efficiency, while also accelerating our pace of innovation. So with that. I appreciate your time and we'll talk to you soon. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating, you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the third quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results, and then finish with our outlook for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2024. First I'll start with the third-quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $433 million, up 30% year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance. As Dev mentioned, we continue to see a healthy new business environment demonstrating our product market fit and the mission criticality of our platform. Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 36% in the quarter compared to the previous year and represents 66% of total revenue compared to 63% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 63% last quarter. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely related to-end user activity of the application, which can be impacted by macroeconomic factors. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. Week-over-week consumption growth in Q3 was in line with our expectations and stronger than Q2. As a reminder, we were expecting a seasonal uptick in consumption in Q3 compared to Q2 based on what we've experienced and shared with you last year. We had forecasted that seasonal improvement to be less pronounced this year compared to last year. Given that overall, we've seen less consumption variability this year and that is exactly how the quarter played out. Turning to non-Atlas revenues, EA exceeded our expectations in the quarter as we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing EA customer base. Ongoing EA strength speaks to the appeal and the success of our run-anywhere strategy. The EA revenue outperformance was in part a result of more multiyear deals than we had expected. As a reminder, the term license component for multiyear deals is recognized as upfront revenue at the start of the contract and therefore includes term license revenues from future years. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,400 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 46,400, which is up from over 39,100 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count over 6,900 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 5,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 44,900 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 37,600 customers in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. During the quarter, we moved approximately 350 accounts, representing negligible ARR. Out of our self-serve customer count because they're better classified as subsidiaries of other customers or they are now users of our free tier. Taking that into account our self-serve net additions and overall net additions remain consistent with our historic healthy trends. In terms of our direct sales, net additions, new sales activity remains healthy. Our reported direct sales net-adds continue to reflect the dynamics we discussed last quarter related to leveraging cloud provider marketplaces to fulfill new direct sales, customer additions and the movement of some small mid-market direct sales accounts to self-serve. Moving onto ARR, we had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%, we ended the quarter with 1,972 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,545 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $335.3 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is up from 74% in the year-ago period. Our year-over-year margin improvement is primarily driven by improved efficiencies that we're realizing in Atlas. Our income from operations was $78.5 million or an 18% operating margin for the third quarter compared to a 6% margin in the year-ago period. Our strong bottom-line results demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our model and are a clear indication of the strength in our underlying unit economics. The primary reason for our operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. In addition, our operating income benefited from the timing of new hires. Finally, Q3 benefited from the timing of marketing programs, internal events, and other expenses, which we now expect to incur in Q4. Net income in the third quarter was $79.1 million or $0.96 per share, based on 82.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $18.7 million or $0.23 per share on 80.4 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter was $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $38.4 million, after taking into consideration, approximately $3.5 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities free cash flow was $35 million in the quarter. This compares to a negative free cash flow of $8.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal year 2024. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $429 million to $433 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $35 million to $38 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.46 based on $83.2 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-year fiscal 2024, we are increasing our outlook across the board. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $1.654 billion to $1.658 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $236.3 million to $239.3 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $2.89 to $2.91 based on $82.5 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2024 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some context on our guidance. First, we expect Q4 Atlas consumption growth to be impacted by the seasonal slowdown around the holidays. Second, as you think about both the sequential and year-over-year revenue growth of Atlas in Q4, keep in mind that in Q4 last year, we had several million dollars more of revenue coming from unused commitments, which we do not expect to occur this quarter. Third; as a result of our strong execution so far this year, we are again raising our non-Atlas revenue expectations for Q4. However, we expect that our non-Atlas revenues will decline sequentially, Q4 versus Q3. This is different from our normal pattern as we usually see a seasonal uptick in Q4 due to greater renewal activity. The reason for the sequential decline this year is because of the strength we've seen in Q3, including the benefit of multiyear EA deals. Finally, thanks to the strong performance in Q3, and increased revenue outlook again, we're again increasing our assumption for operating margins in fiscal 2024 to 14% at the midpoint of our guidance, an improvement of more than 900 basis points compared to fiscal 2023. Our significant margin improvement this year is primarily driven by our revenue outperformance and the fact that we didn't increase our pace of investment as the revenue outlook improved until relatively late in the year. As a result, we achieved greater margin expansion this year than we think is desirable in the short term given the long-term market opportunity ahead of us. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent third-quarter results in a difficult environment, we're pleased with our ability to win new business and are demonstrating the operating leverage inherent in our model, while we will continue to monitor the macro-environment we remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead and we'll continue to invest responsibly to maximize our long-term value. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions, operator. Yes, so just to clarify Q3 for Atlas came in line with our expectations. We had seen and called out last year seasonal -- seasonality for Q3. We had expected that and incorporated that into our forecast. What we have seen is less variability over the course of the year and so, we assume that Q3 seasonality would be more muted this year and that's exactly what happened and how the quarter played out. Yeah, the other thing which I know you know, Raimo, but just for the broader audience, we run the business on a channel basis, sales isn't oriented around products and then also, as we've said before, EA tends to be -- the additional sales of EA tend to be to existing customers, we don't tend to land a ton of new brand-new customers on EA. Yes. So I think it's a little too early to tell, there's obviously plenty of variability in the workloads depending on the nature of what the underlying application is. So, I think it's a little early to give a strong direction to that. I think more broadly on margins, we've certainly been very happy with the margin progress that we've made I referenced, continued efficiencies that we're driving in Atlas. Atlas is roughly two-thirds of the business, so as that continues to increase Atlas still is lower-margin overall. And so that will have some impact over the next several years. But we're really pleased on the margin front, but I think too early to make a specific call or quantification on the gross margin impact of AI. Yes, a couple of things. As we've said from the beginning. Some of those like calculated billings are deferred revenue metrics aren't super helpful or don't provide a ton of insight in terms of how we run the business. We've also talked about how over the last couple of years, one of the things we've been trying to do is reduce friction for the sales force. Some of that includes reducing the emphasis around upfront commitments. And so that helps accelerate you know lending new workloads and things like that and that will flow through or does flow through the financial statements as less upfront deferred and things like that. And so -- but allows us to sort of synthetically cover more ground from a salesforce perspective. And so you do see that, continue to go through, we shared the statistics last quarter that Atlas revenue growth last quarter was 38%, but dollars of committed Atlas declined 15% year-over-year, just as one way to try and help dimensionalize it, we also talked, I think, earlier in the year about how roughly 80% of Atlas doesn't flow-through deferred and so I think all of those data points help kind of lineup to explain the rest of what you're seeing and why that's not sort of helpful forward-looking metrics like it might be in other companies. It doesn't kind of give you the insight that maybe people are used to or hope that it will provide. Thanks, Karl. So I'd say there are a couple of things, obviously it's not something we guide to, it's not a key thing that we focus on, but I think the trends will be. You've got sort of two factors, one is overall Atlas mix, right, and so to the extent that Atlas continues to grow, that will provide a headwind on this dynamic. And then similarly, even within the current Atlas footprint, there's this historic commitments that we need to run-through renewal cycles and everything else and so I think this will take a little while still to play out. Thanks, Brad. Yes, so for those people who don't know Jim's background, he spent about 17 years at AWS. He had a variety of roles but last two meaningful roles was he ran the Dynamo business at AWS which is AWS's fastest-growing and largest non-relational database business. And then he ultimately then took over that identity access management business, which if you think about it, every AWS customer has to use as a service that has to not only perform but perform at massive scale. The fact EV has dealt and built two mission-critical services for AWS was very appealing to us given our ambitions to kind of the level of scale that we expect our business ultimately get to at some point in time. He, obviously, brings us very strong technical DNA, he obviously has a lot of network of relationships in the industry. So, we expect him to help us grow the team around the world leveraging his relationships and in terms of priorities. I mean, right now, he still kind of really assessing the current state of the business. He has been quite impressed with the quality of talent that we have. But he is really kind of what I have encouraged him to do is we need to go slow to go fast to take his time in terms of really understanding the business, understanding the team, understanding the code base before he starts really prioritizing what to do and it's not like there's some things massively broken, it's really helping us set-up to scale to the next level. Yes, the only other thing I'd add Kash is clearly, things have stabilized, we are not guiding fiscal 2025. But just looking out there is clearly a difficult EA and non-EA compare that people should sort of keep in mind, and. I think the big assumption or the big determinant will be people's macro outlook in terms of how that affects the fiscal 2025 numbers. But those are probably the key things to keep in mind. No, it's not about a pull-forward. It's just when you take into account the 606 impact of a multi-year deal, you wind up recognizing a lot of upfront license revenue. And so when you think about what that means on a sequential basis, you see the difference in the delta there. I think the only other thing, Ittai, just for people is, given the strength that we've seen of EA throughout the year, but including Q3 we effectively raised our outlook, if you will in Q4, in part given the strength of EA. Even though we don't guide to product, Atlas is in line with our expectations. EA outperformed in Q3. And our full-year raise was more than the beat in Q3 and I think that shows that kind of continued strength of EA. Yes, so what I would say is, I do not think -- I think if you think about it, Atlas gross margins continue to be lower than Enterprise Advanced gross margins, and while we're very pleased with that 80% margin performance on a subscription margin basis in Q3, Atlas is quote-unquote only two-thirds and so there is still a delta between the two and so I think that that will have a slightly dilutive effect on margins as Atlas increases as a percent of overall revenue. Yes, Joe. I would say that we still believe that we have a very small percentage of wallet share in most accounts. And so, obviously the smaller customer the bigger the wallet share. But in most direct sales customers, our percent of wallet share is still quite small. So we see a big opportunity there and as we talked about in terms of our new business, a big part of our new business came from acquiring new workloads with existing customers. And that is a big focus for our go-to-market teams and the runway is quite long for that trend to continue."

            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter as we continue to execute well, despite challenging market conditions. I will start by reviewing our third-quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $433 million, a 30% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 36% Year-over-Year, representing 66% of total revenue. We generated a non-GAAP operating income of $79 million for an 18% non-GAAP operating margin and we had another solid quarter of customer growth and in the quarter with over 46,400 customers. Overall, we delivered a strong Q3. We had a healthy quarter of new business acquisitions, led by continued strength in new workload acquisition within our existing customers. In addition, our Enterprise Advanced business again exceeded our expectations, demonstrating strong demand for our platform and the appeal of our run-anywhere strategy. Moving on to Atlas consumption trends, the quarter played out in line with our expectations. Michael will discuss consumption trends in more detail later. Finally, retention rates remained strong in Q3, reinforcing the mission criticality of our platform, even in a difficult spending environment. This quarter, we held our most recent global customer advisory board meeting, where customers across various geographies and industries came together to share feedback and insight about the experience using MongoDB. From these discussions, as well as our ongoing C-Suite dialog with our customers a few themes emerged. First, AI is in nearly every conversation with customers of all sizes. We're seeing great early feedback from our partnership with AWS's CodeWhisperer, the AI-powered coding companion that is now trained on MongoDB data to generate code suggestions based on MongoDB's best practices from over 15 years of history. Microsoft GitHub Copilot is also proficient at generating code suggestions that reflect best practices, enabling developers to build highly-performing applications even faster on MongoDB. And with the recent advances in Gen AI, building AI applications is no longer the sole domain of AI or ML experts, increasingly it's software developers who are being asked to build powerful AI functionality directly into their applications. We are well-positioned to help them do just that. We saw exceptional interest in our Vector Search public preview and we announced general availability yesterday. Customers are building a range of AI use cases from semantic search to retrieval augmented generation or RAG where organizations can leverage the use of their private data, to increase the accuracy of LLMs. For example, UKG, a human capital and workflows management technology serves over 80,000 plus customers around the globe chose to use MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for an AI-powered assistant that helps guide their customers employees, people managers, and HR leaders. They chose Atlas Vector Search because of its minimal added architectural complexity, flexibility to handle the rapidly changing data as applications evolve and the scale to handle large workloads. UKG is not alone. In our recent state of AI survey report by Retool, Atlas Vector Search received by far the highest net promoter score from developers compared to all other vector databases available in the market. Moreover, developers can combine Vector Search with any other query capabilities available on MongoDB, namely analytics, tech search, geospatial, and time series. This provides powerful ways of defining additional filters and vector-based queries that other solutions just cannot provide. For example, you can run complex AI enriched queries such as find pants, shirt, shoes in my size that look like the outfit in this image within the particular price range and have free shipping or find real-estate listings with houses that look like this image that were built in the last five years and/or in that area within seven miles west of Downtown Chicago with top-rated schools. Second, customers feel more pressure than ever to modernize their data infrastructure, they are aware that their legacy platforms are holding them back from building modern applications designed for an AI future. However, customers also tell us that they lack the skills and the capacity to modernize. They all want to become modern but are daunted by the challenges as they are aware it's complex -- it's a complex endeavor that involves technology, process, and people. Consequently, customers are increasingly looking to MongoDB, to help them modernize successfully. We launched Relational Migrator early this year to help customers successfully migrate data from the legacy relational databases to MongoDB. Now, we're looking beyond data migrations to the full lifecycle of application modernization. At our local London event, we unveiled a Query Converter, which uses genetic AI to analyze existing sequel queries and stored procedures and convert them to work with MongoDB's query API. Customers already use the tool successfully to convert decades-old procedures to modernize their back-end with minimal need for manual changes. While it's still early days, we're continuing to invest in the Query Converter and other AI features with the goal of significantly reducing the effort involved in monetizing legacy applications to run on MongoDB. To be clear, application modernization will take time to ramp, but as one of the largest long-term growth opportunities for our business. Third, our run-anywhere strategy continues to be a real differentiator as customers greatly appreciate the optionality that our platform provides as they manage often conflicting priorities on the way to the cloud. On one hand, the movement to the cloud continues unabated. Customers in industries and geographies were at first hesitant to move to cloud, such as financial services in Southern Europe are Now moving to the cloud with urgency to become more nimble and to reduce costs. Many of our customers find that the all-in cost of maintaining legacy workloads on-prem is higher than the cost of migrating them to the cloud. On the other hand, our largest enterprise customers tell us they are planning to maintain a meaningful on-prem footprint for the foreseeable future. The reason for keeping workloads on-prem include regulatory requirements, the desire to keep using their existing on-prem infrastructure, or the enormity of the task of migrating all their apps to cloud. In the meantime, they still want to modern data platform to deploy new and existing applications, the continued outperformance of EA business demonstrates that our customers value our ability to run anywhere and to future-proof their eventual move to the cloud by building on EA. Finally, our customers remain focused on cost management, they're looking to do more with less by consolidating vendors and reducing the complexity of the data architecture. MongoDB dramatically increases developer productivity and supports a wide variety of use cases, eliminating the need for many point solutions. This combination resonates with customers in this macro-environment. For example, Atlas search now powers the homepage of one of the most recognizable sports media brands in the world. The customer replaced an incumbent search technology with Atlas search, because they were drawn to the operational ease of running search queries alongside other queries on Atlas as well as the overall cost-savings from consolidating functionality onto a single platform. In short, customers view MongoDB as a true partner, a partner that not only accelerate the pace of innovation, but also drives them to become more efficient. We are deepening investments in our product, partnerships, and customer-facing teams to continue to enable customers to do both. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical applications on Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform. These customers include AT&T, Fishbowl by Glassdoor, and Trend Micro. AT&T selected Atlas as a key element of their modernization journey. The location match and application validates 380 million unique customer addresses and handles about 14 million transactions per day. But the various disparate data management solutions led to technical depth and there were duplicative sources of information. The company turned to Atlas as a developer data platform to simplify their data infrastructure, merged their data into a single view, and freed their teams from managing database operations. Now they rely on Atlas change streams to easily track changes with data as well as Atlas's native search capabilities and built-in geospatial functions to quickly identify location information and accelerate time-to-market for mission-critical products and services. EY, Delivery Hero, and ASAP Log are examples of customers turning to MongoDB to free up their developer's time for innovation, while achieving significant cost-savings. One of the 2023 MongoDB Innovation Award winners is EY. Ernst & Young LLP manages high volumes of transactional data and its clients and internal teams work under strict timelines to file taxes and meet regulatory deadlines. The cloud-based global VAT reporting tool or GVRT automates and digitizes the preparation of 242 different types of returns across 79 countries. EY migrated from their previous non-relational database solution to Atlas and experienced a significant performance boost, reduced cost by as much as 50% and are able to scale without limitations to handle increased data volumes, transactional loads, and concurrent user requests during peak periods. Evernorth Health Services, a division of the Cigna Group Manulife and [indiscernible] are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Manulife, one of the largest life insurance companies in the world, migrated to Atlas when it became clear that their relational database caused a drag on innovation and increased the time to bring new digital products to market. Manulife selected Atlas, because of the flexible document model speeds up development, scales easily, supports asset transactions, and offers seamless data migration. Using Atlas Device Sync, they successfully launched one critical app's offline mode to ensure uninterrupted app usage went offline or in low connectivity areas to improve mobile data synchronization. Using Atlas allows Manulife to broaden its digital capabilities and enhance the [indiscernible] of customer interactions cost-effectively. In summary, I'm pleased with our third-quarter results, our run-anywhere strategy allows customers flexibility over where they deploy and MongoDB is emerging as a platform of choice for their AI-powered applications and customers are using MongoDB to modernize and become more efficient. Before I turn it over to Michael I'm excited to share that Ann Lewnes, the former Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Vice-President of Corporate Strategy and Development at Adobe just joined MongoDB's Board of Directors, and her leadership roles at Adobe from 2006 to 2023, she was instrumental in driving Adobe's transition from a perpetual to subscription-based business model, and as experienced marketing to creative professionals, whether they are in a small agency, a medium-sized business, or very large enterprise. If you replace creative professionals with developers, this strategy is very similar to what MongoDB is doing and Ann did it at the next level of scale. Prior to Adobe, Ann held a variety of leadership positions at Intel during that 20-year tenure at the company, including Vice-President of Sales and Marketing. We're thrilled for the exceptional perspective Ann will bring to the Board. With that, here's Michael. Yes, thanks for your question Sanjit, what I would say is we've been very clear that we're really pushing our developer data platform strategy and we think the market is way larger today than it was for Oracle, when they were essentially 17 years old and our developer data platform strategy is really very simply enabling developers to use MongoDB for a wide variety of use cases across a wide variety of deployment models, whether it's on-prem, on the cloud, multi-cloud or even at the Edge. And so that's really our strategy. We don't see any need to get into quote-unquote the application space itself. And we think that we have a lot of runway ahead of us. Thanks, Sanjit. Yeah, Raimo. With regards to our EA outperformance, I think it really speaks to our run-anywhere strategy where customers really value the ability to build on MongoDB and essentially future-proof their deployment model, whether they stay on-prem or to move to the cloud or move from one cloud to another cloud and the fact that they can do that without having to rewrite the application is very compelling for customers. As you also said, a lot of customers still, especially the largest customer, still have a lot of sunk costs and they want to leverage that -- their existing data infrastructure. So, lot of customers have told us that they will still deploy infrastructure on-prem for the foreseeable future, but what -- but by building on MongoDB, they get the benefits of a modern platform and the optionality to also move to cloud when they're ready to do so. Yes. And Raimo, just to add to that. One of the announcements we also made was that we can now do workload isolation. So, for Search or Vector Search functionality you can scale those nodes independently of the overall cluster. So, what that really does is allow customers to really configure those clusters to have the right level of performance at the most efficient cost. So, we've been very sensitive to making sure that based on the different use cases you can scale up and down different nodes based on your application needs, by definition that will be a very compelling value proposition for customers. Yes. So I'll make a couple of points. Karl, you're absolutely right, there is a lot of focus on data because with AI, data in some ways becomes the new code, you can train your models with your proprietary data that allows you to really drive much more value and build smarter applications. Now, the key thing is that it's operational data because with applications, this data is always constantly being updated and for many customers, most of those applications are right now running on legacy platforms, so that operational data is trapped in those legacy platforms. And you can really do a batch process of e-tailing all that data into some sort of warehouse and then still be able to leverage the real-time use of that data. That's why customers are now much more interested in potentially modernizing legacy platforms than they ever have before. I would say, Karl, to your second part of your question, I would say it's still very, very early days. We definitely believe that this will be one of the largest long-term opportunities for our business, but we're in the very early days and as I've said in the past, there is a risk of overestimating the impact of the short-term but underestimating the impact long-term, we definitely think this is a long-term impact. Yes. We get different answers from different customers, really depends on which tool, they're using without commenting on who is better or who is worst, we definitely see a difference in the quality of the output between different tools. I think it's going to take some time for these tools to mature. So I think we're seeing a lot of customers do a lot of testing and prototyping. I would also tell you that doing a lot of this on internal facing applications, because there's still lots of questions about IP rights and what is potentially copyright-able then ultimately licensable, they offer this as a shrink-wrap software or service to their end-customers. So, we're seeing more of this work on internally facing applications. But the productivity gains, really do vary by tool and also very -- do vary by the sophistication of the app being built. So, it's hard for me to give you a real number. I know there are people out there to toating 30% or 40% improvements. But it really depends on the customer, and the use-case and the tool that they're trying to use. It'd be hard for me to give you a specific number. Thank you. Yes. So it like you said, Q3 Atlas results were in line with our expectations there was a seasonal benefit to Q3 relative to Q2. But given the fact that we've seen less variability in consumption in fiscal 2024, we had expected that to be smaller than it was in fiscal 2023 and that's exactly how it played out. The seasonal improvement, as it relates to Q3 is a little bit more in the back-half of the of the -- of the quarter. As it relates to Q4, typically the back half is weaker, given the holiday slowdown and I hope that helps people understand a little bit. Hey, Kash. Thanks for the question. I think compared from last year, this year we don't see things getting worse, but we don't see things getting better. Where I said, last year with the Fed raising rates, you could really sense that people are getting much more cautious and there was probably more negativity in terms of the outlook coming into calendar 2023. So, that being said, we definitely see innovation, being a priority for customers. We clearly are. I would say the distinction between must-to-have and nice-to-have clearly, in the first category. But customers are also, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks remain focused on being sensitive to costs and ensuring that any investments that may have a high ROI. So we feel that we're well-positioned in terms of use cases or segments. I would say in general there is no real kind of material change in any across any vertical industry or geography. We do see. I mean we were at Reinvent last week and we had an amazing set of conversations with lots of senior-level customers. I think we're really viewed as a mission-critical platform by all our customers, and I think people view us as a platform that they can bet on long-term. And so we see less I would say focus on like point solutions and more about like trying to leverage MongoDB for more and more use cases and I would say that's pretty consistent across industries and geographies. Yes, so let me start with the second question first. I would say that I think six to nine months ago, there was a lot of interest in vector databases and there were some point solutions that got a lot of name recognition and a lot of people wondering is there a risk that could be disrupted by them. And at that point in time, we've made it clear that we believed vectors were really another form of an index and that every database platform would ultimately incorporate vectors into their architecture and the winner really would be the technology that made the vector functionality very integrated and cohesive as part of the development workflow. I would I would argue that that's really played out. As I've said in the prepared remarks, there was a recent analysis done by a consultancy firm called Retool that really spoke to lots of customers and we came out on top in terms of NPS and by the way, our product is a preview product, it wasn't even the GA product. We've seen a lot of demand from customers and we feel like this is a big, big opportunity. Again, it's early days, it's going to take time to materialize, but this is again one of the other big growth opportunities for our business. That being said, in terms of the revenue opportunity, it is really hard to quantify now because the use cases that customers are starting with are still kind of, I would say, early in development, so because people are still playing around with the technology. But we are seeing you know as I mentioned, UKG, is using it to essentially provide a AI-powered assistance for its people, you know one energy -- European energy company is using -- has terabytes of geospatial data and is using vectors to basically get better insights in terms of the images that they're getting from the work they're doing in terms of drilling for oil. So, it's still very, very, early days. So, hard to give you like an exact number, even today even in our general non-AI workloads, the workload variety can vary a lot depending on the customer, the number of users, the amount of data. So, I think it's going to be similar to our core business, which is that just really depends on the use case. Yes, I'm glad you called that out, Brad. Yeah, we're -- I think we added 117 100K customers this quarter, which is the largest add. I think in the company's history. What I think it really speaks to is that customers are increasingly viewing MongoDB as a mission-critical platform. They're going to run more and more workloads on MongoDB. So, by definition, it's rare that one workload on its own will drive that kind of revenue. So, the multiple workloads and really dealing us as a standard part of their infrastructure stack is what's really driving that number. And we're obviously happy to see the results of that and we think that that's just indication, as I said earlier, where people are consolidating onto a few vendors. They recognize that we offer support for a broad set of use cases, we're truly a general-purpose mission-critical platform and that their developers really love using MongoDB. Yes, so. Actually, yeah, one of the reasons we actually built Search is because we got feedback from our customers in many Instances lot of our customers were dual-homing data to MongoDB and to some sort of search database. So consequently, now that they had to manage two databases, keep that data in sync, but also manage the plumbing, the connected those two database platforms and customers told us [indiscernible] like, we don't understand why you're not offering a solution, because we much rather have it all in one platform with one API and that ultimately drove our desire to build-out our search functionality, which is really becoming more-and-more popular. So, the point for customers is that, if you can remove friction in terms of how they can use the platform, leverage the platform, have one set of kind of semantics In terms of -- to address a broad set of use cases, it really simplifies the data architecture and the more you simplify data architecture, the more nimble, you can be and the more cost-effective you can be, and I think that's what's really resonating with customers. Yes, so -- again, as you can imagine, given the lot of these legacy platforms have been around four between 30 to 40 years. Lot of people have large repository of legacy apps and migrating off a legacy platform to another platform does require some work, it requires essentially three things; one, you have to map the scheme of the old platform onto the new platform, you then have to map move the data and then you have to rewrite the application code. And those three things took some time. So, we heard feedback. When we took the company public, you might remember that 30% of our net new business at the time we went public was actually relational migration. So customers were undertaking that heavy lifting because they were in such pain and wanted to move to a more modern platform. But clearly, that pain can basically be a bit of a tax on switching costs. And so essentially rebuilt tooling based on feedback from customers to start automating the schema mapping and the data movement. Now, with the availability of Gen AI. You can also now start automating the code generation associated with rebuilding or rebuilding an application and essentially what rather than thing, but just moving the app in one last step, we can actually break down a monolithic relational app into microservices and start cleaning off different parts of the services first. So it can be a much more efficient and also more ROI, quicker ROI and some of the investments we're making. So, there is a big, big opportunity here for us to do that, but again I want to be very clear, we view this as a long-term growth opportunity. We're still in the very early days. We've got some really interested customers who are doing some interesting things and working with us on pilots. Our engineering and product and field teams are really focused on this, but we are in the very, very early days of really automating relational migrated to the next level leveraging Gen AI. Yes, so just to be clear, when we talk about serverless, basically what customers think about is that they don't have to start thinking about capacity planning that the workload can scale-up and scale-down based on the needs of whatever the use cases and what the compute and other resource needs are, and so there's been a lot of interest from customers. At first stage, there was a lot of the similar workloads, where they didn't want to go provision a dedicated cluster. They wanted to be able to leverage our serverless functionality, we think long-term that almost every workload will become serverless because over time that'll be the way most applications are provisioned. But we're in the early days and the receptivity and use of our serverless functionality has been very high. And you're right, it's -- for those legacy platforms that they can offer similar solutions MongoDB becomes that much more attractive because a development team and architecture team doesn't have to worry about capacity planning, they can just build the app and they know the background our infrastructure can scale-up and down as their usage -- as the usage -- as the usage goes up and down. Yes, so, as we mentioned earlier the feedback on our Vector Search has been very-high, even when it was in public preview, we're getting a lot of feedback and then we saw this report that came out, obviously, we don't talk to people who are using alternatives, we just talk focus on our own customers, but it was -- we're pleased to see that out of all the products available in the marketplace, our own preview product had the highest NPS score. So then if you unpack that. Why do customers like using MongoDB, because it is one tightly integrated solution, you can tightly integrate capturing Vector data, metadata, and then data regarding a particular use case and that becomes very, very attractive, it just becomes much more seamless and easier to use versus either using point solutions or some kludgy solution that's been put together. So, I think that's a big reason about how we remove friction from a developers workflow and why the MongoDB approach makes it so much better to use instead of any other alternative approach. In terms of your question around the amount of data and data bills, obviously vectors can be memory intensive and the amount of vectors you generate will obviously drive the amount of usage on those nodes, that's one of the reasons we also introduced dedicated search knows. So you can asymmetrically scale particular nodes of your application especially Search nodes without having to increase the overall size of your cluster. So you're not -- to your point, shocked with a big bill for underlying usage -- for non-usage, right. So, you only scale to nodes that are really -- need that incremental compute and memory versus nodes that don't and that becomes a much more cost-effective way for people to do this and obviously that's another differentiator for MongoDB. Thank you. I appreciate everyone joining the call today. Again. I just want to reiterate that we had another strong quarter of new business performance, validating the value proposition of our developer data platform and our run-anywhere strategy. We're seeing strong momentum on our AI strategy, especially Atlas Vector Search, which is emerging as a best-in-class solution for building powerful AI applications. And we continue to help customers drive greater efficiency, while also accelerating our pace of innovation. So with that. I appreciate your time and we'll talk to you soon. Take care."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we had another exceptional quarter as we continue to execute well despite challenging market conditions. I will start by reviewing our second-quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $424 million, a 40% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 38% year-over-year, representing 63% of revenue, and is now a $1 billion-plus revenue run-rate product. We generated a non-GAAP operating margin -- operating income of $79 million for a record 19% non-GAAP operating margin, and we had another solid quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 45,000 customers. Overall, we delivered an exceptional Q2. We had a healthy quarter of new business acquisitions, led by continued strength in new workload acquisition within our existing customers. From a new logo perspective, we added 1,900 new customers in the quarter. Our direct sales team had another strong quarter of Enterprise customer additions. Finally, our Enterprise Advanced and other non-Atlas business significantly exceeded our expectations, another indication of our strong product market fit and the appeal of our run anywhere strategy. Moving on to Atlas consumption trends, the quarter played out slightly better than our expectations. Michael will discuss consumption trends in more detail. Finally, retention rates remained strong in Q2, reinforcing the mission criticality of our platform, even in a difficult spending environment. As we've told you in the past, our market is different from most other software markets because the unit of competition is a workload, not a customer. We started customer relationships by acquiring the first workload and we grew from there acquiring incremental workloads over time. Over the last few years, we have oriented our entire company around winning more workloads. Starting with product. At our New York user conference held in June, we made a number of product announcements that will position us to capture more workloads faster. We introduced Atlas Stream Processing, which enables developers to work with streaming data to build sophisticated event-driven applications, the flexibility of the document model and the power of the MongoDB Query Language provide a compelling and differentiated way to process streaming data compared to alternative approaches. Our early access program is meaningfully been oversubscribed as customers realize they can use a familiar and easy approach to work with streaming data and immediately see value. We announced the general availability of Relational Migrator, which makes it easier for customers to migrate their existing relational applications to MongoDB. We are seeing increased adoption across industries and geographies. For example, a leading international retailer was able to leverage Relational Migrator to dramatically accelerate their migration of Oracle. We also announced Atlas Vector Search, which enables developers to store, index, and query vector embeddings instead of having to bolt-on vector search functionality separately adding yet another point solution and creating a more fragmented developer experience, developers can aggregate and process the vectorized data they need to build AI applications, while also using MongoDB to aggregate and process data and metadata. We're seeing significant interest in our Vector Search offering from large and sophisticated enterprise customers, even though it's only -- still only in preview. As one example, a large global management consulting firm is using Atlas -- Atlas Vector Search for internal research applications that allows consultants to semantically search over 1.5 million expert interview transcripts. Over time, AI functionality will make developers more productive to the use of code generation and code assist tools that enable them to build more applications faster. Developers will also be able to enrich applications with compelling AI experiences by enabling integration with either proprietary or open-source, large language models to deliver more impact. Now instead of data being used only by data scientists to drive insights, data can be used by developers to build smarter applications that truly transform the business. These AI applications will be exceptionally demanding, requiring a truly modern operational data platform like MongoDB. In fact, we believe MongoDB has an even stronger competitive advantage in the world of AI. First, the document model's inherent flexibility and versatility renders it a natural fit for AI applications. Developers can easily manage and process various data types all in one place. Second, AI applications require high-performance, parallel computations, and the ability to scale data processing on an ever-growing base of data. MongoDB supports its features with features like sharding and auto-scaling. Lastly, it is important to remember that AI applications have the same demand as any other type of application, transactional guarantees, security and privacy requirements, tech search, in-app analytics, and more. Our developer data platform gives developer a unified solution to build smarter AI applications. We are seeing these applications developed across a wide variety of customer types and use cases. For example, Observe.AI is an AI startup that leverages 40 billion parameter LLM to provide customers with intelligence and coaching that maximize performance of their frontline support and sales teams. Observe.AI processes and run models on millions of support touchpoints daily to generate insights for the customers. Most of this rich unstructured data is stored in MongoDB. Observe.AI chose to build on MongoDB, because we enabled them to quickly innovate, scale to handle large and unpredictable workloads and meet the security requirements of their largest enterprise customers. On the other end of the spectrum is one of the leading industrial equipment suppliers in North America. This company relies on Atlas and Atlas Device Sync to deploy AI models at the edge. To their field teams, mobile devices to better manage and predict inventory in areas with poor physical network connectivity, they chose MongoDB because of our ability to efficiently handle large quantities of distributed data and to seamlessly integrate between the network edge and their back-end systems. As much as we innovate our products, we also continuously innovate and how we engage with our customers. We are highly focused on reducing friction in the sales process, so we can acquire more workloads quickly and cost-effectively given the large size of our market opportunity. Historically, the most significant source of friction has been negotiating with customers to secure an upfront Atlas commitment since it can be hard for customers to forecast consumption growth for a new workload. Given our high retention rates and the underlying consumption growth, several years ago, we began reducing the importance of upfront commitments in our go-to-market process to accelerate workload acquisition. This year, we took additional steps in that direction. For example, we no longer incentivize reps to sign customers to one-year commitments. Obviously, this has short-term impacts on our cash flow, but positions us better for the longer term by accelerating workload acquisition. We are pleased with the impact these changes have had on the business in the first half of the year, specifically, new workload acquisition has accelerated, especially within existing customers. We believe that our efforts to reduce friction are resulting in more efficient growth and we'll always look for ways to improve our go-to-market approach to make it even easier for customers to bring new workloads onto our platform. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries, including Renault, Hootsuite, and Ford are running mission-critical projects on MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform. One of the 2023 MongoDB North American Innovation Award winners is Ford. With a focus on innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction, Ford is a leader in the automotive industry and a household name around the world. Ford is committed to developing advanced technologies that enhance the safety, performance, and sustainability of its vehicles. Their data explorer and transportation mobility cloud applications aggregate customer vehicle data from 24 different sources at a volume ranging up to 15 terabytes. Since migrating to MongoDB Atlas from the previous solution, Ford has seen a 50% performance improvement and faster rewrite times. Cathay Pacific, Foot Locker, and Market Access are examples of customers turning to MongoDB to free up the developer\u2019s time for innovation while achieving significant cost savings. Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's home airline carrier operating in more than 60 destinations worldwide, turned to MongoDB on their journey to become one of the first airlines to create a truly paperless flight deck. Flight Folder, their application built on MongoDB, consolidates dozens of different information sources into one place and includes a digital refueling feature that helps crews become much more efficient with fueling strategies, saving significant flight time and costs. Since the Flight Folder launch, Cathay Pacific has completed more than 340,000 flights with full digital integration in the flight deck. In addition to the greatly improved flight crew experience, flight times have been reduced and the digital refueling has saved eight minutes on the ground on average. All these efficiencies have helped the company avoid the release of 15,000 tons of carbon and save an estimated $12.5 million. Powerledger, Wells Fargo, and System1 are among customers turning to MongoDB to modernize existing applications. System1, a customer acquisition marketing company acquired MapQuest in 2019. At the time of the acquisition, MapQuest had a fragmented architecture that mixed disparate data persistent technologies with third-party services. System1 selected Atlas as a key piece of MapQuest's architecture transformation and has realized estimated cost reductions of 75% and performance improvements of 20% over its prior relational database solution. MapQuest is planning a number of future projects that we use Atlas search and time series collections to improve the user experience and create a feedback loop and location-based relevancy in different cities. In summary, I am incredibly stoked with our second-quarter results. Our ability to win new workloads remained strong and our run anywhere strategy is resonating with customers. While it's early days on AI, we continue to see evidence that MongoDB will be a platform of choice for AI applications, just like we are for other modern and demanding applications. We continue to invest to maximize our long-term potential. With that, here's Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our second quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2024. First, I'll start with our second quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $423.8 million, up 40% year-over-year. As Dev mentioned, we continue to see a healthy new business environment especially in terms of acquiring new workloads within existing customers. To us, this is confirmation we remain a top priority for our customers and that our value proposition continues to resonate even in this market. Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 38% in the quarter compared to the previous year and represents 63% of total revenue compared to 64% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 65% last quarter. In Q2, Atlas slightly declined as a percentage of revenue due to the exceptionally strong performance of our non-Atlas business, underscoring the demand for MongoDB regardless of where customers are in their cloud adoption journey. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely related to end-user activity of the application, which can be affected by macroeconomic factors. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. Consumption growth in Q2 was slightly better than our expectations. As a reminder, we had assumed Atlas would continue to be impacted by the difficult macro environment in Q2, and that is largely how the quarter played out. Turning to non-Atlas revenues. EA significantly exceeded our expectations in the quarter, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our EA customer base. We continue to see that our customers, regardless of their mode of deployment, are launching more workloads at MongoDB and moving towards standardizing on our platform. The EA revenue outperformance was in part a result of more multiyear deals than we had expected. In addition, we had an exceptionally strong quarter in our other licensing revenues. On our last call, we mentioned that we would benefit from a few large multiyear licensing deals, most notably the renewal and extension of our relationship with Alibaba. We also closed some additional multiyear licensing deals in the quarter, which is a meaningful contributor to our outperformance and another sign of popularity of MongoDB and the success of our run anywhere strategy. As a reminder, under ASC 606 for both EA and licensing contracts, the term license component even for multiyear deals, is recognized as upfront revenue. Turning to customer growth. During the second quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 45,000, which is up from over 37,000 in the year period. Of our total customer count, over 6,800 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 5,400 in the year ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 43,500 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 35,500 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. Let me double-click into our direct customer count. As Dev mentioned, we're becoming increasingly sophisticated in how we engage our customers. But some of those motions result in the line between our direct sales and our self-service channels becoming more fluid. I thought it'd be helpful to highlight two particular inter-channel dynamics that impact the channel breakdown of our reported customer counts. While these customer movements represent less than 1% of our ARR, we do expect both of these trends to continue into the future, and so we wanted to make sure you understood how they affect our reported customer counts by channel. First, we are having increasing success leveraging cloud provider self-service marketplaces to drive new customer additions. Growing cloud marketplace volumes is a major secular trend, and we are the only ISV available on all three hyperscaler marketplaces. Customers can deploy Atlas in seconds through cloud provider consoles and can pay for it by drawing down their existing cloud commitments. This further reduces friction as it bypasses the need for our contract altogether. For this reason, our direct sales team has been directing certain new prospects to sign-up using self-serve marketplaces. We've added several hundred customers using this approach in recent quarters, and these customers show up in our self-serve customer count even though we have a direct sales relationship with them. Second, we continually review and analyze product usage signals to determine the potential of our customers. Because we are focused on velocity and efficiency of new workload acquisition, we're very careful not to deploy our reps on accounts where we don't see significant incremental benefit from sales rep coverage. If we determine that a direct sales customer can be supported more cost effectively in the self-serve channel, we'd prefer to free up the rep's time to focus on winning more new workloads. So far this year, we've moved over 300 small mid-market direct sales customers to the self-service channel. Moving on to ARR. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,855 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,462 in the year ago period. Moving down the income statement. I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the second quarter was $329 million, representing a gross margin of 78%, which is up from 73% in the year ago period. It is important to keep in mind that this quarter, we saw exceptional performance of our EA and licensing revenue, which contains a large upfront license component and very high margins, and therefore, we wouldn't expect to repeat this performance. Our income from operations was $79.1 million or a 19% operating margin for the second quarter compared to a negative 4% margin in the year ago period. Our strong bottom-line results demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our model and are a clear indication of the strength in our underlying unit economics. The primary reason for our operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. Net income in the second quarter was $76.7 million or $0.93 per share based on 82.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net loss of $15.6 million or $0.23 per share on 68.3 million base weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was negative $25.3 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $27.3 million in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $48.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Three things of note on our cash flow performance in the quarter. First, as many of you know, Q2 tends to be our seasonally lowest collections quarter of the year because of low contract volumes in Q1, as evidenced by our Q1 ending accounts receivable balance. Second, while our revenue reflects the ASC 606 treatment of multiyear EA and licensing deals, most multiyear contracts are still billed annually, so there's no equivalent benefit to cash flow. Finally, as Dev mentioned, we continue de-emphasizing the value of upfront commitments. So we're seeing fewer of them. In other words, we are intentionally collecting less cash upfront in order to win more workloads more quickly. As evidence of this, we grew Atlas revenue 38% year-over-year, while Atlas dollars committed upfront actually declined by 15% year-over-year. Lower upfront commitments only impact the timing of when our customers pay us, not the total payment. But this trend of declining upfront commitments will impact the relationship between our non-GAAP operating income and operating cash flow in the medium term. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2024. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $400 million to $404 million, we expect non-GAAP income from moderations to be in the range of $41 million to $44 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.50 based on 83.5 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year '24, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.596 billion to $1.608 billion. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $189 million to $197 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $2.27 and to $2.35 based on 83 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2024 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll provide some more context on our guidance. First, we have modestly raised our outlook for the rest of the year, primarily to reflect a slightly stronger Q2 and therefore a higher starting ARR for the second half. We continue to expect that Atlas consumption growth will be impacted by the difficult macroeconomic environment throughout fiscal '24. Our revised full year revenue guidance continues to assume consumption growth that is, on average, in line with the consumption growth we've experienced in the slowdown began in Q2 of last year, but with a slight seasonal benefit in Q3 and a slowdown in Q4 as observed over the last two years. Second, we expect to see a significant sequential decline in non-Atlas revenues in Q3 as we simply do expect similar new business activity, especially when it comes to licensing deals. For that particular line of business, Q2 was just an extreme positive outlier. Third, we're raising our non-Atlas revenue estimate for the rest of the year, even though we don't expect our exceptional Q2 performance to repeat in the second half, our results in the first half give us incremental confidence in our run anywhere strategy. We continue to expect, however, that the difficult compare in the back half of the year will impact our non-Atlas growth rate. Finally, thanks to strong performance in Q2 and the increased revenue outlook, we're meaningfully increasing our assumption for operating margins in fiscal '24 to 12% at the midpoint of our guidance. an improvement of more than 700 basis points compared to fiscal '23, while continuing to invest to pursue our long-term opportunity. As you update your models, please keep in mind that the majority of our planned fiscal '24 hiring will actually occur in the second half of the year. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent second quarter results in a difficult environment. We are pleased with our ability to win new business and are demonstrating the operating leverage inherent in our model. While we continue to monitor the macro environment, we remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead [Technical Difficulty] to maximize our long-term value. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. One moment while we can file the Q&A roster. And our first question today will be coming from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Good new version. Congrats from me on a great quarter. Two quick questions. First, the new -- or the trends you saw for EA or the numbers you saw for EA this quarter, you called out kind of bigger commitments from existing customers and taking more workloads -- or returning more workloads towards Mongo. Is that -- could you talk a little bit towards that in terms of is that a new trend? Was it just kind of very special this quarter? What are you seeing there? Because that's kind of in this sort of environment, seems like against what do you see from everyone else. So maybe couple of factors there? And then the second question is on the newer products like the streaming and vector databases, how does that feed into the revenue model for Mongo? That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. So Raimo, the trends for EA, I think, is just an indication of our run anywhere strategy. We've been very committed to that strategy since the beginning. As you know, we started with EA and then introduced Atlas. But the whole point is that we give customers choice and we want to meet customers where they are in terms of what deployment model they want to use. And so I think this is just puts and takes of the quarter where we had a number of customers who wanted to double down on EA. And we also had some other non-Atlas business come in, in the quarter, which showed up in our results. But it's really a confirmation of the fact that we give customers choice and customers really appreciate that, and that's what you've seen in the results. With regards to, I think you said streaming and vector, those will show up in the Atlas revenue line as incremental consumption. There won't be a separate SKU. But what it will do is drive, as those workloads come on, that will drive incremental consumption of Atlas, which will show up in the Atlas revenue line.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I would just add that also as part of the broader developer data platform, it gives us the opportunity to win more workloads in the beginning. So you've got both sort of new workload penetration piece, which Dev mentioned, but also sort of the increased Atlas number is where it will show up on a revenue standpoint.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you, congrats.\nMichael Gordon: Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Raimo.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: This is Keith Weiss on for Sanjit Singh. One question for Dev and one for Michael. Dev, you guys talked about, I think, last quarter, 1,500 AI companies using MongoDB. You talked a lot about your applicability for AI workloads. I think a question that a lot of investors have is like the time frame for when this actually creates real impacts to where it becomes significant tailwind or just software in general, but more specifically the question to you is when do you think that becomes a significant tailwind for MongoDB? When will we see that more significantly in Atlas revenues? And then the question for Michael. We talked about the commitments coming down, the Atlas commitments coming down and that being a drag on operating cash flow. Any sense you could give us on how long that drag on [OCF] (ph) persists? Is there any way to size that impact over time?\nDev Ittycheria: So, Keith, on AI, obviously, we're really excited about the opportunity that AI presents. We continue to add many more AI customers this quarter. In the short term, we're really excited about some of the use cases we're seeing. We talked about Observe.Ai, the management consulting company, a more traditional company using MongoDB for very impactful AI use case. And longer term, we believe our developer data platform value prop will just drive more AI adoption. People want to use one compelling, unified developer experience to address a wide variety of use cases of which AI is just one of them. And we're definitely hearing from customers to being able to do that on one platform versus bolting on a bunch of point solutions is far more the preferable approach. And so we're excited about the opportunity there. And I think you had some questions -- on the other thing on partners, I do want to say that we're seeing a lot of work and activity with our partner channel on the AI front as well. We're working with Google in the AI start-up program, and there's a lot of excitement. Google had their next conference this week. We're also working with Google to help train Codey, their code generation tool to help people accelerate the development of AI and other applications. And we're seeing a lot of interest in our own AI innovators program. We've had lots of customers apply for that program. So we're super excited about the interest that we're generating.\nMichael Gordon: And on your other question, Keith, it's been a multiyear journey where we've been focused on reducing friction and accelerating new workload adoption. I do think as we called out, we continue to make additional steps and Dev called out some of the specific incremental steps this year. I think it's part of a transition. If you look at the Atlas revenue growth, Atlas grew 38% year-over-year, but dollars collected upfront shrank 15%, right? And so that gives you a sense for the magnitude or the divergence there that's showing up in the op income versus OCF bridge. I think like most things, there'll be a transition time period, but then it will settle into a more normalized level, but I think we've still got like a little bit more transition to go as we kind of work through the balance of the year.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Keith.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs, your line is open.\nKash Rangan: I'm sorry, I didn't hear my name. Thank you very much and congrats, Dev and Michael on the quarter. It's hard to -- put up this kind of operating margin performance being a database company at the scale that you're operating. So kudos on that. The relational migrator came off of beta and came into GA this quarter. So I wonder if that had any particular impact on the EA business because you've certainly up sighted your modest expectations. I want to get a little bit more detail on how that pipeline of Relational Migrator beta customers should play out? Is it going to be showing up in Atlas? Or is it going to be showing up in enterprise, the on-prem version. And on AI, just curious if you can quantify the level of consumption impact in the future to Atlas that you could attribute to the different new things that Mongo is working, whether it's AI or streaming. How should we think about the incremental opportunities for consumption afforded by some of the new things you launched at MongoDB live in New York a couple of months back. Thank you so much. Congrats.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. So regarding relational migrators, it's important for investors to know that this is really a high-end enterprise play. That's where the bulk of the legacy relational market is. And Relational Migrator is designed to help customers reduce the switching cost of migrating off relational databases to MongoDB for both EA and Atlas. So it's a place to -- depending again on the customer's choice of their deployment model but it's really meant to reducing the switching costs. I would say that there was no real impact in terms of revenue of customers using Relational Migrator because we just only made it generally available in June. But there's a tremendous amount of excitement. We have a large pipeline of customers who are very interested and are actually starting to use Relational Migrator and projects have begun, but there was no real impact on the quarter. Regarding your second question about some of the new products and the impact of AI long term, what I would say is we definitely believe it will have a big impact long term. We think that things like Vector Search just make it so much easier to build smarter applications on MongoDB that unified developer experience is a key differentiator. There's a really strong interest in our Public Preview product. We also see a lot of interest in Stream Processing. Stream Processing is a use case that's really optimized for MongoDB. The data is typically JSON, the variability of the data lends itself to a document model that's much more flexible. It's obviously very developer-oriented, where all the alternatives are using very rigid schemas and are much more complicated to use that plays into our sweet spot. So we think we have a big opportunity there. But -- and so it's hard to quantify what that impact will be in the long term, but I will tell you that we're really excited and the interest level on the new products is incredibly high.\nKash Rangan: Fantastic. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Kash.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. I'm not sure Dev or Michael, but going back to the commentary on fewer upfront Atlas commits. Oftentimes, when customers sign multiyear deals and pay upfront, they get a better rate. So if we were to think about not having them pay you upfront and make long-term commits, is that a net margin benefit to you guys on the pricing side?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So a couple of things. Thanks, Brad, for the question. In general, for us, even before the sort of evolution and changes in multiyear deals, typically, they were not all paid upfront. Typically, ours has been annually billed. But yes, to your point, I think as we've reduced upfront commitment, you have a couple of dynamics. The key one is when we are not motivating it or providing an incentive to our sales force, and it winds up being customer driven, the leverage in that negotiation shifts. And on the margin, that is helpful for the ultimate pricing or discount and winds up with sort of better pricing for us, less discounting to the customer.\nBrad Reback: Excellent. And then on your commentary about second half hiring outpacing first half. Would it be correct to assume that the hiring environment is a little less competitive, so you might actually be able to find people more easily and get better pricing for them as well? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. What I would say, Brad, is that, I would say, in general, obviously, the frothiness of a few years ago has abated, but for certain skill sets, there's still significant premium for talent, and we don't want to lower our bar just to optimize on cost. We pride ourselves on recruiting the best of the best in this industry. And we focus on paying market rates. And so while it's a little easier because the market is a little softer, I wouldn't suggest that all of a sudden, we're getting employees at a massive discount.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. I would think about it as availability rather than cost and then throw in some of the dynamics with some places around different return to office models and other things. I think that sort of incrementally is likely to provide opportunities in the back half of the year. And as they present themselves, we'll certainly pursue those.\nBrad Reback: Excellent. Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from Karl Keirstead of UBS. Your line is open.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Great. Maybe this one to Mike. Michael, I wouldn't normally ask about the other segment, but it's such an outlier if I could ask a two-parter. First is, what surprised on the upside there? Was the Alibaba deal much larger than you thought? Or did you grab a few others, maybe you could unpack that? And secondly, you did tell us that the second half guidance assumes a significant decline in the non-Atlas business. Is it fair to assume that this other category might return back to the levels it was at pre the July quarter? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. Thanks, Karl. No, other deals, not Alibaba. Alibaba was baked at the time of the last guidance call. So it was sort of incremental deals that surprised us to the upside there. And yes, obviously, it's a volatile or variable, especially given the 606 and the nature of it where it goes, given the lumpiness of the term license revenue and things like that. And so, yes, I think that this is not repeatable performance, and I think it should settle back down to a more -- to a lower and more normalized level.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. And then if I could ask a follow-up, Mike, you did a good job explaining the changes in the model and the licensing on cash flow, but it's not a metric you often talk about, but your deferred revenue balance was actually down year-over-year, highly unusual. Is this basically the same explanation that would be impacting DR? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. I think it's the same explanation or discussion overlaid with our recurring discussion around billings, and that's sort of not a metric that we focused on and that we sort of discourage people from using and we're focused sort of on those workloads and winning new workloads rather than large upfront commitments. But one of the ways that plays out is absolutely in deferred and for anyone still doing defer -- I mean, calculated billings. Calculations that will affect that there as well. Yes.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question is coming from Rishi Jaluria of RBC. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Rich calling] (ph) on for Rishi Jaluria today. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess if we look at the workloads you have in front of you with Vector Search, Relational Migrator and Streaming and could even throw an application search, which was more of a driver, let's call it, last year. But if we had to stack rank each of those workloads in terms of your positioning to win and your overall opportunity in each of those use cases, how would you go about doing that?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So Rich, thanks for your question. I would say, obviously, the general operational workload of what you call the OLTP workload is still our bread and butter. Workloads that people come to us and relational migrator would just be more of that because of the migrating operational workloads of relational databases to MongoDB. And then the other use case really, other products really function of the use cases that customers are really interested in. For example, Atlas Device Sync, which is really focused on the enterprise mobility play, for example, point-of-sale devices for the retail industry in automotive, connected car in manufacturing, instrumenting the factory floor. So it really depends on the use cases. In application search, we're really seeing an acceleration of large workloads in that -- for that product. So we're really excited about the size of some of the business that we're seeing there. Obviously, Vector is still in public preview. So we hope to have a GA sometime next year, but we're really excited about the early and high interest from enterprises. And obviously, some customers are already deploying it in production, even though it's a public preview product. Streaming is something that we're super excited about. This is more for event-driven real-time applications. It's just very suitable for MongoDB due to the -- most of the data is in JSON and the flexibility of [document] (ph) model makes it a very compelling play. And so I would say that, it really depends on the customer's use case. What it really does is it just enables us to go after more workloads more quickly, and it really positions us as a truly strategic supplier to large enterprises and obviously, a critical supplier for early-stage companies, and that's our strategy, is to get customers to use MongoDB for a variety of use cases across a variety of deployment models.\nMichael Gordon: The other thing that I'd add, which is probably implicit and comes across that, but I think it's important enough to make explicit is one thing that, that sort of, Rich, in your question, sort of the slice-by-slice view misses is the aggregate benefit of delivering the whole platform, right, in delivering a common integrated unified experience to developers so they don't have to use a bunch of point solutions. And I think that's really a key part of the strategy.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That makes perfect sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon. This is Brent. I believe I\u2019m -- was next there. Dev, I wanted to talk a little bit about AI. And Mongo has been at the leading powering new apps for the better part of the decade. We're all trying to figure out what this AI [first world] (ph) looks like, given your purview as a new app enabler, what's your sense in the next three to four years, how many of these new apps are going to layer in large language models? And what is the net result on the database? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So Brent, thanks for your question. I firmly believe that we, as an industry, tend to overestimate the impact of a new technology in the short term and underestimate the impact in the long term. So as you may know, there's a lot of hype in the market right now, in the industry right around AI and in some of the early stage companies in the space have -- the valuations are to the roof. In some cases, almost -- it's hard to see how people can make money because the risk reward doesn't seem to be sized appropriately. So there's a lot of hype in the space. But I do think that AI will be a big impact for the industry and for us long term. I believe that almost every application, both new and existing, will have some AI functionality embedded into the application over the next -- in your horizon three to five years. And let me just remind people why we see -- where we see AI impacting our business. One, developers will become far more productive with the use of code generation and code assist tools. What that will mean is like that will lead to more applications, which means they need more databases and more data platforms. Second, developers will use things like generative AI to just build smarter and more intelligent applications. One, they don't want to use point solutions because it's clear developers want one platform to process and analyze data and metadata and vectorized data and MongoDB is that platform. So which is why in so much interest. And Vector Search, I believe, is really ultimately a feature, not a product. And essentially, it's basically enabling people to marry private data with public data to really offer a compelling experience and there's so much interest in our public preview right now. And as we -- as I mentioned earlier, we've continued to add many more AI customers this quarter and we think the impact will be big. But in the short term, these are still smaller workloads, but they're going to grow over time. Some of the use cases are really interesting, but the fact is that we're really well positioned because what generative AI does is really instantiate AI in front of -- in software, which means developers play a bigger role rather than data scientists, and that's where you'll really see the business impact. And I think that impact will be large over the next three to five years.\nBrent Bracelin: Super helpful color there. And a quick follow-up for Mike. Three-year annual growth rate for EA is over 20%. It slipped below 10% in Q1, spiked now about 30% here in Q2, excluding the licensing multiyear deals. If you continue to see enterprise workload migrations happen, why can't you continue to see strength in EA?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So a couple of things. I think as Dev mentioned, some of the Relational Migrations, with the destination of those, whether it's Enterprise Advanced or Atlas will depend on the customers cloud strategy and their overall approach from like an IT strategy standpoint. Certainly, some of that could benefit EA, and we've continued to see robust adoption and adoption of new workloads within that EA customer base. I think the key thing, at least thinking about the back half of this year, and as you start thinking about next year, is just we have had very strong results from EA. And so we think about EA on a compare basis, I just think it's really important to keep in mind.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open.\nJason Ader: Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just wanted to get a sense on EA. You talked about doing a good job of existing customers adding incremental workloads. What's the main driver there? Is there something you're doing differently? Or do you think it's just maturity and customers getting more comfortable with you for more workloads?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. I think it's really a function of people really recognizing that MongoDB is truly a standard. It's a platform they can bet on to run the most mission-critical use cases and the flexibility of the deployment models means that they can start on-prem, but they can always migrate to the cloud. And so that optional -- that built-in optionality also makes going to EA that much more comforting because it's not like they'll be locked into an on-prem solution or locked into some proprietary cloud solutions. So that that's why I believe, just given our maturity given how we're really becoming a standard in so many organizations, people are much more comfortable doubling down on EA.\nJason Ader: Got you. And then just to follow up on that on EA question. It seems like -- I mean, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seems like maybe you've been a little bit surprised at the strength of EA relative to Atlas over last year. I mean Atlas has been really strong, too, but EA has, I think, surprised you more to the upside. What does that say, I guess, about kind of on-prem versus cloud or self-managed versus fully managed. Any comments on that, Dev?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. What I would say is it really is a reinforcement that customers still will run workloads on-prem, that they still will run workload they want to manage themselves versus use a managed service like Atlas. And so -- and I think customers value choice. And customers value the ability to have different deployment models, but also value the fact that if they want to migrate from one deployment model to another, it's easiest to do so using MongoDB. So I think what we're really seeing is customers valuing choice and to run anywhere strategy is really resonating with customers.\nMichael Gordon: And I would just add, Jason, that the premise of your question is correct. We have been very surprised, obviously, pleasantly so, with the performance of EA. It's been terrific to see, but it's definitely been surprising to the upside.\nJason Ader: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question, please. And the next question will be coming from Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. So Atlas revenue grew by almost $30 million quarter-over-quarter, which is the highest you've ever seen it. Certainly, that performance is better than any of the other consumption models you're seeing. It seems like the commentary at least on Atlas, consumption was pretty consistent with your expectations and still a bit below where it had been pre some of the macro challenges. So could you just kind of unpack what what's driving that strength and revision back to kind of record high levels of sequential dollar adds? Is it better pricing just given some of the sales changes you made or perhaps maybe it's the new AI use cases that you talked about. If you could just help us understand that a bit better. Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Tyler. A few things. If you're looking at an absolute dollars basis, obviously, the business is much larger. So let's start with that. Secondly, if we're looking at the sequential from Q1 to Q2, remember, Q1 has fewer days. And so that's obviously part of the dynamic, and you'll see that historically as well. And then third, we had talked about the Q1 consumption being better than planned, and therefore, the starting ARR in Q2 being better. We saw the consumption itself kind of once we had that -- once you kind of adjust for that higher starting base, broadly in line with our expectations. So slightly better, but not big upside there. And when we look at it in the back half of the year, that's what we're continuing to assume is that same trend line, obviously, seasonally adjusted based on those emerging seasonal patterns. But that's really how to kind of tie and square all the numbers.\nTyler Radke: Okay. That's helpful. And then a follow-up question, just in terms of the excitement, obviously, out in the industry around generative AI. But I guess I'm curious specifically how internally you're using generative AI in products like relational migrator to automate a lot of the re-architecture process? And secondly, are you seeing a greater appetite from customers to modernize kind of legacy transactional applications. And is that starting to pick up just given the excitement around Gen AI? Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So with regards to Gen AI, I mean, we do see opportunities, essentially, the reason when you migrate off using Relational Migrator, there's really three things you have to focus on. One is mapping the schema from the old relational database to the MongoDB platform. Moving the data appropriately and then also rewriting some, if not all, of the application code. Historically, that last component has been the most manually intensive part of the migration, obviously, with the advance of code generation tools, there\u2019s opportunities to automate the rewriting of the application code. I think we're still in the very early days. You'll see us continue to add new functionality to Relational Migrator to help again reduce the switching costs of doing so. And that's obviously an area that we're going to focus. So that's in some ways, a big opportunity for us. And Tyler, there was the second part to your question, which I...\nTyler Radke: Yeah. Yeah, it was just around the customer appetite, like is that the frenzy around Gen AI, is that causing an acceleration in the pace in which customers want to take on these modernization projects?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So I would say that the recent MongoDB is well suited for these new modernization projects is, one, obviously, the data that's trapped in these legacy platforms is incredibly important if you want to leverage that proprietary data for a competitive advantage. Two, is that the performance requirements of these new modern applications require a new modern platform. And three, because it's such an iterative area where people are -- is changing so quickly, you all see the platform that's inherently flexible. So that's driving people to move to MongoDB and to more modern platforms more quickly. So unlike the old lift and shift where people are just trying to say, avoid paying the Oracle tax, now people are being much more thoughtful about not just lifting and shifting, but modernizing and going off relational to MongoDB. And that's definitely a trend that's increasing.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Tyler.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from Patrick Walravens of JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [Owen] (ph) for Pat. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong quarter. Just a quick one for me. What will the pricing structure for some of the new features like Vector Search and Stream Processing be?\nDev Ittycheria: So the pricing will be a function of the -- obviously, the consumption of the back-end infrastructure that supports those new capabilities. So they'll show up as essentially more consumption of Atlas clusters, or increases of clusters depending on the load of the application, and will show up on the Atlas revenue line.\nPatrick Walravens: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from Michael Turits of KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nMichael Turits: Hello?\nDev Ittycheria: Hey, Michael.\nMichael Turits: My name got [indiscernible], I wasn't sure it was me. Thanks. Quick one for you, Mike, and then one for Dev. Very quick. Mike, are you able to comment on the linearity in the quarter relative to those consumption growth trends and how we exited? And then, Dev, for you, you just said that you think that Vector Search is a feature, not a product. There are as you know, two databases deliberately out there, explicitly out there in the market. And then, you, as well as others, who don't have vector databases, including Google, with [Allo] (ph) the other day, are talking about the applicability of their databases for vector embedding. So can you talk about how that's playing out as far as you can tell with customers in terms of their receptivity of looking for something besides a dedicated vector database for this? So linear question and then that one.\nMichael Gordon: Sure. Yeah, just quickly in linear, I don't think there's anything particularly point out of note there.\nDev Ittycheria: And so regarding Vector Search, and I've shared this with other -- talked about this previously, Vector Search is really a reverse index. So it's like an index that's built into all databases. I believe, over time, Vector Search functionality will be built into all databases or data platforms in the future. Yes, there are some point products that are just focused solely on Vector Search. But essentially, it's a point product that still needs to be used with other technologies like MongoDB to store the metadata, the data to be able to process and analyze all that information. So developers have spoken loudly that having a unified and elegant developer experience is a key differentiator. It removes friction in how they work. It's much easier to build and innovate on one platform as learning and supporting multiple technologies. And so my strong belief is that, ultimately, Vector Search will be embedded in many platforms and our differentiation will be, again, like it always has been a very compelling and elegant developer experience.\nMichael Turits: Thanks, Dev and Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from Mike Cikos of Needham. Your line is open. Mike Cikos of Needham, your line is open.\nMike Cikos: I'm sorry. I apologize, the operator [indiscernible] Thanks for getting me on the call here, guys. If I could just follow up on, Dev, your comments there in response to Michael on the Vector Search. I know that we're talking about the developers and how they they're voting here because they want the data in a unified platform, a unified database that preserves all that metadata, right? But I would think there's probably also a benefit to having it all in a single platform as well just because you're lowering the TCO for your customers as well, right? They're not paying a tax for the movement or duplication of all that data between different vendors. Is that also a fair assumption when I'm thinking about the potential that you guys bring versus maybe some of those more point features or databases out there?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, with vectors, vectors are really a mathematical representation of different types of data. So there\u2019s not a tonne of data, unlike application search, where there's a profound benefits by storing everything on one platform versus having an operational database and a search database and some glue to keep the data in sync. That's not as much the case with Vector because you're talking about storing essentially an elegant index. And so it's more about the user experience and the development workflow that really matters. And what we believe is that offering the same taxonomy in the same way they know how to use MongoDB to also be able to enable Vector Search functionality is a much more compelling differentiation than a developer have to bolt-on a separate vector solution and have to provision, configure and manage that solution along with all the other things they have to do.\nMike Cikos: Got it. Thank you for helping clear my understanding on that. And then just a quick follow-up for Michael. Michael, I've gotten a couple of inbounds just trying to unpack the Q3 revenue guide here, specifically as it pertains to Atlas. And I think what people are looking at is, I think Atlas embed slower sequential growth on a daily consumption basis. The questions I'm getting are, was there anything onetime 2Q that would cause us to think that the daily Atlas consumption growth would decelerate going into 3Q? Or anything else you can tease out there while we have you?\nMichael Gordon: No. I think if you look at what we said is the real underlying reason for the increase, obviously, we don't guide by product, but we are trying to give you a whole bunch of color around it, the real increase -- and the Atlas number is given the slight outperformance in Q2, we have a starter hiring ARR in Q2, and that's at the beginning of Q3. And that's really what's flowing through in the numbers and in the guidance.\nMike Cikos: Terrific. Thank you very much guys, I appreciate it.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Mike.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Mile.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session for today. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Dev Ittycheria, CEO, for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I just want to reinforce that we had another strong quarter of new business performance, which really validates our value proposition and our run anywhere strategy. Again, we remain focused on our North Star, which is acquiring new workloads, both from new workloads -- new customers and existing customers. And we're innovating both on the product and go-to-market dimensions to accelerate workload acquisition. And while it's early days, we believe that with the rise of AI, MongoDB will be a beneficiary of as AI becomes more prominent. Thank you very much, and I appreciate all your time. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating and enjoy the rest of your evening. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our second quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2024. First, I'll start with our second quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $423.8 million, up 40% year-over-year. As Dev mentioned, we continue to see a healthy new business environment especially in terms of acquiring new workloads within existing customers. To us, this is confirmation we remain a top priority for our customers and that our value proposition continues to resonate even in this market. Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 38% in the quarter compared to the previous year and represents 63% of total revenue compared to 64% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 65% last quarter. In Q2, Atlas slightly declined as a percentage of revenue due to the exceptionally strong performance of our non-Atlas business, underscoring the demand for MongoDB regardless of where customers are in their cloud adoption journey. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely related to end-user activity of the application, which can be affected by macroeconomic factors. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. Consumption growth in Q2 was slightly better than our expectations. As a reminder, we had assumed Atlas would continue to be impacted by the difficult macro environment in Q2, and that is largely how the quarter played out. Turning to non-Atlas revenues. EA significantly exceeded our expectations in the quarter, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our EA customer base. We continue to see that our customers, regardless of their mode of deployment, are launching more workloads at MongoDB and moving towards standardizing on our platform. The EA revenue outperformance was in part a result of more multiyear deals than we had expected. In addition, we had an exceptionally strong quarter in our other licensing revenues. On our last call, we mentioned that we would benefit from a few large multiyear licensing deals, most notably the renewal and extension of our relationship with Alibaba. We also closed some additional multiyear licensing deals in the quarter, which is a meaningful contributor to our outperformance and another sign of popularity of MongoDB and the success of our run anywhere strategy. As a reminder, under ASC 606 for both EA and licensing contracts, the term license component even for multiyear deals, is recognized as upfront revenue. Turning to customer growth. During the second quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 45,000, which is up from over 37,000 in the year period. Of our total customer count, over 6,800 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 5,400 in the year ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 43,500 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 35,500 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. Let me double-click into our direct customer count. As Dev mentioned, we're becoming increasingly sophisticated in how we engage our customers. But some of those motions result in the line between our direct sales and our self-service channels becoming more fluid. I thought it'd be helpful to highlight two particular inter-channel dynamics that impact the channel breakdown of our reported customer counts. While these customer movements represent less than 1% of our ARR, we do expect both of these trends to continue into the future, and so we wanted to make sure you understood how they affect our reported customer counts by channel. First, we are having increasing success leveraging cloud provider self-service marketplaces to drive new customer additions. Growing cloud marketplace volumes is a major secular trend, and we are the only ISV available on all three hyperscaler marketplaces. Customers can deploy Atlas in seconds through cloud provider consoles and can pay for it by drawing down their existing cloud commitments. This further reduces friction as it bypasses the need for our contract altogether. For this reason, our direct sales team has been directing certain new prospects to sign-up using self-serve marketplaces. We've added several hundred customers using this approach in recent quarters, and these customers show up in our self-serve customer count even though we have a direct sales relationship with them. Second, we continually review and analyze product usage signals to determine the potential of our customers. Because we are focused on velocity and efficiency of new workload acquisition, we're very careful not to deploy our reps on accounts where we don't see significant incremental benefit from sales rep coverage. If we determine that a direct sales customer can be supported more cost effectively in the self-serve channel, we'd prefer to free up the rep's time to focus on winning more new workloads. So far this year, we've moved over 300 small mid-market direct sales customers to the self-service channel. Moving on to ARR. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,855 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,462 in the year ago period. Moving down the income statement. I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the second quarter was $329 million, representing a gross margin of 78%, which is up from 73% in the year ago period. It is important to keep in mind that this quarter, we saw exceptional performance of our EA and licensing revenue, which contains a large upfront license component and very high margins, and therefore, we wouldn't expect to repeat this performance. Our income from operations was $79.1 million or a 19% operating margin for the second quarter compared to a negative 4% margin in the year ago period. Our strong bottom-line results demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our model and are a clear indication of the strength in our underlying unit economics. The primary reason for our operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. Net income in the second quarter was $76.7 million or $0.93 per share based on 82.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net loss of $15.6 million or $0.23 per share on 68.3 million base weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was negative $25.3 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $27.3 million in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $48.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Three things of note on our cash flow performance in the quarter. First, as many of you know, Q2 tends to be our seasonally lowest collections quarter of the year because of low contract volumes in Q1, as evidenced by our Q1 ending accounts receivable balance. Second, while our revenue reflects the ASC 606 treatment of multiyear EA and licensing deals, most multiyear contracts are still billed annually, so there's no equivalent benefit to cash flow. Finally, as Dev mentioned, we continue de-emphasizing the value of upfront commitments. So we're seeing fewer of them. In other words, we are intentionally collecting less cash upfront in order to win more workloads more quickly. As evidence of this, we grew Atlas revenue 38% year-over-year, while Atlas dollars committed upfront actually declined by 15% year-over-year. Lower upfront commitments only impact the timing of when our customers pay us, not the total payment. But this trend of declining upfront commitments will impact the relationship between our non-GAAP operating income and operating cash flow in the medium term. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2024. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $400 million to $404 million, we expect non-GAAP income from moderations to be in the range of $41 million to $44 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.50 based on 83.5 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year '24, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.596 billion to $1.608 billion. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $189 million to $197 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $2.27 and to $2.35 based on 83 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2024 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll provide some more context on our guidance. First, we have modestly raised our outlook for the rest of the year, primarily to reflect a slightly stronger Q2 and therefore a higher starting ARR for the second half. We continue to expect that Atlas consumption growth will be impacted by the difficult macroeconomic environment throughout fiscal '24. Our revised full year revenue guidance continues to assume consumption growth that is, on average, in line with the consumption growth we've experienced in the slowdown began in Q2 of last year, but with a slight seasonal benefit in Q3 and a slowdown in Q4 as observed over the last two years. Second, we expect to see a significant sequential decline in non-Atlas revenues in Q3 as we simply do expect similar new business activity, especially when it comes to licensing deals. For that particular line of business, Q2 was just an extreme positive outlier. Third, we're raising our non-Atlas revenue estimate for the rest of the year, even though we don't expect our exceptional Q2 performance to repeat in the second half, our results in the first half give us incremental confidence in our run anywhere strategy. We continue to expect, however, that the difficult compare in the back half of the year will impact our non-Atlas growth rate. Finally, thanks to strong performance in Q2 and the increased revenue outlook, we're meaningfully increasing our assumption for operating margins in fiscal '24 to 12% at the midpoint of our guidance. an improvement of more than 700 basis points compared to fiscal '23, while continuing to invest to pursue our long-term opportunity. As you update your models, please keep in mind that the majority of our planned fiscal '24 hiring will actually occur in the second half of the year. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent second quarter results in a difficult environment. We are pleased with our ability to win new business and are demonstrating the operating leverage inherent in our model. While we continue to monitor the macro environment, we remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead [Technical Difficulty] to maximize our long-term value. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Yes. I would just add that also as part of the broader developer data platform, it gives us the opportunity to win more workloads in the beginning. So you've got both sort of new workload penetration piece, which Dev mentioned, but also sort of the increased Atlas number is where it will show up on a revenue standpoint. Thank you. And on your other question, Keith, it's been a multiyear journey where we've been focused on reducing friction and accelerating new workload adoption. I do think as we called out, we continue to make additional steps and Dev called out some of the specific incremental steps this year. I think it's part of a transition. If you look at the Atlas revenue growth, Atlas grew 38% year-over-year, but dollars collected upfront shrank 15%, right? And so that gives you a sense for the magnitude or the divergence there that's showing up in the op income versus OCF bridge. I think like most things, there'll be a transition time period, but then it will settle into a more normalized level, but I think we've still got like a little bit more transition to go as we kind of work through the balance of the year. Yeah. So a couple of things. Thanks, Brad, for the question. In general, for us, even before the sort of evolution and changes in multiyear deals, typically, they were not all paid upfront. Typically, ours has been annually billed. But yes, to your point, I think as we've reduced upfront commitment, you have a couple of dynamics. The key one is when we are not motivating it or providing an incentive to our sales force, and it winds up being customer driven, the leverage in that negotiation shifts. And on the margin, that is helpful for the ultimate pricing or discount and winds up with sort of better pricing for us, less discounting to the customer. Yeah. I would think about it as availability rather than cost and then throw in some of the dynamics with some places around different return to office models and other things. I think that sort of incrementally is likely to provide opportunities in the back half of the year. And as they present themselves, we'll certainly pursue those. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, Karl. No, other deals, not Alibaba. Alibaba was baked at the time of the last guidance call. So it was sort of incremental deals that surprised us to the upside there. And yes, obviously, it's a volatile or variable, especially given the 606 and the nature of it where it goes, given the lumpiness of the term license revenue and things like that. And so, yes, I think that this is not repeatable performance, and I think it should settle back down to a more -- to a lower and more normalized level. Yeah. I think it's the same explanation or discussion overlaid with our recurring discussion around billings, and that's sort of not a metric that we focused on and that we sort of discourage people from using and we're focused sort of on those workloads and winning new workloads rather than large upfront commitments. But one of the ways that plays out is absolutely in deferred and for anyone still doing defer -- I mean, calculated billings. Calculations that will affect that there as well. Yes. The other thing that I'd add, which is probably implicit and comes across that, but I think it's important enough to make explicit is one thing that, that sort of, Rich, in your question, sort of the slice-by-slice view misses is the aggregate benefit of delivering the whole platform, right, in delivering a common integrated unified experience to developers so they don't have to use a bunch of point solutions. And I think that's really a key part of the strategy. Yeah. So a couple of things. I think as Dev mentioned, some of the Relational Migrations, with the destination of those, whether it's Enterprise Advanced or Atlas will depend on the customers cloud strategy and their overall approach from like an IT strategy standpoint. Certainly, some of that could benefit EA, and we've continued to see robust adoption and adoption of new workloads within that EA customer base. I think the key thing, at least thinking about the back half of this year, and as you start thinking about next year, is just we have had very strong results from EA. And so we think about EA on a compare basis, I just think it's really important to keep in mind. And I would just add, Jason, that the premise of your question is correct. We have been very surprised, obviously, pleasantly so, with the performance of EA. It's been terrific to see, but it's definitely been surprising to the upside. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Tyler. A few things. If you're looking at an absolute dollars basis, obviously, the business is much larger. So let's start with that. Secondly, if we're looking at the sequential from Q1 to Q2, remember, Q1 has fewer days. And so that's obviously part of the dynamic, and you'll see that historically as well. And then third, we had talked about the Q1 consumption being better than planned, and therefore, the starting ARR in Q2 being better. We saw the consumption itself kind of once we had that -- once you kind of adjust for that higher starting base, broadly in line with our expectations. So slightly better, but not big upside there. And when we look at it in the back half of the year, that's what we're continuing to assume is that same trend line, obviously, seasonally adjusted based on those emerging seasonal patterns. But that's really how to kind of tie and square all the numbers. Sure. Yeah, just quickly in linear, I don't think there's anything particularly point out of note there. No. I think if you look at what we said is the real underlying reason for the increase, obviously, we don't guide by product, but we are trying to give you a whole bunch of color around it, the real increase -- and the Atlas number is given the slight outperformance in Q2, we have a starter hiring ARR in Q2, and that's at the beginning of Q3. And that's really what's flowing through in the numbers and in the guidance. Thanks, Mile."

            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we had another exceptional quarter as we continue to execute well despite challenging market conditions. I will start by reviewing our second-quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $424 million, a 40% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 38% year-over-year, representing 63% of revenue, and is now a $1 billion-plus revenue run-rate product. We generated a non-GAAP operating margin -- operating income of $79 million for a record 19% non-GAAP operating margin, and we had another solid quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 45,000 customers. Overall, we delivered an exceptional Q2. We had a healthy quarter of new business acquisitions, led by continued strength in new workload acquisition within our existing customers. From a new logo perspective, we added 1,900 new customers in the quarter. Our direct sales team had another strong quarter of Enterprise customer additions. Finally, our Enterprise Advanced and other non-Atlas business significantly exceeded our expectations, another indication of our strong product market fit and the appeal of our run anywhere strategy. Moving on to Atlas consumption trends, the quarter played out slightly better than our expectations. Michael will discuss consumption trends in more detail. Finally, retention rates remained strong in Q2, reinforcing the mission criticality of our platform, even in a difficult spending environment. As we've told you in the past, our market is different from most other software markets because the unit of competition is a workload, not a customer. We started customer relationships by acquiring the first workload and we grew from there acquiring incremental workloads over time. Over the last few years, we have oriented our entire company around winning more workloads. Starting with product. At our New York user conference held in June, we made a number of product announcements that will position us to capture more workloads faster. We introduced Atlas Stream Processing, which enables developers to work with streaming data to build sophisticated event-driven applications, the flexibility of the document model and the power of the MongoDB Query Language provide a compelling and differentiated way to process streaming data compared to alternative approaches. Our early access program is meaningfully been oversubscribed as customers realize they can use a familiar and easy approach to work with streaming data and immediately see value. We announced the general availability of Relational Migrator, which makes it easier for customers to migrate their existing relational applications to MongoDB. We are seeing increased adoption across industries and geographies. For example, a leading international retailer was able to leverage Relational Migrator to dramatically accelerate their migration of Oracle. We also announced Atlas Vector Search, which enables developers to store, index, and query vector embeddings instead of having to bolt-on vector search functionality separately adding yet another point solution and creating a more fragmented developer experience, developers can aggregate and process the vectorized data they need to build AI applications, while also using MongoDB to aggregate and process data and metadata. We're seeing significant interest in our Vector Search offering from large and sophisticated enterprise customers, even though it's only -- still only in preview. As one example, a large global management consulting firm is using Atlas -- Atlas Vector Search for internal research applications that allows consultants to semantically search over 1.5 million expert interview transcripts. Over time, AI functionality will make developers more productive to the use of code generation and code assist tools that enable them to build more applications faster. Developers will also be able to enrich applications with compelling AI experiences by enabling integration with either proprietary or open-source, large language models to deliver more impact. Now instead of data being used only by data scientists to drive insights, data can be used by developers to build smarter applications that truly transform the business. These AI applications will be exceptionally demanding, requiring a truly modern operational data platform like MongoDB. In fact, we believe MongoDB has an even stronger competitive advantage in the world of AI. First, the document model's inherent flexibility and versatility renders it a natural fit for AI applications. Developers can easily manage and process various data types all in one place. Second, AI applications require high-performance, parallel computations, and the ability to scale data processing on an ever-growing base of data. MongoDB supports its features with features like sharding and auto-scaling. Lastly, it is important to remember that AI applications have the same demand as any other type of application, transactional guarantees, security and privacy requirements, tech search, in-app analytics, and more. Our developer data platform gives developer a unified solution to build smarter AI applications. We are seeing these applications developed across a wide variety of customer types and use cases. For example, Observe.AI is an AI startup that leverages 40 billion parameter LLM to provide customers with intelligence and coaching that maximize performance of their frontline support and sales teams. Observe.AI processes and run models on millions of support touchpoints daily to generate insights for the customers. Most of this rich unstructured data is stored in MongoDB. Observe.AI chose to build on MongoDB, because we enabled them to quickly innovate, scale to handle large and unpredictable workloads and meet the security requirements of their largest enterprise customers. On the other end of the spectrum is one of the leading industrial equipment suppliers in North America. This company relies on Atlas and Atlas Device Sync to deploy AI models at the edge. To their field teams, mobile devices to better manage and predict inventory in areas with poor physical network connectivity, they chose MongoDB because of our ability to efficiently handle large quantities of distributed data and to seamlessly integrate between the network edge and their back-end systems. As much as we innovate our products, we also continuously innovate and how we engage with our customers. We are highly focused on reducing friction in the sales process, so we can acquire more workloads quickly and cost-effectively given the large size of our market opportunity. Historically, the most significant source of friction has been negotiating with customers to secure an upfront Atlas commitment since it can be hard for customers to forecast consumption growth for a new workload. Given our high retention rates and the underlying consumption growth, several years ago, we began reducing the importance of upfront commitments in our go-to-market process to accelerate workload acquisition. This year, we took additional steps in that direction. For example, we no longer incentivize reps to sign customers to one-year commitments. Obviously, this has short-term impacts on our cash flow, but positions us better for the longer term by accelerating workload acquisition. We are pleased with the impact these changes have had on the business in the first half of the year, specifically, new workload acquisition has accelerated, especially within existing customers. We believe that our efforts to reduce friction are resulting in more efficient growth and we'll always look for ways to improve our go-to-market approach to make it even easier for customers to bring new workloads onto our platform. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries, including Renault, Hootsuite, and Ford are running mission-critical projects on MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform. One of the 2023 MongoDB North American Innovation Award winners is Ford. With a focus on innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction, Ford is a leader in the automotive industry and a household name around the world. Ford is committed to developing advanced technologies that enhance the safety, performance, and sustainability of its vehicles. Their data explorer and transportation mobility cloud applications aggregate customer vehicle data from 24 different sources at a volume ranging up to 15 terabytes. Since migrating to MongoDB Atlas from the previous solution, Ford has seen a 50% performance improvement and faster rewrite times. Cathay Pacific, Foot Locker, and Market Access are examples of customers turning to MongoDB to free up the developer's time for innovation while achieving significant cost savings. Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's home airline carrier operating in more than 60 destinations worldwide, turned to MongoDB on their journey to become one of the first airlines to create a truly paperless flight deck. Flight Folder, their application built on MongoDB, consolidates dozens of different information sources into one place and includes a digital refueling feature that helps crews become much more efficient with fueling strategies, saving significant flight time and costs. Since the Flight Folder launch, Cathay Pacific has completed more than 340,000 flights with full digital integration in the flight deck. In addition to the greatly improved flight crew experience, flight times have been reduced and the digital refueling has saved eight minutes on the ground on average. All these efficiencies have helped the company avoid the release of 15,000 tons of carbon and save an estimated $12.5 million. Powerledger, Wells Fargo, and System1 are among customers turning to MongoDB to modernize existing applications. System1, a customer acquisition marketing company acquired MapQuest in 2019. At the time of the acquisition, MapQuest had a fragmented architecture that mixed disparate data persistent technologies with third-party services. System1 selected Atlas as a key piece of MapQuest's architecture transformation and has realized estimated cost reductions of 75% and performance improvements of 20% over its prior relational database solution. MapQuest is planning a number of future projects that we use Atlas search and time series collections to improve the user experience and create a feedback loop and location-based relevancy in different cities. In summary, I am incredibly stoked with our second-quarter results. Our ability to win new workloads remained strong and our run anywhere strategy is resonating with customers. While it's early days on AI, we continue to see evidence that MongoDB will be a platform of choice for AI applications, just like we are for other modern and demanding applications. We continue to invest to maximize our long-term potential. With that, here's Michael. Sure. So Raimo, the trends for EA, I think, is just an indication of our run anywhere strategy. We've been very committed to that strategy since the beginning. As you know, we started with EA and then introduced Atlas. But the whole point is that we give customers choice and we want to meet customers where they are in terms of what deployment model they want to use. And so I think this is just puts and takes of the quarter where we had a number of customers who wanted to double down on EA. And we also had some other non-Atlas business come in, in the quarter, which showed up in our results. But it's really a confirmation of the fact that we give customers choice and customers really appreciate that, and that's what you've seen in the results. With regards to, I think you said streaming and vector, those will show up in the Atlas revenue line as incremental consumption. There won't be a separate SKU. But what it will do is drive, as those workloads come on, that will drive incremental consumption of Atlas, which will show up in the Atlas revenue line. Thanks, Raimo. So, Keith, on AI, obviously, we're really excited about the opportunity that AI presents. We continue to add many more AI customers this quarter. In the short term, we're really excited about some of the use cases we're seeing. We talked about Observe.Ai, the management consulting company, a more traditional company using MongoDB for very impactful AI use case. And longer term, we believe our developer data platform value prop will just drive more AI adoption. People want to use one compelling, unified developer experience to address a wide variety of use cases of which AI is just one of them. And we're definitely hearing from customers to being able to do that on one platform versus bolting on a bunch of point solutions is far more the preferable approach. And so we're excited about the opportunity there. And I think you had some questions -- on the other thing on partners, I do want to say that we're seeing a lot of work and activity with our partner channel on the AI front as well. We're working with Google in the AI start-up program, and there's a lot of excitement. Google had their next conference this week. We're also working with Google to help train Codey, their code generation tool to help people accelerate the development of AI and other applications. And we're seeing a lot of interest in our own AI innovators program. We've had lots of customers apply for that program. So we're super excited about the interest that we're generating. Thank you, Keith. Sure. So regarding relational migrators, it's important for investors to know that this is really a high-end enterprise play. That's where the bulk of the legacy relational market is. And Relational Migrator is designed to help customers reduce the switching cost of migrating off relational databases to MongoDB for both EA and Atlas. So it's a place to -- depending again on the customer's choice of their deployment model but it's really meant to reducing the switching costs. I would say that there was no real impact in terms of revenue of customers using Relational Migrator because we just only made it generally available in June. But there's a tremendous amount of excitement. We have a large pipeline of customers who are very interested and are actually starting to use Relational Migrator and projects have begun, but there was no real impact on the quarter. Regarding your second question about some of the new products and the impact of AI long term, what I would say is we definitely believe it will have a big impact long term. We think that things like Vector Search just make it so much easier to build smarter applications on MongoDB that unified developer experience is a key differentiator. There's a really strong interest in our Public Preview product. We also see a lot of interest in Stream Processing. Stream Processing is a use case that's really optimized for MongoDB. The data is typically JSON, the variability of the data lends itself to a document model that's much more flexible. It's obviously very developer-oriented, where all the alternatives are using very rigid schemas and are much more complicated to use that plays into our sweet spot. So we think we have a big opportunity there. But -- and so it's hard to quantify what that impact will be in the long term, but I will tell you that we're really excited and the interest level on the new products is incredibly high. Thank you, Kash. Yeah. What I would say, Brad, is that, I would say, in general, obviously, the frothiness of a few years ago has abated, but for certain skill sets, there's still significant premium for talent, and we don't want to lower our bar just to optimize on cost. We pride ourselves on recruiting the best of the best in this industry. And we focus on paying market rates. And so while it's a little easier because the market is a little softer, I wouldn't suggest that all of a sudden, we're getting employees at a massive discount. Yeah. So Rich, thanks for your question. I would say, obviously, the general operational workload of what you call the OLTP workload is still our bread and butter. Workloads that people come to us and relational migrator would just be more of that because of the migrating operational workloads of relational databases to MongoDB. And then the other use case really, other products really function of the use cases that customers are really interested in. For example, Atlas Device Sync, which is really focused on the enterprise mobility play, for example, point-of-sale devices for the retail industry in automotive, connected car in manufacturing, instrumenting the factory floor. So it really depends on the use cases. In application search, we're really seeing an acceleration of large workloads in that -- for that product. So we're really excited about the size of some of the business that we're seeing there. Obviously, Vector is still in public preview. So we hope to have a GA sometime next year, but we're really excited about the early and high interest from enterprises. And obviously, some customers are already deploying it in production, even though it's a public preview product. Streaming is something that we're super excited about. This is more for event-driven real-time applications. It's just very suitable for MongoDB due to the -- most of the data is in JSON and the flexibility of [document] (ph) model makes it a very compelling play. And so I would say that, it really depends on the customer's use case. What it really does is it just enables us to go after more workloads more quickly, and it really positions us as a truly strategic supplier to large enterprises and obviously, a critical supplier for early-stage companies, and that's our strategy, is to get customers to use MongoDB for a variety of use cases across a variety of deployment models. Yeah. So Brent, thanks for your question. I firmly believe that we, as an industry, tend to overestimate the impact of a new technology in the short term and underestimate the impact in the long term. So as you may know, there's a lot of hype in the market right now, in the industry right around AI and in some of the early stage companies in the space have -- the valuations are to the roof. In some cases, almost -- it's hard to see how people can make money because the risk reward doesn't seem to be sized appropriately. So there's a lot of hype in the space. But I do think that AI will be a big impact for the industry and for us long term. I believe that almost every application, both new and existing, will have some AI functionality embedded into the application over the next -- in your horizon three to five years. And let me just remind people why we see -- where we see AI impacting our business. One, developers will become far more productive with the use of code generation and code assist tools. What that will mean is like that will lead to more applications, which means they need more databases and more data platforms. Second, developers will use things like generative AI to just build smarter and more intelligent applications. One, they don't want to use point solutions because it's clear developers want one platform to process and analyze data and metadata and vectorized data and MongoDB is that platform. So which is why in so much interest. And Vector Search, I believe, is really ultimately a feature, not a product. And essentially, it's basically enabling people to marry private data with public data to really offer a compelling experience and there's so much interest in our public preview right now. And as we -- as I mentioned earlier, we've continued to add many more AI customers this quarter and we think the impact will be big. But in the short term, these are still smaller workloads, but they're going to grow over time. Some of the use cases are really interesting, but the fact is that we're really well positioned because what generative AI does is really instantiate AI in front of -- in software, which means developers play a bigger role rather than data scientists, and that's where you'll really see the business impact. And I think that impact will be large over the next three to five years. Yeah. I think it's really a function of people really recognizing that MongoDB is truly a standard. It's a platform they can bet on to run the most mission-critical use cases and the flexibility of the deployment models means that they can start on-prem, but they can always migrate to the cloud. And so that optional -- that built-in optionality also makes going to EA that much more comforting because it's not like they'll be locked into an on-prem solution or locked into some proprietary cloud solutions. So that that's why I believe, just given our maturity given how we're really becoming a standard in so many organizations, people are much more comfortable doubling down on EA. Yeah. What I would say is it really is a reinforcement that customers still will run workloads on-prem, that they still will run workload they want to manage themselves versus use a managed service like Atlas. And so -- and I think customers value choice. And customers value the ability to have different deployment models, but also value the fact that if they want to migrate from one deployment model to another, it's easiest to do so using MongoDB. So I think what we're really seeing is customers valuing choice and to run anywhere strategy is really resonating with customers. Yeah. So with regards to Gen AI, I mean, we do see opportunities, essentially, the reason when you migrate off using Relational Migrator, there's really three things you have to focus on. One is mapping the schema from the old relational database to the MongoDB platform. Moving the data appropriately and then also rewriting some, if not all, of the application code. Historically, that last component has been the most manually intensive part of the migration, obviously, with the advance of code generation tools, there's opportunities to automate the rewriting of the application code. I think we're still in the very early days. You'll see us continue to add new functionality to Relational Migrator to help again reduce the switching costs of doing so. And that's obviously an area that we're going to focus. So that's in some ways, a big opportunity for us. And Tyler, there was the second part to your question, which I... Yeah. So I would say that the recent MongoDB is well suited for these new modernization projects is, one, obviously, the data that's trapped in these legacy platforms is incredibly important if you want to leverage that proprietary data for a competitive advantage. Two, is that the performance requirements of these new modern applications require a new modern platform. And three, because it's such an iterative area where people are -- is changing so quickly, you all see the platform that's inherently flexible. So that's driving people to move to MongoDB and to more modern platforms more quickly. So unlike the old lift and shift where people are just trying to say, avoid paying the Oracle tax, now people are being much more thoughtful about not just lifting and shifting, but modernizing and going off relational to MongoDB. And that's definitely a trend that's increasing. Thanks, Tyler. So the pricing will be a function of the -- obviously, the consumption of the back-end infrastructure that supports those new capabilities. So they'll show up as essentially more consumption of Atlas clusters, or increases of clusters depending on the load of the application, and will show up on the Atlas revenue line. Hey, Michael. And so regarding Vector Search, and I've shared this with other -- talked about this previously, Vector Search is really a reverse index. So it's like an index that's built into all databases. I believe, over time, Vector Search functionality will be built into all databases or data platforms in the future. Yes, there are some point products that are just focused solely on Vector Search. But essentially, it's a point product that still needs to be used with other technologies like MongoDB to store the metadata, the data to be able to process and analyze all that information. So developers have spoken loudly that having a unified and elegant developer experience is a key differentiator. It removes friction in how they work. It's much easier to build and innovate on one platform as learning and supporting multiple technologies. And so my strong belief is that, ultimately, Vector Search will be embedded in many platforms and our differentiation will be, again, like it always has been a very compelling and elegant developer experience. Well, with vectors, vectors are really a mathematical representation of different types of data. So there's not a tonne of data, unlike application search, where there's a profound benefits by storing everything on one platform versus having an operational database and a search database and some glue to keep the data in sync. That's not as much the case with Vector because you're talking about storing essentially an elegant index. And so it's more about the user experience and the development workflow that really matters. And what we believe is that offering the same taxonomy in the same way they know how to use MongoDB to also be able to enable Vector Search functionality is a much more compelling differentiation than a developer have to bolt-on a separate vector solution and have to provision, configure and manage that solution along with all the other things they have to do. Thank you, Mike. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I just want to reinforce that we had another strong quarter of new business performance, which really validates our value proposition and our run anywhere strategy. Again, we remain focused on our North Star, which is acquiring new workloads, both from new workloads -- new customers and existing customers. And we're innovating both on the product and go-to-market dimensions to accelerate workload acquisition. And while it's early days, we believe that with the rise of AI, MongoDB will be a beneficiary of as AI becomes more prominent. Thank you very much, and I appreciate all your time. Take care."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong performance in the first quarter and we continue to execute well despite challenging market conditions. I will start by reviewing our first quarter results before giving you a broader company update. But first, I would like to personally invite all of you to the Investor session at MongoDB.local New York City to be held at the Javits Center on June 22. Please email ir@mongodb.com if you're interested in attending. Now turning to our results. We generated revenue of $368 million, a 29% year-over-year increase and above the high-end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 40% year-over-year, representing 65% of revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 43,100 customers. Overall, we delivered a strong Q1. We had a very healthy quarter of new business acquisition. We added approximately 2,300 customers during the quarter, the highest number in over two years, including over 300 new direct sales customers with notable strength in our Enterprise channel. Our ongoing new business success is due to the mission criticality of our platform and sharp execution by our go-to-market teams, who are navigating a difficult selling environment by remaining laser-focused on our North Star acquiring new workloads. In fact, this quarter, we acquired a record number of new workloads from our existing customers. Moving on to Atlas consumption trends. Q1 consumption was ahead of our expectations but remains below the levels we saw prior to the macro slowdown that began last year. Michael will share more detail on this. Finally, retention rates remained strong in Q1, reinforcing the enduring value in our platform. We are pleased with our results this quarter, especially given the difficult macro environment. It's clear, customers continue to scrutinize our technology investments and must decide which technologies are a must have versus a merely and nice to have. We believe that our Q1 performance and continued new business strength demonstrate that MongoDB is clearly a must have for customers. In today's digital economy, most companies express their business strategies through software. They use software to deliver their core value proposition, provide customers with great experiences and drive operational efficiency. MongoDB is an essential platform in this drive for innovation, making us the critical investment priority. Our customers ranging from the largest companies in the world to cutting-edge startups use our developer data platform to develop and run mission-critical applications. As these applications become successful, customers spend more with MongoDB. In other words, their spend on our platform is directly aligned with the usage of their underlying application, therefore, the value they derive from it. While the growth rate of existing applications can vary based on a number of factors including macro conditions, the relationship between application usage and growth -- application usage growth and MongoDB spend has remained consistent. We believe this is a testament to how well our value proposition is aligned to our customer success. Thinking about a long-term opportunity, I feel exceptionally confident about our core underlying growth driver, the need for companies to use software as a competitive advantage. Customers have ever-increasing expectations for better products, services and experiences, and companies rely on custom-built suffer to deliver these expectations better and faster than the competition. As I've said many times in the past, a durable competitive advantage is built through custom software, it cannot be obtained with an off-the-shelf product. Since most companies understand that they and their competition are all differentiating themselves through software, the speed of software development becomes existential. A McKinsey report found that companies that score in the top quartile of developer velocity generate revenue growth that is four times to five times faster than companies in the bottom quartile. MongoDB is built for speed. We believe AI will be the next frontier of development productivity -- developer productivity and will likely lead to a step-function increase in software development velocity. We know that most organizations have a huge backlog of projects they would like to take on, but they just don't have the development capacity to pursue. As developer productivity meaningfully improves, companies can dramatically increase their software ambitions and rapidly launch many more applications to transform their business. Consequently, the importance of development velocity to remain competitive will be even more pronounced. Said another way, if you are slow, then you're obsolete. Moreover, the shift to AI will favor modern platforms that offer a rich and sophisticated set of capabilities, delivered in a performance and scalable way. We are observing an emerging trend where customers are increasingly choosing Atlas as a platform to build and run new AI applications. For example, in Q1, more than 200 of the new Atlas customers were AI or ML companies. Well finance startups like Hugging Face, Tekion, One AI and [Nuro] (ph) are examples of companies using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered applications to their customers. We also believe that many existing applications will be re-platformed to be AI-enabled. This will be a compelling reason for customers to migrate from legacy technologies to MongoDB. To summarize, AI is just the latest example of the technology that promises to accelerate the production of more applications and greater demand for operational data stores, especially the ones best suited for modern data requirements such as MongoDB. We look forward to telling you more at our Investor session on June 22. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. MongoDB's developer data platform continues to gain momentum as customers across industries and around the world are running their mission-critical projects on Atlas. Organizations, including Anywhere Real Estate, GE Healthcare and Intuit are leveraging the power of our developer data platform. GE Healthcare has turned to MongoDB's developer data platform to manage the lifecycle of its IoT devices, imaging, ultrasound and other patient-care devices from deployment to retirement. They selected Atlas for its effective management, scalability, built-in security and multi-cloud support. GE Healthcare's use of Atlas helps healthcare providers enhance productivity by reducing the complexity and time required to manage databases, resulting in an 83% decrease in data retrieval time and enabling faster deployment of IoT devices. Many customers are turning to MongoDB to free up their developer's time for innovation, enabling them to move faster and deliver better customer experiences, while driving cost-savings. This includes China Mobile, Tata Digital and Grant Thornton International. China Mobile provides mobile voice and multimedia services via its nationwide mobile telecom network across Mainland China and Hong Kong. It is the world's largest mobile network operator by total number of subscribers. The telecom leader is using MongoDB to support one of its largest and most critical push services, which sends out billing details to more than 1 billion users every month. Prior to MongoDB, the tech team relied on Oracle. But as the user numbers increase, performance degraded. Despite large investments, it was still taking too long to do basic requests like finalize and deliver bills to users. As a result, China Mobile migrate this service to MongoDB after comprehensive testing and evaluation of alternatives. By taking advantage of MongoDB's native [sharding] (ph), they were able to improve performance by 80% and go from 50 Oracle machines to just 12 machines for the same workload. This service now handles all current requirements and is set up to scale with future growth. Digital transformation is redefining how organizations operate, and MongoDB is helping customers on this journey by delivering the developer data platform that powers the migration from on-premises to the cloud. Companies including Shutterfly, Radio and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank are example of customers leveraging MongoDB in their transformations. A leader in the HR and job finding tech space shifted from MongoDB Community to MongoDB Atlas during its journey to migrate its entire infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud. They selected MongoDB Atlas to give its developers full autonomy over their data, while freeing up the time they previously spent managing their database system to focus on innovation and improving the end user experience. During their migration journey to Atlas, the company identified [indiscernible] significant infrastructure reduction and subsequent cost-savings. In addition, the company has experienced 250% faster query performance and 300% faster right throughput on their applications built on Atlas. In summary, I'm pleased with our first quarter results in a difficult macro environment. Our ability to win new workloads remain strong and Atlas consumption trends were better than expected. We also believe that AI will accelerate application development, which would further stimulate demand for MongoDB. We continue to invest to maximize our long-term growth opportunities. With that, here's Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the first quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results, and then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2024. First, I'll start with our first quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $368.3 million, up 29% year-over-year. As Dev mentioned, we continue to see a healthy new business environment, both in terms of acquiring new customers, as well as acquiring new workloads within existing customers. To us, this is confirmation we remain a top priority for our customers and that our value proposition continues to resonate even in this market. Shifting to our product mix. Let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 40% in the quarter compared to the previous year and represents 65% of total revenue compared to 60% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and 65% last quarter. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely related to end-user activity of the application, which can be impacted by macroeconomic factors. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. As Dev mentioned, consumption growth in Q1 was above our expectations. This outperformance was broad-based and driven by stronger growth in underlying application usage. While Q1 consumption trends were better than expected, the growth remains below the levels we had experienced prior to the beginning of the slowdown in Q2 of last year. Turning to Enterprise Advanced. As you know, we will be facing very difficult EA compares throughout fiscal 2024, and Q1 was no exception as evidenced by our slower year-over-year EA revenue growth. However, EA revenues were up sequentially, which is better than what we had anticipated in our Q1 guidance. This is despite the fact that Q1 is typically a seasonally slower new business quarter for EA. Turning to customer growth. During the first quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 2,300 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 43,100, which is up from over 35,200 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 6,700 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 4,800 in the year-ago period. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net-new to our platform as well as self-serve customers with whom we've now established a direct sales relationship. We saw a strong quarter of customer -- of direct customer additions in our enterprise channel. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 41,600 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 33,700 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net expansion -- ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,761 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,379 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement. I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $279.9 million, representing a gross margin of 76%, which is up from 75% in the year-ago period. We're very pleased with our gross margin progression, especially in the context of Atlas representing 65% of our overall business. Our income from operations was $43.7 million, or 12% operating margin for the first quarter compared to a 6% margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for our strong operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. In addition, Q1 benefited from the timing of marketing programs, internal events and other expenses, which we now expect to incur later in the year. Net income for the first quarter was $45.3 million or $0.56 per share based on 81.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to net income of $15.2 million or $0.20 per share on 77 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the first quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $53.7 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $51.8 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $8.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2024. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $388 million to $392 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $36 million to $39 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.46 based on 82.5 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion to $1.542 billion. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $110 million to $125 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $1.42 to $1.56 based on 83 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2024 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our guidance, starting with Q2. First, I want to remind you that Q2 has three more days than Q1, which is a tailwind for Q2 Atlas revenue. Second, we expect to see a sequential decline in the EA business after a stronger than expected Q1. Third, we recently signed a few large licensing deals, most notably a renewal and extension of our relationship with Alibaba. Those deals have an upfront license revenue component, which will positively impact our revenue in Q2 by roughly $10 million. You will see this impact in other subscription revenues, the portion that is neither Atlas nor EA. Finally, we expect to see a significant sequential uptick in expenses since we have some of our largest sales and marketing events in Q2, most notably MongoDB.local in New York. Turning to our updated full year guidance. First, we are increasing our revenue expectations for the rest of the year because Atlas Q1 exit ARR is now higher than previously expected given the stronger Q1 performance. Second, we continue to expect that Atlas consumption growth will be impacted by the difficult macro environment throughout fiscal 2024. Our revised full year revenue guidance continues to assume consumption growth that is in line with the average consumption growth we've experienced since the slowdown began in Q2 of last year. In other words, our usage growth assumptions for the remainder of the year remain unchanged from what we provided our initial guidance range for fiscal 2024 last quarter. Third, we continue to expect that the year-over-year growth of Enterprise Advanced will be impacted by the difficult compares from the prior-year period. Finally, thanks to strong Q1 performance and the increased revenue outlook, we are meaningfully increasing our assumption for operating margins in fiscal 2024 to 7.7% at the midpoint of our guidance, an improvement of approximately 300 basis points compared to fiscal 2023, while continuing to invest to pursue our long-term opportunity. To summarize, MongoDB delivered strong first quarter results in a difficult environment. Our new business performance and strong total customer net additions demonstrate the continued demand for our developer data platform. While we are pleased that Atlas Q1 consumption growth was above our expectations, we continue to be mindful of the environment, taking a step back from the near-term trends. We are incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead and we'll continue to invest responsibly to maximize our long-term value. With that, we'd like to open up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your question please, Raimo.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. My first question before I have to follow-on -- follow-up question. Dev, if you -- everyone talks about AI at the moment and Mongo in theory always kind of view as an operational database. How do you fit into this kind of new AI world? You mentioned some of the names and some of the projects that would look really exciting. But how does Mongo kind of fit into this new world? And I had one follow-up for Michael.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. Sure, Raimo. First, we expect MongoDB to be a net beneficiary of AI. And the reason being is that as developer productivity increases, the volume of new applications will increase, which by definition will create new apps, which means more data stores. So driving more demand for MongoDB. Second, developers will be attracted to modern platforms like MongoDB because that's the place where they can build these modern next-generation applications. And third, because of the breadth of our platform and the wide variety of use cases we support that becomes even more of an impetus to use MongoDB. As I mentioned that we've had over 200 customers just in last quarter who are running AI apps on Atlas. Some of those includes some very cutting-edge well-financed startups like Nuro and Hugging Face and Tekion. We have a high degree of existing customers who are engaging with our field organizations on AI use cases. And so the demand for using MongoDB to build and run these AI apps is very high.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And Michael, if I look at the update or the significant upgrade to the profitability outlook, like, obviously, you had your budgeting cycle to come up with the initial guidance. So what has changed besides maybe slightly higher revenue to kind of come up with these kind of much higher numbers? And obviously, we all like that. But like, what drove that? Thank you and congrats from me.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks. Yes. The big driver of the improved bottom line output is the stronger Q1 performance and then the upgraded revenue outlook and it's really just sort of flowing through to the P&L.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, Sanjit.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions and congrats to the MongoDB team on a strong start to the year. I wanted to start off -- just a question on the environment. As we talked -- as we listen to the [Hyperscalers] (ph) report, their results seem some of the cloud infrastructure ecosystem reported results. We're all trying to get a sense of where are we in sort of the cloud optimization budget scrutiny sort of cycle. It sounded like from what you guys are saying that you guys are executing well, but things are still pretty tight from a budget environment perspective. So wanted to get your sort of latest perspective on whether you see cloud spend and optimization headwinds fading anytime soon? And then what you saw in May that potentially gave you maybe some leading indicators on where things may be headed?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So first point I'd make, Sanjit is that, we don't really see optimization as a trend because there's a direct link between app usage and our revenue, right? So the more the apps are used, the more revenue that drives. And consequently, when apps are used less, the less revenue we get. And so, there's a one-to-one correlation between usage and revenue, which as you can imagine, when the customers are building these apps, they want their apps to be used. So that's really what's happening in terms of what's driving our revenue. In terms of what's happening in terms of the macro environment, I definitely agree with you that it's tough out there, but what we see is innovation is still a priority. We see that customers really want to leverage software as a competitive advantage. We had very strong new business numbers. We added 2,300 customers this year. Our six figure customer count grew 28% year-over-year and our Atlas growth was 40% year-over-year. So like these are pretty good signs that customers are still prioritizing innovation and they're doing so leveraging modern platforms like MongoDB. So I would also say that our go-to-market channels have to really focus on and are doing a really good job on qualifying these opportunities, being able to separate customers who are serious versus customers who may be just wanting to kick the tires. And again, as I mentioned earlier, it's all about us acquiring high-quality workloads. If we can hire -- acquire high-quality workloads, onboard them well and make sure they're served as well, good things will happen; and that's happening. And we had a record number of new workloads added this quarter from existing customers.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate the perspective, Dev. I just wanted to follow up on Raimo's question on AI. And I guess the context is that, you guys have proven that the document model has been very, very scalable in terms of addressing multiple different types of workloads and different data types. So in the context of large language model applications and customers trying to build applications with large language models and the rules of vectors and vector databases, from your guys' perspective, is this a use case that MongoDB can address? And any sort of product updates or anything on the product road map to address this part of the market?\nDev Ittycheria: Right. So -- and maybe I'll just do a little primer just so everyone is on the same page. The results that come from training and LLM against content are known as vector embeddings. And so content is assigned vectors and the vectors are stored in a database. These databases then facilitate searches when users query large language modeling with the appropriate vector embeddings, and it's essentially how a user searches match to content from an LLM. The key point, though, is that you still need an operational data store to store the actual data. And there are some adjunct solutions out there that have come out that are bespoke solutions but are not tied to actually where the data resides, so it's not the best developer experience. And I believe that over time, people will gravitate to a more seamless and integrated platform that offers a compelling user experience. And I do want to say it's still very early days. I think people tend to overestimate the impact of new trends in the short term but underestimate them in the long term. So it's very early days. And I think you're going to see a lot of things happening over the course of the next few months and quarters and years, but we feel we're in a very good position to take advantage of this new trend.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate the comments, Dev. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your question please, Brad.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Dev, last quarter you talked about a couple of very large financial institutions beginning to migrate, I believe it was hundreds of apps. I know you talked about better usage trends this quarter. Was that -- did those migrations impact this quarter? Or is that more something we should expect in the coming quarters?\nDev Ittycheria: No, they'll -- I mean -- so one, we're obviously we are very happy about customers wanting to migrate a large percentage of their applications to MongoDB, but that takes time, right? It's not going to happen overnight. And so, that's going to happen over the long term and so that's something that's a trend that we're feeling good about. I would say, in terms of the usage trends, it's again tied to our customers' underlying business. And so the applications of building on MongoDB are clearly being used. They're driving value, which consequently drives our revenue; and we feel really good. And again -- so that drives us to go acquire more workloads, high-quality workloads, that we can then onboard quickly. And then that drives future usage, so that's the real focus for us. That's focus on the input metrics that drive the outputs that you see. And that's an example what happened this quarter.\nBrad Reback: That's great. And then Michael, real quick. Since the year got off to such a great start here, does it impact your hiring plans for the rest of this fiscal year? Thanks.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, thanks for the question, Brad, yes. Strong start to the year, no major changes. Obviously all that's factored into the full year guide, and you can see the significant upgrade in the bottom line outlook. We are obviously continuing to invest for the long term, though, and believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time.\nBrad Reback: That's great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Your question please, Brent.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. Dev, what drove the record number of new workloads migrating to the platform? You flagged that in the comments there. It seems a little too early for Gen AI to be driving the number of new workloads, so what drove that [indiscernible] as well? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Like I said, I think people tend to overestimate the impact of a trend like AI in the short term. And so I will clearly say it wasn't AI that drove the acquisition of workloads. It was really sharp execution by go-to-market teams. We have really focused our teams to acquire workloads either through the acquisition of new customers or the acquisition of workloads in existing customers. It's all about acquiring workloads, so our incentive mechanisms, management attention and focus is all about this North Star about acquiring new workloads. And I saw -- and I think you've seen the results of that showing up in Q1.\nBrent Bracelin: Great, blocking and tackling and walking while chewing gum. Sounds like it's working for you. My follow-up is really around a vector feature engine as you think about AI. How important is layering in vector feature engines inside of the Mongo database? Is that on the docket? How should we think about vector functionality inside of Mongo going forward relative to attracting more Gen AI workloads? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Again, for generating content that's accurate in a performant way, you do need to use vector embeddings which are stored in a database. And you -- but you also need to store the data and you want to be able to offer a very compelling and seamless developer experience and be able to offer that as part of a broader platform. I think what you've seen, Brent, is that there's been other trends, things like graph and time series, where a lot of people are very excited about these kind of bespoke single-function technologies, but over time, they got subsumed into a broader platform because it didn't make sense for customers to have all these bespoke solutions which added so much complexity to their data architecture. I don't want to preempt what we're going to be talking about on June 22, but I encourage you to attend because that's where we'll share a little bit about our AI strategy.\nBrent Bracelin : Looking forward to it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your question please, Kash.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter, great start to the year. One for Dev and one for Michael. Dev, you've talked about relation of database displacements for a while now, so how are those deployments coming along? And are you increasingly able to open the door for even bigger deployments in the future? That's one. And one for you, Michael. It now appears that you have a cadence where you -- despite challenging consumption trends on a per-customer basis, you've been able to add new customers at record pace, so results have been actually quite resilient. So how does this make you think about the business model ahead? I mean, are you at a point where the new customer momentum more than offsets declining consumption growth trends that you have better visibility into your business than you did probably, say, a year back, six months back? Thank you so much.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, what I would say is, I think, in the short term, the consumption trends are clearly tied to our customers' underlying business. The only way we can really influence that is, over the long term by acquiring more and more workloads either through from existing customers or acquiring new customers. And so, we're really focused on what we can control, which is all about acquiring new customers and new workloads. And obviously there'll be puts and takes in every quarter, but our go-to-market organization is very, very focused on this. And we do that not just from our sales organization but also from our self-serve business. And then we also just don't just focus on acquiring but also making sure they're onboarded properly, they're serviced properly so that those workloads grow well and the customer's experience with those workloads is very positive so they continue to add new workloads to our platform. That's ultimately the things that we can control and that's what we're really focused on. And you talked about...\nKash Rangan: [indiscernible]\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Sorry. So we are seeing -- again, part of acquiring a workload is acquiring a relational workload and replatforming it on MongoDB, so when we say acquiring a workload, you should not always assume it's a new workload. It could be an existing workload that people want to replatform. We talked about the China Mobile example where it was a very, very large workload servicing a very, very large user population. And they just weren't getting the performance benefits that they needed for such a large set of -- such a large implementation, so that was their catalyst to basically migrate to MongoDB. And I want to be clear. There's always going to be some catalyst. There's got to be some compelling event for a customer to do so. It could be for cost reasons. It could be for performance reasons like in China Mobile. Or it could be that they're -- they can't add new features fast enough on a brittle legacy platform so they need to migrate to a new modern platform where they continue to service their own business well. So those are the drivers and that's a big focus for us as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead of UBS. Your question please, Karl.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. Maybe this will go to Mike. Mike, if we could unpack the 2Q guide a little bit. First, on the $10 million onetime lift from Alibaba, if you could just clarify the entirety of that lens in other subscription. None of it lands in Atlas or EA. And is there any follow-through on that, Alibaba? Or is it truly onetime 2Q? And then I've got a quick follow-up.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So it will show up -- first of all, it's not just Alibaba in the $10 million, but Alibaba is the one that people understand and know and we had a joint press release about. And it's certainly driving a healthy chunk of that. It does show up in that kind of other, other line, so it's not showing up in Atlas or in the EA line items, just for sort of clarity around the geography. The extension of the deal, we initially signed a multiyear deal with them. This extends that contract. The structure has minimum commitment levels, and so what runs through the P&L is the minimum commitment level. So obviously, to the extent that there is outperformance above this further increased level, like, that could impact things. We have seen those historically. That's part of what led to the early renewal and extension given the success of the joint offering. Over the time since we've launched it, we've seen an 8 times increase in their end user consumption. And so that's what sort of gave them and obviously us collectively the confidence to sort of extend that.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. Thanks, Mike. And then further on the 2Q guide, the three extra days relative to Q1, does that loosely offer kind of an added three point sequential boost? And then secondly, in terms of the overall demand assumptions you're using to drive that 2Q guide, is it sort of similar broader trends that you've seen in the last couple of months? Or Mike, are you assuming things get better or things get a little worse? Thanks. And that's it for me.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So you're correct. The Q2 days, it does affect because it's consumption and it's recognized as it's utilized. So that is a tailwind to Q2 relative to Q1 by those few extra days. The -- in terms of the broader assumptions, the primary driver of the increase in the fiscal 2024 full year guide is the fact that Atlas outperformed in Q1. Therefore, our starting Atlas ARR for Q2 is higher. We have not changed our outlook for the expected growth over the balance of the year. And so, we're not seeing things get worse. We're not assuming things get better or deteriorate further, and so it's consistent with our view that we had 90 days ago.\nKarl Keirstead: Yes. Super helpful. Thanks Mike.\nMichael Gordon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes on the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Your question please, Tyler.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks very much for taking the question. So Dev, in your opening remarks, you talked about how AI can kind of provide a new opportunity for modernization of existing applications. And I'm just curious, from your perspective, how you see this playing out. Or do you -- when do you think that this starts to accelerate the pace in which companies modernize their apps? And maybe how you're preparing your go-to-market team to tackle that opportunity.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Tyler, we're already seeing high customer engagement of customers already talking to us about new AI use cases that they want to build and run on MongoDB, so that's obviously a very positive trend. Again it's early days, so I don't want to suggest that there'll be some step function increase in consumption or revenue, but the trend is obviously real. As I mentioned, we already saw like over 200 customers who are AI companies who are deploying apps on MongoDB. And I would argue that there's an emerging trend that Atlas is one of the preferred places for AI companies to go to build apps, and so we feel really good about our positioning. And I think we feel like it will be definitely a tailwind given that with all of the AI assist tools around cogeneration and improving developer productivity, the capacity of a development team in a typical organization will only increase. There's statistics that say it can increase anywhere from 15% to 30%, 40%. I think it's still early days to determine what percent is real, but it will definitely increase, which by definition will increase the number of applications developed, which will then obviously drive more demand for MongoDB.\nTyler Radke: That's helpful. And I assume the answer is too early, but as you look at those 200 customers or so and maybe some existing ones that were already on the platform, is there any way to think about quantifying the AI-related revenue and -- or maybe where you think about that for the full year?\nDev Ittycheria: I think it's way too early, Tyler. I think it's also really tied to the market and the product market fit of those customers' businesses because obviously, if those customers do well, then we're a beneficiary. If they're not doing well, then obviously they're not going to drive a lot of consumption. So it's really tied to the product market fit of those companies, but the general trend that we are very pleased about is that, there's a lot of people leaning towards MongoDB in terms of thinking about the next set of AI apps that they're building.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Tyler.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your question please, Jason.\nJason Ader: Thank you. I just wanted to ask about the linearity of consumption through the quarter and then any comments you have on consumption in the month of May?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So I'd say clearly March and April were better than we expected given the outperformance of our revenue numbers. And so that's great to see. In general what we've seen since the start of the slowdown is certainly some month-to-month variability, but in general, like, some pretty reasonable ranges. And to the extent that when we see ranges that diverge at the start of Q2, the more pronounced holiday slowdown that we saw, we tend to call those out, but we feel that we've seen a pretty consistent level of sort of macro-affected or post-macro growth rates of existing expansion. That was what was included in our guide and that's what's initially for fiscal 2024. And that's also what's in our guide for the balance of the year.\nJason Ader: Okay, just -- yes. I mean what's a little hard to reconcile is I understand the sort of onetime pop in Q2, but for the back half, I mean, it just seems like growth is going to slow down massively year-over-year. I'm just trying to understand. If you're not assuming anything different on the macro, why would that be the case?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So what I would say is, when we look at it, you've got a higher starting Q2 ARR as a result of the strong Q1 performance. And as you flow through the same cohort expansion, for lack of a better phrase, over the balance of the year, that's what leads to the improved revenue outlook that we have. And so, we're actually seeing stronger growth on a year-over-year basis for the back half of the year than we thought at the beginning of the year.\nJason Ader: Got you, all right. And then one quick last one for you, Michael, on the gross margin outlook. I think your long term -- unless it changed, I think it was 70%. And you're running now in the mid-70s. It seems like Atlas has really been above your expectations in terms of the gross margin. Any comments on just sort of like, call it, the next couple of years on gross margin?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So we have not specifically guided to gross margin. You are correct. We have outperformed our expectations on gross margin. Our gross margin progression plan, particularly as it relates to Atlas has been very strong. I would not have forecast such high gross margins with Atlas at almost two-thirds of our revenue. And so we've continued to execute incredibly well there. I would just go back to your comment around sort of our long-term target model was 70-plus. And so I think I feel significantly more confident in delivering against that now that we've got Atlas at a much higher percent of the revenue. Atlas still is dilutive on a margin basis, but clearly we've meaningfully narrowed that gap and outperformed our own plan, both in terms of the rate and pace of achieving the improvements, as well as, as we've kind of pulled additional levers, we've gotten more value out of the levers that we had identified along the way. And that's what's put us in this strong position.\nJason Ader: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes line of Fred Havemeyer of Macquarie Capital. Your question please, Fred.\nFred Havemeyer: Thank you. I wanted to also follow up on margins with respect to Atlas. I think, as your company is going through a transition from, of course, like more term licenses, towards Atlas being more of a consumption-based model, it's exciting to see the margin upside flowing through as revenue is coming through, but I wanted, I think, a refresher on how to think about just essentially unit -- sorry, just on how to think about margin progression with Atlas in play. Just generally, once customers have signed and you are through that period of, of course, recognizing commissions, et cetera, and customers are expanding on that Atlas, how should we think about that incremental revenue contribution contributing, of course, to profitability?\nMichael Gordon: Sure. So I'll try and tackle it a couple of different ways, Fred. So I think in general what you see is Atlas revenue is consumption oriented. I think people understand that. We have this very close value linkage, and so it maps quite tightly to the underlying application usage for our customers and their end users. And so I think the key thing when you compare it to the 606 implications particularly of enterprise advanced and the term license revenue is, while it's not ratable -- and I do think sometimes there's the tendency to confuse it was ratable. It is spread over the duration. If we just assume a one year contract, which most of our contracts are, you'll get the same revenue over the time, but with the enterprise license -- enterprise events license, you'll see that upfront revenue being lumpier, right? That's part of the reason why we talk about and go to great pains to explain the EA compares and some of those other things. So that's really the big driver. You get the same revenue, but there's less upfront. I think the other thing that's important to understand in terms of the financials is really the cash flow dynamics and understanding that. As we've talked about for the last several years, we've been deemphasizing upfront commitments, trying to reduce the level of friction, trying to focus on acquiring more workloads and getting more workloads on the platform. And the result of that is spending less time on upfront commitments. Atlas now has -- about 80% of Atlas does not flow through deferred. And so that's just a very different dynamic when you start thinking about less from the income statement but more kind of away from the other parts of the balance sheet and some of the other calculations that you all do.\nFred Havemeyer: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kingsley Crane of Canaccord. Your question please, Kingsley.\nKingsley Crane: Great, yes. So I would like to ask a question about the replacement opportunity and in just a slightly different way. So we're all excited about this AI theme. I know this is more longer term, but do you think that AI workloads creation, app replatforming can act as a catalyst for share shifts as relational DBs are less prepared to support these workloads?\nDev Ittycheria: I think, over the long term, that's definitely the case. I think you're seeing that, I mean, people forget that the relational database has been around for almost 45 years, right? So -- and so it's a technology that's worked well for a long period of time, but it really doesn't suit the needs of modern applications. And as applications get more and more sophisticated, have more performance and scale requirements, people need to consider moving to more scalable platforms and that's our strength. And China Mobile, again, is a great example of that. And that's not even AI apps.\nKingsley Crane: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits of KeyBanc. Your line is open, Michael.\nMichael Turits: Hi, guys. Good evening. So I want to come back to the usage trends. So I want -- maybe explain it, but I'm not sure. So what really drove the better-than-expected usage in 1Q? I know you said that execution was great, which is awesome. And then [Multiple Speakers] in terms of expectations for the rest of the year?\nMichael Gordon: Sorry. Say the last part of the question again, Michael.\nMichael Turits: So what drove the better-than-expected usage in Q1? But then for the rest of the year, you're expecting a return to your prior assumptions regarding usage growth.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So let me try and clarify it. So first, the strong execution, I think, that Dev was talking about really ties more to the new business environment, which remember is very valuable for the medium to long term, but the near term is much more governed by the performance of existing applications. So that, what drove the outperformance of that was stronger underlying usage of those applications, right? So when you think about the underlying queries, right, the reads and writes of those applications, more activity. That drove more consumption and so that's what drove the outperformance. And when you think about the -- as I mentioned, there's a little bit of variability period to period, but other than sort of the start of the downturn in Q2 of last year and the more pronounced holiday slowdown, it's been in a fairly reasonable range. That was the range that we've seen the performance in for Q1. That's the range that we saw the performance was -- in our Q1, our guide at the beginning of the year for the full year. And so there's no real reason to change that outlook for the balance of the year. We're not assuming things get materially better. We're not assuming things get materially worse, and we don't have any data that would suggest either of those directions.\nMichael Turits: And then just a quick follow-up. I know you talked about Atlas not running through deferred, but it was actually EA that was a little stronger this quarter. So what would maybe explain it? But why did we see that sequential decline in deferred revenue that we haven't typically seen?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I go back to a couple of thoughts. One, billings in general is not a super helpful metric for us. And I know we've said that for -- really since going public, I guess, but it -- increasingly, I think that, that is true. Certainly, as roughly two-third of the business is Atlas and as I mentioned, about 80% of that does not flow through deferreds, but also what that means is that a larger portion of what will run through deferreds is EA. And you saw EA grew more slowly on a year-over-year basis. And Q1 tends to be a seasonally slower quarter for new EA business.\nMichael Turits: Okay. All right. Mike and Dev. Thanks very much.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham. Your question please, Mike.\nMichael Cikos : Hi, guys. Can you hear me all right? I apologize. The operator might have tuned...\nBrian Denyeau: Yes, all good, no problem.\nMichael Cikos : Awesome. If I could just follow up on Michael's last question there. And one of the things I wanted to highlight, on that EA strength in Q1, I believe we were expecting EA to actually decline sequentially. And you guys delivered some slight outperformance there. And I guess, broadly if we look back over the last couple of quarters, EA has really outperformed expectations. Can you help us think through what is driving that EA outperformance; and I guess, with more specific color to Q1, where that outperformance came from?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. You have to -- thanks for your question, Mike. You have to remember that one of our strengths is people can run MongoDB anywhere. And there's still a large percentage of workloads and a lot of customers who still run a lot of important workloads on premise. I think the journey to the cloud is far from over. And the attraction of starting with MongoDB on premise is that they, customers then get optionality to -- at some point in time, if they ever choose to move to the cloud, they don't have to rewrite the application. It's a much more graceful migration than having to replatform on to another technology when they want to move that workload to the cloud. So that is a very attractive part of the MongoDB value proposition. And beyond that, obviously, [indiscernible] is people value MongoDB's ability with a flexible document model. The highly distributed and scalable platform just gives enormous benefits whether it's on-prem or in the cloud. And so, that's something that people also value, so we still see a lot of demand. Obviously Atlas is the biggest growth engine of our business, but there's still a lot of customers who lean into EA.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I would just add, we were expecting enterprise events to be down. And so the fact that it had a slight sequential gain, It was great to see and speaks to all the points Dev is underscoring. I would just remind people that, to the point, EA did have a very strong year last year. And so we do face very difficult compares throughout the year on enterprise advanced. And I just think it's important to understand that because you can see the slower growth rate on EA shining through in Q1.\nMichael Cikos : No, that's great. And I appreciate you reiterating the difficult comps there, Michael. I think, if I can just follow up with a two parter, maybe more for Dev here, but first, I know that you're really citing the sharp execution from the go-to-market teams with respect to the number of new workloads or customer wins. I wanted to sanity check. Has relational migrator in any way played a role in landing these workloads and customers? That's the first part. And the second part would be can you just give us an update on how the investments are tracking as far as enhancing features around time series and search capabilities on MongoDB.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So on the first question, again while we do have customers, some customers, migrating relational workloads to MongoDB, I would not say relational migrator was a huge lever in making that happen. We're very excited about the prospects of relational migrator and helping to reduce the cost and time to migrate relational apps to MongoDB, but we're still early in that journey. With regards to time series and some of the other capabilities, we feel really good about the platform. Uptake is high. And we plan to do a pretty broad set of announcements at our MongoDB.local New York on June 22, so stay tuned for some announcements then.\nMichael Cikos : That's great. I'll see you guys in New York in June. Thank you very much.\nDev Ittycheria: We look forward to it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Firoz Valliji of Alliance Bernstein. Your question please, Firoz.\nFiroz Valliji: Hi. Thank you taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Maybe, the first one on the consumption trends. So you have talked about revenue being linked to consumption. And we have seen consumption level come down over the past few quarters. Is it fair to assume that, in next couple of quarters, consumption level may reset at a new normal and then maybe resume growth from that level? Or is it hard to call bottom on the per-user consumption level? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So what I'd say is we have -- I would just say, when we look at our outlook, there's no reason, based on the data that we have, to assume things get materially better or materially worse. And that's what's included in our guidance for the balance of the year. And that's consistent with what we thought in last quarter's call, when we provided our initial view. And when we look at where we are now and the outlook, I think that's the right view, so I don't think that there's any particular data that would point to things suddenly becoming better or becoming materially worse.\nFiroz Valliji: Got it. And so recently, we heard from another data platform [indiscernible] seeing some of the customers move data out of the platform to maybe economize on costs. Are you seeing anything similar? Or do you see pockets of workloads where that might occur on MongoDB's platform as well?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So if I understood your question, you're saying are people moving -- you've seen other companies have talked about customers moving data out of their platforms. We have not seen that trend. As we said, our consumption is tied to the application usage. And you have to remember, if customer builds an application, they want that application to be used, so if the application is not being used, in some ways, that's not a good thing for a customer. That being said, our revenue is driven by usage, so when usage goes up, our revenue goes up. And when usage goes down, our revenue goes down, but it's very linked to the underlying trends of that customer's business, so the link to -- from value to price is highly correlated. So we don't have customers who are \u201ctrying to move data off Atlas\u201d. That's not a phenomenon that we see.\nFiroz Valliji: Perfect. Thanks. It\u2019s very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Ma of Guggenheim Partners. Your question please, Howard.\nHoward Ma: Thank you squeezing me in off the hour mark. Can you just quickly comment on whether or not relational migrations are contributing more to growth relative to greenfield plus subsequent expansion? And if you could frame that within the 2,300 net adds in the quarter too, that would be great. Thank so much.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Howard. No, I would say generally consistent is what we've seen. I wouldn't particularly call out a particular spike up. Obviously there's the China Mobile case study or vignette that Dev walked through, and you can always find those in every quarter. It continues to be a healthy part of the business, but I wouldn't uniquely call that out as sort of particularly driving the results, although it's obviously a big part of our long-term market opportunity.\nHoward Ma: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.\nMichael Gordon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Dev Ittycheria for closing remarks. Sir?\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you. I just want to again just close by saying that we had another strong quarter of new business performance, while Atlas consumption rebounded from last quarter. We remain laser-focused on our North Star, which is acquiring new workloads from both new and existing customers. We do believe AI will increase the velocity of software development and, in turn, the number and sophistication of new applications developed. And we believe that this increase -- this will increase demand for powerful and comprehensive platforms like MongoDB over the long term. So with that, we want to thank you for your time today. And we look forward to seeing you on June 22 at the Javits Center in New York City. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the first quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results, and then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2024. First, I'll start with our first quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $368.3 million, up 29% year-over-year. As Dev mentioned, we continue to see a healthy new business environment, both in terms of acquiring new customers, as well as acquiring new workloads within existing customers. To us, this is confirmation we remain a top priority for our customers and that our value proposition continues to resonate even in this market. Shifting to our product mix. Let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 40% in the quarter compared to the previous year and represents 65% of total revenue compared to 60% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and 65% last quarter. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely related to end-user activity of the application, which can be impacted by macroeconomic factors. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. As Dev mentioned, consumption growth in Q1 was above our expectations. This outperformance was broad-based and driven by stronger growth in underlying application usage. While Q1 consumption trends were better than expected, the growth remains below the levels we had experienced prior to the beginning of the slowdown in Q2 of last year. Turning to Enterprise Advanced. As you know, we will be facing very difficult EA compares throughout fiscal 2024, and Q1 was no exception as evidenced by our slower year-over-year EA revenue growth. However, EA revenues were up sequentially, which is better than what we had anticipated in our Q1 guidance. This is despite the fact that Q1 is typically a seasonally slower new business quarter for EA. Turning to customer growth. During the first quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 2,300 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 43,100, which is up from over 35,200 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 6,700 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 4,800 in the year-ago period. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net-new to our platform as well as self-serve customers with whom we've now established a direct sales relationship. We saw a strong quarter of customer -- of direct customer additions in our enterprise channel. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 41,600 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 33,700 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net expansion -- ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,761 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,379 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement. I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $279.9 million, representing a gross margin of 76%, which is up from 75% in the year-ago period. We're very pleased with our gross margin progression, especially in the context of Atlas representing 65% of our overall business. Our income from operations was $43.7 million, or 12% operating margin for the first quarter compared to a 6% margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for our strong operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. In addition, Q1 benefited from the timing of marketing programs, internal events and other expenses, which we now expect to incur later in the year. Net income for the first quarter was $45.3 million or $0.56 per share based on 81.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to net income of $15.2 million or $0.20 per share on 77 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the first quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $53.7 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $51.8 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $8.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2024. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $388 million to $392 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $36 million to $39 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.46 based on 82.5 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion to $1.542 billion. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $110 million to $125 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $1.42 to $1.56 based on 83 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2024 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our guidance, starting with Q2. First, I want to remind you that Q2 has three more days than Q1, which is a tailwind for Q2 Atlas revenue. Second, we expect to see a sequential decline in the EA business after a stronger than expected Q1. Third, we recently signed a few large licensing deals, most notably a renewal and extension of our relationship with Alibaba. Those deals have an upfront license revenue component, which will positively impact our revenue in Q2 by roughly $10 million. You will see this impact in other subscription revenues, the portion that is neither Atlas nor EA. Finally, we expect to see a significant sequential uptick in expenses since we have some of our largest sales and marketing events in Q2, most notably MongoDB.local in New York. Turning to our updated full year guidance. First, we are increasing our revenue expectations for the rest of the year because Atlas Q1 exit ARR is now higher than previously expected given the stronger Q1 performance. Second, we continue to expect that Atlas consumption growth will be impacted by the difficult macro environment throughout fiscal 2024. Our revised full year revenue guidance continues to assume consumption growth that is in line with the average consumption growth we've experienced since the slowdown began in Q2 of last year. In other words, our usage growth assumptions for the remainder of the year remain unchanged from what we provided our initial guidance range for fiscal 2024 last quarter. Third, we continue to expect that the year-over-year growth of Enterprise Advanced will be impacted by the difficult compares from the prior-year period. Finally, thanks to strong Q1 performance and the increased revenue outlook, we are meaningfully increasing our assumption for operating margins in fiscal 2024 to 7.7% at the midpoint of our guidance, an improvement of approximately 300 basis points compared to fiscal 2023, while continuing to invest to pursue our long-term opportunity. To summarize, MongoDB delivered strong first quarter results in a difficult environment. Our new business performance and strong total customer net additions demonstrate the continued demand for our developer data platform. While we are pleased that Atlas Q1 consumption growth was above our expectations, we continue to be mindful of the environment, taking a step back from the near-term trends. We are incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead and we'll continue to invest responsibly to maximize our long-term value. With that, we'd like to open up to questions. Operator? Thanks. Yes. The big driver of the improved bottom line output is the stronger Q1 performance and then the upgraded revenue outlook and it's really just sort of flowing through to the P&L. Yes, thanks for the question, Brad, yes. Strong start to the year, no major changes. Obviously all that's factored into the full year guide, and you can see the significant upgrade in the bottom line outlook. We are obviously continuing to invest for the long term, though, and believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time. Yes. So it will show up -- first of all, it's not just Alibaba in the $10 million, but Alibaba is the one that people understand and know and we had a joint press release about. And it's certainly driving a healthy chunk of that. It does show up in that kind of other, other line, so it's not showing up in Atlas or in the EA line items, just for sort of clarity around the geography. The extension of the deal, we initially signed a multiyear deal with them. This extends that contract. The structure has minimum commitment levels, and so what runs through the P&L is the minimum commitment level. So obviously, to the extent that there is outperformance above this further increased level, like, that could impact things. We have seen those historically. That's part of what led to the early renewal and extension given the success of the joint offering. Over the time since we've launched it, we've seen an 8 times increase in their end user consumption. And so that's what sort of gave them and obviously us collectively the confidence to sort of extend that. Yes. So you're correct. The Q2 days, it does affect because it's consumption and it's recognized as it's utilized. So that is a tailwind to Q2 relative to Q1 by those few extra days. The -- in terms of the broader assumptions, the primary driver of the increase in the fiscal 2024 full year guide is the fact that Atlas outperformed in Q1. Therefore, our starting Atlas ARR for Q2 is higher. We have not changed our outlook for the expected growth over the balance of the year. And so, we're not seeing things get worse. We're not assuming things get better or deteriorate further, and so it's consistent with our view that we had 90 days ago. Thank you. Yes. So I'd say clearly March and April were better than we expected given the outperformance of our revenue numbers. And so that's great to see. In general what we've seen since the start of the slowdown is certainly some month-to-month variability, but in general, like, some pretty reasonable ranges. And to the extent that when we see ranges that diverge at the start of Q2, the more pronounced holiday slowdown that we saw, we tend to call those out, but we feel that we've seen a pretty consistent level of sort of macro-affected or post-macro growth rates of existing expansion. That was what was included in our guide and that's what's initially for fiscal 2024. And that's also what's in our guide for the balance of the year. Yes. So what I would say is, when we look at it, you've got a higher starting Q2 ARR as a result of the strong Q1 performance. And as you flow through the same cohort expansion, for lack of a better phrase, over the balance of the year, that's what leads to the improved revenue outlook that we have. And so, we're actually seeing stronger growth on a year-over-year basis for the back half of the year than we thought at the beginning of the year. Yes. So we have not specifically guided to gross margin. You are correct. We have outperformed our expectations on gross margin. Our gross margin progression plan, particularly as it relates to Atlas has been very strong. I would not have forecast such high gross margins with Atlas at almost two-thirds of our revenue. And so we've continued to execute incredibly well there. I would just go back to your comment around sort of our long-term target model was 70-plus. And so I think I feel significantly more confident in delivering against that now that we've got Atlas at a much higher percent of the revenue. Atlas still is dilutive on a margin basis, but clearly we've meaningfully narrowed that gap and outperformed our own plan, both in terms of the rate and pace of achieving the improvements, as well as, as we've kind of pulled additional levers, we've gotten more value out of the levers that we had identified along the way. And that's what's put us in this strong position. Sure. So I'll try and tackle it a couple of different ways, Fred. So I think in general what you see is Atlas revenue is consumption oriented. I think people understand that. We have this very close value linkage, and so it maps quite tightly to the underlying application usage for our customers and their end users. And so I think the key thing when you compare it to the 606 implications particularly of enterprise advanced and the term license revenue is, while it's not ratable -- and I do think sometimes there's the tendency to confuse it was ratable. It is spread over the duration. If we just assume a one year contract, which most of our contracts are, you'll get the same revenue over the time, but with the enterprise license -- enterprise events license, you'll see that upfront revenue being lumpier, right? That's part of the reason why we talk about and go to great pains to explain the EA compares and some of those other things. So that's really the big driver. You get the same revenue, but there's less upfront. I think the other thing that's important to understand in terms of the financials is really the cash flow dynamics and understanding that. As we've talked about for the last several years, we've been deemphasizing upfront commitments, trying to reduce the level of friction, trying to focus on acquiring more workloads and getting more workloads on the platform. And the result of that is spending less time on upfront commitments. Atlas now has -- about 80% of Atlas does not flow through deferred. And so that's just a very different dynamic when you start thinking about less from the income statement but more kind of away from the other parts of the balance sheet and some of the other calculations that you all do. Sorry. Say the last part of the question again, Michael. Yes. I go back to a couple of thoughts. One, billings in general is not a super helpful metric for us. And I know we've said that for -- really since going public, I guess, but it -- increasingly, I think that, that is true. Certainly, as roughly two-third of the business is Atlas and as I mentioned, about 80% of that does not flow through deferreds, but also what that means is that a larger portion of what will run through deferreds is EA. And you saw EA grew more slowly on a year-over-year basis. And Q1 tends to be a seasonally slower quarter for new EA business. Thanks. Yes. I would just add, we were expecting enterprise events to be down. And so the fact that it had a slight sequential gain, It was great to see and speaks to all the points Dev is underscoring. I would just remind people that, to the point, EA did have a very strong year last year. And so we do face very difficult compares throughout the year on enterprise advanced. And I just think it's important to understand that because you can see the slower growth rate on EA shining through in Q1. Yes. So what I'd say is we have -- I would just say, when we look at our outlook, there's no reason, based on the data that we have, to assume things get materially better or materially worse. And that's what's included in our guidance for the balance of the year. And that's consistent with what we thought in last quarter's call, when we provided our initial view. And when we look at where we are now and the outlook, I think that's the right view, so I don't think that there's any particular data that would point to things suddenly becoming better or becoming materially worse. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Howard. No, I would say generally consistent is what we've seen. I wouldn't particularly call out a particular spike up. Obviously there's the China Mobile case study or vignette that Dev walked through, and you can always find those in every quarter. It continues to be a healthy part of the business, but I wouldn't uniquely call that out as sort of particularly driving the results, although it's obviously a big part of our long-term market opportunity. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong performance in the first quarter and we continue to execute well despite challenging market conditions. I will start by reviewing our first quarter results before giving you a broader company update. But first, I would like to personally invite all of you to the Investor session at MongoDB.local New York City to be held at the Javits Center on June 22. Please email ir@mongodb.com if you're interested in attending. Now turning to our results. We generated revenue of $368 million, a 29% year-over-year increase and above the high-end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 40% year-over-year, representing 65% of revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 43,100 customers. Overall, we delivered a strong Q1. We had a very healthy quarter of new business acquisition. We added approximately 2,300 customers during the quarter, the highest number in over two years, including over 300 new direct sales customers with notable strength in our Enterprise channel. Our ongoing new business success is due to the mission criticality of our platform and sharp execution by our go-to-market teams, who are navigating a difficult selling environment by remaining laser-focused on our North Star acquiring new workloads. In fact, this quarter, we acquired a record number of new workloads from our existing customers. Moving on to Atlas consumption trends. Q1 consumption was ahead of our expectations but remains below the levels we saw prior to the macro slowdown that began last year. Michael will share more detail on this. Finally, retention rates remained strong in Q1, reinforcing the enduring value in our platform. We are pleased with our results this quarter, especially given the difficult macro environment. It's clear, customers continue to scrutinize our technology investments and must decide which technologies are a must have versus a merely and nice to have. We believe that our Q1 performance and continued new business strength demonstrate that MongoDB is clearly a must have for customers. In today's digital economy, most companies express their business strategies through software. They use software to deliver their core value proposition, provide customers with great experiences and drive operational efficiency. MongoDB is an essential platform in this drive for innovation, making us the critical investment priority. Our customers ranging from the largest companies in the world to cutting-edge startups use our developer data platform to develop and run mission-critical applications. As these applications become successful, customers spend more with MongoDB. In other words, their spend on our platform is directly aligned with the usage of their underlying application, therefore, the value they derive from it. While the growth rate of existing applications can vary based on a number of factors including macro conditions, the relationship between application usage and growth -- application usage growth and MongoDB spend has remained consistent. We believe this is a testament to how well our value proposition is aligned to our customer success. Thinking about a long-term opportunity, I feel exceptionally confident about our core underlying growth driver, the need for companies to use software as a competitive advantage. Customers have ever-increasing expectations for better products, services and experiences, and companies rely on custom-built suffer to deliver these expectations better and faster than the competition. As I've said many times in the past, a durable competitive advantage is built through custom software, it cannot be obtained with an off-the-shelf product. Since most companies understand that they and their competition are all differentiating themselves through software, the speed of software development becomes existential. A McKinsey report found that companies that score in the top quartile of developer velocity generate revenue growth that is four times to five times faster than companies in the bottom quartile. MongoDB is built for speed. We believe AI will be the next frontier of development productivity -- developer productivity and will likely lead to a step-function increase in software development velocity. We know that most organizations have a huge backlog of projects they would like to take on, but they just don't have the development capacity to pursue. As developer productivity meaningfully improves, companies can dramatically increase their software ambitions and rapidly launch many more applications to transform their business. Consequently, the importance of development velocity to remain competitive will be even more pronounced. Said another way, if you are slow, then you're obsolete. Moreover, the shift to AI will favor modern platforms that offer a rich and sophisticated set of capabilities, delivered in a performance and scalable way. We are observing an emerging trend where customers are increasingly choosing Atlas as a platform to build and run new AI applications. For example, in Q1, more than 200 of the new Atlas customers were AI or ML companies. Well finance startups like Hugging Face, Tekion, One AI and [Nuro] (ph) are examples of companies using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered applications to their customers. We also believe that many existing applications will be re-platformed to be AI-enabled. This will be a compelling reason for customers to migrate from legacy technologies to MongoDB. To summarize, AI is just the latest example of the technology that promises to accelerate the production of more applications and greater demand for operational data stores, especially the ones best suited for modern data requirements such as MongoDB. We look forward to telling you more at our Investor session on June 22. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. MongoDB's developer data platform continues to gain momentum as customers across industries and around the world are running their mission-critical projects on Atlas. Organizations, including Anywhere Real Estate, GE Healthcare and Intuit are leveraging the power of our developer data platform. GE Healthcare has turned to MongoDB's developer data platform to manage the lifecycle of its IoT devices, imaging, ultrasound and other patient-care devices from deployment to retirement. They selected Atlas for its effective management, scalability, built-in security and multi-cloud support. GE Healthcare's use of Atlas helps healthcare providers enhance productivity by reducing the complexity and time required to manage databases, resulting in an 83% decrease in data retrieval time and enabling faster deployment of IoT devices. Many customers are turning to MongoDB to free up their developer's time for innovation, enabling them to move faster and deliver better customer experiences, while driving cost-savings. This includes China Mobile, Tata Digital and Grant Thornton International. China Mobile provides mobile voice and multimedia services via its nationwide mobile telecom network across Mainland China and Hong Kong. It is the world's largest mobile network operator by total number of subscribers. The telecom leader is using MongoDB to support one of its largest and most critical push services, which sends out billing details to more than 1 billion users every month. Prior to MongoDB, the tech team relied on Oracle. But as the user numbers increase, performance degraded. Despite large investments, it was still taking too long to do basic requests like finalize and deliver bills to users. As a result, China Mobile migrate this service to MongoDB after comprehensive testing and evaluation of alternatives. By taking advantage of MongoDB's native [sharding] (ph), they were able to improve performance by 80% and go from 50 Oracle machines to just 12 machines for the same workload. This service now handles all current requirements and is set up to scale with future growth. Digital transformation is redefining how organizations operate, and MongoDB is helping customers on this journey by delivering the developer data platform that powers the migration from on-premises to the cloud. Companies including Shutterfly, Radio and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank are example of customers leveraging MongoDB in their transformations. A leader in the HR and job finding tech space shifted from MongoDB Community to MongoDB Atlas during its journey to migrate its entire infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud. They selected MongoDB Atlas to give its developers full autonomy over their data, while freeing up the time they previously spent managing their database system to focus on innovation and improving the end user experience. During their migration journey to Atlas, the company identified [indiscernible] significant infrastructure reduction and subsequent cost-savings. In addition, the company has experienced 250% faster query performance and 300% faster right throughput on their applications built on Atlas. In summary, I'm pleased with our first quarter results in a difficult macro environment. Our ability to win new workloads remain strong and Atlas consumption trends were better than expected. We also believe that AI will accelerate application development, which would further stimulate demand for MongoDB. We continue to invest to maximize our long-term growth opportunities. With that, here's Michael. Yeah. Sure, Raimo. First, we expect MongoDB to be a net beneficiary of AI. And the reason being is that as developer productivity increases, the volume of new applications will increase, which by definition will create new apps, which means more data stores. So driving more demand for MongoDB. Second, developers will be attracted to modern platforms like MongoDB because that's the place where they can build these modern next-generation applications. And third, because of the breadth of our platform and the wide variety of use cases we support that becomes even more of an impetus to use MongoDB. As I mentioned that we've had over 200 customers just in last quarter who are running AI apps on Atlas. Some of those includes some very cutting-edge well-financed startups like Nuro and Hugging Face and Tekion. We have a high degree of existing customers who are engaging with our field organizations on AI use cases. And so the demand for using MongoDB to build and run these AI apps is very high. Yes. So first point I'd make, Sanjit is that, we don't really see optimization as a trend because there's a direct link between app usage and our revenue, right? So the more the apps are used, the more revenue that drives. And consequently, when apps are used less, the less revenue we get. And so, there's a one-to-one correlation between usage and revenue, which as you can imagine, when the customers are building these apps, they want their apps to be used. So that's really what's happening in terms of what's driving our revenue. In terms of what's happening in terms of the macro environment, I definitely agree with you that it's tough out there, but what we see is innovation is still a priority. We see that customers really want to leverage software as a competitive advantage. We had very strong new business numbers. We added 2,300 customers this year. Our six figure customer count grew 28% year-over-year and our Atlas growth was 40% year-over-year. So like these are pretty good signs that customers are still prioritizing innovation and they're doing so leveraging modern platforms like MongoDB. So I would also say that our go-to-market channels have to really focus on and are doing a really good job on qualifying these opportunities, being able to separate customers who are serious versus customers who may be just wanting to kick the tires. And again, as I mentioned earlier, it's all about us acquiring high-quality workloads. If we can hire -- acquire high-quality workloads, onboard them well and make sure they're served as well, good things will happen; and that's happening. And we had a record number of new workloads added this quarter from existing customers. Right. So -- and maybe I'll just do a little primer just so everyone is on the same page. The results that come from training and LLM against content are known as vector embeddings. And so content is assigned vectors and the vectors are stored in a database. These databases then facilitate searches when users query large language modeling with the appropriate vector embeddings, and it's essentially how a user searches match to content from an LLM. The key point, though, is that you still need an operational data store to store the actual data. And there are some adjunct solutions out there that have come out that are bespoke solutions but are not tied to actually where the data resides, so it's not the best developer experience. And I believe that over time, people will gravitate to a more seamless and integrated platform that offers a compelling user experience. And I do want to say it's still very early days. I think people tend to overestimate the impact of new trends in the short term but underestimate them in the long term. So it's very early days. And I think you're going to see a lot of things happening over the course of the next few months and quarters and years, but we feel we're in a very good position to take advantage of this new trend. No, they'll -- I mean -- so one, we're obviously we are very happy about customers wanting to migrate a large percentage of their applications to MongoDB, but that takes time, right? It's not going to happen overnight. And so, that's going to happen over the long term and so that's something that's a trend that we're feeling good about. I would say, in terms of the usage trends, it's again tied to our customers' underlying business. And so the applications of building on MongoDB are clearly being used. They're driving value, which consequently drives our revenue; and we feel really good. And again -- so that drives us to go acquire more workloads, high-quality workloads, that we can then onboard quickly. And then that drives future usage, so that's the real focus for us. That's focus on the input metrics that drive the outputs that you see. And that's an example what happened this quarter. Yes. Like I said, I think people tend to overestimate the impact of a trend like AI in the short term. And so I will clearly say it wasn't AI that drove the acquisition of workloads. It was really sharp execution by go-to-market teams. We have really focused our teams to acquire workloads either through the acquisition of new customers or the acquisition of workloads in existing customers. It's all about acquiring workloads, so our incentive mechanisms, management attention and focus is all about this North Star about acquiring new workloads. And I saw -- and I think you've seen the results of that showing up in Q1. Again, for generating content that's accurate in a performant way, you do need to use vector embeddings which are stored in a database. And you -- but you also need to store the data and you want to be able to offer a very compelling and seamless developer experience and be able to offer that as part of a broader platform. I think what you've seen, Brent, is that there's been other trends, things like graph and time series, where a lot of people are very excited about these kind of bespoke single-function technologies, but over time, they got subsumed into a broader platform because it didn't make sense for customers to have all these bespoke solutions which added so much complexity to their data architecture. I don't want to preempt what we're going to be talking about on June 22, but I encourage you to attend because that's where we'll share a little bit about our AI strategy. Yes, what I would say is, I think, in the short term, the consumption trends are clearly tied to our customers' underlying business. The only way we can really influence that is, over the long term by acquiring more and more workloads either through from existing customers or acquiring new customers. And so, we're really focused on what we can control, which is all about acquiring new customers and new workloads. And obviously there'll be puts and takes in every quarter, but our go-to-market organization is very, very focused on this. And we do that not just from our sales organization but also from our self-serve business. And then we also just don't just focus on acquiring but also making sure they're onboarded properly, they're serviced properly so that those workloads grow well and the customer's experience with those workloads is very positive so they continue to add new workloads to our platform. That's ultimately the things that we can control and that's what we're really focused on. And you talked about... Yes. Sorry. So we are seeing -- again, part of acquiring a workload is acquiring a relational workload and replatforming it on MongoDB, so when we say acquiring a workload, you should not always assume it's a new workload. It could be an existing workload that people want to replatform. We talked about the China Mobile example where it was a very, very large workload servicing a very, very large user population. And they just weren't getting the performance benefits that they needed for such a large set of -- such a large implementation, so that was their catalyst to basically migrate to MongoDB. And I want to be clear. There's always going to be some catalyst. There's got to be some compelling event for a customer to do so. It could be for cost reasons. It could be for performance reasons like in China Mobile. Or it could be that they're -- they can't add new features fast enough on a brittle legacy platform so they need to migrate to a new modern platform where they continue to service their own business well. So those are the drivers and that's a big focus for us as well. Yes. Tyler, we're already seeing high customer engagement of customers already talking to us about new AI use cases that they want to build and run on MongoDB, so that's obviously a very positive trend. Again it's early days, so I don't want to suggest that there'll be some step function increase in consumption or revenue, but the trend is obviously real. As I mentioned, we already saw like over 200 customers who are AI companies who are deploying apps on MongoDB. And I would argue that there's an emerging trend that Atlas is one of the preferred places for AI companies to go to build apps, and so we feel really good about our positioning. And I think we feel like it will be definitely a tailwind given that with all of the AI assist tools around cogeneration and improving developer productivity, the capacity of a development team in a typical organization will only increase. There's statistics that say it can increase anywhere from 15% to 30%, 40%. I think it's still early days to determine what percent is real, but it will definitely increase, which by definition will increase the number of applications developed, which will then obviously drive more demand for MongoDB. I think it's way too early, Tyler. I think it's also really tied to the market and the product market fit of those customers' businesses because obviously, if those customers do well, then we're a beneficiary. If they're not doing well, then obviously they're not going to drive a lot of consumption. So it's really tied to the product market fit of those companies, but the general trend that we are very pleased about is that, there's a lot of people leaning towards MongoDB in terms of thinking about the next set of AI apps that they're building. Thanks, Tyler. I think, over the long term, that's definitely the case. I think you're seeing that, I mean, people forget that the relational database has been around for almost 45 years, right? So -- and so it's a technology that's worked well for a long period of time, but it really doesn't suit the needs of modern applications. And as applications get more and more sophisticated, have more performance and scale requirements, people need to consider moving to more scalable platforms and that's our strength. And China Mobile, again, is a great example of that. And that's not even AI apps. Yes. So let me try and clarify it. So first, the strong execution, I think, that Dev was talking about really ties more to the new business environment, which remember is very valuable for the medium to long term, but the near term is much more governed by the performance of existing applications. So that, what drove the outperformance of that was stronger underlying usage of those applications, right? So when you think about the underlying queries, right, the reads and writes of those applications, more activity. That drove more consumption and so that's what drove the outperformance. And when you think about the -- as I mentioned, there's a little bit of variability period to period, but other than sort of the start of the downturn in Q2 of last year and the more pronounced holiday slowdown, it's been in a fairly reasonable range. That was the range that we've seen the performance in for Q1. That's the range that we saw the performance was -- in our Q1, our guide at the beginning of the year for the full year. And so there's no real reason to change that outlook for the balance of the year. We're not assuming things get materially better. We're not assuming things get materially worse, and we don't have any data that would suggest either of those directions. Yes. You have to -- thanks for your question, Mike. You have to remember that one of our strengths is people can run MongoDB anywhere. And there's still a large percentage of workloads and a lot of customers who still run a lot of important workloads on premise. I think the journey to the cloud is far from over. And the attraction of starting with MongoDB on premise is that they, customers then get optionality to -- at some point in time, if they ever choose to move to the cloud, they don't have to rewrite the application. It's a much more graceful migration than having to replatform on to another technology when they want to move that workload to the cloud. So that is a very attractive part of the MongoDB value proposition. And beyond that, obviously, [indiscernible] is people value MongoDB's ability with a flexible document model. The highly distributed and scalable platform just gives enormous benefits whether it's on-prem or in the cloud. And so, that's something that people also value, so we still see a lot of demand. Obviously Atlas is the biggest growth engine of our business, but there's still a lot of customers who lean into EA. Yes. So on the first question, again while we do have customers, some customers, migrating relational workloads to MongoDB, I would not say relational migrator was a huge lever in making that happen. We're very excited about the prospects of relational migrator and helping to reduce the cost and time to migrate relational apps to MongoDB, but we're still early in that journey. With regards to time series and some of the other capabilities, we feel really good about the platform. Uptake is high. And we plan to do a pretty broad set of announcements at our MongoDB.local New York on June 22, so stay tuned for some announcements then. We look forward to it. Yes. So if I understood your question, you're saying are people moving -- you've seen other companies have talked about customers moving data out of their platforms. We have not seen that trend. As we said, our consumption is tied to the application usage. And you have to remember, if customer builds an application, they want that application to be used, so if the application is not being used, in some ways, that's not a good thing for a customer. That being said, our revenue is driven by usage, so when usage goes up, our revenue goes up. And when usage goes down, our revenue goes down, but it's very linked to the underlying trends of that customer's business, so the link to -- from value to price is highly correlated. So we don't have customers who are \u201ctrying to move data off Atlas\u201d. That's not a phenomenon that we see. Thank you. I just want to again just close by saying that we had another strong quarter of new business performance, while Atlas consumption rebounded from last quarter. We remain laser-focused on our North Star, which is acquiring new workloads from both new and existing customers. We do believe AI will increase the velocity of software development and, in turn, the number and sophistication of new applications developed. And we believe that this increase -- this will increase demand for powerful and comprehensive platforms like MongoDB over the long term. So with that, we want to thank you for your time today. And we look forward to seeing you on June 22 at the Javits Center in New York City. Thank you."
