And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I hope you enjoy the opening video. We will all, always remember 2020. And while we'll never recall the year with anything close to fondness, at Tractor Supply, 2020 will be remembered with a small measure of pride, as we reflect on our efforts to take care of our fellow team members, support our customers and invest in the future. None of these results would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our team. And I want to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to the more than 42,000 Tractor Supply team members, for how they have lived our mission values and work together to take care of each other and our customers. My thanks also go out to our supply chain and vendor partners, who've done an excellent job supporting our business. The environment continues to be uncertain and challenging. Vaccines are on the rise, but our country is still very much in the midst of a pandemic. Given the pace of the vaccine rollout, it will be at least fall, before we're back to some form of normality. Throughout the pandemic, our utmost priority has been to take care of the health, and safety and well-being of our team members and customers. We spent tens of millions of dollars on cleaning and mask, plexiglass and sanitizer. We provided almost 700,000 hours of COVID sick pay. We have conducted nearly 20,000 COVID tests. And we rolled out company-wide a contact tracing wearable devices for all team members to use. We will continue to spare no expense in this area in 2021. In addition to rolling out industry-leading safety protocols, we've also shown our commitment to our team members through appreciation bonuses, increased wages, and broader benefits offerings. At Tractor Supply, we are committed to being a part the solution for our team members, our customers and our communities. And we remain steadfast in that commitment going forward. As we talk now shifting and talking about 2021, we believe there is as much uncertainty this year, as there was in 2020. How fast will vaccines roll out? How are the derivatives of COVID impact transmission rates and antibody effectiveness? Will there be another stimulus? How will consumer spending evolve through the year? Given these questions and there are all the other elements of uncertainty, we're planning for fiscal 2021, based on a range of potential outcomes. The initial guidance we're providing today is consistent with our long-term algorithm that we shared with you, at our Enhanced Earnings Event in October. Importantly, our 2021 outlook reflects the strategic initiatives that are foundational to our Life Out Here Strategy. With the actions we're taking, we are committed to emerging from the pandemic, stronger than before. Now let's shift to the business review section for the fourth quarter of 2020 in the fiscal year. We delivered another strong quarter that exceeded our expectations. In the fourth quarter, we had strong net sales gains of 31.3%, with comparable store sales up 27.3%. We continue to gain market share and benefited from customer shopping with us with larger baskets. All customer segments and all value segments experienced growth. For the fiscal year, we added over $2 billion in revenue, and we reached over $10 billion in sales for the year, a significant milestone for the company. Once again, our quarterly results were remarkably consistent, across all periods of the quarter, across all product categories, across all geographic regions of the country. Also, both our transactions and ticket growth were seeing and were very balanced. For the third quarter, e-commerce saw strong triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we did this year to improve our omnichannel capabilities has certainly resonated with our customers as we've seen several years of digital adoption accelerate in just a matter of months. For the year, about 75% of our omnichannel sales were picked up at a Tractor Supply store, further reinforcing the importance of our stores to our customers. As we have experienced in the last several quarters, we continue to have strong performance and market share gains in our consumable, usable and edible categories, with growth exceeding 20% for the quarter. In 2020, we had more customers shop with us than ever before, with increased sales across our existing customer groups, new customers and reacquired customers. Now shifting to talk about a few other operational highlights for 2020. We added more than 10,000 team members to support the growth of our business. These new team members were critical in our ability to service our customers at these elevated levels and also flow volumes through our supply chain. We pivoted our marketing spending for more traditional print media, digital and national TV. We launched our first national advertising campaign in over a decade. Our research indicates that Tractor Supply has become more top of mind with consumers, as our unaided brand awareness increased over 800 basis points. We expanded our in-store and digital capabilities to make it easier and safer to shop at Tractor Supply. We were nimble and agile in offering curbside pickup and same-day next day delivery. We also re-launched our website, and we rolled out a new mobile app, which already has over one million downloads. We celebrated the opening of our 1,900 store in Oakhurst, California and announced plans for a new distribution center in Navarre, Ohio that is expected to be operational by the fall of 2022. We reinforced our long-standing commitment to ESG through improved disclosure and transparency. We also surpassed our original target of a 25% reduction in carbon emissions, 5 years ahead of plan. We just step back, overall, 2020 really highlighted the resiliency of the Tractor Supply team and illuminated the potential for the business. We participate in a large, attractive market. We have momentum. We're investing in our business through our Life Out Here Strategy. We have the opportunity to create and define our future and extend our leadership for years to come. Before I hand the call over to Kurt, I'd like to address the impairment charge we took for the Petsense business. We recently completed a strategic review of Petsense. Although Petsense had solid sales performance in 2020, we reached the conclusion to reduce the number of new store openings planned over the long-term and identified some underperforming stores to close. We expect to close 10 to 15 stores in 2021. Combined, this resulted in a pre-tax charge of about $74.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share after tax. Petsense offers a differentiated shopping experience to the suburban and rural pet owner [ph] As mentioned, the business is currently doing well overall. We remain committed to growing and investing Petsense. Earlier this week, we named Matthew Rubin as SVP and General Manager for Petsense. Matthew brings a strong retail background, and I'm confident that he'll be an immediate asset to the business. I look forward to sharing more about our plans with you over time. Now Kurt will walk you through greater details of the quarter and the year, along with our 2021 outlook, before I return to give you an update on our Life Out Here Strategy.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Hal. And hello to everyone on the call. This year was like no other in the history of Tractor Supply, as we delivered record sales and financial performance for the year. The fourth quarter continued to benefit from the macro trends that have worked to our favor. As we rank order our comparable store sales performance, the trends that I shared with you in the second and third quarter continue to play out in our sales performance. The largest driver continued to be our customer\u2019s desire for product categories that support the Out Here Lifestyle, as they shifted spending away from travel, entertainment and dining to creating their own experiences. For Tractor Supply, this included purchases such as outdoor recreation and living, like UTVs and outdoor fire pits, along with all those indoor projects and winterizing their homes and equipment. This trend also includes living a more self-reliant lifestyle. The adoption of new hobbies like backyard poultry, hunting, gardening and bird feeding had continued. And we believe these hobbies and trends are becoming more ingrained in our customer\u2019s behavior. The strong brand awareness and new customer performance that Hal discussed was the second largest driver of our comparable store sales performance. This was then followed by tailwinds such as emergency response related demand due to the hurricane activity and various strategic initiatives, such as our investments in digital and the omnichannel experience, same-day delivery and our private label credit card. Exclusive of the modest hurricane activity benefit, the weather impact was generally neutral compared to the prior year. We had robust performance in our big ticket categories, which exceeded our overall comp sales growth. This was driven by broad based strength, with safe, recreational vehicles, utility vehicles, trailers and generators representing the top 5 product categories. Fourth quarter gross profit exceeded our expectations due to higher demand for our products and a reduction in promotional and clearance activities. These factors were partially offset by higher transportation costs as a percentage of net sales. The result was that gross margin as a percentage of sales was 34.6% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 75 basis points. Moving on to SG&A. The 46 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales was attributable to 3 primary factors. First, incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, second, increased incentive compensation due to record sales and profit performance in the quarter, and then third, investments in our strategic initiatives. The additional costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic included appreciation bonuses to team members across stores and distribution centers, as well as additional labor hours and supply cost dedicated to cleaning and sanitation to enhance the health and safety of team members and our customers. COVID-19 related incremental costs were approximately $33 million in the quarter, and that compares to our estimate of $15 million to $20 million going into the quarter, which resulted from an unexpected resurgence of COVID-19 cases late in the year. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased nearly 36% with operating profit margin of 9%, an improvement of 29 basis points. Adjusted net income was $193.2 million, an increase of 34%. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.64, an increase of nearly 36%. For the year, we reached an adjusted operating profit margin of 10.1% and had strong growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 47.4%. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong, merchandise inventories were $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, representing an increase of 5.6% in average inventory per store. This level of inventory is still a bit lighter than we would like, given the momentum of the business, and we are working with our suppliers and vendors to build our stock to support this momentum. During the quarter, we issued our first ever public offering of debt, and we received investment-grade ratings from both Moody's and S&P given our strong credit metrics. We issued $650 million in 10 year notes at a coupon rate of 1.75%. The proceeds from the debt issues were used for refinancing and repayment of term loans as we plan to maintain a leverage ratio below 2.5 times. Fiscal 2020 was a year of strong cash flow from operations, which totaled $1.39 billion, an increase of $582 million or 72%. For the full year, we returned a total of $518 million in capital to our shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our authorization for share repurchases. Today, our Board reconfirmed our commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a 30% increase in our quarterly dividend, which puts our dividend payments in line with our target of at least a 30% payout ratio. Moving now to our guidance for 2021 that is detailed on page 11 of the supplemental deck. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results remains uncertain. Given that backdrop, we are planning our \u2013 for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes. To date, while still very early in the first quarter, we continue to see strong sales momentum in the business. For fiscal 2021, we expect net sales in the range of $10.7 billion to $11 billion. Comp store sales are anticipated to be in the range of down 2% to up 1%. For the year, we anticipate operating profit margin to be in the range of 9.3% to 9.6%, a significant step up when compared to our baseline 2019 performance. In fiscal 2020, approximately 90% of the operating margin year-over-year gain was driven by gross margin improvement. For fiscal 2021, we anticipate some giveback in gross margin and SG&A to slightly increase as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2020 on an adjusted basis. Now let's go into a little more detail on each of these areas. Our expectation is for modest gross margin contraction in 2021, as we anticipate incremental promotional activity, along with higher freight costs. Partially offsetting these pressures are an expected benefit from vendor funding for our field activity support team program, while the fast program expenses will be reported in SG&A with a year-over-year impact of about 40 basis points on each. Breaking down SG&A, the leverage from reduced COVID-19 costs and more normalized incentive compensation is expected to be offset by ongoing wage pressures, investments in our supply chain and digital space and higher depreciation and amortization expense. And as a reminder, the FAST program costs are reported in SG&A. As a result, we are forecasting SG&A as a percent of sales to slightly deleverage. Adjusted for normalization of the FAST program costs, SG&A is expected to remain relatively flat as a percent of sales. As always, we would encourage you to think about our business between the first half of the year and the second half as this is in line with how we manage the business. As you model 2021, I want to point out a few items that will impact comparability. Appreciation bonuses impact the second and fourth quarters of 2020, while wage increases of about $13 million per quarter took effect in the third quarter of 2020. Costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain an uncertainty for us in 2020, as our utmost priority remains the health and safety of our team members and our customers. For the first quarter, we anticipate costs related to the pandemic will continue at elevated levels. Additionally, as you think about the cadence of 2021, our business performance is expected to be stronger in the first quarter, as our comparisons step up starting in the second quarter. The first quarter of 2021 is forecast to have the highest comp performance of the year and correspondingly the highest operating profit growth rate. The second quarter is likely to be our most difficult earnings comparison of the year due to a couple of factors. Please recall the second quarter of 2020 experienced the strongest gross margin performance, driven by the least sales promotional activity. In addition, we expect incremental cost in Q2 of this year as we support the launch of an upgrade to our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. Moving to below the line. We expect total interest expense for 2021 to be approximately $27 million, while our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 22.5% to 22.8%. Our capital spending is anticipated to range from $450 million to $550 million with more than 80% of that spending going towards growth initiatives. The vast majority of the capital spending increase is attributable to new in-store initiatives and supporting technology for our Life Out Here Strategy. Depreciation expense is estimated to increase approximately $50 million. This is above our recent run rate as we accelerate our investments in the business. For the year, we expect share repurchases to reduce our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by about 1% to 2%. For modeling purposes, we've assumed weighted average shares outstanding of about 116 million shares in 2021. Net income is forecast in the range of $750 million to $800 million or $6.50 to $6.90 per diluted share. With our strong performance in 2020 and the critical momentum in our business, the team at Tractor Supply is excited about the Life Out Here Strategy. Our clear focus enables us to continue to be the innovation leader in our channel and emerge from the pandemic stronger than before. Now I'll turn it back to Hal.\nHarry Lawton: Thanks, Kurt. So now let's shift into 2021. As Kurt said, we're laser-focused, and we're focused on continuing to gain market share. We're going to do this in 3 different ways. One is capitalizing on our numerous macro trends benefiting us. Second is nurturing our existing new and reengaged customers, and the third is executing our Life Out Here Strategy. So let's talk about each one of those in a little more detail. We believe that many of the consumer behaviors that we've seen over the last 9 months will continue through most or all of 2021. These trends we've mentioned before, but they include rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, self reliant lifestyle movement, consumer spending that's shifting from travel and entertainment to home and land and an all-time high pet ownership. We exited the year with nearly 19 million Neighbor's Club members. For the full year, over 11 million new identified customers and more than 6 million reactivated customers shop with us at Tractor Supply. We're seeing strong retention with these customers, and we have plans in place to engage them with new capabilities, marketing and product offerings. The third way we're going to be focused on gaining share this year is our Life Out Here Strategy, and it really positions us to strengthen and transform the company. As we shared last quarter, there are 5 pillars to our Life Out Here strategy. The first is the liver legendary customer service, second is advance our ONETractor capabilities, the third is to operate the tractor way, the fourth is go to country model for our team, and lastly, it's generate healthy shareholder return. So let me highlight some of our planned efforts that we have this year in support of our strategy. In 2021, we plan to open 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 Petsense stores. Additionally, we plan to remodel 150 to 200 stores with Project Fusion, and to execute Project Side Lot in 150 to 200 of our stores. That brings our total construction activity for the year to 400 to 500 projects. This is a significant step up in the team's workload and also is being executed in the midst of COVID. Our Project Fusion remodel program is designed to drive space productivity and to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base. It is a combination of both changes in the store layout and imagery that creates a greater lifestyle impression and drive space allocation for product assortment. Fusion stores help create a more welcoming destination and offer compelling showcase for our brands. Our Side Lot program is a full transformation of the space from, primarily a storage location for agriculture equipment to a state of the art outside garden feed and farm shopping center. That also provides for greater convenience through the expansion of buy online pick up at store. While still very early with both of these projects, we continue to be very excited about the sales trends we're seeing from the first tranche of Fusion remodels and Side Lot transformation projects. And importantly, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Given the size of the store - of our store base, these initiatives represent a multiyear opportunity to continually refresh our store base and drive further comp sales. Another initiative we have is our FAST team. And they are already having a significant impact on the business. Since their implementation in August, they've taken on execution programs like executing merchandising programs like Center Court, End Caps, planogram resets, seasonal programs and sales driving initiatives. And what this is doing is it's really allowing our store teams to focus more on customer service and improve their in-store execution and then really ultimately allow us to focus more on the customer and driving comparable sales, and we're very pleased with the FAST rollout. We're also committed to ensuring our digital capabilities stay ahead of our customer expectations. We did this in 2020, and we'll continue to do this in 2021 and beyond. Big areas of focus for us in the first half are shipped from store, search engine optimization, payment options like Apple Pay and Google Pay, subscriptions, both online and in-store and also the recent launch of our Pet Rx platform. As Kurt mentioned, we have plans in place for an upgrade in our Neighbor's Club loyalty program by mid-year. And we anticipate that this new program will really drive incremental customer retention. And also provides strong incentive to allow us to grow our share of wallet with our customers. As we get closer to the launch of our new Neighbor's Club program, I look forward to sharing more of the details about the changes with you. Now just stepping back, we're excited about spring. We believe our customers will continue to be focused on their homes as their oasis and creating their own experiences, whether that's through things like gardening, grilling or home setting with their family and friends and neighbors. Spring Chick Days create great retail theater and support existing and new customers who want to expand their flocks. This was a big category for us last year, and we expect it to be so this year. And we will have a broader selection than we have historically of chicken coops. Tractor Supply is the clear destination for this on trend category. Given the strong trends we're seeing in our companion animal categories and the recent growth in pet ownership, we are focused on being a more complete resource for pet parents. In store, this includes relevant product assortment and brands, expansion of self-serve pet wash locations across, 150 stores to 200 stores and the build-out of 50 to 75 additional pet wellness centers. Currently, about 1,600 stores have vet services in-store, through our mobile vet clinics. Starting this quarter, pet prescriptions can be fulfilled online at Tractor Supply, as I mentioned earlier. In our app, we're now offering on-demand veterinary advice from a team of experienced veterinary professionals. Our customers can call, chat or e-mail a team of veterinary professionals to get all their pet health questions answered. These expanded and new services allow Tractor Supply to offer a complete solution to care for our customers, pets, whether in-store or online. Our stores will be ready for the change of seasons as we move into spring. In closing, we have a unique opportunity. We compete in an attractive and fragmented market. We have a track record of success and outperformance in our business. We see a unique opportunity to capitalize on the powerful customer trends we are benefiting from, and to emerge from the pandemic, stronger, transform company. Our goal is to make strategic investments that enable us to create greater competitive advantage, capture the opportunity we've discussed and generate shareholder value. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. It's Scot Ciccarelli. I hope everyone is well and healthy, first of all. Second, I do appreciate you guys providing guidance, obviously not easy given the amount of uncertainty in the environment. But with that being said, I was hoping you guys could help us better understand how you went about constructing your topline expectations? And maybe outline a couple of your key inputs or assumptions? Thanks.\nHarry Lawton: Hey, Scot. It's Hal Lawton, and good to speak with you this morning. I think the guidance that we provided is very consistent with the commentary that we had at the end of the third quarter. And I think aligned with the spirit of the dialogue in our opening remarks, which is that we expect COVID to remain a large kind of consumer driving force for the foreseeable future, certainly into the fall, if not for the balance of the year. And as a consequence of that, many of the macro trends, which have benefited us, will continue. We also think a number of these macro trends are sticky irregardless of COVID. And so, we kind of see those two coming together in a way that shapes the year as follows. The first quarter we're in now, we expect momentum in this quarter and our results in this quarter will be much like what we saw in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 with elevated sales levels. And then, as we start to comp on top of those in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 this year, we do expect that the comps will start to turn to more normal levels. And the collectiveness of that will kind of compile [Technical Difficulty] guided between minus 2 and plus 1. So it is a heavily weighted in the first quarter with kind of Q2, Q3, Q4, recognizing it will be comping on top of last year's elevated levels, but with still likely strong underlying momentum supporting those quarters.\nScot Ciccarelli: I appreciate that, Hal. And how much \u2013 obviously, the macro trends, we actually agree with that assessment. But how much of your expectation is from some of the company specific initiatives, the Side Lots, some of the store remodels? Or is it just kind of all thrown together in a mixing goal there? Thanks.\nHarry Lawton: Yes. We're certainly looking to piece apart our various initiatives, and we have some pretty sophisticated analytics tools that allow us to do that, at these more elevated volume levels, it is a little bit harder to see than what you might see in a normal mid single digit comp environment. But I will say that it's our view that we are gaining share and winning in all the categories that we participate in. And that's really consistent across the Board, whether you're looking at industry level data or we're talking with vendors. And so that would lead us to believe that not only are we benefiting from the macro trends, but the work that we're doing to support the business is also helping with that. And I'll call out a few things that kind of give us that - give us that sense. First off, I'll point to kind of some data sets around our customer. Our unaided brand awareness due in part, due to our national television campaign that we launched last March is up 8 points in the year. That's a very significant improvement in unaided brand awareness. And then the benefit that we've seen of that is a significant - the most customers that we've ever had shop our store in one year last year, including 11 million new customers and six million reacquired customers. And those customers are shopping with us at repeat rates that are at kind of all-time highs. And those repeat shopping rates are for the new customers are holding - have held through the year. So whether it was a new customer we saw in March or April or May, or a new customer that we saw in October, November, December, all those repeat shopping rates are holding at all-time highs. And then, last thing I'll talk about is, if you look at our team members. And you look like our customer SAT scores, our - if you look at the customers perception of safety and health and well-being in our stores, customers seem to be voting with their wallets and shopping and Tractor Supply, indicative of both our strong transactions, but also our strong ticket. And I think that would speak to the fact that customers are certainly aggregating their ticket. You're hearing that from other retailers, more units per basket driving basket up, but a lot of these retailers are talking about negative comp transactions. With us, it's very balanced with about half coming from comp transactions and about half coming from average ticket. So we're seeing that stock up, but we're also seeing more transactions in the store. So, it's hard to kind of piece it together, but we do think the initiatives we're taking, the support we've given the business on inventory and adding staffing, our focus on cleanliness, plus our digital efforts and our early efforts around Fusion and Sidelight [ph] and FAST, are adding to the share - creating - helping us drive share gains and kind of add it to the macro trends we're seeing.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Elizabeth Suzuki from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great. Thank you. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on the strategic review of Petsense? And what came out of that review that resulted in the decision to slow the growth of new stores? It just seems like with pat ownership at all-time highs, unless those stores were significantly underperforming the company average, just kind of wondering what some of the specifics were of that review?\nHarry Lawton: Yes. Hi, Elizabeth and good morning. Yes. This was just completing my first year as the CEO of Tractor Supply. And so just kind of normal course, kind of steps back and did a strategic review of Petsense, right at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The business - the net takeaway is where the business is doing well. But if you look at the broader landscape of pets and where the shifts are coming, where things are growing, and you look at the - kind of what's playing out in specialty, through that work and then us revisiting our real estate model as a part of that, we made the decision to reduce the long-term store count expectations that we have for that business. And in doing so, that led us to revisit the value that we had on that business, on our balance sheet. And so we've now kind of reset our expectations for the new store counts of that business. We've hired a new leader, for the Petsense business, and we are - we will continue to invest in Petsense, as we see opportunities. And it's - as I said, the business is doing well. We do think its gaining share, in the specialty space. And we will continue to support that business and moving forward, just at a lower long-term store count target.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Okay. And could you potentially shift more of the sales in that business online, if you're not going to grow the store count to quite as much as you thought. Like, do you just view a shift towards the e-commerce side of the business as a way to expand into new markets?\nHarry Lawton: Yes. I look forward to sharing with you more about the Petsense strategy as Matthew comes in and has an opportunity to engage and chart the future of the company. And we're very pleased with the performance. The stores are doing well. The website is doing well. As you said, Liz, we do know pet online is doing well. You can look at the industry data, and that's certainly something I know Matthew is going to - we'll be looking into as a way to accelerate our efforts there. So, more to come.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks very much. Congratulations on a great year. I wanted to just talk a little bit about the three or five-year algorithm. You had originally called out 9% to 9.5% operating margins. Your fiscal \u201821 bottom end range is already 30 basis points higher than that algorithm. So I guess, what would make the range, I guess, decrease in \u201822 and beyond? And I guess, maybe asked a slightly different way, when I look at that 9% to 9.5% range, that would imply flat operating profit growth in 2022, and that doesn't seem likely scenario?\nKurt Barton: Hey, Karen. This is Kurt. Yes, thank you for the question. And really, the question, as I understand it, is about the outlook on the operating margin, the flow-through going forward. One important thing that I pointed out in our prepared remarks is, we had tremendous upside and benefit in 2020 from the gross margin side of the business. And the principal drivers with that, was for the majority of the year, we had favorable transportation. And the most significant was unusually of low levels of promotion and clearance. I mean, the inventory, at some point, really felt like it was going hand to mouth to the consumer. And we anticipate this year in 2021, as we still have some of that extended pandemic demand before we start to cycle into that, that there's benefit on less promotion and clearance. We'll start to normalize on that. The important thing is to manage the business, ensuring that we're everyday low price. We're giving our customers a great value in our product enterprise. And over the years, we're going to manage the operating margin, ensuring that we continue to gain market share. And the important thing is that there may begin to be in the next couple of years as inventory more normalizes and more clearance exposure normalizes. There's some anticipated risk with gross margin. So, we'll continue to manage gross margin with our benefits of our driving and staying at EDLP, not anticipating to revert back to the promotional activity in the past. But with our investments in the business the next couple of years to continue to gain this market share, we anticipate still staying around that range. We think it's a great sweet spot to allow us to continue to hit those revenue growth targets and to continue to gain on the market share. So we want to manage to a reasonable operating margin to continue our opportunity to gain market share. And our outlook for 2021 and the long-term really anticipates that. And as we progress, we'll continue to update you as we see more visibility as things change.\nKaren Short: Okay. That's very helpful. And just my follow-up is looking at the comp in 2Q to 4Q, obviously, as you have said and we all see, you had very evenly kind of split composition on the comp from 2Q to 4Q. How do you think about when we start to lap those in 2021, do you think the pressure will come more from ticket or traffic in terms of the comp comparisons?\nKurt Barton: Yes. It's a great question. As we think about traffic and ticket in 2021, there's a lot of variables and still some uncertainty as we begin to lap that. We're going to be nimble and have shown in the past that we can shift very well to that. So as we think about the business with ticket and traffic, I'll give you some thoughts on ticket drivers, certainly some level of inflation that could be driving ticket. If there's continued trip consolidation, it helps in the ticket. But other aspects on traffic, as areas such as trip consolidation, if there's a bit more normalization on trip consolidation, as we begin to cycle some of the COVID demand. And if there's inflation, it sometimes has an offset on the traffic. So point being, there's a number of variables in there. And as we cycle this, we see our opportunity in both categories, and there can be some risk and shift in both. And we've contemplated those aspects in our guidance for comp sales as we begin to cycle the COVID lift that we saw starting in Q2 of 2020. And we anticipate that there's not a meaningful shift from either one as we see it at this point, but both has variables that could drive it up or down.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Steve Forbes from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\nSteve Forbes: Good morning. So I wanted to start, Hal, with the new and reengaged customer trends, right, you mentioned repeat rates at all-time highs, just curious if you can provide more color here, right? Are these customers engaging at a level that's more comparable to your Neighbor's Club members? Are they shopping across more categories right than the average customer, shopping both channels, right? And why aren't we seeing greater, I guess, entrants into the Neighbor's Club Loyalty Program, as I would imagine, that's sort of a core initiative right for 2021?\nHarry Lawton: Yes. Hey, Steve, and good morning. A couple of things I'll say. First of all, on the Neighbor's Club program, we are very pleased with the growth in the ownership of that - I mean, the growth in the membership of that program, reaching 19 million members, representing approximately 60% of our total sales. We're seeing very strong engagement rates with those customers. And we have plans, as we've talked about to reinvigorate that program in the first half of this year, which I think will drive a step change in engagement with those customers and also migration upward of their spend. So we're very - we're looking forward to that promotion and getting it out there and look forward to sharing more details with you at our next earnings call on it. As it relates to our new customers, we've mentioned in the past that we see approximately 20% of our new customers return and shop with us within 28 days. And that trend really hasn't changed since the beginning of the year. It's held very stable. And it's two or three points higher than what we would have seen in a historic period when we cohorted new customers. And then I would say it's not - we also continue to see strong repurchase rates as you get out to kind of two months at the 56 day count and at three months. And so we're very pleased with their reengagement. We see them engaging first in categories like poultry and dog and pet. But then they start to broaden their purchases across things like apparel and garden, and if they started in pet, they might move to poultry or vice versa. And a higher percentage of these groups than our normal business starts online and does a pickup in store, and then you'll see in their next purchase then coming into the store for purchase. And our new customer SAT scores are higher than historic as well. So, I'd say all around, we are pleased with the 19 million numbers. They represent the growth that we had this year, particularly in the midst of the pandemic. Our sign up is really at the register there face-to-face. People are really trying to check out much faster as we all know. So, the ability to still sign up those Neighbor's Clubs members and gain the millions that we did this year, we're very pleased with and then the new customers are exhibiting very strong reengagement behavior.\nSteve Forbes: Thanks, Hal. And maybe just a quick follow-up. As we try to conceptualize the opportunity here, how does the 11 million new customers and 6 million reengaged customers compare to 2018 or 2019 levels?\nHarry Lawton: I don't think we've disclosed that in the past. But what I will say is - and we'll get that some thought on whether to do so. But what I would say is there are material increases from previous years.\nSteve Forbes: Awesome. Thanks so much. Best of luck. Stay well.\nHarry Lawton: Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Peter Benedict from R.W. Baird. Your line is open.\nPeter Benedict: Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess, first question, Kurt, you kind of mentioned inflation at \u201821. And I'm just curious where you're seeing that most acutely off [ph] and size it up, but which categories you're seeing inflation in the business? That's my first question.\nHarry Lawton: Peter, I'm going to let Seth take that.\nSeth Estep: Hey, Peter, this is Seth. Hey Peter, as we look at some of the inflation of this coming year and what we're seeing kind of early on, if you just look at the kind of base commodity markets that are out there, I'd tell you early reads. Our steel-based product as well as some of the grain-based goods, if you look at those commodity markets. Feel really good about the handle that the team has on the business to be able to manage it accordingly with our tolls that we have on the pricing side. But those would be the areas that I would say that we're starting to see those come through in the early reads.\nPeter Benedict: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then maybe, Hal, one for you. Just on the competitive environment out there. Obviously, it's been strong. But even with the strength in farm and ranch, and in the pet area, we're seeing some reasonably large chains have trouble and even shut down within both of those areas. So, I'm just curious as you've got a lot of strategic initiatives in place. But is the competitive environment shifting in a way that maybe has you thinking differently on any maybe longer term initiatives over the next couple of years? Just kind of curious your view on that. I know you got a lot on your plate, but just wanted to hear you add on that.\nHarry Lawton: Yes. Thanks, Peter. And what I'd say is the \u2013 I think the dynamics that are playing out in the market right now, whether it's with customers or vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors, those dynamics are really playing to the sweet spots of Tractor Supply. First off, people are struggling with in-stocks, and I think you're going to see more of that as we get into the spring with the supply chain disruption that's out there. And our team has done an outstanding job, managing inventory through the year. We saw how we ended the year with inventory above last year. And we're tracking to continue with that at those levels, if not higher, as Kurt mentioned in his opening remarks. We planned for our spring shipments to arrive earlier than they have historically. And so while we are seeing some container backlog, we are going to be able to manage through that and get it kind of in on a normal time frame, but that's to our benefit. So I think anywhere where you've made investments in inventory and you've leaned in there, anywhere where you're making investments in customer service because right now that makes such a big difference in this environment. And we've certainly done that through the net hiring of 10,000 team members and providing appreciation bonuses and others and raises to drive their engagement. Also in technology, if you've invested in technology and you can do curb side pickup, and you can do same-day, next-day delivery, and you can do those with great customer service, that leads to advantages as well. So I think the scale that we have in our distribution systems, the scale that we have in technology, the leverage and scale that we have with our vendors, and then, of course, our advantage of our 42,000 team members, which wake up every day looking to provide legendary service, all that just plays well for us. I mean, we're \u2013 and then you think about the convenience, the location of our stores and that's why if you go across every category, we're confident that we're taking share in a significant way. I mean, if you look at our CUE business being up over 20% for the quarter, that's \u2013 and you think about the proxy \u2013 using that as a proxy for the businesses that are in there around animal feed and pet food and others, those rates are well above industry estimates for those categories. And certainly, a lot of other companies that are out there reporting that play in those categories. So I think it really just speaks to the business model to track or the resiliency of it and the foundation of it and then the investments that we're making day-to-day to ensure that our customers and our new customers are having a great experience.\nMary Pilkington: Michelle, let me just say one thing, if I may. I know we're at the top of the hour, but we're going to let the call go about 10 minutes longer. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. So your next question comes from Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital. Your line is open.\nScott Mushkin: Hey, guys. And Mary Winn, thanks for letting the call run a little bit longer and I'll try to be quick. So I was wondering if \u2013 and maybe I missed it, but the percentage of the new customers, I know we talked about this a little bit that are purchasing CUE and then the percentage of those that are repeating. I'm not sure I got that data and if you're willing to give us that data.\nKurt Barton: Yes. Scott, how are you? Good morning.\nScott Mushkin: Good morning.\nHarry Lawton: We have not mentioned what percent are buying CUE in their first purchase. We did mention what percent are coming back and buying a second time. So about 20% of our new customers return and shop with us again within 28 days. And we said that's above historic run rates by several points. So we feel very good about our retention of these customers. And that's a proxy at one-time marker, but it's the same if you look across 7, 14 days, 2 months, 3 months, et cetera. As it relates to what they're buying on their first purchase, the 2 dominant areas that they're buying on their first purchase are pet, pet food or poultry and or supplies and such around those two categories.\nScott Mushkin: And so that's interesting. And I can be my follow-up. I was going to actually add something else. But a 20% repeat rate sounds high, but if it's skewing towards CUE, you might think you can actually make that number higher. Are there any initiatives to figure out how to make sure they're repeating at a higher rate if they're engaged in CUE and then our yield [ph].\nHarry Lawton: Yes, absolutely. So this is what the full focus of our marketing team is focused on, is exactly this, is we've got - we've invested over the last 1.5 year or two in our CRM capabilities, moving that platform to the Azure cloud, upgrading our analytical capabilities, adding new personalization tooling in place and also looking at behaviors, whether on the site or inside of the store and then looking for kind of like comparing them to look like shoppers. And so whether it's e-mails that those new customers get or whether it's digital banner ads, we're retargeting them. All those sorts of kind of marketing channels and vehicles are being used to engage with these customers and encourage them to re-shop with us. And in addition, obviously, we just have the investments we're making in our team members, the investments we're making in our store experience, the investments we're making in inventory and those sorts of things that drive repeat behavior as well. One interesting anecdote that I'll give on this is we ask our customers in our checkout survey, kind of post-purchase survey, what their top criteria were for why they selected to shop with Tractor Supply. And typically the responses are similar to what any other retailer would have with price and location convenience, having the right product, customer service; those sorts of things that are kind of the dominant criteria for shopping for retail. During the midst of the pandemic over the last 6 months, the number one and number two criteria have been cleanliness and safety. Never in my 20-plus years of retail, have I seen those two criteria at the top of a customer\u2019s decision-making criteria. And so that's why we've invested so much in those areas. And I highlighted the tens of millions of dollars we've spent on those areas in the last quarter.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Peter Keith from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nPeter Keith: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Great results, guys. Quick follow-up to Peter Benedict\u2019s question on the inflation. Certainly, a lot of the commodities are ramping up to record levels we haven't seen in 9 to 10 years, would you have an inflation benefit factored into comp? And if so, could you provide that for us?\nKurt Barton: Yes. Peter, this is Kurt. In regards to inflation, let me first start with what we've seen here in 2020. I mean, we saw a bit of elevation as we worked our way through the year. In Q4, we still saw a bit of a modest level of inflation, less than 100 basis points of commodity inflation into the product cost. We anticipate that as all of the inflation information, as I know everyone's seen is certainly at higher levels. We're anticipating that to accelerate in 2021. We've seen where inflation on commodities can rise as quickly as it did. It can also shift, as you know, just as quickly. So like we said in our prepared remarks, we're planning for 2021 and are a number of scenarios. But in our guidance, we assume that over the year, a weighted average of about 1% to 2% inflation into the product cost and that certainly could vary first half versus second half of the year. And right now, we're seeing the points that Seth mentioned on grains and steel being primary drivers of some inflation at this point. So as we picked up an assumption, that range of about 1% to 2% is where we landed in our assumption.\nPeter Keith: Okay. Very helpful. And maybe committing over to a question for Hal or Seth, on the pet trends. Everyone knows 2020 was a record year for pet adoption and acquisition, but what are you guys seeing out there in the field? Are you seeing continued strength? And what would you expect in for \u201821? There's arguments if there's been a pull-forward and the acquisitions will drop-off or there's other arguments that the same adoption trends are going to continue for the year.\nHarry Lawton: Yes. We are planning for the pet category to continue to remain strong, and to over-perform relative to our overall business in the year. I think on the last call, we talked about poultry and chickens and flocks and how they're a bit of an annuity stream, given that they have a 7, 8 year lifespan. Obviously, pet is very much the same way. With pet adoption up at an all-time high, those pets, as they grow are only going to \u2013 they're going to move from puppy food to adult food. We're seeing that, by the way, in our trends. Typically with dogs, as they get a little older, they eat a little more, as they get bigger. So we're actually seeing that \u2013 the benefit from that a little bit on the tonnage side. And we expect the humanization of pet will remain very strong this entire year, as people continue to work-from-home really for the foreseeable future, potentially all of 2021. And so they're around their pets. They're buying toys. They're buying snacks. They're upgrading their bed, they're getting them a new bed. All those things, I expect will continue this year. And as I said, we're very pleased with our pet business. We are confident we're gaining share in our pet business. We're seeing strong growth in our pet business, both in-store just through brick-and-mortar channels, as well as online. And certainly, the sweet spot for us on pet is our omnichannel, where we're seeing significant amount of pet purchases online picked up in store. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're investing heavily in this category to remain a strong destination for our customers in it, whether it was the release recently of our new Pet Rx solution online, whether it's the rollout of both the subscriptions in-store to support in a similar way that we have it online, whether it's the addition of 150 to 200 more pet watch stations this year, and then also the build-out of more pet wellness clinics in our stores to support the mobile pet clinics that we have that drive significant engagement with our stores from our customers. So we feel really good about where we are in pet, and we'll be continuing to invest here. I guess, I neglected also mentioned topologies is that our marketing campaign that we've been doing in the past year, we have a significant amount of dedicated marketing, both TV and digital devoted to pet. And it's - its systemic mean, it's always on and we do spike it at certain periods. But it's a consistent program that we're doing now. First time we've done that. We've been doing that for about 6 or 9 months.\nOperator: And you next\u2026\nMary Pilkington: We'll call this our final question, as we wrap up the call.\nOperator: Okay. Perfect. So Chuck Grom, is your final question for today from with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\nChuck Grom: Good morning. Nice quarter and a great first year, Hal. My questions on Side Lot, it seems like a tremendous opportunity for you guys. I'm curious, how you plan to approach it from a marketing perspective? And also how quickly you think it's going to take the ramp-up to optimal profit productivity levels?\nHarry Lawton: Yes, hey, Chuck. We are - remain very bullish, on the Side Lot project. It's - as we remarked before, garden is the category that our customers say they most participate in that we don't fully address their needs. And in the Side Lot that we have open, we - the customer engagement with the product and the purchase rate, it was - it's kind of like an overnight switch. Once that's all - when the project is complete and the product is in there, we saw really strong engagement with customers. And this is in the midst of fall and winter when, live goods assortments are very limited and gardening activities is much less. So we've got over 50 of these Side Lots, in - underway right now. Some, we're in the process of applying for permits. Some were in the final stages of getting the certificate of occupancy. We've got 100 plus more \u2013 100 plus more scheduled for the year. And we're very excited about their potential. And the team is doing an excellent job kind of navigating this environment to get those built. It's in the context of COVID you've got, construction crews at a time. So we'll have to quarantine for a couple of weeks, if one of the team members on the project is test positive. You've got city municipalities that getting permitting done is very difficult. Getting someone to come out and do a certificate of occupancy is much slower. And the team is just doing an excellent job managing through, all those twists and turns. We're very - we remain very bullish on Side Lot. And like, I said, a number of them underway. I just visited a handful of them in the last week and really excited to have our first batch of them opened in time for the spring season.\nChuck Grom: That's great. And just as a follow-up, I believe that the garden center pad is going to be about 4,000 square feet. When you compare that to - when you compare that productivity opportunity to what your stores typically do today, any sense or what you think that can eventually generate over time?\nHarry Lawton: It's very seasonal. And in my experience elsewhere, the garden centers are very productive, if not more productive than they store, during the core spring season. And then in the winter time, the productivity falls off well below the core of the store. And so, we're looking forward to having a full year ahead of us with these projects to be able to get a sense for what's the max productivity in the midst of spring. How much can we prop the productivity up with things like Christmas trees, and pumpkins, and harvest type stuff in the fall? And then, we'll see where it plays out for the full year. But we are very confident that it will drive significant productivity relative to how the space is being used now and will drive strong shareholder returns. The question is to what magnitude. And we'll know more as we get into spring.\nMary Pilkington: All right. Thank you, Operator. This will conclude our call today. And thank you to everyone for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you on our first quarter call in April.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Harry Lawton",
            "content": "Good morning. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I hope you enjoy the opening video. We will all, always remember 2020. And while we'll never recall the year with anything close to fondness, at Tractor Supply, 2020 will be remembered with a small measure of pride, as we reflect on our efforts to take care of our fellow team members, support our customers and invest in the future. None of these results would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our team. And I want to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to the more than 42,000 Tractor Supply team members, for how they have lived our mission values and work together to take care of each other and our customers. My thanks also go out to our supply chain and vendor partners, who've done an excellent job supporting our business. The environment continues to be uncertain and challenging. Vaccines are on the rise, but our country is still very much in the midst of a pandemic. Given the pace of the vaccine rollout, it will be at least fall, before we're back to some form of normality. Throughout the pandemic, our utmost priority has been to take care of the health, and safety and well-being of our team members and customers. We spent tens of millions of dollars on cleaning and mask, plexiglass and sanitizer. We provided almost 700,000 hours of COVID sick pay. We have conducted nearly 20,000 COVID tests. And we rolled out company-wide a contact tracing wearable devices for all team members to use. We will continue to spare no expense in this area in 2021. In addition to rolling out industry-leading safety protocols, we've also shown our commitment to our team members through appreciation bonuses, increased wages, and broader benefits offerings. At Tractor Supply, we are committed to being a part the solution for our team members, our customers and our communities. And we remain steadfast in that commitment going forward. As we talk now shifting and talking about 2021, we believe there is as much uncertainty this year, as there was in 2020. How fast will vaccines roll out? How are the derivatives of COVID impact transmission rates and antibody effectiveness? Will there be another stimulus? How will consumer spending evolve through the year? Given these questions and there are all the other elements of uncertainty, we're planning for fiscal 2021, based on a range of potential outcomes. The initial guidance we're providing today is consistent with our long-term algorithm that we shared with you, at our Enhanced Earnings Event in October. Importantly, our 2021 outlook reflects the strategic initiatives that are foundational to our Life Out Here Strategy. With the actions we're taking, we are committed to emerging from the pandemic, stronger than before. Now let's shift to the business review section for the fourth quarter of 2020 in the fiscal year. We delivered another strong quarter that exceeded our expectations. In the fourth quarter, we had strong net sales gains of 31.3%, with comparable store sales up 27.3%. We continue to gain market share and benefited from customer shopping with us with larger baskets. All customer segments and all value segments experienced growth. For the fiscal year, we added over $2 billion in revenue, and we reached over $10 billion in sales for the year, a significant milestone for the company. Once again, our quarterly results were remarkably consistent, across all periods of the quarter, across all product categories, across all geographic regions of the country. Also, both our transactions and ticket growth were seeing and were very balanced. For the third quarter, e-commerce saw strong triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we did this year to improve our omnichannel capabilities has certainly resonated with our customers as we've seen several years of digital adoption accelerate in just a matter of months. For the year, about 75% of our omnichannel sales were picked up at a Tractor Supply store, further reinforcing the importance of our stores to our customers. As we have experienced in the last several quarters, we continue to have strong performance and market share gains in our consumable, usable and edible categories, with growth exceeding 20% for the quarter. In 2020, we had more customers shop with us than ever before, with increased sales across our existing customer groups, new customers and reacquired customers. Now shifting to talk about a few other operational highlights for 2020. We added more than 10,000 team members to support the growth of our business. These new team members were critical in our ability to service our customers at these elevated levels and also flow volumes through our supply chain. We pivoted our marketing spending for more traditional print media, digital and national TV. We launched our first national advertising campaign in over a decade. Our research indicates that Tractor Supply has become more top of mind with consumers, as our unaided brand awareness increased over 800 basis points. We expanded our in-store and digital capabilities to make it easier and safer to shop at Tractor Supply. We were nimble and agile in offering curbside pickup and same-day next day delivery. We also re-launched our website, and we rolled out a new mobile app, which already has over one million downloads. We celebrated the opening of our 1,900 store in Oakhurst, California and announced plans for a new distribution center in Navarre, Ohio that is expected to be operational by the fall of 2022. We reinforced our long-standing commitment to ESG through improved disclosure and transparency. We also surpassed our original target of a 25% reduction in carbon emissions, 5 years ahead of plan. We just step back, overall, 2020 really highlighted the resiliency of the Tractor Supply team and illuminated the potential for the business. We participate in a large, attractive market. We have momentum. We're investing in our business through our Life Out Here Strategy. We have the opportunity to create and define our future and extend our leadership for years to come. Before I hand the call over to Kurt, I'd like to address the impairment charge we took for the Petsense business. We recently completed a strategic review of Petsense. Although Petsense had solid sales performance in 2020, we reached the conclusion to reduce the number of new store openings planned over the long-term and identified some underperforming stores to close. We expect to close 10 to 15 stores in 2021. Combined, this resulted in a pre-tax charge of about $74.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share after tax. Petsense offers a differentiated shopping experience to the suburban and rural pet owner [ph] As mentioned, the business is currently doing well overall. We remain committed to growing and investing Petsense. Earlier this week, we named Matthew Rubin as SVP and General Manager for Petsense. Matthew brings a strong retail background, and I'm confident that he'll be an immediate asset to the business. I look forward to sharing more about our plans with you over time. Now Kurt will walk you through greater details of the quarter and the year, along with our 2021 outlook, before I return to give you an update on our Life Out Here Strategy. Thanks, Kurt. So now let's shift into 2021. As Kurt said, we're laser-focused, and we're focused on continuing to gain market share. We're going to do this in 3 different ways. One is capitalizing on our numerous macro trends benefiting us. Second is nurturing our existing new and reengaged customers, and the third is executing our Life Out Here Strategy. So let's talk about each one of those in a little more detail. We believe that many of the consumer behaviors that we've seen over the last 9 months will continue through most or all of 2021. These trends we've mentioned before, but they include rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, self reliant lifestyle movement, consumer spending that's shifting from travel and entertainment to home and land and an all-time high pet ownership. We exited the year with nearly 19 million Neighbor's Club members. For the full year, over 11 million new identified customers and more than 6 million reactivated customers shop with us at Tractor Supply. We're seeing strong retention with these customers, and we have plans in place to engage them with new capabilities, marketing and product offerings. The third way we're going to be focused on gaining share this year is our Life Out Here Strategy, and it really positions us to strengthen and transform the company. As we shared last quarter, there are 5 pillars to our Life Out Here strategy. The first is the liver legendary customer service, second is advance our ONETractor capabilities, the third is to operate the tractor way, the fourth is go to country model for our team, and lastly, it's generate healthy shareholder return. So let me highlight some of our planned efforts that we have this year in support of our strategy. In 2021, we plan to open 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 Petsense stores. Additionally, we plan to remodel 150 to 200 stores with Project Fusion, and to execute Project Side Lot in 150 to 200 of our stores. That brings our total construction activity for the year to 400 to 500 projects. This is a significant step up in the team's workload and also is being executed in the midst of COVID. Our Project Fusion remodel program is designed to drive space productivity and to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base. It is a combination of both changes in the store layout and imagery that creates a greater lifestyle impression and drive space allocation for product assortment. Fusion stores help create a more welcoming destination and offer compelling showcase for our brands. Our Side Lot program is a full transformation of the space from, primarily a storage location for agriculture equipment to a state of the art outside garden feed and farm shopping center. That also provides for greater convenience through the expansion of buy online pick up at store. While still very early with both of these projects, we continue to be very excited about the sales trends we're seeing from the first tranche of Fusion remodels and Side Lot transformation projects. And importantly, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Given the size of the store - of our store base, these initiatives represent a multiyear opportunity to continually refresh our store base and drive further comp sales. Another initiative we have is our FAST team. And they are already having a significant impact on the business. Since their implementation in August, they've taken on execution programs like executing merchandising programs like Center Court, End Caps, planogram resets, seasonal programs and sales driving initiatives. And what this is doing is it's really allowing our store teams to focus more on customer service and improve their in-store execution and then really ultimately allow us to focus more on the customer and driving comparable sales, and we're very pleased with the FAST rollout. We're also committed to ensuring our digital capabilities stay ahead of our customer expectations. We did this in 2020, and we'll continue to do this in 2021 and beyond. Big areas of focus for us in the first half are shipped from store, search engine optimization, payment options like Apple Pay and Google Pay, subscriptions, both online and in-store and also the recent launch of our Pet Rx platform. As Kurt mentioned, we have plans in place for an upgrade in our Neighbor's Club loyalty program by mid-year. And we anticipate that this new program will really drive incremental customer retention. And also provides strong incentive to allow us to grow our share of wallet with our customers. As we get closer to the launch of our new Neighbor's Club program, I look forward to sharing more of the details about the changes with you. Now just stepping back, we're excited about spring. We believe our customers will continue to be focused on their homes as their oasis and creating their own experiences, whether that's through things like gardening, grilling or home setting with their family and friends and neighbors. Spring Chick Days create great retail theater and support existing and new customers who want to expand their flocks. This was a big category for us last year, and we expect it to be so this year. And we will have a broader selection than we have historically of chicken coops. Tractor Supply is the clear destination for this on trend category. Given the strong trends we're seeing in our companion animal categories and the recent growth in pet ownership, we are focused on being a more complete resource for pet parents. In store, this includes relevant product assortment and brands, expansion of self-serve pet wash locations across, 150 stores to 200 stores and the build-out of 50 to 75 additional pet wellness centers. Currently, about 1,600 stores have vet services in-store, through our mobile vet clinics. Starting this quarter, pet prescriptions can be fulfilled online at Tractor Supply, as I mentioned earlier. In our app, we're now offering on-demand veterinary advice from a team of experienced veterinary professionals. Our customers can call, chat or e-mail a team of veterinary professionals to get all their pet health questions answered. These expanded and new services allow Tractor Supply to offer a complete solution to care for our customers, pets, whether in-store or online. Our stores will be ready for the change of seasons as we move into spring. In closing, we have a unique opportunity. We compete in an attractive and fragmented market. We have a track record of success and outperformance in our business. We see a unique opportunity to capitalize on the powerful customer trends we are benefiting from, and to emerge from the pandemic, stronger, transform company. Our goal is to make strategic investments that enable us to create greater competitive advantage, capture the opportunity we've discussed and generate shareholder value. With that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Hey, Scot. It's Hal Lawton, and good to speak with you this morning. I think the guidance that we provided is very consistent with the commentary that we had at the end of the third quarter. And I think aligned with the spirit of the dialogue in our opening remarks, which is that we expect COVID to remain a large kind of consumer driving force for the foreseeable future, certainly into the fall, if not for the balance of the year. And as a consequence of that, many of the macro trends, which have benefited us, will continue. We also think a number of these macro trends are sticky irregardless of COVID. And so, we kind of see those two coming together in a way that shapes the year as follows. The first quarter we're in now, we expect momentum in this quarter and our results in this quarter will be much like what we saw in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 with elevated sales levels. And then, as we start to comp on top of those in Q2 and Q3 and Q4 this year, we do expect that the comps will start to turn to more normal levels. And the collectiveness of that will kind of compile [Technical Difficulty] guided between minus 2 and plus 1. So it is a heavily weighted in the first quarter with kind of Q2, Q3, Q4, recognizing it will be comping on top of last year's elevated levels, but with still likely strong underlying momentum supporting those quarters. Yes. We're certainly looking to piece apart our various initiatives, and we have some pretty sophisticated analytics tools that allow us to do that, at these more elevated volume levels, it is a little bit harder to see than what you might see in a normal mid single digit comp environment. But I will say that it's our view that we are gaining share and winning in all the categories that we participate in. And that's really consistent across the Board, whether you're looking at industry level data or we're talking with vendors. And so that would lead us to believe that not only are we benefiting from the macro trends, but the work that we're doing to support the business is also helping with that. And I'll call out a few things that kind of give us that - give us that sense. First off, I'll point to kind of some data sets around our customer. Our unaided brand awareness due in part, due to our national television campaign that we launched last March is up 8 points in the year. That's a very significant improvement in unaided brand awareness. And then the benefit that we've seen of that is a significant - the most customers that we've ever had shop our store in one year last year, including 11 million new customers and six million reacquired customers. And those customers are shopping with us at repeat rates that are at kind of all-time highs. And those repeat shopping rates are for the new customers are holding - have held through the year. So whether it was a new customer we saw in March or April or May, or a new customer that we saw in October, November, December, all those repeat shopping rates are holding at all-time highs. And then, last thing I'll talk about is, if you look at our team members. And you look like our customer SAT scores, our - if you look at the customers perception of safety and health and well-being in our stores, customers seem to be voting with their wallets and shopping and Tractor Supply, indicative of both our strong transactions, but also our strong ticket. And I think that would speak to the fact that customers are certainly aggregating their ticket. You're hearing that from other retailers, more units per basket driving basket up, but a lot of these retailers are talking about negative comp transactions. With us, it's very balanced with about half coming from comp transactions and about half coming from average ticket. So we're seeing that stock up, but we're also seeing more transactions in the store. So, it's hard to kind of piece it together, but we do think the initiatives we're taking, the support we've given the business on inventory and adding staffing, our focus on cleanliness, plus our digital efforts and our early efforts around Fusion and Sidelight [ph] and FAST, are adding to the share - creating - helping us drive share gains and kind of add it to the macro trends we're seeing. Yes. Hi, Elizabeth and good morning. Yes. This was just completing my first year as the CEO of Tractor Supply. And so just kind of normal course, kind of steps back and did a strategic review of Petsense, right at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The business - the net takeaway is where the business is doing well. But if you look at the broader landscape of pets and where the shifts are coming, where things are growing, and you look at the - kind of what's playing out in specialty, through that work and then us revisiting our real estate model as a part of that, we made the decision to reduce the long-term store count expectations that we have for that business. And in doing so, that led us to revisit the value that we had on that business, on our balance sheet. And so we've now kind of reset our expectations for the new store counts of that business. We've hired a new leader, for the Petsense business, and we are - we will continue to invest in Petsense, as we see opportunities. And it's - as I said, the business is doing well. We do think its gaining share, in the specialty space. And we will continue to support that business and moving forward, just at a lower long-term store count target. Yes. I look forward to sharing with you more about the Petsense strategy as Matthew comes in and has an opportunity to engage and chart the future of the company. And we're very pleased with the performance. The stores are doing well. The website is doing well. As you said, Liz, we do know pet online is doing well. You can look at the industry data, and that's certainly something I know Matthew is going to - we'll be looking into as a way to accelerate our efforts there. So, more to come. Yes. Hey, Steve, and good morning. A couple of things I'll say. First of all, on the Neighbor's Club program, we are very pleased with the growth in the ownership of that - I mean, the growth in the membership of that program, reaching 19 million members, representing approximately 60% of our total sales. We're seeing very strong engagement rates with those customers. And we have plans, as we've talked about to reinvigorate that program in the first half of this year, which I think will drive a step change in engagement with those customers and also migration upward of their spend. So we're very - we're looking forward to that promotion and getting it out there and look forward to sharing more details with you at our next earnings call on it. As it relates to our new customers, we've mentioned in the past that we see approximately 20% of our new customers return and shop with us within 28 days. And that trend really hasn't changed since the beginning of the year. It's held very stable. And it's two or three points higher than what we would have seen in a historic period when we cohorted new customers. And then I would say it's not - we also continue to see strong repurchase rates as you get out to kind of two months at the 56 day count and at three months. And so we're very pleased with their reengagement. We see them engaging first in categories like poultry and dog and pet. But then they start to broaden their purchases across things like apparel and garden, and if they started in pet, they might move to poultry or vice versa. And a higher percentage of these groups than our normal business starts online and does a pickup in store, and then you'll see in their next purchase then coming into the store for purchase. And our new customer SAT scores are higher than historic as well. So, I'd say all around, we are pleased with the 19 million numbers. They represent the growth that we had this year, particularly in the midst of the pandemic. Our sign up is really at the register there face-to-face. People are really trying to check out much faster as we all know. So, the ability to still sign up those Neighbor's Clubs members and gain the millions that we did this year, we're very pleased with and then the new customers are exhibiting very strong reengagement behavior. I don't think we've disclosed that in the past. But what I will say is - and we'll get that some thought on whether to do so. But what I would say is there are material increases from previous years. Thanks. Appreciate it. Peter, I'm going to let Seth take that. Yes. Thanks, Peter. And what I'd say is the \u2013 I think the dynamics that are playing out in the market right now, whether it's with customers or vis-a\u0300-vis our competitors, those dynamics are really playing to the sweet spots of Tractor Supply. First off, people are struggling with in-stocks, and I think you're going to see more of that as we get into the spring with the supply chain disruption that's out there. And our team has done an outstanding job, managing inventory through the year. We saw how we ended the year with inventory above last year. And we're tracking to continue with that at those levels, if not higher, as Kurt mentioned in his opening remarks. We planned for our spring shipments to arrive earlier than they have historically. And so while we are seeing some container backlog, we are going to be able to manage through that and get it kind of in on a normal time frame, but that's to our benefit. So I think anywhere where you've made investments in inventory and you've leaned in there, anywhere where you're making investments in customer service because right now that makes such a big difference in this environment. And we've certainly done that through the net hiring of 10,000 team members and providing appreciation bonuses and others and raises to drive their engagement. Also in technology, if you've invested in technology and you can do curb side pickup, and you can do same-day, next-day delivery, and you can do those with great customer service, that leads to advantages as well. So I think the scale that we have in our distribution systems, the scale that we have in technology, the leverage and scale that we have with our vendors, and then, of course, our advantage of our 42,000 team members, which wake up every day looking to provide legendary service, all that just plays well for us. I mean, we're \u2013 and then you think about the convenience, the location of our stores and that's why if you go across every category, we're confident that we're taking share in a significant way. I mean, if you look at our CUE business being up over 20% for the quarter, that's \u2013 and you think about the proxy \u2013 using that as a proxy for the businesses that are in there around animal feed and pet food and others, those rates are well above industry estimates for those categories. And certainly, a lot of other companies that are out there reporting that play in those categories. So I think it really just speaks to the business model to track or the resiliency of it and the foundation of it and then the investments that we're making day-to-day to ensure that our customers and our new customers are having a great experience. We have not mentioned what percent are buying CUE in their first purchase. We did mention what percent are coming back and buying a second time. So about 20% of our new customers return and shop with us again within 28 days. And we said that's above historic run rates by several points. So we feel very good about our retention of these customers. And that's a proxy at one-time marker, but it's the same if you look across 7, 14 days, 2 months, 3 months, et cetera. As it relates to what they're buying on their first purchase, the 2 dominant areas that they're buying on their first purchase are pet, pet food or poultry and or supplies and such around those two categories. Yes, absolutely. So this is what the full focus of our marketing team is focused on, is exactly this, is we've got - we've invested over the last 1.5 year or two in our CRM capabilities, moving that platform to the Azure cloud, upgrading our analytical capabilities, adding new personalization tooling in place and also looking at behaviors, whether on the site or inside of the store and then looking for kind of like comparing them to look like shoppers. And so whether it's e-mails that those new customers get or whether it's digital banner ads, we're retargeting them. All those sorts of kind of marketing channels and vehicles are being used to engage with these customers and encourage them to re-shop with us. And in addition, obviously, we just have the investments we're making in our team members, the investments we're making in our store experience, the investments we're making in inventory and those sorts of things that drive repeat behavior as well. One interesting anecdote that I'll give on this is we ask our customers in our checkout survey, kind of post-purchase survey, what their top criteria were for why they selected to shop with Tractor Supply. And typically the responses are similar to what any other retailer would have with price and location convenience, having the right product, customer service; those sorts of things that are kind of the dominant criteria for shopping for retail. During the midst of the pandemic over the last 6 months, the number one and number two criteria have been cleanliness and safety. Never in my 20-plus years of retail, have I seen those two criteria at the top of a customer's decision-making criteria. And so that's why we've invested so much in those areas. And I highlighted the tens of millions of dollars we've spent on those areas in the last quarter. Yes. We are planning for the pet category to continue to remain strong, and to over-perform relative to our overall business in the year. I think on the last call, we talked about poultry and chickens and flocks and how they're a bit of an annuity stream, given that they have a 7, 8 year lifespan. Obviously, pet is very much the same way. With pet adoption up at an all-time high, those pets, as they grow are only going to \u2013 they're going to move from puppy food to adult food. We're seeing that, by the way, in our trends. Typically with dogs, as they get a little older, they eat a little more, as they get bigger. So we're actually seeing that \u2013 the benefit from that a little bit on the tonnage side. And we expect the humanization of pet will remain very strong this entire year, as people continue to work-from-home really for the foreseeable future, potentially all of 2021. And so they're around their pets. They're buying toys. They're buying snacks. They're upgrading their bed, they're getting them a new bed. All those things, I expect will continue this year. And as I said, we're very pleased with our pet business. We are confident we're gaining share in our pet business. We're seeing strong growth in our pet business, both in-store just through brick-and-mortar channels, as well as online. And certainly, the sweet spot for us on pet is our omnichannel, where we're seeing significant amount of pet purchases online picked up in store. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're investing heavily in this category to remain a strong destination for our customers in it, whether it was the release recently of our new Pet Rx solution online, whether it's the rollout of both the subscriptions in-store to support in a similar way that we have it online, whether it's the addition of 150 to 200 more pet watch stations this year, and then also the build-out of more pet wellness clinics in our stores to support the mobile pet clinics that we have that drive significant engagement with our stores from our customers. So we feel really good about where we are in pet, and we'll be continuing to invest here. I guess, I neglected also mentioned topologies is that our marketing campaign that we've been doing in the past year, we have a significant amount of dedicated marketing, both TV and digital devoted to pet. And it's - its systemic mean, it's always on and we do spike it at certain periods. But it's a consistent program that we're doing now. First time we've done that. We've been doing that for about 6 or 9 months. Yes, hey, Chuck. We are - remain very bullish, on the Side Lot project. It's - as we remarked before, garden is the category that our customers say they most participate in that we don't fully address their needs. And in the Side Lot that we have open, we - the customer engagement with the product and the purchase rate, it was - it's kind of like an overnight switch. Once that's all - when the project is complete and the product is in there, we saw really strong engagement with customers. And this is in the midst of fall and winter when, live goods assortments are very limited and gardening activities is much less. So we've got over 50 of these Side Lots, in - underway right now. Some, we're in the process of applying for permits. Some were in the final stages of getting the certificate of occupancy. We've got 100 plus more \u2013 100 plus more scheduled for the year. And we're very excited about their potential. And the team is doing an excellent job kind of navigating this environment to get those built. It's in the context of COVID you've got, construction crews at a time. So we'll have to quarantine for a couple of weeks, if one of the team members on the project is test positive. You've got city municipalities that getting permitting done is very difficult. Getting someone to come out and do a certificate of occupancy is much slower. And the team is just doing an excellent job managing through, all those twists and turns. We're very - we remain very bullish on Side Lot. And like, I said, a number of them underway. I just visited a handful of them in the last week and really excited to have our first batch of them opened in time for the spring season. It's very seasonal. And in my experience elsewhere, the garden centers are very productive, if not more productive than they store, during the core spring season. And then in the winter time, the productivity falls off well below the core of the store. And so, we're looking forward to having a full year ahead of us with these projects to be able to get a sense for what's the max productivity in the midst of spring. How much can we prop the productivity up with things like Christmas trees, and pumpkins, and harvest type stuff in the fall? And then, we'll see where it plays out for the full year. But we are very confident that it will drive significant productivity relative to how the space is being used now and will drive strong shareholder returns. The question is to what magnitude. And we'll know more as we get into spring."

            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal. And hello to everyone on the call. This year was like no other in the history of Tractor Supply, as we delivered record sales and financial performance for the year. The fourth quarter continued to benefit from the macro trends that have worked to our favor. As we rank order our comparable store sales performance, the trends that I shared with you in the second and third quarter continue to play out in our sales performance. The largest driver continued to be our customer's desire for product categories that support the Out Here Lifestyle, as they shifted spending away from travel, entertainment and dining to creating their own experiences. For Tractor Supply, this included purchases such as outdoor recreation and living, like UTVs and outdoor fire pits, along with all those indoor projects and winterizing their homes and equipment. This trend also includes living a more self-reliant lifestyle. The adoption of new hobbies like backyard poultry, hunting, gardening and bird feeding had continued. And we believe these hobbies and trends are becoming more ingrained in our customer's behavior. The strong brand awareness and new customer performance that Hal discussed was the second largest driver of our comparable store sales performance. This was then followed by tailwinds such as emergency response related demand due to the hurricane activity and various strategic initiatives, such as our investments in digital and the omnichannel experience, same-day delivery and our private label credit card. Exclusive of the modest hurricane activity benefit, the weather impact was generally neutral compared to the prior year. We had robust performance in our big ticket categories, which exceeded our overall comp sales growth. This was driven by broad based strength, with safe, recreational vehicles, utility vehicles, trailers and generators representing the top 5 product categories. Fourth quarter gross profit exceeded our expectations due to higher demand for our products and a reduction in promotional and clearance activities. These factors were partially offset by higher transportation costs as a percentage of net sales. The result was that gross margin as a percentage of sales was 34.6% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 75 basis points. Moving on to SG&A. The 46 basis point increase in adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales was attributable to 3 primary factors. First, incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, second, increased incentive compensation due to record sales and profit performance in the quarter, and then third, investments in our strategic initiatives. The additional costs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic included appreciation bonuses to team members across stores and distribution centers, as well as additional labor hours and supply cost dedicated to cleaning and sanitation to enhance the health and safety of team members and our customers. COVID-19 related incremental costs were approximately $33 million in the quarter, and that compares to our estimate of $15 million to $20 million going into the quarter, which resulted from an unexpected resurgence of COVID-19 cases late in the year. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit increased nearly 36% with operating profit margin of 9%, an improvement of 29 basis points. Adjusted net income was $193.2 million, an increase of 34%. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.64, an increase of nearly 36%. For the year, we reached an adjusted operating profit margin of 10.1% and had strong growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 47.4%. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong, merchandise inventories were $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, representing an increase of 5.6% in average inventory per store. This level of inventory is still a bit lighter than we would like, given the momentum of the business, and we are working with our suppliers and vendors to build our stock to support this momentum. During the quarter, we issued our first ever public offering of debt, and we received investment-grade ratings from both Moody's and S&P given our strong credit metrics. We issued $650 million in 10 year notes at a coupon rate of 1.75%. The proceeds from the debt issues were used for refinancing and repayment of term loans as we plan to maintain a leverage ratio below 2.5 times. Fiscal 2020 was a year of strong cash flow from operations, which totaled $1.39 billion, an increase of $582 million or 72%. For the full year, we returned a total of $518 million in capital to our shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our authorization for share repurchases. Today, our Board reconfirmed our commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a 30% increase in our quarterly dividend, which puts our dividend payments in line with our target of at least a 30% payout ratio. Moving now to our guidance for 2021 that is detailed on page 11 of the supplemental deck. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results remains uncertain. Given that backdrop, we are planning our \u2013 for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes. To date, while still very early in the first quarter, we continue to see strong sales momentum in the business. For fiscal 2021, we expect net sales in the range of $10.7 billion to $11 billion. Comp store sales are anticipated to be in the range of down 2% to up 1%. For the year, we anticipate operating profit margin to be in the range of 9.3% to 9.6%, a significant step up when compared to our baseline 2019 performance. In fiscal 2020, approximately 90% of the operating margin year-over-year gain was driven by gross margin improvement. For fiscal 2021, we anticipate some giveback in gross margin and SG&A to slightly increase as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2020 on an adjusted basis. Now let's go into a little more detail on each of these areas. Our expectation is for modest gross margin contraction in 2021, as we anticipate incremental promotional activity, along with higher freight costs. Partially offsetting these pressures are an expected benefit from vendor funding for our field activity support team program, while the fast program expenses will be reported in SG&A with a year-over-year impact of about 40 basis points on each. Breaking down SG&A, the leverage from reduced COVID-19 costs and more normalized incentive compensation is expected to be offset by ongoing wage pressures, investments in our supply chain and digital space and higher depreciation and amortization expense. And as a reminder, the FAST program costs are reported in SG&A. As a result, we are forecasting SG&A as a percent of sales to slightly deleverage. Adjusted for normalization of the FAST program costs, SG&A is expected to remain relatively flat as a percent of sales. As always, we would encourage you to think about our business between the first half of the year and the second half as this is in line with how we manage the business. As you model 2021, I want to point out a few items that will impact comparability. Appreciation bonuses impact the second and fourth quarters of 2020, while wage increases of about $13 million per quarter took effect in the third quarter of 2020. Costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain an uncertainty for us in 2020, as our utmost priority remains the health and safety of our team members and our customers. For the first quarter, we anticipate costs related to the pandemic will continue at elevated levels. Additionally, as you think about the cadence of 2021, our business performance is expected to be stronger in the first quarter, as our comparisons step up starting in the second quarter. The first quarter of 2021 is forecast to have the highest comp performance of the year and correspondingly the highest operating profit growth rate. The second quarter is likely to be our most difficult earnings comparison of the year due to a couple of factors. Please recall the second quarter of 2020 experienced the strongest gross margin performance, driven by the least sales promotional activity. In addition, we expect incremental cost in Q2 of this year as we support the launch of an upgrade to our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. Moving to below the line. We expect total interest expense for 2021 to be approximately $27 million, while our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 22.5% to 22.8%. Our capital spending is anticipated to range from $450 million to $550 million with more than 80% of that spending going towards growth initiatives. The vast majority of the capital spending increase is attributable to new in-store initiatives and supporting technology for our Life Out Here Strategy. Depreciation expense is estimated to increase approximately $50 million. This is above our recent run rate as we accelerate our investments in the business. For the year, we expect share repurchases to reduce our diluted weighted average shares outstanding by about 1% to 2%. For modeling purposes, we've assumed weighted average shares outstanding of about 116 million shares in 2021. Net income is forecast in the range of $750 million to $800 million or $6.50 to $6.90 per diluted share. With our strong performance in 2020 and the critical momentum in our business, the team at Tractor Supply is excited about the Life Out Here Strategy. Our clear focus enables us to continue to be the innovation leader in our channel and emerge from the pandemic stronger than before. Now I'll turn it back to Hal. Hey, Karen. This is Kurt. Yes, thank you for the question. And really, the question, as I understand it, is about the outlook on the operating margin, the flow-through going forward. One important thing that I pointed out in our prepared remarks is, we had tremendous upside and benefit in 2020 from the gross margin side of the business. And the principal drivers with that, was for the majority of the year, we had favorable transportation. And the most significant was unusually of low levels of promotion and clearance. I mean, the inventory, at some point, really felt like it was going hand to mouth to the consumer. And we anticipate this year in 2021, as we still have some of that extended pandemic demand before we start to cycle into that, that there's benefit on less promotion and clearance. We'll start to normalize on that. The important thing is to manage the business, ensuring that we're everyday low price. We're giving our customers a great value in our product enterprise. And over the years, we're going to manage the operating margin, ensuring that we continue to gain market share. And the important thing is that there may begin to be in the next couple of years as inventory more normalizes and more clearance exposure normalizes. There's some anticipated risk with gross margin. So, we'll continue to manage gross margin with our benefits of our driving and staying at EDLP, not anticipating to revert back to the promotional activity in the past. But with our investments in the business the next couple of years to continue to gain this market share, we anticipate still staying around that range. We think it's a great sweet spot to allow us to continue to hit those revenue growth targets and to continue to gain on the market share. So we want to manage to a reasonable operating margin to continue our opportunity to gain market share. And our outlook for 2021 and the long-term really anticipates that. And as we progress, we'll continue to update you as we see more visibility as things change. Yes. It's a great question. As we think about traffic and ticket in 2021, there's a lot of variables and still some uncertainty as we begin to lap that. We're going to be nimble and have shown in the past that we can shift very well to that. So as we think about the business with ticket and traffic, I'll give you some thoughts on ticket drivers, certainly some level of inflation that could be driving ticket. If there's continued trip consolidation, it helps in the ticket. But other aspects on traffic, as areas such as trip consolidation, if there's a bit more normalization on trip consolidation, as we begin to cycle some of the COVID demand. And if there's inflation, it sometimes has an offset on the traffic. So point being, there's a number of variables in there. And as we cycle this, we see our opportunity in both categories, and there can be some risk and shift in both. And we've contemplated those aspects in our guidance for comp sales as we begin to cycle the COVID lift that we saw starting in Q2 of 2020. And we anticipate that there's not a meaningful shift from either one as we see it at this point, but both has variables that could drive it up or down. Yes. Scott, how are you? Good morning. Yes. Peter, this is Kurt. In regards to inflation, let me first start with what we've seen here in 2020. I mean, we saw a bit of elevation as we worked our way through the year. In Q4, we still saw a bit of a modest level of inflation, less than 100 basis points of commodity inflation into the product cost. We anticipate that as all of the inflation information, as I know everyone's seen is certainly at higher levels. We're anticipating that to accelerate in 2021. We've seen where inflation on commodities can rise as quickly as it did. It can also shift, as you know, just as quickly. So like we said in our prepared remarks, we're planning for 2021 and are a number of scenarios. But in our guidance, we assume that over the year, a weighted average of about 1% to 2% inflation into the product cost and that certainly could vary first half versus second half of the year. And right now, we're seeing the points that Seth mentioned on grains and steel being primary drivers of some inflation at this point. So as we picked up an assumption, that range of about 1% to 2% is where we landed in our assumption."

Thanks for taking the time today to join us and I do hope you're all staying safe and well. And on behalf of all of us at Tractor Supply, I also want to thank frontline workers around the country, including our own team members who work so hard to ensure that our stores can continue to provide our products and services to the communities we call home.  Today, we have a packed agenda. First, we're here to discuss our third quarter results with Hal Lawton, our CEO; and Kurt Barton, our CFO. After that, we'll be joined by members of TSC's executive team, who will go into greater detail on some of Tractor Supply's key initiatives to support our company's long-term plans. Following their presentations, there will be an extensive Q&A period when they will take your questions.  Our goal is to allow about an hour for the Q&A session and we plan to conclude our event by noon, Central Time. A replay of the webcast as well as the Q&A session will be available on our website at irtractorsupply.com under Events and Presentations.  But before we get too far down the road, I'd like to ask you to take note of our safe harbor statement. Please note, some of the discussions, presentations and statements that we make today regarding our business, operation and financial performance may be considered forward-looking.

Although the company believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations or any of its expectations or any of its forward-looking statements will prove to be correct and actual results may differ materially from expectations. Important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements are included at the end of the press release issued today and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Because we use select non-GAAP measures to describe our business performance, we've provided a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, which is included in the appendix of this presentation and will be posted on the IR section of our website as part of today's call.

Tractor Supply undertakes no obligation to update any information discussed in this webcast.  Thank you for your time and attention. Now we'd like to share a video featuring one of our many team members who lives our lifestyle and brings the Tractor Supply story to life. \nHarry Lawton: Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. When I first saw the video that we just shared with you, I thought it really captured the essence of Tractor Supply as a purpose-driven company. It is who we are. It is what we do. In retail today, having meaning and purpose with customers makes all the difference. It is a pleasure to speak with everyone today not only about our third quarter results but also about our Life Out Here strategy.  We see opportunities to capture tremendous growth ahead of us. As we're in the midst of a global health crisis and all that comes along with that, we didn't feel that it was appropriate to do a full investor community day. Rather, it's our goal today to share our Life Out Here strategic framework and provide greater insights on our initiatives as we plan for 2021 and beyond. Over time, as the world normalizes, our goal would be to host another event in the future as appropriate.  Tractor Supply is well positioned to leverage our stores and capitalize on our omnichannel capabilities. We have a large total addressable market with an attractive position and are gaining market share. We're focused on operational excellence, execution discipline and making investments from a position of strength for long-term value creation.  We're on a multiyear journey to evolve the future of our company. We are thriving as our second and third quarter results indicate. And with the actions we're taking, we're committed to emerging from the pandemic stronger than before. My sincere thanks and appreciation go out to our more than 40,000 team members of Tractor Supply that delivered these strong results. This is a team that's been operating during a global pandemic, supporting recovery from multiple natural disasters and executing at elevated sales levels while, at the same time, laying the foundation for our future growth.  Coming into the quarter, we recognized it would continue to be a challenging time and our team certainly stepped up to the challenge. Through it all, the organization has lived up to our mission and values. And I also want to thank our vendor and supply chain partners who've done a tremendous job supporting us in this challenging operating environment. I'm incredibly proud to be a part of this team. The results that we reported for the third quarter would not be possible without the team's inspiring efforts over the last several months.  The Tractor Supply team has been fully committed to adapting to the uncertainty brought on by the pandemic. Our utmost priority has been the health and safety of our team members and customers. And we're committed to being a safe place to work and a safe place to shop. And we continue to implement industry-leading best practices across all parameters of safety.  Our team member engagement scores continue to rank among the best-in-class. We have taken steps to reinforce our appreciation of the hard work of our teams that enhance and build on our culture. We're also committed to supporting and strengthening the local communities that we call home. Before we get into our Life Out Here strategy that I'm very excited to share with you, let's cover off on some of our third quarter performance.  The third quarter was another exceptional quarter for Tractor Supply. Our results were very much a continuation of the trends we experienced in the second quarter. For Q3, we had robust and consistent growth across all periods, all product categories and all geographic regions. Our brand awareness campaign, along with our new customer growth, continues to be a significant driver of our performance.  Our e-commerce business continued to drive triple-digit comps with nearly 80% of our omni sales picked up in our stores. And e-commerce continues to increase significantly as a percentage of our overall sales, doubling its penetration year-over-year. The work we have done to improve our e-commerce capabilities has certainly resonated with our customers. For example, our recently launched customer app has had almost 500,000 downloads since our launch in July.  For the third quarter, our business continued to perform at record levels. As an essential needs-based retailer, we are supporting our customers the products they need to take care of their families, their animals, their land and pets. Net sales for us in the third quarter were up 31% over last year with comparable store sales up 26.8%. Much like second quarter, we had good balance across both our transactions and our ticket growth. The top-performing categories were in our core competencies of pet food, feed and forage, agricultural fencing, poultry and bird feeding, along with seasonal categories like zero-turn tractors, outdoor power equipment and lawn and garden as we had an excellent extended selling season for these categories. And we had robust performance in our big ticket sales, driven by strength in zero-turns, safes, generators, trailers and front-engine riders.  Our CUE products, consumable, usable and edible categories, which represent the strength of our core reoccurring business, had comp sales growth in the high 20% range, an acceleration from our mid-teens performance in the second quarter. We're gaining share in these businesses and across the board, including pet food.  We continue to engage with new and reengaged customers at amongst the fastest rate in the company's history. On a combined basis, more than 10 million identified new and reengaged customers have shopped with Tractor Supply since the start of the pandemic. These new customers skew younger, higher-income and slightly more female and they represent significant incremental growth opportunities for us to unlock. More customers shopping with us than ever and they have larger baskets. The feedback from our customers on their shopping patterns at Tractor Supply include positive comments such as convenient locations, selection of products and most importantly, previous positive shopping experiences at our stores. Our opportunity is to capitalize on these trends as we look to nurture these customers and gain market share. We're working hard to retain these customers with marketing, products and service offerings and we'll continue to make investments to do so.  Before we turn to our strategic framework for Life Out Here, Kurt will now take you through some greater detail on our performance and share our outlook for the fourth quarter.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Hal and good morning, everyone. I will go through more of the third quarter financial highlights and then come back as part of our strategy update. At that time, I'll share with you greater details on our focus to generate shareholder value. First, I want to build on the overview of our sales that Hal shared earlier and provide a couple of additional highlights. We did have marginal sales benefit from emergency response products as our teams work to support the communities impacted from multiple hurricanes and the wildfires out West. In addition, much like the second quarter, we had ideal weather conditions for the quarter also contributing to the comp sales performance.  Another highlight for the quarter is that we continue to achieve strong year-over-year growth in our private label credit card sales. The largest growth in our PLCC tender came from standard financing while also seeing strength in our big ticket sales. We continue to see strong growth in this program, providing us the confidence that our 5% reward program is resonating with our customers.  Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 36.4% in the third quarter. That's an increase of 138 basis points. This increase was driven principally by a reduction in frequency and depth of promotions and a lower level of clearance, both of them as a result of strong demand for our product categories and our focus on everyday low price. We also benefited from lower transportation costs as a percentage of net sales as most of our cost inputs were favorable to the prior year, such as domestic carrier costs, imports and fuel costs. We did begin to see a meaningful shift in the domestic and import carrier costs beginning in the third quarter, which will begin to flow through the P&L during the fourth quarter. And I'll speak to that in a bit later.  Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 30.7% compared to the prior year's third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses improved 14 basis points. The robust comp sales performance drove over 250 basis points of leverage in our core SG&A expenses, inclusive of the permanent wage and benefit increases effective in July of this year.  Now the strong leverage was partially offset by incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic; investments in strategic initiatives, including incremental advertising initiatives; and increased incentive compensation, with the majority of that incentive compensation for the benefit of the frontline store teams, given the record sales and profit performance in the quarter. The incremental costs related to COVID-19 pandemic was in line with our expectations, albeit at the higher end of the range and it included additional labor hours and supply costs dedicated to the cleaning and sanitation to enhance the health and safety of our team members and our customers. The 3 incremental cost factors I just pointed out represented the vast majority of the offset to the 250 basis points of leverage.  Turning to profitability. Our operating profit dollars increased $90.4 million over the prior year, with operating profit margin of 9.7%, an improvement of 152 basis points. Net income was $190.6 million, an increase of 56%. Diluted EPS was $1.62, an increase of nearly 59%. When I come back up later in the event, I'll give you a greater perspective on our cash flow, liquidity and capital allocation priorities, all of which builds on the current strength and health of our balance sheet.  Moving now to our guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, our view assumes no significant worsening of the pandemic or any dramatic reclosing of the economy. To date, we continue to see the strong sales momentum in the business. We expect this momentum to continue, albeit at a lower level than the third quarter as we forecast delivering strong sales and profitability for the fourth quarter. We continue to believe it's always better to look at our business by the halves of the year. Due to the unique situation related to COVID-19, we are providing our view on the fourth quarter similar to how we did last quarter. Factors contributing to a heightened level of uncertainty include the duration and impact of shelter-in-place restrictions and social distancing measures, the potential for incremental government stimulus benefits, elevated unemployment levels and the November elections.  Additionally, the fourth quarter is sensitive to shifts in weather trends and seasonal holiday shopping patterns. With this backdrop, we would anticipate the strength in our comparable sales trends to moderate as we move through the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect net sales to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion and comp sales growth in the range of 15% to 20%. Net income is forecasted to be in the range of $163 million to $175 million and diluted EPS of $1.37 to $1.47. We anticipate gross margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of flat to a modest increase compared to the prior year.  There are three factors driving the shift from the more favorable trends of the 2 most recent quarters. One, we are cycling strong prior year gross margin performance in the fourth quarter, which benefited from strong direct margin performance as our merchant teams partnered with our vendors on achieving a solid overall landed margin. And then two, we anticipate the transportation cost to be higher as a percentage of sales due to rising costs in both domestic and import transportation and along with that, higher seasonal surcharges for small package parcels related to our strong and growing e-commerce business. And then three, in comparison to the previous 2 quarters, we are planning more promotional events during this always-promotional-holiday-shopping season.  In regards to SG&A, there are 2 incremental costs to the business factored into our guidance. First, the COVID-19-related costs of approximately $17 million to $20 million to ensure the health and safety of our team members and customers; and then second, an incremental $12 million to $15 million for the prioritization of our strategic growth initiatives. And as a reminder, consistent with our third quarter, our move to permanent wage and benefit changes will represent an incremental $13 million in the quarter. And for modeling purposes, as a percentage of sales, we estimate 40 to 50 basis points impact from incremental incentive compensation based on the strong performance of the quarter and the full year. Lastly, we are forecasting our net income growth for the quarter to be generally in line with the sales growth.  To wrap up, our recent results reinforce the confidence and optimism of our future. We are moving fast to capitalize on the exciting opportunities we see ahead of us. I look forward to coming back here to discuss with you our plans for delivering sustainable shareholder value.  And with that, let me turn it back over to you, Hal.\nHarry Lawton: Thanks, Kurt. We've been operating in this challenging environment for more than seven months now and our team continues to show great resilience, determination and commitment. Once again, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude and appreciation for the remarkable performance across the entire Tractor Supply team. Thank you.\nMary Pilkington: Thank you, Hal and Kurt. I believe that our results year-to-date create an environment where we can continue to strengthen and grow our business well into the future. Now let's turn our focus to our Life Out Here strategy. This approach builds on Tractor Supply's strong heritage of over 80 years as a dependable and convenient supplier for the Out Here lifestyle. Hal will now share more details around the strategy and his insights.\nHarry Lawton: For the next hour or so, you'll hear from myself, John Ordus, Seth Estep, Rob Mills and Kurt Barton on our Life Out Here strategy. As mentioned, these presentations will be followed by Q&A. All right. So let's jump into it. Tractor Supply has a strong heritage of being the dependable and convenient supplier for the Out Here lifestyle. We are a purpose-driven company. We're deeply rooted in our mission and values. We have a resilient business model and a track record of performance. And importantly, we see an exciting future with compelling opportunities for growth and value creation. We're an integral part of our customers' lives. We equip a way of life, a way of life that we respect, love and often live ourselves. We serve the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers as well as those who simply enjoy the rural lifestyle.  We have a diversified retail footprint of over 1,900 stores across 49 states. Our footprint is a competitive advantage for us and it allows us to address the needs of our customers better than anyone else in this fragmented market. Our size also allows us to have strong relationships with our vendor partners and to efficiently invest in technology and supply chain infrastructure.  One of our special sauces is our ability to leverage this footprint and while being nationally strong, also being able to tailor to the needs of our local community. Our culture is a competitive advantage. Our mission is work hard, have fun and make money. This mission is supported by 10 values. Combined, they serve as the underpinning of our culture and guiding principles for how we conduct our business.  Our focus on Life Out Here, in combination with our culture and our store footprint, has been our foundation for our business model. This business model has proven to be very resilient as we're needs-based and demand-driven. This has allowed us to expand from 200 stores to over 1,900 stores in the last 20 years, with trailing 12 months' revenue nearing $10 billion. We have consistently delivered strong results over the last decade. We have a track record of positive traffic and same-store sales growth. We've generated strong free cash flow while maintaining a discipline on the use of financial leverage. We are strongly committed to environmental sustainability efforts. This is important to our team members, our customers, the communities we call home and our investors.  As an example, we've saved 138 million kilowatt hours since 2013 and we've recycled 3.3 million wood pallets last year. In 2018, we announced our goal to reduce carbon emissions from our facilities by 25% by 2025 and we've made great progress towards achieving that goal. We are also a strong proponent of diversity, equality and inclusion in our workforce with over 49% of our team members being female. We also published our first ever ESG tearsheet this year, along with completing our inaugural submission to CDP in August. And hopefully, you all saw our announcement last week that Tractor Supply was designated as a Great Place to Work.  We compete in an attractive market that is benefiting from numerous tailwinds. Consumers have always invested in their homes and they are doing so now like never before. Pet ownership is at an all-time high and pets have evolved into a true family member. Also, we've seen the migration of the United States population out of dense urban areas, out into the rural and suburbs of America and home-standing activities and self-reliance are very much in vogue. And additionally, because of our lifestyle and our 15,500-square foot format, we are also benefiting from trends like trip consolidation. As we look ahead, we see significant opportunities for growth and we're committed to investing to gain share and create value in a large, relatively fragmented market.  We estimate that our total addressable market to be nearly $110 billion and we believe that our share to be approximately 10%. And this provides a significant upside potential to expand our share of this large market. To capture this growth, we'll continue to invest in new stores with a target of 75 to 80 stores per year. We feel very good about our long-term market potential for 2,500 Tractor Supply stores. Our new store economics continue to be strong with robust returns.  The other way we'll grow is investment in our Life Out Here strategy. We are all about the Out Here lifestyle and our strategy is being focused on being an integral part of our customers' lives. And there are 5 pillars to this strategy. The first is deliver legendary customer service. The second is to advance our ONETractor capabilities. The third is to operate The Tractor Way. The fourth is to go the country mile for our team and the fifth is to generate healthy shareholder return. So let's review them in a little more detail.  First, delivering legendary service is a core component of our mission. This strategic component includes activities such as our brand campaign, CRM activities and the evolution of our Neighbor's Club. The objective of this pillar is to expand and deepen our customer base.  Second, advance our ONETractor capabilities. We launched our ONETractor strategy in 2017 and have made significant progress since. And you'll hear later from Rob Mills on our actions in this area, which includes our mobile app, omni fulfillment options and website enhancements. The objective of this pillar is to ensure that our digital capabilities stay ahead of our customer expectations.  Excellence in operations has always been a hallmark of Tractor Supply and we call this The Tractor Way, our third pillar. The 3 main areas of focus for this pillar are space productivity, store labor productivity and supply chain capabilities. And you'll hear more from Seth on Project Fusion and our store remodels and on our Side Lot Transformation. And from John, he's going to share with you some insights on our FAST initiative and how we're using it to drive labor productivity.  Our fourth strategy is that we go the country mile for our team. Our team members are a source of competitive advantage for us. We have a highly passionate and engaged team. In many instances, we hire our customers who bring their lifestyle expertise to work every day. And we continue to invest in our team members, their well-being and their workplace experience. We're committed to a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace. We have industry-leading store and DC manager retention. We provide significant opportunities for growth for our team members.  And finally, our last pillar. It's our goal to generate healthy shareholder return. Given our strong financial performance and resources, we'll continue to make investments that you'll hear about today to grow our business. We believe we can set an even stronger foundation that will enable us to emerge from the pandemic stronger with the goal of generating healthy shareholder return. We believe our key strategic initiatives will be meaningfully accretive to our financial profile. And you'll hear more detail from Kurt later on how the Life Out Here strategy purposely aligns our business and our financial strategy.  The leadership that drives the execution of these 5 pillars is an experienced management team with a strong track record in retail. Kurt, Seth, John and Ben, they bring 65 years of experience with Tractor Supply. And we've got Rob, Christi and Colin, they each have 5 years of Tractor Supply but bringing experience from Ulta and Home Depot and Target. And Melissa Kersey recently joined us as our CHRO after experiences at Walmart and McDonald's. I've never been more excited to be part of such a dynamic team who will lead our strategy in the years to come.  To wrap up, Tractor Supply has a resilient business model with a differentiated and loyal and growing customer base. We are moving at a fast pace. With our Life Out Here strategy, we're creating Tractor Supply 2.0 to ensure we continue as a strong, relevant company for the future. Now is the time for us to invest as we look to drive sustainable growth and long-term value for our shareholders.\nMary Pilkington: Thank you, Hal. For more details on how we're executing the Life Out Here strategy, let's hear from our deep and experienced executive team. First up, Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer, Seth Estep. Seth will share some exciting developments within our product portfolio and provide updates on several initiatives focused on driving productivity of the space inside and outside of our stores.\nSeth Estep: Thank you, Mary Winn and hello, everyone. I'm excited to be here today to share with you some of the key merchandising initiatives to drive sustained top and bottom line performance. We believe we have a significant opportunity to add science, enhanced analytics and category expansions to drive sales and become an even more integral part of the Out Here lifestyle.  Specifically, as we look to drive consistent mid-single-digit comp sales, a maniacal focus must be given to driving space productivity. As you can see when looking at the productivity of our stores versus other retailers in the peer group, we believe we have considerable opportunity to close the gap and we have several key initiatives that we'd like to share with you today on how we can shift these metrics up and to the right.  At Tractor Supply, we have a lot of exciting merchandising programs in the works, but there are 3 initiatives I want to highlight for you today that we believe will help drive our space productivity in our stores. First, we recently implemented new technology that dramatically enhances our ability to leverage AI and data analytics to optimize our product assortments and meet the local and regional needs of our customers. This technology unlocks vast amounts of data and insights to help us make decisions at both the store, category and SKU level.  Second is Project Fusion, tractor Supply's first true remodel program that will help enhance our customer shopping experience, drive convenience and bring forth our latest merchandising initiatives to our existing store base.  And third, we have our Side Lot Transformation project that we believe is a significant opportunity to grow sales, increase trips and improve convenience by leveraging our outdoor selling space to live up to our commitment to have everything our customers need to live Life Out Here. Through these initiatives, we believe we will grow sales per square foot, increase market share, improve customer retention and acquisition as well as grow the market basket and profitability. I'm excited to share with you more about these programs today.  We have completed several technology and analytic initiatives that will drive space productivity across all 1,900-plus stores. First, we are currently implementing our new channel-clustering and assortment-optimization tools. These new tools will elevate the way we allocate product in space as we blend science with the art of merchandising. These systems take into account a wide range of data sources and combines them with the overall merchant product strategies to generate optimal product recommendations. We believe these new capabilities will result in growing market share, achieving higher profit margins with improved inventory precision and supporting more regional and localized assortments to be the dependable supplier for our customers, all of which will drive greater sales per foot and store productivity.  For instance, the seasonal division store-clustering example combines stores with similar customer demographics, POS purchasing data and other data points to optimize our seasonal product assortment to fit what they need. This data tells us that group one, in this example, primarily dominant in the Deep South, aligns with the Pastoral Pride Mosaic, a proud working-class customer who lives in rural communities. The data tells us that key product categories for this group are tractor and riders, rec vehicles and tractor maintenance. So using this information, we will tailor the seasonal assortment in these group 1 stores to meet those customers' needs to drive sales and enhance productivity. Our goal is to be locally great and nationally strong by optimizing our use of space and localizing our product assortments to meet the market needs.  Project Fusion is our second primary initiative to drive space productivity. With Project Fusion, our goal is to remodel our existing store base, bringing programs to life with new fixtures, layouts and products that truly enhance the customer shopping experience. The site-level space is analyzed category by category and reallocated as needed to align with current merchandising strategies and to drive space productivity. When reviewing the age distribution of our current store portfolio, we believe we have an opportunity to roll out Project Fusion across 60% to 70% of our store base over time. In addition to these remodels, we will continue to implement our best-in-class merchandising programs to non-Fusion stores through product resets as well as new store openings. By the end of 2020, our target is to roll out Project Fusion to 75 stores and we plan to accelerate this initiative to 150 to 200 stores next year.  Our third major space productivity initiative is our Side Lot Transformation. Many of our stores have an equivalent amount of outdoor selling space as they do inside. For years, we've used our side lot primarily for fencing, other ag supplies as well as storage. By refixturing the products currently in the side lot, we can maintain our current outdoor assortment and add significantly more products in categories that are meaningful for our customers to care for their home and their land. Our goal is to leverage this underutilized outdoor space to be the Out Here lawn and garden authority and to enhance our relationship with our customers to be the indispensable supplier for the lifestyle they choose to live.  There are several ways that we're going to leverage this outdoor space. We're excited to build out a 4,000- to 5,000-square foot garden center in our side lots. Based on our customer research, outdoor lawn and garden is the #1 category that our customer base plays in that we currently aren't a destination for. We are implementing a drive-through pickup lane for our buy online, pick up at store orders to give new and existing customers the convenience in picking up their feed on the go and giving them that contactless customer experience.  This Side Lot Transformation will enable us to become the Out Here lawn and garden authority. By the end of 2020, our target is to transform the side lots of 55 to 65 stores, either completely or under final construction, as we enter 2021. And we plan to accelerate this initiative to an additional 150 to 200 stores next year. We will also start to open up new stores with our new side lot prototype in the back half of 2021. We've already identified growers that could support more than 75% of our current store base. And over time, we anticipate transforming the side lot in 60% to 70% of our stores.  Now that you know a little bit about these initiatives, I'm going to take you on a really quick tour of our Fusion and Side Lot Transformation that we recently completed at our Rome, Georgia store.  The Rome store is representative of a typical store for our chain with around 15,500 square feet of indoor selling space and also an attached side lot with an equivalent amount of selling space. This store opened up in 2005 and as you can see, it has an opportunity to improve how we are presenting the brand to our customers. Over the next few minutes, I'm going to take you on that virtual tour and walk you through several of the updates to improve the brand experience and drive space productivity.  It all starts when a customer enters our store. At Tractor Supply, we want everyone to feel welcomed and really connect to the Out Here lifestyle. We want it to be an inviting experience with open sight lines across the store and one of the big changes of this layout involves creating one central customer service and checkout hub that shoppers can really use as the heart and soul of our store.  When you move to apparel, we've reallocated merchandising space to bring in new brands like Columbia, expand winning brands like Carhartt in area, particularly in women's. The apparel area has a fresh new appearance and layout. Next up is tool, truck and hardware. Like apparel, we created store-within-a-store expansions, utilize their air rights with new fixtures, completely retumble the adjacencies and category space to improve productivity. We know we have an opportunity to grow market share in tools and DIY. And with these changes, we're also introducing brands such as Makita that resonate with our customers and their lifestyle.  In our updated feed area, customers can shop by species, whether it be livestock, poultry or equine. In home setting categories, an area we can differentiate in retail today. Here, you can see just our new brooder tower, solidifying TSC as the destination for poultry.  Tractor Supply customers love their animals. And in our pet department, we've also increased space, allowing more holding power as well as allocating additional footage for categories like pet food and pet accessories, while improving the sight lines and shopping experience. This is such an important category for us and we continue to see opportunity to gain share. TSC is also a great place to have an outing with your dog and we've introduced new services for customers such as our pet wash. This new feature has been really well received by shoppers. We also plan to incorporate pilot wellness centers in select stores in partnership with our mobile clinic provider.  Gardening and landscape are significant destination categories for Tractor Supply, but we think we are only scratching the surface. As we mentioned earlier, we recognize we have an opportunity to really leverage these categories to grow with our existing customers while attracting and retaining new shoppers. For our seasonal department, we actually shifted it to the other side of the store to align the adjacency with our side lot so we could cohesively bring the inside department and the garden center to life.  Now let's move to the side lot area where you can see a remarkable change in the utilization of space, with one of the biggest transformational things we did was the creation of our garden center. Some of our new category highlights in the garden center include outdoor living and grilling, best-selling annuals, perennials, shrubs and trees, with a primary focus on fruit and garden which are very meaningful to the Out Here customer. We also believe this somewhat softens the store to appeal to a more female shopper base as well, which could drive sales in other categories like apparel, decor and pet.  We've added color in other live goods, really focusing in on items and products that we know our customers want as we want to be the destination for all-things-garden-related for our customers.  Beyond the garden center, our drive-through pickup lane allows for contactless customer service and convenience. Customers picking up buy online, pick up at stores orders stop at the first bay. And at our second bay, we have our new drive-through barn that allows our team members to load heavy animal feed, fencing and other core categories directly into their vehicles, convenience that we know our customers want. This entire Side Lot Transformation was completed without losing any products out of our original side lot. We just improved the merchandising through new fixtures that we think truly enhance the shopping experience and that will drive space productivity.  For my time in the store, I have seen firsthand the overwhelmingly positive response from our customers across all departments of the store with the improved shopping experience, assortment and creation of the garden center. We hope you enjoyed this virtual walk around the store, highlighting just a few of the changes that will bring our existing stores, their product assortments and shopping experiences to best-in-class standards by combining the art and the science of merchandising. We believe these initiatives will have a meaningful impact to driving space productivity and will be one of the catalysts for sustainable comp store sales as we roll out these initiatives out to the chain over time.  I hope you enjoyed seeing our Project Fusion and Side Lot Transformation initiatives through the life of our Rome, Georgia store. We look forward to bringing the enhanced format to more stores across America in the coming months and years ahead.  And as we wrap up today, a few key takeaways I want to leave you with. First, we have significant initiatives to drive sustainable sales for space productivity. Second, we believe that our growth investments in technology, Project Fusion and Side Lot Transformation will allow us to gain market share and drive comparable store sales over time. And third, our merchandising and shopping experience initiatives are designed to grow, attract and retain customers.  Over the past 82 years, Tractor Supply has worked hard to position our business as the most dependable supplier of basic maintenance products to farm, ranch and rural customers. We built a legacy on our ability to help our customers care for their home, their lands, their pets and their animals. But the story isn't over yet. With these initiatives, we are strategically poised to grow our business and continue to enhance our customers' in-store shopping experience while tailoring our assortment to serve their unique needs. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time today.\nMary Pilkington: Thank you, Seth. Tractor Supply has become the largest rural lifestyle retailer in the U.S. by focusing on the continued improvement of our customers' experience inside our stores. We call it operating The Tractor Way and it's how TSC drives productivity and efficiencies to elevate customer service. Here to tell us more about operating The Tractor Way and its positive effect across all 1,900 stores is Executive Vice President and Chief Stores Officer, John Ordus.\nJohn Ordus: Thank you, Mary Winn. It's great to talk to you all today about operating The Tractor Way. Before we talk about Tractor Way, I'm going to talk to you about our opportunity. At Tractor Supply, we have a solid operating foundation in place across our more than 1,900 stores. At the same time, we believe there's an opportunity to increase labor productivity. Based on our industry benchmarking, we know we have room to grow to be best-in-class on customer-facing sales-driving initiatives. Our teams have made progress over the last couple of years with a nearly 400 basis point improvement in customer service by adding workforce planning, task management and the rollover of our Tractor Way program. There is still a lot more that we can do to help drive efficiency in our operating processes and structure to free up hours to focus on customer service.  We are going to continue to reinvest in labor efficiencies and the customer experience. We are also going to continue to invest in new stores with a target of 75 to 80 new stores a year, drive productivity of our existing stores, take task work out of our stores and use technology-like initiatives like in-store communication, labor management, interfaces that give team members actionable information and capabilities and optimizing payroll by store.  The foundation of our strategic pillar, operate The Tractor Way, is The Tractor Way program we first launched chain-wide in 2019 as a way to make our freight and recovery process more efficient and reinvest the hours from operational efficiency into customer experience. Our initial program focused on our most time-intensive and high-customer impact processes, things like freight, recovery, daily maintenance, zero-outs and feed the floor. The focus was to drive value to the customers through more time for customer service, improved in-stock position and a recovered store that is easy to shop.  To provide more time for customer service, we drove efficiency in our key processes through designated roles like our assistant manager is now our freight team leader; smart process design that removed wasted steps; we invested in new cards, totes and scanners; and clear finish-line goals and schedules to motivate the team to make sure all stores are following the same process. We have excellent training support and a process built to support all stores and account for normal retail disruptions.  With this foundation, we have built some strong muscle in the world of productivity. I have never seen the field take on a program and execute like they did with The Tractor Way program. They love this program. The outcome of the process improvements allowed us to roll out the GURA sales leader in all stores. I'll talk more about this position in just a minute, but the key point is the position works. Our racetrack in stores engage with every customer. We have the best team members. We hire our customers and they love to talk about our products because they live that Out Here lifestyle.  We're a relationship retailer. Our customers have responded to the changes we made with The Tractor Way initiatives. We measure customer experience in our stores by GURA scores. GURA stands for greet, uncover, recommend and ask. And we also measure overall satisfaction. Our customers score our stores at Tractor Supply. That is who we want to hear from, that is who should score our stores. Even though we are already top box on both metrics, as you can see, we improved our already high scores. This chart highlights the strong improvements in availability of assistance and product availability. Adding the GURA sales leader in every store helps us engage with the customer faster. And as you can see, availability of assistance has increased 250 basis points.  After seeing the success with freight recovery, the most labor-intensive activity in our stores, we are now applying The Tractor Way to other areas of the store. Our field activity support teams are another example of applying The Tractor Way philosophy to remove task work from the stores and make that work more efficient for the teams that are doing it. By removing this highly variable work from those stores and giving it to a specialized team, we have again provided more time for our store team members to execute GURA.  The purpose of FAST is to support the stores in creating the legendary in-store experience for our customers through best-in-class merchandising execution. FAST does this through consistency, speed to market, quality, accountability and flexibility. We launched FAST company-wide on September 2020. Let's take a look at our FAST team member setting an end-cap. As you can see, the FAST team member uses the tools we have, provided to be efficient and safe footsteps. When they are finished, the planogram is completely set and the store manager signs off.  Feedback from the stores has been great so far. I was in the store just right after the leather boots set and the FAST team did it faster and more accurately than in years past. The store teams are giving very positive feedback. In the first 4 weeks of the program, we have seen a significant year-over-year improvement in planograms. This leads to higher sales and much better shopping experience. We now are executing planograms at over 95% compliance, which is 40-plus percent better than last year. This is an industry-leading best practice that we will continue to leverage.  With the launch of FAST in 2020, we have built cross-functional alignment and support. We are already seeing the benefits of the FAST team and how we are going to be able to complete more resets on time with a higher level of execution, bringing benefit to our customers, our store teams and our vendors. We believe FAST can do even more to benefit our customers and our stores as the program matures and the teams gain even more speed and efficiency. Some examples are assembly, top stock, recovery, promotions, physical inventories and a whole lot more. And we'll continue to evolve the FAST capabilities over time.  Now let's talk about GURA. The Tractor Way is driven by the commitment to provide a legendary customer experience for our customers. We do that by executing GURA. GURA is the foundation of our customer experience.  Greet. Team member welcomes the customer upon entering the store, shares their name and ask an open-ended question about their trip. Uncover. A team member uncovers the customers' needs by building a relationship and asking further questions. Recommend. Team member leverages understanding of customer needs and resources available to them. They use things like the stockyard to make sure that we can provide the proper recommendations and ensure that the customer has everything they need to complete their entire project. This is where our team members really stand out as they live that Out Here lifestyle and have deep experience. And ask. Team members have several techniques for closing out the sale.  To see the most value from The Tractor Way, we created the GURA sales leader. The GURA sales leader is the air traffic controller of the store. They are responsible for ensuring every customer experience is GURA and for motivating and coaching team members throughout the store. We cover all open hours with a GURA sales leader in every store. Each GURA sales leader has a shift goal and they're responsible for communicating that goal to the entire team. This allows the day to be broken down into smaller segments and creates competition to beat the goal each shift. That GURA sales leader is connected to the entire team with heads-up and hands-free communication through our in-store communication device. This improves the GURA sales leader's ability to increase the speed of service and be way more efficient. Every team member in the store is equipped with a voice-activated, hands-free device that has effectively served as an intelligent assistant to allow for instant communication and information for the customers' needs. We are continuing to provide enhanced training to equip our GURA sales leaders and our team members to be able to provide an even better customer experience.  In our stores, we live out the mission of Tractor Supply every single day. Our mission is to work hard, have fun and make money by providing legendary service and great products at everyday low prices. Our mission doesn't say good service or okay service, it says legendary service. Our teams talking about legendary service and being that dependable supplier all the time.  To live up to legendary and to have fun, we developed the Hi Five program. This program supports GURA by nurturing our selling culture and providing opportunities for store team members to have some friendly competition in their stores and with their stores in their district. Hi Five is all about selling. 5 selling priorities give the team members some more specifics about add-on selling, which is part of recommend and ask in GURA.  As you can see, our team is really excited about this program. We focus on categories like pet, bird, equine, chicken and seasonally relevant categories. Team members are trained on what makes great add-on sales for them in these categories. This ensures our customers have everything they need and helps the store reach their sales bonus. Hi Five also focuses on additional programs we have to offer the customer, like our Power Plus Protection Plan, Neighbor's Club and our private label credit card. All of these areas are at all-time highs in our company.  We have seen strong success from the Hi Five program and the store team members. This program has been in place for about 2.5 years now. It's always energizing when our teams share their customer success stories when I'm out and in the field visiting stores. I also get hundreds of success stories a month on team members taking care of customers. We hear it from our customers and our team members. This year so far, our great team members have had 743,000 positive comments or 72% of all comments from our customers. 118,000 of these positive comments mentioned a team member by name. This is GURA. That is legendary service.  To wrap up, let me on with some key points. At Tractor Supply, we have an incredible strong foundation through our stores and our committed passionate team members who are proud to serve our customers. Our customer service is key to retaining the new customers that shop with Tractor Supply over the past 7 months. We believe that we have significant opportunity to reinvest efficiencies from our labor productivity into our customer experience to drive more sales. Our field activity support teams will allow us to enhance the quality of the in-store experience for our customers, all while driving more productivity. Through new technology and new applications, we can close the gap in customer-facing hours in store with best-in-class retailers to drive more sales.  A differentiator for Tractor Supply is our culture. It is clear competitive advantage to making Tractor Supply a great place to work and a great place to shop. I've been with Tractor Supply for around 22 years now and I'm incredibly passionate about our team members and our customers. As a relationship retailer, the magic happens when our team member engages with our customer. I love seeing our stores and I think you will, too. Thank you all for your time.\nMary Pilkington: Thank you, John. Now is a good time to press pause and give you a very quick break. So when we return, Chief Technology Officer Rob Mills will share details on digital's expanding role in our Life Out Here strategy and CFO Kurt Barton will conclude our presentations with our strategy for delivering healthy shareholder return. We'll see you back here in a few minutes. \nMary Pilkington: Welcome back. We're glad you're with us. Now before we dive back in, a quick reminder. In just a little over half an hour, we'll have a Q&A session with members of our management team, so please stay with us. At the top of today's presentation, our CEO, Hal Lawton, explained our Life Out Here strategy and its commitment to our customers to deliver the products they need, however, whenever and wherever they need them. Joining us now to share how investment in our digital platforms is allowing us to honor that commitment both now and in the future, here's Rob Mills, our EVP, Chief Technology, Digital Commerce and Strategy Officer.\nRobert Mills: Hello, everyone. It's great to be here with you virtually today. A few years ago, we introduced our ONETractor strategy. This strategy drove significant progress for Tractor Supply, making great strides in providing a seamless customer experience. Further, the capabilities we introduced as a part of ONETractor have helped to fuel our growth during recent shifts in consumer behaviors and habits, many of which that are here to stay.  The past 6 months have accelerated digital adoption across the retail sector. Our digital strategies are a key part of our plans to sustain and grow not only with our new and reengaged customers but with our core customers who are more digitally engaged than ever. Our digital growth has been driven by introducing new capabilities and improving the shopping journey.  Even with this significant growth, we still have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us compared to other hardline and specialty retailers. Just a few years ago, e-commerce represented less than 1% of our business. And today, we are nearing 6% with continued plans to grow that share. Our online conversion rates continued to improve with double-digit growth in recent years as we evolve that shopping experience through new capabilities and have provided an intuitive checkout with efficient and fast fulfillment options. An example of this is how we introduced curbside pickup earlier this year.  Delivering legendary customer experience is our top priority, making certain that the customer experience has always ranked above our peer group, leveraging industry benchmarks such as 4C. While these capabilities we have built are serving us well today, we will continue to invest in furthering those capabilities in 3 ways: by implementing a best-in-class platform and technology, hiring and developing the best technology team and growing our digital expertise across the company.  Our goal is to deliver a world-class customer experience, supported by efficient business processes and a strong fulfillment strategy. We are transforming our business to be more digitally focused and we are connecting the customer experience together across ways they want to shop and interact with us. Our customers have told us they want to shop digitally. The success of Buy Online Pickup in Store and Ship to Store programs have illustrated this, representing over 80% of our online sales. We saw rapid adoption of our customer mobile app this summer with customers leveraging the shopping experience, curbside pickup, notifications and managing their Neighbor's Club loyalty program. And our efforts to improve the online experience and drive traffic to the website are resulting in new customer acquisition.  The goals of our advancing ONETractor capabilities pillar are fairly simple. There are 3 primary areas to focus to accomplish this: delivering legendary customer experiences anytime, anywhere, anyway; digitizing our business processes; and furthering our omnichannel capabilities. Let's talk about each of these.  We will continue to transform the customer experience with a focus on personalized content, messaging and products that meet their needs in a fast and convenient way. We are improving the online experience by optimizing search capabilities and navigation to ensure that our customers can easily find the products and services they require.  With our newly released customer mobile app, we are able to further personalize those customer experiences and provide features that make the shopping experience simple and convenient, drawing insights by leveraging information that our customers share with us through our Neighbor's club program, profiles and purchase histories. This allows us to provide product recommendations for their specific animals, pets and property. For example, a customer who purchased baby chicks has specific needs throughout the life cycle of that bird. Using machine learning to identify shopping trends and needs, we can anticipate and serve our content specific to each stage of the chicken's life, from caring for chicks during warm and cold periods to protecting the flock from predators with the right chicken coop. Once these trends and data points are identified, we can leverage artificial intelligence to recommend specific products and content, fulfillment options that fit the customers' lifestyle and even direct customers to on-demand expert advice.  We are taking steps to further the integration of the online and in-store experiences, enabling our team members with information and digitizing the store. Digitizing the layout of our fleet of stores will empower us to drive improvements in sales per square foot, enable team member efficiencies and provide new capabilities such as way-finding to our customers.  Imagine a customer who dwells in front of a riding lawn mower outside the store for several minutes. We can message them with a compelling financing offer or offer assistance through our mobile app, allowing them to notify an in-store team member that they have a question. This is just one example of how we are digitizing the in-store experience.  To continue improving the seamless experience, we are investing in intelligent assistant devices John mentioned earlier for all of our store team members, allowing instant communication with one another and being informed of those customers' needs. By integrating this technology with customer-facing capabilities, such as our mobile app, we can reduce wait times and improve the execution, directly impacting the customers' experience, customer satisfaction and ultimately driving sales.  You've heard us talk about our expert product knowledge, being the authority for the Out Here lifestyle. Leveraging this deep knowledge, we are able to curate a localized product assortment that meets our customers' needs, positioning our in-store assortment to meet daily needs then augmenting it with an extended assortment on our website and mobile app that remain localized and personalized. In addition to having the right product mix, it's important that we provide rich content for our customers and our team members, digitizing that deep knowledge I mentioned earlier. We can then help them how-to information when they run into problems on their property, provide them data to make decisions about what product is best for their animal needs and make sure they know what is needed to complete each project in advance.  Earlier, I referenced a customer purchasing baby chicks and understanding the life cycle of the birds. By knowing this information, we can offer them content and advice at relevant times, helping them understand when they need to change feeds, purchase supplements and other wellness needs that will improve and maintain the chick's health.  Personalizing the message isn't enough, though. We also have to offer that knowledge and ways our customers prefer, such as showing relevant content on their home page, providing fast answers to common questions and problems powered by automation and offering live ask-the-expert capabilities to share deep knowledge and understanding.  How customers receive their products is a key satisfaction driver in retail today, whether in-store, picked up or delivered. How we execute, the speed at which we do so and the costs are important factors. Over the years, many retailers have accepted inefficient cost structure to accomplish this. We have the opportunity to get it in front of this, leveraging a variety of options to offer the value propositions our customers want without sacrificing profitability. We are working to align our fulfillment options to our SKUs and categories to drive this efficiency and profitability. And combining this, the leveraging of our store locations and inventory investments, we will be able to ensure we provide multiple options that meet the customers' expectations.  With our wide assortment of products, fulfillment is not a one-size-fits-all. By providing options to ship from our stores and DCs, offering Buy Online Pickup in Store and curbside and delivering products from our stores can help us align the right fulfillment method to each specific product. A critical component of this strategy is how we leverage our order management systems to optimize how we route orders across our different fulfillment channels, allowing us to deliver quickly and cost effectively to the customer.  Our goal is to provide 1-day delivery to 99% of our customers while improving our profitability. By investing in systems and artificial intelligence that will identify the right methods and optimize the routing of the product, we can ensure we are choosing the best options, actively leveraging our network of stores for that final mile.  My team is energized to help capture the growth opportunities ahead of us. We have much more in the works and I look forward to sharing with you over time. Today's framework shared with you is how we intend to further evolve our seamless customer experience, advancing our ONETractor capabilities.  In summary, I'm going to leave you with 4 key takeaways that will allow us to capture significant growth opportunities ahead of us. We will continue to improve the customer shopping experience across all channels, striving to be that best-in-class omnichannel retailer. We will have an extreme focus on digitizing our business processes by leveraging data and analytics and we will provide rich personalized content and digital interactions. Lastly, we will improve sales and profitability by providing efficient, robust fulfillment options to fit any need.  At Tractor Supply, we're passionate about our digital vision and I'm thrilled to be a part of this organization. Thanks for joining us today and don't forget to enjoy some holiday shopping on tractorsupply.com.\nMary Pilkington: There are certainly some exciting developments coming from our digital team. In addition to meeting the needs of our customers, one of the pillars of our Life Out Here strategy is to generate healthy investor returns. Here's our CFO, Kurt Barton, to take a deeper dive into that subject.\nKurt Barton: Good morning again, everyone. In these incredibly uncertain and complex times, the Tractor Supply team has found a way to truly thrive. It is a testament to each and every one of our team members and our resilient business model that we have found a way to really be there for our customers, serving them with care and doing our best to have the right products and services for them at the right price and available anytime, anywhere, any way they choose to shop.  Our Life Out Here strategy is grounded in our focus on delivering strong and sustainable total shareholder return. We are humbled by our strong operating financial performance year-to-date, which is a true testament to our differentiated and durable core business. And as you have heard from Hal and others, given our extremely strong financial performance and resources, we plan to make significant investments to enable us to continue to gain market share. We are confident that our planned growth and margin-driving initiatives such as Fusion, Side Lot and FAST, will strengthen our foundation and enable us to emerge even stronger on the other side of the pandemic. My goal is to provide deeper insights on how our disciplined capital stewardship supports our business strategy and can deliver strong and sustainable TSR.  I will first highlight our strong and durable financial performance and the free cash flows that enables us to make the critically important organic investments that we have been discussing with you. These investments will allow us to build on our strong growth platform and strengthen our advantage. I will also highlight how we plan to return excess cash to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. And then finally, I will reinforce our commitment to a healthy and resilient balance sheet with investment-grade credit rating.  We believe the shift in consumer interest and behavior caused by the COVID pandemic has created a sustainable tailwind for Tractor Supply, as shown by the red line on this graph. How long that lasts, we don't know. Nobody has a crystal ball to really indicate when normalcy will return. While the exact dates are uncertain, we view the revenue performance in 3 phases: first, the COVID pandemic phase and then a 1-year post-COVID period and then an extended normalized post-COVID period being beyond 1 year.  The one year post-COVID period represents the period of time for us to comp the current exceptional and unprecedented performance. The 12 months following the end of the pandemic will come with some level of uncertainty in our comp performance, as it will for most retailers. We do expect our comp revenue to be on a different and stronger trajectory post COVID as a result of our strategic investments, as this slide illustrates.  As you see in the pre-COVID time period, we had a healthy trajectory line that was 2.5% to 3% comps. Soon after COVID began significantly impacting us here in the U.S., we saw a major step-up change in our comps. With the step-up in growth we have seen during this pandemic and given the important organic investments and broader macro trends that are favorable to Life Out Here, our goal is to sustain the stepped-up sales growth and to achieve an even stronger growth trend line than pre pandemic the year after we see the environment return to normalcy. And that's shown by the steeper slope in the blue dash line relative to the pre-COVID trajectory.  When we reach the normalized post-COVID period, the main improvement we expect to see is on comp sales, where our key strategic initiatives should be meaningfully accretive to our financial profile. Specifically, we're targeting a sales comp in the 4% to 5% range and total net sales in the 6% to 7% range. We expect to remain consistent in our number of store openings in comparison to pre-COVID period. With the step-up in the base revenue, the new stores contribute less to the overall sales growth than the pre-COVID period. And to remind you, we still have headroom to open another 600 locations.  Looking to margin. We believe that through our greater scale and improvements in efficiencies, we have the ability to deliver operating margin in the mid 9% range. This would lead us to attractive ongoing 8% to 10% EPS growth post normalization, all of that on a much higher base. We will also focus on strong free cash flow generation and maintaining a healthy balance sheet, all while not losing sight of our goal of delivering strong and sustainable TSR.  Our key initiatives are laser-like focus on improving store productivity leading to stronger comp growth. As you've heard today, we're very excited about side lot and the significant amount of outside selling space that we will use more productively, bringing in an entirely new range of seasonal live goods and adding speed and convenience our customers want with drive-through feed and drive-through curbside pickup.  With Project Fusion, we are remodeling stores to bring an even more productive and relevant offering to each community. The multiyear rollout of Side Lot and Project Fusion initiatives are expected to provide ongoing benefits in the years ahead as we move quickly and thoughtfully store-by-store with the goal of an extended period of 4% to 5% comp store revenue growth.  As you heard from Rob, continuing our ONETractor initiatives will help to increase our omnichannel conversion. Neighbor's Club program enhancements are well underway and the FAST program is rolled out, both expected to drive benefits starting in 2021.  One of our great strengths is strong free cash flow generation. We currently expect to generate approximately $3.5 billion in free cash flow over the next 5 years. We've always exercised strong financial discipline focusing on accretive investments to drive the top line, margin dollars and free cash flow. We are taking advantage of our current strong cash flow generation to make further investments for growth and investments to support our team. Our increased focus on technology and training tools to support and strengthen our team members will continue to drive legendary customer service as defined by our customers today. These investments, when coupled with our ongoing profit improvement initiatives and our working capital improvements, are expected to generate higher operating cash flow going forward versus pre COVID.  Our strong balance sheet and our investment-grade capital structure is a strength we can leverage further. As you may have seen, yesterday, both Moody's and S&P announced investment-grade ratings for Tractor Supply. This provides us additional levers in our capital structure to support growth investments. In addition, with this performance, our goal is to return to shareholders approximately $4 billion in total cash payouts through dividends and share repurchases through our strong free cash flow and excess cash on the balance sheet. Additionally, we will have the financial capacity to consider opportunistic tuck-in acquisitions. We will continue to practice strong financial discipline, always with the goal of delivering strong and sustainable TSR to our shareholders.  This chart puts some dollars to what we just talked about. As you see in this cash flow waterfall, our operating cash flow target over this period is approximately $6 billion. Our capital expenditures are expected to be a total of $2.5 billion over the next five years, reflecting approximately $1 billion in incremental growth CapEx to strengthen our advantage. This increased level of spend is critical to continuing to gain market share. And because of our strong operating model, we expect to be in a position to return, through the combination of dividends and share repurchases, approximately $4 billion to shareholders during this time.  As I indicated earlier, our priority will be investing for growth, doubling our organic investments to include significant growth spend. We anticipate growing our dividend per share, returning to a 30% dividend payout on a higher and faster-growing EPS base. We plan to continue to be active in share repurchases to offset dilution effect of equity grants and to opportunistically repurchase with excess cash. We expect dividends and share repurchases to contribute 3% to 4% to our TSR delivery. While not a key priority, we are open to tuck-in acquisitions at the right price.  Historically, our leverage ratio has been approximately 2x. During COVID, we were able to maintain that ratio and we expect our leverage to remain at that level with the flexibility to use our strong balance sheet for incremental investment opportunities. And we're targeting to maintaining a leverage ratio below 2.5x. And we are positioned well to take advantage of our investment-grade rating and may look to refinance a portion of our debt when there is an attractive opportunity.  There has never been a more exciting time at Tractor Supply. We are incredibly proud of our heritage. There have been many key chapters in our amazing history. This is the beginning of a new chapter. Our solid foundation combined with shifts in the macro environment and our Life Out Here strategy provide us with significant growth opportunities. We are purposely aligning our business strategy and our financial strategy with the goal of delivering strong and sustainable total shareholder return.  With that, I will turn it back over to Mary Winn.\nMary Pilkington: Thank you, Kurt. Well, we've certainly shared a lot of information with you today and our hope is that you've gained some insight into our Life Out Here strategy.  Now for a few takeaways and closing remarks, here's Hal Lawton.\nHarry Lawton: We are all about the Out Here lifestyle. Our Life Out Here strategy is focused on being an integral part of our customers' lives. And as we close out our prepared remarks, I hope you take away that we're a market leader with strong omnichannel capabilities, that our culture is a competitive advantage, that we have a resilient business model with compelling growth opportunities and we have the resources and are committed to allocating them to effectively execute our Life Out Here strategy.  Thank you for joining us today and I look forward to answering your questions in just a bit.\nMary Pilkington: Our executive panel Q&A session is right around the corner. But first, we'll step away for a quick break. We'll be right back. \nA - Mary Pilkington: Welcome back to the Q&A session of Tractor Supply's enhanced earning event. We've assembled today's presenters and they are ready to take your questions. A couple of housekeeping notes first. [Operator Instructions]. For anyone just tuning in, a quick introduction of our team: President and CEO, Hal Lawton; CFO, Treasurer, Kurt Barton; Chief Merchandising Officer, Seth Estep; Chief Stores Officer, John Ordus; Chief Technology Officer, Rob Mills. We have a line of folks standing by, so let's take our first question. First up is Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo.\nZachary Fadem: Thanks for hosting a great event today, really well done. So first question for me on the 4% to 5% long-term comp outlook. This compares to about 3%-plus previously. And I'm hoping you could bridge the gap for us, talk about how you're quantifying the impact of the initiatives you've discussed today. And then what impact would you assign towards changes that are more structural, like the urbanization, rising pet ownership and other external factors due to COVID?\nHarry Lawton: Yes, great. I'll take that. Zach, it's great to see you this morning and thanks for joining us for our enhanced earnings day. The way I think what Kurt in his presentation tried to kind of outline is we anticipate that COVID will -- we'll be dealing with COVID. It will be part of the U.S. economy and consumer mentality for the better part of next year. And then as we start to comp on top of that, that will create some period of uncertainty, really depending with a lot of parameters impacting that. It could be the pace of the adoption of a vaccine, the effectiveness of a vaccine and then how user behavior changes afterwards.  What I would say is, from our view, the longer that kind of COVID -- the COVID pandemic is here, we think the longer, the more structural a lot of the trends are that we're seeing. If you think about as an example, year-to-date, we've sold 11 million birds. Pet adoption and ownership at an all-time high. Those are annuity streams that are going to continue on. Work from home and kind of this investment in your home, because you're there more frequently, that's going to continue even post COVID.  So as we think about kind of the 12 months post COVID, there's some period of kind of settling out but we're becoming more confident in that. And then once we get to the end of that, then we think we get back to a more normal routine run rate. And if our previous long-term guidance had been about 3%, what we're starting to do is add on top of that 3% the initiatives that we're announcing today. That would be the initiatives of maintaining our new customer base that we've seen and starting to -- continuing to have business from that group that's sustaining our levels that we're already operating at but also growing on top of it.  But it also comes down to our existing store base, the productivity we're going to get from the existing store base both inside the store as well as outside of the store and then the continued growth from our digital business. As you know, we've got, I think, over 30 quarters of double-digit growth. And the last two quarters have been over 100% comps. And so we see that continuing to play out. So we feel very good about the increase of our comp guidance from previously 3% to 4% to 5% based on kind of that waterfall of initiatives.\nZachary Fadem: Got it. I appreciate that. And then quickly moving to the long-term EBIT margin of 9% to 9.5%. This looks to be a bit of a step-down from about 10% this year. Obviously, given the tough compares next year and the step-up in investments, I'm curious if the 9% to 9.5% margin is the right way to frame expectations during this fiscal '21, '22 transition period or after the near-term investments or both.\nKurt Barton: Yes. Zach, this is Kurt. I'll take that question. In regards to our long-term target, we've been very specific in saying that this COVID pandemic, there's uncertainty as to how long it lasts and when does this 12-month of a cycling begin. And some of that may fall into 2021 and so there may be some noise on exactly the level of performance on a top line that would certainly impact it.  What you've heard from us on our initiatives are that we believe that this business has got strong sustainable growth. We can begin to not only achieve top level sales growth but sustain this level.  And then for 2021, the operating margin that we gave could have a little bit of variability in it. But a 9.0% to 9.5% in our long-term target is a really good sweet spot for us. We feel like the opportunity and our primary focus of gaining market share and being able to have a 9% to 9.5% operating margin range gives the most optimal overall earnings per share and value to our shareholders. And so our focus is on the long term in both top line revenue and that operating margin.\nMary Pilkington: Okay. We have our next question and that question is from Peter Benedict at Baird.\nPeter Benedict: Thanks for doing this event. Extremely well done, very helpful particularly with everything going on. So thanks for doing this. My first question, I guess, Hal, you threw out the TAM, $110 billion TAM in your remarks. Wondering if you could unpack that a bit, where you see kind of the most potential for gains, the most opportunity. And how do the services play into that? I know in the past, you've talked a little bit about tool rental, things like that, but I'm just curious if that's kind of -- if that's part of the current thinking here as you're moving through the next few years. That's my first question.\nHarry Lawton: Yes. Good morning, Peter and thanks for joining us on our enhanced earnings day here and I appreciate the comments. Over the last 6 to 9 months, as we've been both dealing with COVID, responding to numerous natural disasters and also dealing with the -- kind of operating at these elevated volume levels, we've also been preparing and kind of laying the foundation for the future of the company. And part of that really started with, what is our total addressable market? And that allows us to understand where share gains can be had and where our opportunities are.  And so we spent a good bit of time really digging in each of our categories, understanding where we participate in each of those categories, what the size of those markets are and then really also thinking about the markets that we address. So really, it's really a rural-suburban kind of cut of the categories that we participate in.  And after doing that work, we came to $110 billion market, a large market. One with a significant amount of opportunity, one where we have nice share at kind of 10-ish percent but one that presents a lot of opportunity for growth in front of us. And as we've talked about, we think there's a lot of opportunity to do more with our existing assets. We think there's opportunities to continue to build stores to our $2,500 target. And there's also opportunity to continue to grow our digital footprint that's dominantly with and through our stores. As it relates to the categories, I'm going to toss it to Seth and he could talk a little bit about some of the categories that we're making big investments in and where we think there's some growth.\nSeth Estep: Yes. Thanks, Hal. Thanks, Peter. I like the cap, by the way. Yes, when we think about the total addressable market, that's one data point that the merchants have utilized in coming up with where we're really going to focus and, as Hal mentioned, where we're going to make some of these big investments.  To put it in perspective, we showed earlier today the investments in the garden center. And you think about the size of the traditional lawn and garden category that's out there, excluding OPE where we've been strong in for a long time and that's over a $20 billion industry that's out there. So for every share point that we can go out and get, where today we're low single digits when we think about where we are there, that's $200 million of opportunity in revenue growth.  So as we think about these things and the data points -- we've looked at that in tools and DIY, obviously, where we are with pet and animal -- we've gone around the store. And as we think about Fusion and how we have laid out the category expansions, where we've looked at those footprints, we've really partnered with our vendor base, use all the different analytics points to really figure out where we're going to go invest in and whether that be in lawn and garden, again, whether it be pet and animal, whether it be in home setting categories, going after market share in those DIY areas and then utilizing our drive aisle to really go after that backyard, that activity and that's what that drives aisles are really for today, right? Take advantage of the current trends that's out there to build a basket. So hopefully, that helps a little bit in kind of how we're looking at the TAM and how we're building our category strategies accordingly.\nPeter Benedict: That sure does. And Seth, I guess, sticking with the garden center, just curious how you guys are approaching that. Are you going to own the live goods? Are you going to go consignment model? Just curious on kind of the margin and return profile, just how you're going to attack that business.\nSeth Estep: Peter, yes, it's a variation. So as we're rolling this out, I mean, we're in the initial phases of this. We partnered with some outside resources as well that are very much experts in this area. Again, I think we mentioned earlier, we've identified growers for over 75% of our current store base that we know that we have an opportunity to go out there and build these garden centers. So obviously, live goods are one component. It varies by different product segment of how -- whether we'll be owning it or whether it will be kind of scan-based type product. But then also, the other big thing in the garden center as well, it's really going to open up other categories like grilling, outdoor decor, some of those other things that can be very margin accretive as well as we build not just the live goods themselves. But that's really kind of the footstep driver to then build the basket.\nMary Pilkington: Okay. We'll go on to our next question and our next question comes from Steve Forbes at Guggenheim.\nSteven Forbes: And again, really great to see the visual representation here. So thank you for all the effort. I wanted to start with a multipart question as it pertains to the side lots. So maybe for Hal or Seth, if you could speak to the cadence behind the initiative. Is the goal to have all 150, 200 stores done by spring, seasonal?  And should we expect the program to be completed by -- within that five year time frame that you laid out by 2025? Is that where we should expect all 60% to 75% of stores to be done?\nHarry Lawton: Yes, Steven and thanks for joining us on the enhanced earnings day today. And as it relates to the side lot, again, we're very bullish on the opportunity, significant opportunity to expand our sales per square foot and better utilize the side lot, the concrete pad outside of our stores. And I thought Seth really laid out that opportunity in his prepared remarks earlier very well.  As it relates to the cadence, as Seth said, we're looking somewhere in that kind of 50% to 65% range of stores for this year to accomplish. We're learning a lot as we go. We've got a real -- we've got great muscles built around building new stores and we're starting to adapt and tailor those muscles to being able to remodel stores. And doing that in the context of COVID, where you've got a lot of permitting that you've got to do and you've got town halls that -- have more virtual meetings now and those sorts of things. But we're working through that, building those muscles, building that flywheel and we feel very good about the progress we're making this year.  Next year as we move forward, we do anticipate getting at least half of those stores up and running in advance of the spring season. And then the remainder will happen through Q2 and Q3.  And then as it relates to the 5-year outlook, once we get through midway into next year, we'll have a better sense of what our capacity and capabilities are for rollout in 2022 and beyond. We certainly have aspirations of addressing the -- Seth has said in his prepared remarks, I believe, he said 60% to 75% of our stores were applicable for side lot. And we have aspirations of addressing all those over a 5-year time frame. But what we do in years 2, 3 and 4 and 5 will vary a little bit based on just kind of our learnings as we roll it out next year in terms of our capacity and capability.\nSteven Forbes: Then just a follow up on pet ownership and the pet food trends. Probably for you, Hal. Would love to sort of hear your thoughts on the importance of this category as you think about ongoing share gains at the local level and would love to sort of speak to both existing and new customer trends right in this particular category, just with all the excitements around pet ownership post COVID here.\nHarry Lawton: Yes, absolutely. So first on pet, I want to be really clear. We are gaining share in pet food and gaining share in the pet category. And while that industry certainly, there's a rising tide there, we are gaining share in the context of that rising tide. As you mentioned, you've got both pet ownership at all-time highs combined with the humanization of the pet really reinforced because people are in their homes more around their pets. And so consequently, that's driving significant volume in the category.  It is a very strategically important category for us. It's a core part of what we call our CUE business. It drives footsteps, it drives transactions. And it's a cart-starter to build the basket for our customers in the store. And as we talked about our CUE business, I believe Kurt mentioned it, it was in the mid double-digit comps in Q2, up from high-kind-of-teens in Q2. So we did see a step-up in our CUE business and a part of that improvement was driven by our pet business. We saw a significant improvement in the trend in that business from Q2 to Q3. It is being driven by both our new customers, our reacquired customers and our existing customers. We're seeing increased transactions and larger baskets from our existing customers, but we're also seeing a strong number of new customers in the pet category shopping with us.  And their repeats are at much higher rates than we've seen in the past. So it's not a one-and-done or even a two-and-done and are qualitatively, as those customers indicate the vast majority in that they plan on incorporating Tractor Supply in their future shopping patterns.  Also online, our pet business is one of the big drivers of our online triple-digit comps. And that's both happening direct ship to people's homes but also the pickup in store. So we feel like we've got a strong pet business. It's important to us strategically and that we are gaining share both in our stores and online across all the customer base.\nMary Pilkington: All right. Well, thank you very much. We'll move on to our next question which is from Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Good job this year. By the way, Mary Winn said my picture -- my mouth will move, so just watch out. And my first question is strategic and financial. The question is this, Hal, how much of the spending that -- in this plan is influenced by COVID and how well you've done? Were you thinking of these investments irrespective a year ago? Because it looks like you're spending a lot of additional capital. At the moment, the business is growing very fast, so it makes sense but there's a big step-up. And so it looks like the incremental return maybe can't be as good as where they are today. And yes, you're going to get faster revenue growth, but the EPS growth is -- it looks like it's going to slow. So if you can sort of take that all together.\nHarry Lawton: Yes, Simeon. So hit a few things. First off on how much of this was stimulated by COVID. I'd say we were working our strategy at the same time as we've been operating through the last 9 months. So the two were really much more in parallel than interrelated. What I would say is we do recognize that we're investing from a position of strength. We're committed to emerging from the pandemic a much stronger company and we are confident that we will do so.  As it relates to kind of the initiatives and the EPS, what I would say, 2 things: one, remind you we're at a much higher base now that we're operating at than we were 9 months ago. And certainly, 2 or 3 years ago, we did our long-term guidance previously.  And then the second thing I'd say is every single one of our initiatives and kind of the strategies that they kind of roll up into, we've done business cases for every single one of those. We know what the NPV and the NRRs are. We've modeled the TSR implications of those investments. And they are all kind of in the numbers that we've delivered to you today. And every single one of those investments, we're confident that it -- they generate healthy shareholder returns and generate value in the business.\nSimeon Gutman: And is the shape of the EPS growth and margins the same throughout the investment cycle? Or does it -- is it heavier upfront and then it accelerates later on?\nHarry Lawton: Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead.\nKurt Barton: I'll take it. I'll take it. Simeon, this is Kurt. In regards to the time frame, first, I'll just point out and remind that slide I gave on the trajectory. There's a lot of uncertainty, there's the COVID pandemic, then there's that 1-year cycling. In regards to the investments, there's more consistency in regards to our expectation as to when to -- the cadence of that investment. The impact on the timing, we're not going to try to go ahead and at this point try to peg over time. But what we are confident is that we can achieve with these investments, as Hal said, investing right now in a position of strength. We're making those investments now. We've got the cash to be able to do that and these investments will begin to provide that level of return.  The exciting thing about this is this level of EPS growth, the operating margin that we believe we can sustain through that is during this period of time where we're committing to and making a stepped-up investment in the business. That's exciting for the near term. It's really exciting for the long-term and the overall total shareholder return.\nMary Pilkington: All right. We'll move on to our next question, please. We'll go to Michael Lasser at UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Very nice job. So comparing your current guidance from an operating margin perspective of 9% to 9.5% to the 9% to 9.4% that you'd previously rolled out pre COVID, it would seem like based on updated comp expectation that the incremental profitability contribution from the 100 to 200 basis points that you're presumably going to get from the initiatives like Side Lot and Project Fusion are going to come in at a lower-than-average profitability that you'll offset with some incremental sales leverage on fixed costs. So why wouldn't the margin be higher given these incremental comp expectations?\nKurt Barton: Yes, Michael, this is Kurt. Thank you for the question. Just build on the -- I'll build on the last explanation I gave earlier. The important factor here is that we're making these investments. It's a significant step-up. These investments are for the long term. These investments are the opportunity to achieve greater market share, sustain the stepped-up growth. And when you make this level of investment, in stores in particular, the Side Lot and Fusion are investments in our leasehold assets. And so these stores have 5-, 7-, 10-year leases. There's a burden in that time frame that we've baked into the financials. And so we think it's a very compelling algorithm to be able to produce the same and stepped-up level of operating margin during this time of investment to be able to continue to grow this business.  As Hal mentioned, the last long-term targets that we set out back in 2018. If you think about the size of the business, say, $7.5 billion revenue business on a $4 EPS, we're certainly well beyond those numbers and be able to have the level of EPS growth while returning even greater shares -- greater cash to our shareholders, a commitment to a stronger level of dividend and a consistent share buyback. Overall, I'll just continue to emphasize, for the long term, our focus is total shareholder return. We think it's a very compelling -- much better compelling offer than a previous long-term targets.\nHarry Lawton: And Michael, the only thing I would kind of tactically call out is that the new sales are not dilutive. If you think about a 9%-ish to 9.4% on a 3% comp and then the investments we're making, particularly as it relates to capital and the depreciation that comes along with that and then our target that we shared today of 9% to 9.5%, they really are flowing through basically at the same operating margin rate that the base business, so to speak, was. So I just wanted to clarify that that's not the case when we modeled it out.\nMichael Lasser: Okay. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on that. Can you provide more detail on the geography of how this is going to impact both the gross margin? Presumably, D&A is going to step up and so it will be -- that will flow through to higher SG&A. And as part of that, how should we think about what this adds to the operational complexity of running a Tractor Supply store either from incremental staffing or the shrink associated with having more expensive space and products that are more subject to obsolescence?\nHarry Lawton: Yes. Thanks, Michael. So what -- I'm going to ask John first to just talk about the operational models and the adjustments we've made in the Side Lot and Fusion stores that we've rolled out. Just to be clear, those are reflected in the numbers that we shared today. But John, maybe you can talk about that. And then, Kurt, you can come back to the broader geography questions.\nJohn Ordus: Sure. Michael, so what we've done is we put together a store productivity team a couple of years ago. And what that team has done is they continue to look at how we can make things more efficient inside the store. We're doing that, we're able to make sure that we have hours out in the side lot for all open hours of store. So we have people out there to do both the feed floor, the curbside, make sure the propane is taken care of and then also to make sure we have that greenhouse staff outside there. So as we continue to look at more efficiency inside the store, we can continue to make sure that we take hours, reinvest it in customer service and continue with those all-time customer service -- all-time high customer service scores we have.\nKurt Barton: Yes. Thanks, John. And in regards to geography, the -- over a 3- to 5-year period of time, I'll stay rather directional and really hit 3 points. Starting with the gross margin, that is an area that we believe we have growth opportunity when you compare to the previous guide or the base year of 2019 for a number of the things that you heard today.  But just to hit a few key points on gross margin, we will continue to focus on our supply chain and our sourcing. There's opportunity to be able to take costs out of that part of the business as well as leveraging the scale that we've got and, from the fast program and from fusion and the productivity, does drive some performance in gross margin, so the opportunities in gross margin.  When it comes to the investments, to your point that you pointed out, the burden is principally in the -- from the depreciation from capital. So that's going to hit that SG&A area. And that is offset from very promising, strong, strategic initiatives on profit improvement. So we believe we can mostly offset the SG&A burden and we believe there's opportunity to achieve on the gross margin. All of that plays out to growing the operating margin modestly over this period of time.\nMary Pilkington: All right. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays.\nKaren Short: I wanted to ask a couple of questions just on the side lot opportunity. Could you maybe give a little bit of color on what you think the possible sales per square foot to be on the side lot and then maybe what you're seeing currently and/or what the range is? And then I have one other question.\nHarry Lawton: We are not disclosing at this time kind of the individual pieces of our strategic initiatives. You can expect to hear more from us on that over time. But what I would say is the composition of our new customers and providing the -- kind of retaining them, also our omnichannel efforts, combined with side lot infusion, are reflected in our updated comp guidance.  What I would say is we're very pleased with the early results of our -- of the stores that we've implemented the side lot. Seth showed you the Rome, Georgia store today in a video and talked you through it. But we're very pleased with the early results and that's given us the conviction to do between 150 and 200 stores next year and allocate the capital that's required to do that and the incremental capital dollars that we shared with you today. And more to come, but we think there's a big opportunity in garden. As Seth mentioned, it's the #1 category that we are not a destination for, that our customers really participate in and so big opportunity there.  In feed, where we have the feed drive-through, we are the largest player in bagged dog feed in the country. And an opportunity for us always is to make that process more efficient for our customers. And I really do think the time that it requires to load up a customer's truck or trailer with feed as they begin their day is -- does drive the difference in people going left or right. So that will make a big difference in our ability to keep gaining share in a market that we're already the #1 player. And we're very excited, bullish and going to be investing into the side lot initiative.\nKaren Short: Okay. That's helpful. And then I wanted to just ask about the digitization of the store. So I'm just wondering if you could give a little more color on how many stores are digitized and then how you think that would contribute to, I guess, splitting the assets? Because it seems like that's a little bit more of a newer nuance to the story that you haven't talked about that much in the past.\nHarry Lawton: Yes. Great. So I'm going to ask Seth to do that. And specifically, what you're going to hear from him is teeing up kind of the systems implementations we've done around macro and then the systems implementations we've done around micro that kind of come together through our line review process to deliver kind of more optimal outcomes.\nSeth Estep: Yes. Thanks, Hal. Yes, so we talked a little bit earlier about some of the systems that we are currently implementing, as Hal mentioned. It's both on a macro and a micro level. We are really starting on the micro level right now as we are going through all of our line review processes, whether that be through our store clustering on each individual category as well as then that being the assortment optimization that comes with that. And our tools that -- the Blue Yonder tool that we've been implementing is space aware, so it's integrated throughout all of our merchandising processes and systems. That really allow us to get smarter, better, more scientific and apply the merchandising art to that as well on each individual micro, call it, planogram space within the store.  The next step of that as well is within the software as well as through some projects, will be more the macro store clustering project that we'll be embarking on as well so that we can, again, get better on a local and a regional level and that we can start to tailor space accordingly to what those store clusters look like. Whether that be in opening up new stores or as we go on, on this Project Fusion and side lot journey, those store clusters will -- the macro store clusters will be a big part of that on, call it, what floor plan goes in there.  In addition to those two systems, we also have another system where it's the site-level CADs, where every store itself -- we have a significant number of stores that aren't, call it, a prototype, a stand-alone building that can have some nuances in there, could be a little bit larger than the 15,500, that we don't have great visibility to today on how much, call it, flex planogram space might be in a store.  We've now got over 500 stores that we have site-level CADs that were out there today where we can now identify what those flex spaces are. Then as you just think about that and apply the space productivity metrics to it, over time, that can be a really good flywheel to drive comp, knowing that there's a big piece of the store base that has that flex space that now we can take and strategically drive planogram and space activity, too.\nMary Pilkington: Okay. Thank you. Next question is from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom: My question is on new customer adoption, 10 million alone, I believe, in the second and third quarter. I'm curious on how that shopper is behaving both on trip frequency and basket size versus a more mature Tractor shopper and how that maturation curve could play out over the next couple of years.\nHarry Lawton: As it relates to new customers, to your point, as we remarked in our opening comments, 10 million new and reacquired customers between Q2 and Q3. And what I'd say is, first off, the pace of new customers really did not slow from Q2 to Q3 kind of the new customer counts that we were seeing on a weekly basis, with the exception of some modest seasonalization between Q2 and Q3, really continued at the same levels, meaning that we were really attracting new customers at the same pace in Q3. Some of that's driven by our continued advertising. But I think a lot of it's driven by just the lifestyle that people embrace in the Out Here Lifestyle and finding Tractor Supply a very relevant shopping destination for them in that lifestyle.  And we are laser-focused on retaining those customers. We're doing that through both our marketing efforts with robust CRM activities and digital marketing activities as well as bringing people into our Neighbor's Club, which we continue to increase our number of millions of customers that are members there, but also just in our stores and focusing on what's important to these new customers, delivering that legendary service and staying really focused on it.  As I mentioned earlier, the reshop rates with these customers are exceeding the historic rates we have of reshop rates with new customers not only on the second but also third time. And that gives us more confidence in the structural-oriented -- that there's more structural-ness versus transitory in those new customers.  John, I know -- I'd let him speak a little bit in terms of having all-time customer SAP scores but also the focus on cleanliness and safety that we've had in our stores to really maybe bring some of that to life.\nJohn Ordus: Yes. So since COVID started, we've really spent a lot of time on cleanliness inside of our stores. We wanted -- we saw it coming. We wanted to make sure we saw some benchmarking out there as well. And what we've done is we've invested in that. We've invested in making sure that we're cleaning top to bottom throughout our stores all the time throughout Monday through Friday and then Saturday and Sunday, on the weekends, when our customers are in our stores. We want to make sure we had a clean environment for them. Bathrooms, everything throughout the store are cleaned. And we've seen that we're over-indexing now compared to other retailers as far as where we're at on cleaning.  As far as customer experience goes, I talked a little bit about it earlier today, just customer experience, that high five, the GURA, we rolled out fast. It allowed us to take some of our people that we've hired that are more task-driven and moved them over into a task-driven environment.  Now the other team members that we have inside of our stores, what they do is they love to sell. They live that lifestyle. They love talking about that lifestyle. We hire for attitude. We hire farmers, welders, ranchers, horse owners. And then they're inside the store and they're doing what they really love, that GURA selling skills that are out there in our stores.  We're also investing in training of them. What that's driven us throughout this year is our GURA scores are up about 90 basis points over where they were last year. Over the last 4 years, they're up about 700 basis points. And then overall satisfaction scores continue to go up as well.\nMary Pilkington: Okay. Thank you.\nChuck Grom: That's great. So actually, some -- I guess my follow-up would be for Kurt. You spoke to the operating environment until the third quarter of next year may be at a minimum. So I guess if that's the case, I'm curious how you're thinking comps could shake out in 2021 particularly as you begin to cycle some of these big prints from the share.\nKurt Barton: Yes. Well, I'll share a little bit of information. The -- we're not going to begin to give guidance or any indication on our 2021 plan, but we are beginning to and have been looking at and have multiple scenarios for 2021. We look at and watch closely all of the indications on how the COVID pandemic is playing out. And certainly, an important factor for us is when does this pandemic begin to bring a level of normalcy back to the consumer.  And vaccines and therapeutics are going to be key. And so I want to first say that the timing of when vaccines become available to the public, the therapeutic measurements improve, we believe, as most, that there's some level of normalcy that may return back to the consumer spending and the consumer behavior.  And it's very hard to tell when. As we try to plan, we plan that, that may be mid- to late 2021. And so in that environment, we feel strong about the first half of the year, the first quarter, certainly. And I think we're planning on and investing and being able to have a strong performance in the second quarter.  And then as I indicated, as the chart that I showed indicated as well, that whenever that 1-year period of time to comp, there's some variability in it. We may have some positive growth still, they may be flattish and there's potential for even some downside in those numbers. And so we plan that the first half of the year, there's still a lot of indications for the strength and demand in our business is based on all the macro social distancing and emphasis at home. And then at some point in time, that will begin to fade as there's a level of normalcy that returns. And I think at this point that giving you guys a structure of how we think about it is about the best I can do at this point before we give any 2021 guidance.\nHarry Lawton: The only thing I'll add to Kurt's comments is we are staffing and buying to a Q2 that is dealing with the COVID pandemic. And we know we had elevated volume levels last year. We knew we were -- we were short on inventory in certain programs as we got into the middle of Q2 because we weren't anticipating obviously when we placed our import orders in the November, December time frame for 38% comps. We now know how consumers behave in the midst of the COVID pandemic and we're working both on our -- with our import partners as well as our domestic partners to build inventory levels to meet that demand this coming Q2. And we also are building staffing plans to meet that demand as well.\nMary Pilkington: So great questions as always. [Operator Instructions]. So with that, our next question is from Oliver Wintermantel at Evercore ISI.\nOliver Wintermantel: Yes. So Kurt, maybe it's for you. It's a question about free cash flow. You mentioned $3.5 billion over the next five years. So I just wanted to see if there's any -- from the cadence, is that more back-end loaded or have investments there an impact? And then on the share buybacks, you mentioned that you're going back into share buybacks. Is there any timing? And the size, is that also flat then over the next few years? Any color into buybacks.\nKurt Barton: Okay. Yes. Thanks, Oliver. So there's two questions in there, free cash flow over time and then buybacks. I'll hit on the free cash flow. Certainly, as a reminder, the timing of the pandemic can play, bid into it, but in general, we've planned for a rather consistent pattern on the free cash flow over time. The investments maybe shift between years as to when a distribution center is loaded, but $450 million to $550 million investments into the business over time with a very continued strong level of operating cash flow from this business, we believe it will be relatively consistent throughout the period of time. And we think that's a really strong, compelling part of our business.  It then leaves us the ability to be able to return cash to our shareholders. And that a really purposeful, important part of the Life Out Here strategy for us is the capital allocation. And our first priority, as we've mentioned, is investing organically in the business with all the things that we've just been talking about. But it is exciting that in that period of time, we estimate or targeting returning $4 billion to our shareholders.  The dividends are an important piece of our model. We're targeting to be able to get back to a 30% payout ratio, so there's some strong allocation to dividend. But on the buybacks, we've said in the beginning of the pandemic, we were temporarily pausing that and we did. And it was purposely a planned temporary pause. We do see that as we come out over the last couple of quarters, the business is strong, that share buybacks, as I indicated, are a plan in our capital allocation. So in the next couple of weeks, we'll be talking with our Board about our plans to reengage on the share repurchases and we'll have more information in the near term as to the timing of that.\nMary Pilkington: Okay. We'll move on to our next question, which is from Peter Keith at Piper Sandler, please.\nPeter Keith: A great quarter. I know it's difficult to execute in this environment, but some really nice numbers today. You guys have a lot of interesting things going on. I was hoping at a high level, you could just talk about your competitive positioning and how these investments you feel might be structurally enhancing your competitive positioning relative to the competition. And maybe interested in how you might prioritize or rank those in order of importance. And then as a follow-on, just in the pet category, it's good to hear you're gaining share. But maybe specifically to pet, what are you doing there to enhance the competitive positioning?\nHarry Lawton: Yes. Peter, thanks for joining us today and appreciate your remarks about our quarter. I'd first start out with we had the opportunity of participating in an incredibly attractive market, $110 billion in size, fragmented, very favorable profitability structure. It's demand-driven, needs-based. And we had the benefit of being a scaled player in that with significant opportunity still ahead of us. As we think about a competitive positioning, we think about it a little bit less about the competitive positioning and more about the customer.  And the whole focus is to stay ahead of where the customers' expectations are. And that the entire focus of Life Out Here strategy is to address that lifestyle need, that Out Here Lifestyle need and make sure that our offerings, our capabilities are best-in-class out there and surpassing what the customers' expectations are. And we firmly believe that if we do that, we will gain share in a very attractive market. And we are confident right now across all the categories that we compete in, no matter what the categories in our stores, that we are gaining substantive share.  Specifically as it relates to pet, as I said earlier, we are gaining share in pet. We know that when we look at the overall kind of industry-level data and also when we look at our data and when we talk with our customers -- our manufacturers. And what I'll talk with -- and I'll let Seth talk a little bit about kind of marketing and merchandising activity that we have going on there.\nSeth Estep: Yes. So thanks, Hal. So yes, from the pet space, for example, obviously, we spend a tremendous amount of time analyzing the space, analyzing market trends. From a product assortment standpoint, the team has absolutely done a fantastic job responding to the dynamics of the industry over the course of last year.  Actually, in Q3, every single pet consumable category was touched and reset and really had the consumer obviously at the heart of all those resets, going from, they call it, a grain-free assortment north of 40% prior to the August reset, now sub-25% and really leaning into some of those science-based brands, introducing new brands like Victor, partnering with Miranda Lambert MuttNation and getting those type of exclusive partnerships out there that can really engage with our consumer base.  But we're also continuing to go after things, like you saw today, like pet wash. We're looking at ways to be that convenient solution and a value-oriented solution for mobile vet clinics, where we have that in over 1,500 stores today. We partnered and have over 20 full-blown wellness clinics now in pilot in some of our stores. And we're talking to some of our partners out there as well on how we can look to incorporate some of that in next year's project -- at some select Project Fusion layouts.  And then obviously, a lot of the investments that we're also making in the digital space are really, really going after this consumer, not only being there for their products but try to really build that relationship with them in the digital space and then obviously with John and his team in the stores. So...\nMary Pilkington: Okay. Our next question is from Chris Horvers at JPMorgan.\nChristopher Horvers: So I had one question in two parts. First, can you talk about how much of the business that you would classify as truly repeating in nature? I guess some of animal adoption includes crates and beds and that will, per se, repeat next year. So how do you think about true short replacement cycle as a percentage of your mix? At the same time, buying a riding mower is in short cycle and can you give the other side of it, which is what is -- what portion of the mix would you create as sort of a multiyear replacement cycle business?  And the second part of the question is you mentioned expecting positive comps in the first half of next year given COVID sticks around and mentioning chasing demand in 2Q '20. Would that suggest that you could potentially lap 2Q with the positive comp?\nHarry Lawton: Yes. Again, thanks for joining us today. As Kurt mentioned in his remarks and also in last quarter's remarks, we see about 50% of our elevated comps being more structural and about half of it being a little bit more transitory. And there's a variety of kind of different ways that we look at it to kind of come to that conclusion, but we feel very good about that. And I'd say, if anything, we're becoming more comfortable on the structural side as the pandemic progresses.  To your point, say, on dogs, certainly, you might not buy that crate again. But if you bought a small bed, then you're going to upgrade to a larger bed. Or if you got a small ball for your pet, it's very much an annuity-type business.  And then on garden, while certainly we have very strong share in things like riders, there's a lot of opportunity, as Seth shared, for us to gain a broader share in the garden business, whether it's in soils and fertilizers, certainly live goods, outdoor power more broadly. And those are the sorts of categories that you can see us really emphasizing, grilling, you can see us leaning into those. So as we start to cycle some of the bigger-ticket purchases, we're looking for those other categories to really offset that and drive those kind of comp sales in those sorts of businesses.  As it relates to Q2, as I said, we're leaning in on it. We're buying for it. We're going to staff for it. And then we'll see how it evolves as we get into next year. There's a lot of uncertainties, as Kurt's laid out, not only the pandemic but how the economy is going to be, what the economic conditions are going to be, unemployment, stimulus, those sorts of things. So we'll -- there's a lot of uncertainty out there, but know that we are leaning into Q2.\nMary Pilkington: Okay. We'll move on to our next question, which is Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Great results. Congratulations. So my question and I'll keep it to one just with respect to Mary Winn's request. It's shorter term in nature, so I apologize. We talked a lot about the potential for -- Kurt, you talked about in your presentation the potential for normalization after COVID. If you look at the results now, clearly, a historically strong comp in second quarter and that's -- I'm sorry, third quarter, I apologize, very strong comp in the second quarter. The guidance for Q4 does assume some kind of moderation. I'm assuming there's likely conservatism in that. But the question I have is, are you starting to see -- even with COVID still there, are you starting to see some indication that your consumer is beginning to normalize in their buying patterns? Is that a factor behind whatever is in the report?\nKurt Barton: Do you want to take it?\nHarry Lawton: Yes, I'll take it. What I would say is our business has been remarkably consistent. And we've seen no trailing off of consumer behavior at all. And in fact, we're seeing right now simultaneous strength in even some extended spring goods and summer goods, say, like riders as well as strength in more seasonal goods like patio heaters, log splitters, chain saws and outerwear as people are starting to think about the winter and as the fall and winter season approaches. And they're really approaching it with the same mentality as they approached spring.  And in fact, we're seeing a little bit more of even of some stock-up behavior, where I think those who were last in line, so to speak, in the spring and summer, they didn't -- they weren't able to get the patio furniture. They weren't able to get that pool put in. They weren't able to do some of the things that they wanted to do to their backyard. And they're not going to miss out on that here as they go into the fall and into the winter time.  So our comps month-by-month in Q3 were very consistent. Our comps across geographies, very consistent. Our comps across categories, very consistent. We're seeing that continue into Q4 here. And we're seeing the same level of behavior from our customers as we saw in the previous two quarters, with the exception of it just moderating based on the types of categories that are in season right now.\nMary Pilkington: All right. Keep moving down our questions. Let's see, we'll go to Scott Ciccarelli at RBC.\nRobert Ciccarelli: So I guess I have another follow-up question on the side lots since that seems to be the initiative that you guys are expecting to have the biggest impact on your business. Can you tell us what percent of sales today comes from the side lot? And just related to that, is your expectation that your sales maybe reaches your in-store levels? Or would you expect that, given the nature of those side lots, to continue to lag what you generate in the store?\nKurt Barton: Yes. Scott, this is Kurt. In the side lot, I think the important thing to remember is that the side lot today, you've walked it, it's productive. It has a portion of it that you'd view as storage for that large, bulky agricultural-type equipment. And so some of that product outside, is inside other areas, we don't get specific to the productivity of the side lot pre or post on this initiative in there. What we see is a great opportunity for that product itself to be able to sell at or at a greater pace in the modified reduced space for the ag equipment and then reallocate that space to create that environment that's a shopping -- an actual pleasant shopping experience, a convenient shopping experience, leverage it even for the drive-through aspect of the business to capitalize on convenience.  And so it's -- one, it's very early, so it's hard for us to go and say here's what it would -- the productivity is going to be like. But it's also more of a holistic store productivity view for us. And that's how we encourage you to look at it as the convenience that it drives and the new categories that Seth talked about. And what you see in our projections of the stepped-up comps in a normal post-COVID is a primary indicator as you work the number of stores that we roll this out, you can see the level between fusion and side lot and what that's going to be doing to drive productivity in our existing space today.  And we will certainly have more opportunity to share as these first rounds of stores really begin over the next 6, 9 months to show us some true trends in that business. But you certainly can see the excitement of what it does holistically for the store.\nMary Pilkington: Okay. Next up on our Q&A is Matt McClintock with Raymond James.\nMatthew McClintock: So my question is what are some of the buckets that you have the flexibility to spend on. Should significant upside remain to your current plan? And I asked this because it seems like you're pretty flexible or nimble on marketing spend the last few quarters and how simply that helps with new customer acquisition.\nHarry Lawton: Yes. Matt, I'm going to turn it over to Rob here in just a minute to talk a little about technology. And I think that's one of the areas that we've really shown a significant amount of flexibility this year. As you mentioned in other areas also in marketing, as soon as the pandemic kicked in, we transitioned from a dominantly kind of more traditional print-based marketing plan to a digital and television-based marketing plan as we thought that there was going to -- the consumer is going to be right to kind of open their aperture on consideration of what retailers to shop. And certainly, the new customers that we've seen have proven that hypothesis to be true.  I think Seth demonstrated a lot of agility and flexibility in digital. I'll turn to Rob to maybe talk a little bit about some of the things we've done but, importantly, a lot of the things that we have on the horizon.\nRobert Mills: Great. So as Hal mentioned, yes, a lot of flexibility and agility built into IT, which is not uncommon, but this year was a great example where we really leaned in and focusing on what that flexibility and agility would look like especially in the digital space. We started this year with a clear road map of improving that customer experience online, really striving to be that best-in-class, world-class omni-channel provider.  And with that, earlier and within COVID, it was obvious that our customer was adopting very quickly to digital, coming to the website, but also looking for convenience. And this is where the partnership with John's team of implementing curbside pickup very rapidly, expanding our capabilities of delivering to the customer's home very rapidly across the entire store base.  And then looking even in the future, we really have 3 core pillars. One is how do we continue to build that flexibility around finding the product, the navigation, search that will improve the quality of the traffic coming to the website as well as just making it a simpler and easier shopping experience for the customer. The second is really around that convenience factor leveraging curbside but delivering the product to the customer much more faster and efficiently with the goal of 90% of our deliveries occurring same day or within near the same day. And then lastly, really leveraging on that expertise that I've talked about earlier, providing that -- the content, the video, that know-how-to expertise for our customers, that they come to us more. We're clearly trusted with our customer base and how do we bring that through the mobile device and at all times.  You've seen throughout this year, we've changed our deployment strategy from the technology, really focused on agility where we're doing online twice a month, sometimes more frequent, new capabilities that's impacting the stores as well as within the digital space. So really excited about the technology advancements that we're making. We have flexibility to scale up through partners as well as our internal team members and aligning it to our short-term and long-term goals.\nMary Pilkington: All right. Thanks so much, Matt. We'll move on to our next question that comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens.\nDaniel Imbro: I'll add my congrats to the list. Maybe a follow-up to the last answer on digital investments, how are you guys thinking about the new mobile app? Obviously, engagement looks like it's growing nicely, but is it more of a transactional tool or a research tool for your customers? And while it's only been a few months, can you maybe talk about how you're working to ensure it's truly incremental to sales and not just a channel shift?\nRobert Mills: Right. Do you want me to take it?\nHarry Lawton: Yes.\nRobert Mills: All right. Thanks a lot. So mobile is a key part of our strategy. It has been for several years. Our customers clearly told us mobile first is very important. We have shared in the past that majority of our site, our traffic comes through a mobile device and that's not changing. We accelerated this year the mobile device -- or the mobile application and closed it by 6 to 9 months.  And originally out of the gate, it was to provide some basic selling tools and ensure that we can provide a customer transaction and the ability to pick up within store, but we're very rapidly building on those capabilities related to convenience. And with that is also focusing on the content. So it's a little bit of both.  You're going to see us clearly, we want a simple, convenient shopping experience for that customer. But at the same time, we want to always be with them. They come into our stores looking for that product expertise, that service knowledge. That's a differentiator for Tractor. You've heard us talk about how we hire our customers. We want that mobile device to always be with them, that mobile app always available. So if they have questions while they're on their property or questions about their animal or health or wellness being, how are we always there to ask and answer those questions, some through automation, some through ask the experts, so live interaction; and then also at the same time have the products available both in stores as well as at extended assortment, so they can transact.  We see both the sales coming from, in some cases, a shift; in other cases, being incremental and that's what we've seen so far. We're really pleased with the adoption. We have extreme focus and I'm really excited about what's going to be coming in the next couple of quarters with additional capabilities focusing on content and that convenience play.\nMary Pilkington: Thanks, Rob. I hope everybody has downloaded the Tractor Supply app. For every download up to 1 million, we're donating $1 to the American Connection Project Broadband Coalition. And as you know, that's a real need in our rural communities, so thank you all for taking the time to download the app. Our next question comes from Brad Thomas at KeyBanc.\nBradley Thomas: Congrats on the great results. I want to circle back on a question of trying to model 2021 and I recognize you're not ready to give guidance and none of us know how the top line is going to play out next year. But I was hoping we could just talk about some expense buckets that maybe we know about at this point. As I'm counting it, the wage increases roll into next year, presumably some of the COVID expenses roll into next year. You've now disclosed $12 million to $15 million of strategic growth investments in the fourth quarter. Kurt, are those now expected to roll through next year? And are there any other items that we should be thinking about that you can call out this time as we think about some of the margin or expense puts and takes for next year?\nKurt Barton: Yes. Brad, that's good question. And so let me give you some of the directional information as you think about 2021. In regards to COVID, very similar to how it's framed up, how we're looking at 2021, potentially, you would anticipate, we anticipate that the expenses that we've incurred in COVID would continue but yet would likely fade as you move out of a COVID pandemic into a bit of normalcy.  On the COVID expenses, the vast majority of that is labor and supplies focused on safety, cleaning, sanitation, as John talked about. And then there's -- the lesser extent would be medical and sick-related costs and contact tracing, case management. And so you can see how as we transition out of a COVID pandemic, that those costs could dissipate in there as well.  Yes, the permanent wage benefits, we would model that into 2021. On the strategic growth initiatives, the strategy that we just laid out, the primary cost would be in the capital spend and would start to introduce into the depreciation. On the strategic initiatives that we're pointing out today, like in third quarter and even in fourth quarter, the most significant factor was the rollout of the FAST Program, which we said we would do hiring, training, all of that and we would incur that initial burden of the ramp-up of it. And some of that incurs and it's a primary factor in fourth quarter as well.  Third quarter was the next largest piece of the strategic growth initiatives we're advertising. And as Hal mentioned, that's something we may flex in or out as we anticipate. So as we talk about strategic growth initiatives in Q3 and Q4, those are something specific to the back half of the year. And going forward, it's more specific items to these strategic initiatives and may not be at those same levels and likely to be, on a quarterly basis, a level that's lesser than the $12 million to $15 million on a per-quarter basis in 2021.\nHarry Lawton: You want to say something about incentive compensation, Kurt, because that's a big swing.\nKurt Barton: Yes. I mean certainly, incentive compensation, as you model that out, I mean, with the performance in 2021, there's record-level performance and super excited to be able to provide our team members a record level of incentive compensation. And we've talked often, the frontline team members, those in the stores, distribution centers, getting a real strong portion of that incentive compensation. But as we lap that next year, the way that our incentive plans are built, that's actually a leverage point for us in 2021.\nMary Pilkington: All right. Thank you, Kurt. We'll go to Seth Sigman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse now.\nSeth Sigman: I'll add my congrats as well. I want to follow up on that last question. As we're hopefully trying to figure out if demand remains elevated here, should we be thinking about the flow-through next year in '21 being more or less favorable than this past year? And so you clearly have been spending already. Some of that may continue, but you'll also start to lap some of that, you'll lap the incentive comp, but then you'll also have some incremental investments coming in. So just to summarize, like how would we be thinking about the flow-through more or less favorable than what we've seen recently?  And then also, if you can speak specifically about the gross margin, Kurt, because you also noted some incremental pressures hitting the fourth quarter and Tractor is clearly not alone in that. But are you expecting those headwinds to continue? And how do you feel about the offsets to that, things that helped this past year like less promotional activity and all the effectiveness with discounting, would those serve as offsets next year?\nKurt Barton: Okay. Yes, Seth, I think I heard two questions in there. One was a little bit of guidance and I'll stay very directional on 2021 and the flow-through. And then there was a gross margin question on Q4 and maybe a little bit on 2021. Directionally, I would guide towards staying somewhat consistent on the flow-through in 2021 principally because what you've seen and what we've seen in this environment today, with the step-up of demand that the COVID pandemic creates for all the things we talked about, the cost of doing business is also elevated. And as the demand for the product may shift as you move out of a peak COVID, so does some of the expenses that goes with it. So I'd stay somewhere in the range that you've seen in 2020, albeit 2020 is going to have a high level of flow-through. And we'll give more guidance on that on our fourth quarter call.  In regards to gross -- in the gross margin, there are some specific things as I called out the fourth quarter. And so the past 2 quarters had tremendous gross margin growth year-over-year on the rate. And fourth quarter last year, we began to see some of our benefits play out and we had our strongest gross margin performance and we'll cycle that. And there are some things that are transitory to the fourth quarter specific to it.  How long some of the newer pressures in the transportation business sticks may impact 2021. And then particularly to the fourth quarter, as I pointed out, that's typically just generally a more promotional-type environment with the holiday season. So we anticipate some of the benefit of less promotional in Q2, Q3 puts pressure on the fourth quarter to be able to maintain that.  Looking out to 2021, I would just emphasize we will continue to focus on everyday low pricing benefit there and not necessarily going back to a heavier promotional. So we do anticipate focusing on maintaining as much of the gross margin rate benefit that we've seen of late go forward.\nMary Pilkington: Thank you, Kurt. So we let it go just a little bit longer than our 1-hour mark for Q&A, but we'll wrap up with one final question. That question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with TAG.\nJoseph Feldman: Again, I'll offer congratulations on the quarter and a good event. So I wanted to wrap up with which categories do you think you see the most opportunity for, from the analytics and technology that you're talking about and Project Fusion, not just product categories but space within the stores. As I'm thinking about it, I'm just trying to think like is apparel your biggest opportunity, where there's most upside? Or what are those kind of categories we should look for?  And then if I could kind of tie this together with another question on pets was -- and I apologize if I missed it, but I don't think I heard the word Petsense at all today and I'm just wondering what you're thinking about that.\nHarry Lawton: Yes. So I'll take the Petsense piece and then I'll turn it to Seth. And Seth, maybe you can walk through kind of the merchandising category portfolio strategy and kind of the 6 kind of must-wins that your team is focused on.\nSeth Estep: Yes, absolutely.\nHarry Lawton: Yes. So Petsense, the business is doing very well. It's -- it too is benefiting from kind of the strength in pet adoption and pet humanization. The management team is doing well. We feel really good about the business. It is continuing to grow. It's reasonably immaterial to the overall Tractor Supply portfolio and size and scale. And kind of more to come, I guess, on Petsense, but the Petsense business is doing very well. We're really pleased with it. Seth, I'll turn it over to you to maybe talk a little bit about our category strategies and where we're really focusing.\nSeth Estep: Yes, absolutely. So yes, we talked a little bit earlier about some of the category strategies that we're going after. And over the course of -- it actually -- it was -- really started this process even, call it, pre-COVID and then just continued to assess the opportunity as we've gone throughout this COVID environment.  And there's really five fundamental areas that we're focused in on. First and foremost, we are going to win at pet and animal. We think we still have a significant opportunity to not only maintain our market-leading status in things like large animal feed that Hal talked about earlier but also continue to gain share there as well, really not only going with our product assortment in stores but some of the convenience play, the digital piece, delivery, et cetera.  Pet is the other piece of that as well. Our customers love their animals. They love pet. We look at that and we know we have the ability to continue not only win with new customers but win with that share of wallet. And so we're -- our goal there is, first and foremost, win in pet and animal.  The second piece to that is going to be in how do we become that authority in lawn and garden out here. We've talked a lot about that today as we look at our exterior space as well as just some of those categories that we're going to go after. And you'll -- and what we've seen so far just in the limit of obviously early in the garden center test. But it's not only as we've gone after the garden center to see that product sell, we've seen the product sell obviously throughout all the seasonal department that's inside as well as some of those secondary categories like workwear, things of that nature have seen some really, really strong lift.  We're going to continue to capitalize again on backyarding activity, right? We're going to make sure we leverage our drive aisle, our space, all focused in on the customer, right? And it's what the customer is doing, where they're going and how can we continue to respond to those things for them. And then we're going to also go after market share in like tools, DIY as well as workwear that we talked about. You just look at the total addressable market, you look at our store count, you look at the opportunity that we have, you look at the trends that our consumers are coming to us for to start to consolidate some of those trips and we believe that we have just a significant opportunity to not only maintain our status in some of our traditional core categories but also continue to expand that through some of those other categories as well and really grow and win there.  You'll see that come to life throughout the store. You'll see it in Project Fusion. Talked a little bit about store clustering, we're looking at that on a store-by-store, region-by-region, state-by-state basis. But in a nutshell, we want to really focus in on the lifestyle we serve and the categories that we go after, just making sure that we are there for them and their needs, so they can live kind of that life on their terms.\nMary Pilkington: Great. Well, that's going to be our final question. I want to thank everyone who took the time to call in today. As always, those were some great questions.  I also wanted to take a minute to thank the Tractor Supply IR and PR team who worked so tirelessly behind the scenes on this event. Marianne Denenberg, Mackenzie Goldman and Lindsey Mitchell, I appreciate all your efforts.  And thanks to all of you for taking time out of your day to join us virtually. We look forward to speaking to you again on our fourth quarter 2020 call in late January. Take care and please stay safe.",

            "name": "Robert Mills",
            "content": "Hello, everyone. It's great to be here with you virtually today. A few years ago, we introduced our ONETractor strategy. This strategy drove significant progress for Tractor Supply, making great strides in providing a seamless customer experience. Further, the capabilities we introduced as a part of ONETractor have helped to fuel our growth during recent shifts in consumer behaviors and habits, many of which that are here to stay.  The past 6 months have accelerated digital adoption across the retail sector. Our digital strategies are a key part of our plans to sustain and grow not only with our new and reengaged customers but with our core customers who are more digitally engaged than ever. Our digital growth has been driven by introducing new capabilities and improving the shopping journey.  Even with this significant growth, we still have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us compared to other hardline and specialty retailers. Just a few years ago, e-commerce represented less than 1% of our business. And today, we are nearing 6% with continued plans to grow that share. Our online conversion rates continued to improve with double-digit growth in recent years as we evolve that shopping experience through new capabilities and have provided an intuitive checkout with efficient and fast fulfillment options. An example of this is how we introduced curbside pickup earlier this year.  Delivering legendary customer experience is our top priority, making certain that the customer experience has always ranked above our peer group, leveraging industry benchmarks such as 4C. While these capabilities we have built are serving us well today, we will continue to invest in furthering those capabilities in 3 ways: by implementing a best-in-class platform and technology, hiring and developing the best technology team and growing our digital expertise across the company.  Our goal is to deliver a world-class customer experience, supported by efficient business processes and a strong fulfillment strategy. We are transforming our business to be more digitally focused and we are connecting the customer experience together across ways they want to shop and interact with us. Our customers have told us they want to shop digitally. The success of Buy Online Pickup in Store and Ship to Store programs have illustrated this, representing over 80% of our online sales. We saw rapid adoption of our customer mobile app this summer with customers leveraging the shopping experience, curbside pickup, notifications and managing their Neighbor's Club loyalty program. And our efforts to improve the online experience and drive traffic to the website are resulting in new customer acquisition.  The goals of our advancing ONETractor capabilities pillar are fairly simple. There are 3 primary areas to focus to accomplish this: delivering legendary customer experiences anytime, anywhere, anyway; digitizing our business processes; and furthering our omnichannel capabilities. Let's talk about each of these.  We will continue to transform the customer experience with a focus on personalized content, messaging and products that meet their needs in a fast and convenient way. We are improving the online experience by optimizing search capabilities and navigation to ensure that our customers can easily find the products and services they require.  With our newly released customer mobile app, we are able to further personalize those customer experiences and provide features that make the shopping experience simple and convenient, drawing insights by leveraging information that our customers share with us through our Neighbor's club program, profiles and purchase histories. This allows us to provide product recommendations for their specific animals, pets and property. For example, a customer who purchased baby chicks has specific needs throughout the life cycle of that bird. Using machine learning to identify shopping trends and needs, we can anticipate and serve our content specific to each stage of the chicken's life, from caring for chicks during warm and cold periods to protecting the flock from predators with the right chicken coop. Once these trends and data points are identified, we can leverage artificial intelligence to recommend specific products and content, fulfillment options that fit the customers' lifestyle and even direct customers to on-demand expert advice.  We are taking steps to further the integration of the online and in-store experiences, enabling our team members with information and digitizing the store. Digitizing the layout of our fleet of stores will empower us to drive improvements in sales per square foot, enable team member efficiencies and provide new capabilities such as way-finding to our customers.  Imagine a customer who dwells in front of a riding lawn mower outside the store for several minutes. We can message them with a compelling financing offer or offer assistance through our mobile app, allowing them to notify an in-store team member that they have a question. This is just one example of how we are digitizing the in-store experience.  To continue improving the seamless experience, we are investing in intelligent assistant devices John mentioned earlier for all of our store team members, allowing instant communication with one another and being informed of those customers' needs. By integrating this technology with customer-facing capabilities, such as our mobile app, we can reduce wait times and improve the execution, directly impacting the customers' experience, customer satisfaction and ultimately driving sales.  You've heard us talk about our expert product knowledge, being the authority for the Out Here lifestyle. Leveraging this deep knowledge, we are able to curate a localized product assortment that meets our customers' needs, positioning our in-store assortment to meet daily needs then augmenting it with an extended assortment on our website and mobile app that remain localized and personalized. In addition to having the right product mix, it's important that we provide rich content for our customers and our team members, digitizing that deep knowledge I mentioned earlier. We can then help them how-to information when they run into problems on their property, provide them data to make decisions about what product is best for their animal needs and make sure they know what is needed to complete each project in advance.  Earlier, I referenced a customer purchasing baby chicks and understanding the life cycle of the birds. By knowing this information, we can offer them content and advice at relevant times, helping them understand when they need to change feeds, purchase supplements and other wellness needs that will improve and maintain the chick's health.  Personalizing the message isn't enough, though. We also have to offer that knowledge and ways our customers prefer, such as showing relevant content on their home page, providing fast answers to common questions and problems powered by automation and offering live ask-the-expert capabilities to share deep knowledge and understanding.  How customers receive their products is a key satisfaction driver in retail today, whether in-store, picked up or delivered. How we execute, the speed at which we do so and the costs are important factors. Over the years, many retailers have accepted inefficient cost structure to accomplish this. We have the opportunity to get it in front of this, leveraging a variety of options to offer the value propositions our customers want without sacrificing profitability. We are working to align our fulfillment options to our SKUs and categories to drive this efficiency and profitability. And combining this, the leveraging of our store locations and inventory investments, we will be able to ensure we provide multiple options that meet the customers' expectations.  With our wide assortment of products, fulfillment is not a one-size-fits-all. By providing options to ship from our stores and DCs, offering Buy Online Pickup in Store and curbside and delivering products from our stores can help us align the right fulfillment method to each specific product. A critical component of this strategy is how we leverage our order management systems to optimize how we route orders across our different fulfillment channels, allowing us to deliver quickly and cost effectively to the customer.  Our goal is to provide 1-day delivery to 99% of our customers while improving our profitability. By investing in systems and artificial intelligence that will identify the right methods and optimize the routing of the product, we can ensure we are choosing the best options, actively leveraging our network of stores for that final mile.  My team is energized to help capture the growth opportunities ahead of us. We have much more in the works and I look forward to sharing with you over time. Today's framework shared with you is how we intend to further evolve our seamless customer experience, advancing our ONETractor capabilities.  In summary, I'm going to leave you with 4 key takeaways that will allow us to capture significant growth opportunities ahead of us. We will continue to improve the customer shopping experience across all channels, striving to be that best-in-class omnichannel retailer. We will have an extreme focus on digitizing our business processes by leveraging data and analytics and we will provide rich personalized content and digital interactions. Lastly, we will improve sales and profitability by providing efficient, robust fulfillment options to fit any need.  At Tractor Supply, we're passionate about our digital vision and I'm thrilled to be a part of this organization. Thanks for joining us today and don't forget to enjoy some holiday shopping on tractorsupply.com. Great. So as Hal mentioned, yes, a lot of flexibility and agility built into IT, which is not uncommon, but this year was a great example where we really leaned in and focusing on what that flexibility and agility would look like especially in the digital space. We started this year with a clear road map of improving that customer experience online, really striving to be that best-in-class, world-class omni-channel provider.  And with that, earlier and within COVID, it was obvious that our customer was adopting very quickly to digital, coming to the website, but also looking for convenience. And this is where the partnership with John's team of implementing curbside pickup very rapidly, expanding our capabilities of delivering to the customer's home very rapidly across the entire store base.  And then looking even in the future, we really have 3 core pillars. One is how do we continue to build that flexibility around finding the product, the navigation, search that will improve the quality of the traffic coming to the website as well as just making it a simpler and easier shopping experience for the customer. The second is really around that convenience factor leveraging curbside but delivering the product to the customer much more faster and efficiently with the goal of 90% of our deliveries occurring same day or within near the same day. And then lastly, really leveraging on that expertise that I've talked about earlier, providing that -- the content, the video, that know-how-to expertise for our customers, that they come to us more. We're clearly trusted with our customer base and how do we bring that through the mobile device and at all times.  You've seen throughout this year, we've changed our deployment strategy from the technology, really focused on agility where we're doing online twice a month, sometimes more frequent, new capabilities that's impacting the stores as well as within the digital space. So really excited about the technology advancements that we're making. We have flexibility to scale up through partners as well as our internal team members and aligning it to our short-term and long-term goals. Right. Do you want me to take it? All right. Thanks a lot. So mobile is a key part of our strategy. It has been for several years. Our customers clearly told us mobile first is very important. We have shared in the past that majority of our site, our traffic comes through a mobile device and that's not changing. We accelerated this year the mobile device -- or the mobile application and closed it by 6 to 9 months.  And originally out of the gate, it was to provide some basic selling tools and ensure that we can provide a customer transaction and the ability to pick up within store, but we're very rapidly building on those capabilities related to convenience. And with that is also focusing on the content. So it's a little bit of both.  You're going to see us clearly, we want a simple, convenient shopping experience for that customer. But at the same time, we want to always be with them. They come into our stores looking for that product expertise, that service knowledge. That's a differentiator for Tractor. You've heard us talk about how we hire our customers. We want that mobile device to always be with them, that mobile app always available. So if they have questions while they're on their property or questions about their animal or health or wellness being, how are we always there to ask and answer those questions, some through automation, some through ask the experts, so live interaction; and then also at the same time have the products available both in stores as well as at extended assortment, so they can transact.  We see both the sales coming from, in some cases, a shift; in other cases, being incremental and that's what we've seen so far. We're really pleased with the adoption. We have extreme focus and I'm really excited about what's going to be coming in the next couple of quarters with additional capabilities focusing on content and that convenience play."

            "name": "Seth Estep",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn and hello, everyone. I'm excited to be here today to share with you some of the key merchandising initiatives to drive sustained top and bottom line performance. We believe we have a significant opportunity to add science, enhanced analytics and category expansions to drive sales and become an even more integral part of the Out Here lifestyle.  Specifically, as we look to drive consistent mid-single-digit comp sales, a maniacal focus must be given to driving space productivity. As you can see when looking at the productivity of our stores versus other retailers in the peer group, we believe we have considerable opportunity to close the gap and we have several key initiatives that we'd like to share with you today on how we can shift these metrics up and to the right.  At Tractor Supply, we have a lot of exciting merchandising programs in the works, but there are 3 initiatives I want to highlight for you today that we believe will help drive our space productivity in our stores. First, we recently implemented new technology that dramatically enhances our ability to leverage AI and data analytics to optimize our product assortments and meet the local and regional needs of our customers. This technology unlocks vast amounts of data and insights to help us make decisions at both the store, category and SKU level.  Second is Project Fusion, tractor Supply's first true remodel program that will help enhance our customer shopping experience, drive convenience and bring forth our latest merchandising initiatives to our existing store base.  And third, we have our Side Lot Transformation project that we believe is a significant opportunity to grow sales, increase trips and improve convenience by leveraging our outdoor selling space to live up to our commitment to have everything our customers need to live Life Out Here. Through these initiatives, we believe we will grow sales per square foot, increase market share, improve customer retention and acquisition as well as grow the market basket and profitability. I'm excited to share with you more about these programs today.  We have completed several technology and analytic initiatives that will drive space productivity across all 1,900-plus stores. First, we are currently implementing our new channel-clustering and assortment-optimization tools. These new tools will elevate the way we allocate product in space as we blend science with the art of merchandising. These systems take into account a wide range of data sources and combines them with the overall merchant product strategies to generate optimal product recommendations. We believe these new capabilities will result in growing market share, achieving higher profit margins with improved inventory precision and supporting more regional and localized assortments to be the dependable supplier for our customers, all of which will drive greater sales per foot and store productivity.  For instance, the seasonal division store-clustering example combines stores with similar customer demographics, POS purchasing data and other data points to optimize our seasonal product assortment to fit what they need. This data tells us that group one, in this example, primarily dominant in the Deep South, aligns with the Pastoral Pride Mosaic, a proud working-class customer who lives in rural communities. The data tells us that key product categories for this group are tractor and riders, rec vehicles and tractor maintenance. So using this information, we will tailor the seasonal assortment in these group 1 stores to meet those customers' needs to drive sales and enhance productivity. Our goal is to be locally great and nationally strong by optimizing our use of space and localizing our product assortments to meet the market needs.  Project Fusion is our second primary initiative to drive space productivity. With Project Fusion, our goal is to remodel our existing store base, bringing programs to life with new fixtures, layouts and products that truly enhance the customer shopping experience. The site-level space is analyzed category by category and reallocated as needed to align with current merchandising strategies and to drive space productivity. When reviewing the age distribution of our current store portfolio, we believe we have an opportunity to roll out Project Fusion across 60% to 70% of our store base over time. In addition to these remodels, we will continue to implement our best-in-class merchandising programs to non-Fusion stores through product resets as well as new store openings. By the end of 2020, our target is to roll out Project Fusion to 75 stores and we plan to accelerate this initiative to 150 to 200 stores next year.  Our third major space productivity initiative is our Side Lot Transformation. Many of our stores have an equivalent amount of outdoor selling space as they do inside. For years, we've used our side lot primarily for fencing, other ag supplies as well as storage. By refixturing the products currently in the side lot, we can maintain our current outdoor assortment and add significantly more products in categories that are meaningful for our customers to care for their home and their land. Our goal is to leverage this underutilized outdoor space to be the Out Here lawn and garden authority and to enhance our relationship with our customers to be the indispensable supplier for the lifestyle they choose to live.  There are several ways that we're going to leverage this outdoor space. We're excited to build out a 4,000- to 5,000-square foot garden center in our side lots. Based on our customer research, outdoor lawn and garden is the #1 category that our customer base plays in that we currently aren't a destination for. We are implementing a drive-through pickup lane for our buy online, pick up at store orders to give new and existing customers the convenience in picking up their feed on the go and giving them that contactless customer experience.  This Side Lot Transformation will enable us to become the Out Here lawn and garden authority. By the end of 2020, our target is to transform the side lots of 55 to 65 stores, either completely or under final construction, as we enter 2021. And we plan to accelerate this initiative to an additional 150 to 200 stores next year. We will also start to open up new stores with our new side lot prototype in the back half of 2021. We've already identified growers that could support more than 75% of our current store base. And over time, we anticipate transforming the side lot in 60% to 70% of our stores.  Now that you know a little bit about these initiatives, I'm going to take you on a really quick tour of our Fusion and Side Lot Transformation that we recently completed at our Rome, Georgia store.  The Rome store is representative of a typical store for our chain with around 15,500 square feet of indoor selling space and also an attached side lot with an equivalent amount of selling space. This store opened up in 2005 and as you can see, it has an opportunity to improve how we are presenting the brand to our customers. Over the next few minutes, I'm going to take you on that virtual tour and walk you through several of the updates to improve the brand experience and drive space productivity.  It all starts when a customer enters our store. At Tractor Supply, we want everyone to feel welcomed and really connect to the Out Here lifestyle. We want it to be an inviting experience with open sight lines across the store and one of the big changes of this layout involves creating one central customer service and checkout hub that shoppers can really use as the heart and soul of our store.  When you move to apparel, we've reallocated merchandising space to bring in new brands like Columbia, expand winning brands like Carhartt in area, particularly in women's. The apparel area has a fresh new appearance and layout. Next up is tool, truck and hardware. Like apparel, we created store-within-a-store expansions, utilize their air rights with new fixtures, completely retumble the adjacencies and category space to improve productivity. We know we have an opportunity to grow market share in tools and DIY. And with these changes, we're also introducing brands such as Makita that resonate with our customers and their lifestyle.  In our updated feed area, customers can shop by species, whether it be livestock, poultry or equine. In home setting categories, an area we can differentiate in retail today. Here, you can see just our new brooder tower, solidifying TSC as the destination for poultry.  Tractor Supply customers love their animals. And in our pet department, we've also increased space, allowing more holding power as well as allocating additional footage for categories like pet food and pet accessories, while improving the sight lines and shopping experience. This is such an important category for us and we continue to see opportunity to gain share. TSC is also a great place to have an outing with your dog and we've introduced new services for customers such as our pet wash. This new feature has been really well received by shoppers. We also plan to incorporate pilot wellness centers in select stores in partnership with our mobile clinic provider.  Gardening and landscape are significant destination categories for Tractor Supply, but we think we are only scratching the surface. As we mentioned earlier, we recognize we have an opportunity to really leverage these categories to grow with our existing customers while attracting and retaining new shoppers. For our seasonal department, we actually shifted it to the other side of the store to align the adjacency with our side lot so we could cohesively bring the inside department and the garden center to life.  Now let's move to the side lot area where you can see a remarkable change in the utilization of space, with one of the biggest transformational things we did was the creation of our garden center. Some of our new category highlights in the garden center include outdoor living and grilling, best-selling annuals, perennials, shrubs and trees, with a primary focus on fruit and garden which are very meaningful to the Out Here customer. We also believe this somewhat softens the store to appeal to a more female shopper base as well, which could drive sales in other categories like apparel, decor and pet.  We've added color in other live goods, really focusing in on items and products that we know our customers want as we want to be the destination for all-things-garden-related for our customers.  Beyond the garden center, our drive-through pickup lane allows for contactless customer service and convenience. Customers picking up buy online, pick up at stores orders stop at the first bay. And at our second bay, we have our new drive-through barn that allows our team members to load heavy animal feed, fencing and other core categories directly into their vehicles, convenience that we know our customers want. This entire Side Lot Transformation was completed without losing any products out of our original side lot. We just improved the merchandising through new fixtures that we think truly enhance the shopping experience and that will drive space productivity.  For my time in the store, I have seen firsthand the overwhelmingly positive response from our customers across all departments of the store with the improved shopping experience, assortment and creation of the garden center. We hope you enjoyed this virtual walk around the store, highlighting just a few of the changes that will bring our existing stores, their product assortments and shopping experiences to best-in-class standards by combining the art and the science of merchandising. We believe these initiatives will have a meaningful impact to driving space productivity and will be one of the catalysts for sustainable comp store sales as we roll out these initiatives out to the chain over time.  I hope you enjoyed seeing our Project Fusion and Side Lot Transformation initiatives through the life of our Rome, Georgia store. We look forward to bringing the enhanced format to more stores across America in the coming months and years ahead.  And as we wrap up today, a few key takeaways I want to leave you with. First, we have significant initiatives to drive sustainable sales for space productivity. Second, we believe that our growth investments in technology, Project Fusion and Side Lot Transformation will allow us to gain market share and drive comparable store sales over time. And third, our merchandising and shopping experience initiatives are designed to grow, attract and retain customers.  Over the past 82 years, Tractor Supply has worked hard to position our business as the most dependable supplier of basic maintenance products to farm, ranch and rural customers. We built a legacy on our ability to help our customers care for their home, their lands, their pets and their animals. But the story isn't over yet. With these initiatives, we are strategically poised to grow our business and continue to enhance our customers' in-store shopping experience while tailoring our assortment to serve their unique needs. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time today. Yes. Thanks, Hal. Thanks, Peter. I like the cap, by the way. Yes, when we think about the total addressable market, that's one data point that the merchants have utilized in coming up with where we're really going to focus and, as Hal mentioned, where we're going to make some of these big investments.  To put it in perspective, we showed earlier today the investments in the garden center. And you think about the size of the traditional lawn and garden category that's out there, excluding OPE where we've been strong in for a long time and that's over a $20 billion industry that's out there. So for every share point that we can go out and get, where today we're low single digits when we think about where we are there, that's $200 million of opportunity in revenue growth.  So as we think about these things and the data points -- we've looked at that in tools and DIY, obviously, where we are with pet and animal -- we've gone around the store. And as we think about Fusion and how we have laid out the category expansions, where we've looked at those footprints, we've really partnered with our vendor base, use all the different analytics points to really figure out where we're going to go invest in and whether that be in lawn and garden, again, whether it be pet and animal, whether it be in home setting categories, going after market share in those DIY areas and then utilizing our drive aisle to really go after that backyard, that activity and that's what that drives aisles are really for today, right? Take advantage of the current trends that's out there to build a basket. So hopefully, that helps a little bit in kind of how we're looking at the TAM and how we're building our category strategies accordingly. Peter, yes, it's a variation. So as we're rolling this out, I mean, we're in the initial phases of this. We partnered with some outside resources as well that are very much experts in this area. Again, I think we mentioned earlier, we've identified growers for over 75% of our current store base that we know that we have an opportunity to go out there and build these garden centers. So obviously, live goods are one component. It varies by different product segment of how -- whether we'll be owning it or whether it will be kind of scan-based type product. But then also, the other big thing in the garden center as well, it's really going to open up other categories like grilling, outdoor decor, some of those other things that can be very margin accretive as well as we build not just the live goods themselves. But that's really kind of the footstep driver to then build the basket. Yes. Thanks, Hal. Yes, so we talked a little bit earlier about some of the systems that we are currently implementing, as Hal mentioned. It's both on a macro and a micro level. We are really starting on the micro level right now as we are going through all of our line review processes, whether that be through our store clustering on each individual category as well as then that being the assortment optimization that comes with that. And our tools that -- the Blue Yonder tool that we've been implementing is space aware, so it's integrated throughout all of our merchandising processes and systems. That really allow us to get smarter, better, more scientific and apply the merchandising art to that as well on each individual micro, call it, planogram space within the store.  The next step of that as well is within the software as well as through some projects, will be more the macro store clustering project that we'll be embarking on as well so that we can, again, get better on a local and a regional level and that we can start to tailor space accordingly to what those store clusters look like. Whether that be in opening up new stores or as we go on, on this Project Fusion and side lot journey, those store clusters will -- the macro store clusters will be a big part of that on, call it, what floor plan goes in there.  In addition to those two systems, we also have another system where it's the site-level CADs, where every store itself -- we have a significant number of stores that aren't, call it, a prototype, a stand-alone building that can have some nuances in there, could be a little bit larger than the 15,500, that we don't have great visibility to today on how much, call it, flex planogram space might be in a store.  We've now got over 500 stores that we have site-level CADs that were out there today where we can now identify what those flex spaces are. Then as you just think about that and apply the space productivity metrics to it, over time, that can be a really good flywheel to drive comp, knowing that there's a big piece of the store base that has that flex space that now we can take and strategically drive planogram and space activity, too. Yes. So thanks, Hal. So yes, from the pet space, for example, obviously, we spend a tremendous amount of time analyzing the space, analyzing market trends. From a product assortment standpoint, the team has absolutely done a fantastic job responding to the dynamics of the industry over the course of last year.  Actually, in Q3, every single pet consumable category was touched and reset and really had the consumer obviously at the heart of all those resets, going from, they call it, a grain-free assortment north of 40% prior to the August reset, now sub-25% and really leaning into some of those science-based brands, introducing new brands like Victor, partnering with Miranda Lambert MuttNation and getting those type of exclusive partnerships out there that can really engage with our consumer base.  But we're also continuing to go after things, like you saw today, like pet wash. We're looking at ways to be that convenient solution and a value-oriented solution for mobile vet clinics, where we have that in over 1,500 stores today. We partnered and have over 20 full-blown wellness clinics now in pilot in some of our stores. And we're talking to some of our partners out there as well on how we can look to incorporate some of that in next year's project -- at some select Project Fusion layouts.  And then obviously, a lot of the investments that we're also making in the digital space are really, really going after this consumer, not only being there for their products but try to really build that relationship with them in the digital space and then obviously with John and his team in the stores. So... Yes, absolutely. Yes, absolutely. So yes, we talked a little bit earlier about some of the category strategies that we're going after. And over the course of -- it actually -- it was -- really started this process even, call it, pre-COVID and then just continued to assess the opportunity as we've gone throughout this COVID environment.  And there's really five fundamental areas that we're focused in on. First and foremost, we are going to win at pet and animal. We think we still have a significant opportunity to not only maintain our market-leading status in things like large animal feed that Hal talked about earlier but also continue to gain share there as well, really not only going with our product assortment in stores but some of the convenience play, the digital piece, delivery, et cetera.  Pet is the other piece of that as well. Our customers love their animals. They love pet. We look at that and we know we have the ability to continue not only win with new customers but win with that share of wallet. And so we're -- our goal there is, first and foremost, win in pet and animal.  The second piece to that is going to be in how do we become that authority in lawn and garden out here. We've talked a lot about that today as we look at our exterior space as well as just some of those categories that we're going to go after. And you'll -- and what we've seen so far just in the limit of obviously early in the garden center test. But it's not only as we've gone after the garden center to see that product sell, we've seen the product sell obviously throughout all the seasonal department that's inside as well as some of those secondary categories like workwear, things of that nature have seen some really, really strong lift.  We're going to continue to capitalize again on backyarding activity, right? We're going to make sure we leverage our drive aisle, our space, all focused in on the customer, right? And it's what the customer is doing, where they're going and how can we continue to respond to those things for them. And then we're going to also go after market share in like tools, DIY as well as workwear that we talked about. You just look at the total addressable market, you look at our store count, you look at the opportunity that we have, you look at the trends that our consumers are coming to us for to start to consolidate some of those trips and we believe that we have just a significant opportunity to not only maintain our status in some of our traditional core categories but also continue to expand that through some of those other categories as well and really grow and win there.  You'll see that come to life throughout the store. You'll see it in Project Fusion. Talked a little bit about store clustering, we're looking at that on a store-by-store, region-by-region, state-by-state basis. But in a nutshell, we want to really focus in on the lifestyle we serve and the categories that we go after, just making sure that we are there for them and their needs, so they can live kind of that life on their terms."

            "content": "Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today. When I first saw the video that we just shared with you, I thought it really captured the essence of Tractor Supply as a purpose-driven company. It is who we are. It is what we do. In retail today, having meaning and purpose with customers makes all the difference. It is a pleasure to speak with everyone today not only about our third quarter results but also about our Life Out Here strategy.  We see opportunities to capture tremendous growth ahead of us. As we're in the midst of a global health crisis and all that comes along with that, we didn't feel that it was appropriate to do a full investor community day. Rather, it's our goal today to share our Life Out Here strategic framework and provide greater insights on our initiatives as we plan for 2021 and beyond. Over time, as the world normalizes, our goal would be to host another event in the future as appropriate.  Tractor Supply is well positioned to leverage our stores and capitalize on our omnichannel capabilities. We have a large total addressable market with an attractive position and are gaining market share. We're focused on operational excellence, execution discipline and making investments from a position of strength for long-term value creation.  We're on a multiyear journey to evolve the future of our company. We are thriving as our second and third quarter results indicate. And with the actions we're taking, we're committed to emerging from the pandemic stronger than before. My sincere thanks and appreciation go out to our more than 40,000 team members of Tractor Supply that delivered these strong results. This is a team that's been operating during a global pandemic, supporting recovery from multiple natural disasters and executing at elevated sales levels while, at the same time, laying the foundation for our future growth.  Coming into the quarter, we recognized it would continue to be a challenging time and our team certainly stepped up to the challenge. Through it all, the organization has lived up to our mission and values. And I also want to thank our vendor and supply chain partners who've done a tremendous job supporting us in this challenging operating environment. I'm incredibly proud to be a part of this team. The results that we reported for the third quarter would not be possible without the team's inspiring efforts over the last several months.  The Tractor Supply team has been fully committed to adapting to the uncertainty brought on by the pandemic. Our utmost priority has been the health and safety of our team members and customers. And we're committed to being a safe place to work and a safe place to shop. And we continue to implement industry-leading best practices across all parameters of safety.  Our team member engagement scores continue to rank among the best-in-class. We have taken steps to reinforce our appreciation of the hard work of our teams that enhance and build on our culture. We're also committed to supporting and strengthening the local communities that we call home. Before we get into our Life Out Here strategy that I'm very excited to share with you, let's cover off on some of our third quarter performance.  The third quarter was another exceptional quarter for Tractor Supply. Our results were very much a continuation of the trends we experienced in the second quarter. For Q3, we had robust and consistent growth across all periods, all product categories and all geographic regions. Our brand awareness campaign, along with our new customer growth, continues to be a significant driver of our performance.  Our e-commerce business continued to drive triple-digit comps with nearly 80% of our omni sales picked up in our stores. And e-commerce continues to increase significantly as a percentage of our overall sales, doubling its penetration year-over-year. The work we have done to improve our e-commerce capabilities has certainly resonated with our customers. For example, our recently launched customer app has had almost 500,000 downloads since our launch in July.  For the third quarter, our business continued to perform at record levels. As an essential needs-based retailer, we are supporting our customers the products they need to take care of their families, their animals, their land and pets. Net sales for us in the third quarter were up 31% over last year with comparable store sales up 26.8%. Much like second quarter, we had good balance across both our transactions and our ticket growth. The top-performing categories were in our core competencies of pet food, feed and forage, agricultural fencing, poultry and bird feeding, along with seasonal categories like zero-turn tractors, outdoor power equipment and lawn and garden as we had an excellent extended selling season for these categories. And we had robust performance in our big ticket sales, driven by strength in zero-turns, safes, generators, trailers and front-engine riders.  Our CUE products, consumable, usable and edible categories, which represent the strength of our core reoccurring business, had comp sales growth in the high 20% range, an acceleration from our mid-teens performance in the second quarter. We're gaining share in these businesses and across the board, including pet food.  We continue to engage with new and reengaged customers at amongst the fastest rate in the company's history. On a combined basis, more than 10 million identified new and reengaged customers have shopped with Tractor Supply since the start of the pandemic. These new customers skew younger, higher-income and slightly more female and they represent significant incremental growth opportunities for us to unlock. More customers shopping with us than ever and they have larger baskets. The feedback from our customers on their shopping patterns at Tractor Supply include positive comments such as convenient locations, selection of products and most importantly, previous positive shopping experiences at our stores. Our opportunity is to capitalize on these trends as we look to nurture these customers and gain market share. We're working hard to retain these customers with marketing, products and service offerings and we'll continue to make investments to do so.  Before we turn to our strategic framework for Life Out Here, Kurt will now take you through some greater detail on our performance and share our outlook for the fourth quarter. Thanks, Kurt. We've been operating in this challenging environment for more than seven months now and our team continues to show great resilience, determination and commitment. Once again, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude and appreciation for the remarkable performance across the entire Tractor Supply team. Thank you. For the next hour or so, you'll hear from myself, John Ordus, Seth Estep, Rob Mills and Kurt Barton on our Life Out Here strategy. As mentioned, these presentations will be followed by Q&A. All right. So let's jump into it. Tractor Supply has a strong heritage of being the dependable and convenient supplier for the Out Here lifestyle. We are a purpose-driven company. We're deeply rooted in our mission and values. We have a resilient business model and a track record of performance. And importantly, we see an exciting future with compelling opportunities for growth and value creation. We're an integral part of our customers' lives. We equip a way of life, a way of life that we respect, love and often live ourselves. We serve the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers as well as those who simply enjoy the rural lifestyle.  We have a diversified retail footprint of over 1,900 stores across 49 states. Our footprint is a competitive advantage for us and it allows us to address the needs of our customers better than anyone else in this fragmented market. Our size also allows us to have strong relationships with our vendor partners and to efficiently invest in technology and supply chain infrastructure.  One of our special sauces is our ability to leverage this footprint and while being nationally strong, also being able to tailor to the needs of our local community. Our culture is a competitive advantage. Our mission is work hard, have fun and make money. This mission is supported by 10 values. Combined, they serve as the underpinning of our culture and guiding principles for how we conduct our business.  Our focus on Life Out Here, in combination with our culture and our store footprint, has been our foundation for our business model. This business model has proven to be very resilient as we're needs-based and demand-driven. This has allowed us to expand from 200 stores to over 1,900 stores in the last 20 years, with trailing 12 months' revenue nearing $10 billion. We have consistently delivered strong results over the last decade. We have a track record of positive traffic and same-store sales growth. We've generated strong free cash flow while maintaining a discipline on the use of financial leverage. We are strongly committed to environmental sustainability efforts. This is important to our team members, our customers, the communities we call home and our investors.  As an example, we've saved 138 million kilowatt hours since 2013 and we've recycled 3.3 million wood pallets last year. In 2018, we announced our goal to reduce carbon emissions from our facilities by 25% by 2025 and we've made great progress towards achieving that goal. We are also a strong proponent of diversity, equality and inclusion in our workforce with over 49% of our team members being female. We also published our first ever ESG tearsheet this year, along with completing our inaugural submission to CDP in August. And hopefully, you all saw our announcement last week that Tractor Supply was designated as a Great Place to Work.  We compete in an attractive market that is benefiting from numerous tailwinds. Consumers have always invested in their homes and they are doing so now like never before. Pet ownership is at an all-time high and pets have evolved into a true family member. Also, we've seen the migration of the United States population out of dense urban areas, out into the rural and suburbs of America and home-standing activities and self-reliance are very much in vogue. And additionally, because of our lifestyle and our 15,500-square foot format, we are also benefiting from trends like trip consolidation. As we look ahead, we see significant opportunities for growth and we're committed to investing to gain share and create value in a large, relatively fragmented market.  We estimate that our total addressable market to be nearly $110 billion and we believe that our share to be approximately 10%. And this provides a significant upside potential to expand our share of this large market. To capture this growth, we'll continue to invest in new stores with a target of 75 to 80 stores per year. We feel very good about our long-term market potential for 2,500 Tractor Supply stores. Our new store economics continue to be strong with robust returns.  The other way we'll grow is investment in our Life Out Here strategy. We are all about the Out Here lifestyle and our strategy is being focused on being an integral part of our customers' lives. And there are 5 pillars to this strategy. The first is deliver legendary customer service. The second is to advance our ONETractor capabilities. The third is to operate The Tractor Way. The fourth is to go the country mile for our team and the fifth is to generate healthy shareholder return. So let's review them in a little more detail.  First, delivering legendary service is a core component of our mission. This strategic component includes activities such as our brand campaign, CRM activities and the evolution of our Neighbor's Club. The objective of this pillar is to expand and deepen our customer base.  Second, advance our ONETractor capabilities. We launched our ONETractor strategy in 2017 and have made significant progress since. And you'll hear later from Rob Mills on our actions in this area, which includes our mobile app, omni fulfillment options and website enhancements. The objective of this pillar is to ensure that our digital capabilities stay ahead of our customer expectations.  Excellence in operations has always been a hallmark of Tractor Supply and we call this The Tractor Way, our third pillar. The 3 main areas of focus for this pillar are space productivity, store labor productivity and supply chain capabilities. And you'll hear more from Seth on Project Fusion and our store remodels and on our Side Lot Transformation. And from John, he's going to share with you some insights on our FAST initiative and how we're using it to drive labor productivity.  Our fourth strategy is that we go the country mile for our team. Our team members are a source of competitive advantage for us. We have a highly passionate and engaged team. In many instances, we hire our customers who bring their lifestyle expertise to work every day. And we continue to invest in our team members, their well-being and their workplace experience. We're committed to a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace. We have industry-leading store and DC manager retention. We provide significant opportunities for growth for our team members.  And finally, our last pillar. It's our goal to generate healthy shareholder return. Given our strong financial performance and resources, we'll continue to make investments that you'll hear about today to grow our business. We believe we can set an even stronger foundation that will enable us to emerge from the pandemic stronger with the goal of generating healthy shareholder return. We believe our key strategic initiatives will be meaningfully accretive to our financial profile. And you'll hear more detail from Kurt later on how the Life Out Here strategy purposely aligns our business and our financial strategy.  The leadership that drives the execution of these 5 pillars is an experienced management team with a strong track record in retail. Kurt, Seth, John and Ben, they bring 65 years of experience with Tractor Supply. And we've got Rob, Christi and Colin, they each have 5 years of Tractor Supply but bringing experience from Ulta and Home Depot and Target. And Melissa Kersey recently joined us as our CHRO after experiences at Walmart and McDonald's. I've never been more excited to be part of such a dynamic team who will lead our strategy in the years to come.  To wrap up, Tractor Supply has a resilient business model with a differentiated and loyal and growing customer base. We are moving at a fast pace. With our Life Out Here strategy, we're creating Tractor Supply 2.0 to ensure we continue as a strong, relevant company for the future. Now is the time for us to invest as we look to drive sustainable growth and long-term value for our shareholders. We are all about the Out Here lifestyle. Our Life Out Here strategy is focused on being an integral part of our customers' lives. And as we close out our prepared remarks, I hope you take away that we're a market leader with strong omnichannel capabilities, that our culture is a competitive advantage, that we have a resilient business model with compelling growth opportunities and we have the resources and are committed to allocating them to effectively execute our Life Out Here strategy.  Thank you for joining us today and I look forward to answering your questions in just a bit. Yes, great. I'll take that. Zach, it's great to see you this morning and thanks for joining us for our enhanced earnings day. The way I think what Kurt in his presentation tried to kind of outline is we anticipate that COVID will -- we'll be dealing with COVID. It will be part of the U.S. economy and consumer mentality for the better part of next year. And then as we start to comp on top of that, that will create some period of uncertainty, really depending with a lot of parameters impacting that. It could be the pace of the adoption of a vaccine, the effectiveness of a vaccine and then how user behavior changes afterwards.  What I would say is, from our view, the longer that kind of COVID -- the COVID pandemic is here, we think the longer, the more structural a lot of the trends are that we're seeing. If you think about as an example, year-to-date, we've sold 11 million birds. Pet adoption and ownership at an all-time high. Those are annuity streams that are going to continue on. Work from home and kind of this investment in your home, because you're there more frequently, that's going to continue even post COVID.  So as we think about kind of the 12 months post COVID, there's some period of kind of settling out but we're becoming more confident in that. And then once we get to the end of that, then we think we get back to a more normal routine run rate. And if our previous long-term guidance had been about 3%, what we're starting to do is add on top of that 3% the initiatives that we're announcing today. That would be the initiatives of maintaining our new customer base that we've seen and starting to -- continuing to have business from that group that's sustaining our levels that we're already operating at but also growing on top of it.  But it also comes down to our existing store base, the productivity we're going to get from the existing store base both inside the store as well as outside of the store and then the continued growth from our digital business. As you know, we've got, I think, over 30 quarters of double-digit growth. And the last two quarters have been over 100% comps. And so we see that continuing to play out. So we feel very good about the increase of our comp guidance from previously 3% to 4% to 5% based on kind of that waterfall of initiatives. Yes. Good morning, Peter and thanks for joining us on our enhanced earnings day here and I appreciate the comments. Over the last 6 to 9 months, as we've been both dealing with COVID, responding to numerous natural disasters and also dealing with the -- kind of operating at these elevated volume levels, we've also been preparing and kind of laying the foundation for the future of the company. And part of that really started with, what is our total addressable market? And that allows us to understand where share gains can be had and where our opportunities are.  And so we spent a good bit of time really digging in each of our categories, understanding where we participate in each of those categories, what the size of those markets are and then really also thinking about the markets that we address. So really, it's really a rural-suburban kind of cut of the categories that we participate in.  And after doing that work, we came to $110 billion market, a large market. One with a significant amount of opportunity, one where we have nice share at kind of 10-ish percent but one that presents a lot of opportunity for growth in front of us. And as we've talked about, we think there's a lot of opportunity to do more with our existing assets. We think there's opportunities to continue to build stores to our $2,500 target. And there's also opportunity to continue to grow our digital footprint that's dominantly with and through our stores. As it relates to the categories, I'm going to toss it to Seth and he could talk a little bit about some of the categories that we're making big investments in and where we think there's some growth. Yes, Steven and thanks for joining us on the enhanced earnings day today. And as it relates to the side lot, again, we're very bullish on the opportunity, significant opportunity to expand our sales per square foot and better utilize the side lot, the concrete pad outside of our stores. And I thought Seth really laid out that opportunity in his prepared remarks earlier very well.  As it relates to the cadence, as Seth said, we're looking somewhere in that kind of 50% to 65% range of stores for this year to accomplish. We're learning a lot as we go. We've got a real -- we've got great muscles built around building new stores and we're starting to adapt and tailor those muscles to being able to remodel stores. And doing that in the context of COVID, where you've got a lot of permitting that you've got to do and you've got town halls that -- have more virtual meetings now and those sorts of things. But we're working through that, building those muscles, building that flywheel and we feel very good about the progress we're making this year.  Next year as we move forward, we do anticipate getting at least half of those stores up and running in advance of the spring season. And then the remainder will happen through Q2 and Q3.  And then as it relates to the 5-year outlook, once we get through midway into next year, we'll have a better sense of what our capacity and capabilities are for rollout in 2022 and beyond. We certainly have aspirations of addressing the -- Seth has said in his prepared remarks, I believe, he said 60% to 75% of our stores were applicable for side lot. And we have aspirations of addressing all those over a 5-year time frame. But what we do in years 2, 3 and 4 and 5 will vary a little bit based on just kind of our learnings as we roll it out next year in terms of our capacity and capability. Yes, absolutely. So first on pet, I want to be really clear. We are gaining share in pet food and gaining share in the pet category. And while that industry certainly, there's a rising tide there, we are gaining share in the context of that rising tide. As you mentioned, you've got both pet ownership at all-time highs combined with the humanization of the pet really reinforced because people are in their homes more around their pets. And so consequently, that's driving significant volume in the category.  It is a very strategically important category for us. It's a core part of what we call our CUE business. It drives footsteps, it drives transactions. And it's a cart-starter to build the basket for our customers in the store. And as we talked about our CUE business, I believe Kurt mentioned it, it was in the mid double-digit comps in Q2, up from high-kind-of-teens in Q2. So we did see a step-up in our CUE business and a part of that improvement was driven by our pet business. We saw a significant improvement in the trend in that business from Q2 to Q3. It is being driven by both our new customers, our reacquired customers and our existing customers. We're seeing increased transactions and larger baskets from our existing customers, but we're also seeing a strong number of new customers in the pet category shopping with us.  And their repeats are at much higher rates than we've seen in the past. So it's not a one-and-done or even a two-and-done and are qualitatively, as those customers indicate the vast majority in that they plan on incorporating Tractor Supply in their future shopping patterns.  Also online, our pet business is one of the big drivers of our online triple-digit comps. And that's both happening direct ship to people's homes but also the pickup in store. So we feel like we've got a strong pet business. It's important to us strategically and that we are gaining share both in our stores and online across all the customer base. Yes, Simeon. So hit a few things. First off on how much of this was stimulated by COVID. I'd say we were working our strategy at the same time as we've been operating through the last 9 months. So the two were really much more in parallel than interrelated. What I would say is we do recognize that we're investing from a position of strength. We're committed to emerging from the pandemic a much stronger company and we are confident that we will do so.  As it relates to kind of the initiatives and the EPS, what I would say, 2 things: one, remind you we're at a much higher base now that we're operating at than we were 9 months ago. And certainly, 2 or 3 years ago, we did our long-term guidance previously.  And then the second thing I'd say is every single one of our initiatives and kind of the strategies that they kind of roll up into, we've done business cases for every single one of those. We know what the NPV and the NRRs are. We've modeled the TSR implications of those investments. And they are all kind of in the numbers that we've delivered to you today. And every single one of those investments, we're confident that it -- they generate healthy shareholder returns and generate value in the business. Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead. And Michael, the only thing I would kind of tactically call out is that the new sales are not dilutive. If you think about a 9%-ish to 9.4% on a 3% comp and then the investments we're making, particularly as it relates to capital and the depreciation that comes along with that and then our target that we shared today of 9% to 9.5%, they really are flowing through basically at the same operating margin rate that the base business, so to speak, was. So I just wanted to clarify that that's not the case when we modeled it out. Yes. Thanks, Michael. So what -- I'm going to ask John first to just talk about the operational models and the adjustments we've made in the Side Lot and Fusion stores that we've rolled out. Just to be clear, those are reflected in the numbers that we shared today. But John, maybe you can talk about that. And then, Kurt, you can come back to the broader geography questions. We are not disclosing at this time kind of the individual pieces of our strategic initiatives. You can expect to hear more from us on that over time. But what I would say is the composition of our new customers and providing the -- kind of retaining them, also our omnichannel efforts, combined with side lot infusion, are reflected in our updated comp guidance.  What I would say is we're very pleased with the early results of our -- of the stores that we've implemented the side lot. Seth showed you the Rome, Georgia store today in a video and talked you through it. But we're very pleased with the early results and that's given us the conviction to do between 150 and 200 stores next year and allocate the capital that's required to do that and the incremental capital dollars that we shared with you today. And more to come, but we think there's a big opportunity in garden. As Seth mentioned, it's the #1 category that we are not a destination for, that our customers really participate in and so big opportunity there.  In feed, where we have the feed drive-through, we are the largest player in bagged dog feed in the country. And an opportunity for us always is to make that process more efficient for our customers. And I really do think the time that it requires to load up a customer's truck or trailer with feed as they begin their day is -- does drive the difference in people going left or right. So that will make a big difference in our ability to keep gaining share in a market that we're already the #1 player. And we're very excited, bullish and going to be investing into the side lot initiative. Yes. Great. So I'm going to ask Seth to do that. And specifically, what you're going to hear from him is teeing up kind of the systems implementations we've done around macro and then the systems implementations we've done around micro that kind of come together through our line review process to deliver kind of more optimal outcomes. As it relates to new customers, to your point, as we remarked in our opening comments, 10 million new and reacquired customers between Q2 and Q3. And what I'd say is, first off, the pace of new customers really did not slow from Q2 to Q3 kind of the new customer counts that we were seeing on a weekly basis, with the exception of some modest seasonalization between Q2 and Q3, really continued at the same levels, meaning that we were really attracting new customers at the same pace in Q3. Some of that's driven by our continued advertising. But I think a lot of it's driven by just the lifestyle that people embrace in the Out Here Lifestyle and finding Tractor Supply a very relevant shopping destination for them in that lifestyle.  And we are laser-focused on retaining those customers. We're doing that through both our marketing efforts with robust CRM activities and digital marketing activities as well as bringing people into our Neighbor's Club, which we continue to increase our number of millions of customers that are members there, but also just in our stores and focusing on what's important to these new customers, delivering that legendary service and staying really focused on it.  As I mentioned earlier, the reshop rates with these customers are exceeding the historic rates we have of reshop rates with new customers not only on the second but also third time. And that gives us more confidence in the structural-oriented -- that there's more structural-ness versus transitory in those new customers.  John, I know -- I'd let him speak a little bit in terms of having all-time customer SAP scores but also the focus on cleanliness and safety that we've had in our stores to really maybe bring some of that to life. The only thing I'll add to Kurt's comments is we are staffing and buying to a Q2 that is dealing with the COVID pandemic. And we know we had elevated volume levels last year. We knew we were -- we were short on inventory in certain programs as we got into the middle of Q2 because we weren't anticipating obviously when we placed our import orders in the November, December time frame for 38% comps. We now know how consumers behave in the midst of the COVID pandemic and we're working both on our -- with our import partners as well as our domestic partners to build inventory levels to meet that demand this coming Q2. And we also are building staffing plans to meet that demand as well. Yes. Peter, thanks for joining us today and appreciate your remarks about our quarter. I'd first start out with we had the opportunity of participating in an incredibly attractive market, $110 billion in size, fragmented, very favorable profitability structure. It's demand-driven, needs-based. And we had the benefit of being a scaled player in that with significant opportunity still ahead of us. As we think about a competitive positioning, we think about it a little bit less about the competitive positioning and more about the customer.  And the whole focus is to stay ahead of where the customers' expectations are. And that the entire focus of Life Out Here strategy is to address that lifestyle need, that Out Here Lifestyle need and make sure that our offerings, our capabilities are best-in-class out there and surpassing what the customers' expectations are. And we firmly believe that if we do that, we will gain share in a very attractive market. And we are confident right now across all the categories that we compete in, no matter what the categories in our stores, that we are gaining substantive share.  Specifically as it relates to pet, as I said earlier, we are gaining share in pet. We know that when we look at the overall kind of industry-level data and also when we look at our data and when we talk with our customers -- our manufacturers. And what I'll talk with -- and I'll let Seth talk a little bit about kind of marketing and merchandising activity that we have going on there. Yes. Again, thanks for joining us today. As Kurt mentioned in his remarks and also in last quarter's remarks, we see about 50% of our elevated comps being more structural and about half of it being a little bit more transitory. And there's a variety of kind of different ways that we look at it to kind of come to that conclusion, but we feel very good about that. And I'd say, if anything, we're becoming more comfortable on the structural side as the pandemic progresses.  To your point, say, on dogs, certainly, you might not buy that crate again. But if you bought a small bed, then you're going to upgrade to a larger bed. Or if you got a small ball for your pet, it's very much an annuity-type business.  And then on garden, while certainly we have very strong share in things like riders, there's a lot of opportunity, as Seth shared, for us to gain a broader share in the garden business, whether it's in soils and fertilizers, certainly live goods, outdoor power more broadly. And those are the sorts of categories that you can see us really emphasizing, grilling, you can see us leaning into those. So as we start to cycle some of the bigger-ticket purchases, we're looking for those other categories to really offset that and drive those kind of comp sales in those sorts of businesses.  As it relates to Q2, as I said, we're leaning in on it. We're buying for it. We're going to staff for it. And then we'll see how it evolves as we get into next year. There's a lot of uncertainties, as Kurt's laid out, not only the pandemic but how the economy is going to be, what the economic conditions are going to be, unemployment, stimulus, those sorts of things. So we'll -- there's a lot of uncertainty out there, but know that we are leaning into Q2. Yes, I'll take it. What I would say is our business has been remarkably consistent. And we've seen no trailing off of consumer behavior at all. And in fact, we're seeing right now simultaneous strength in even some extended spring goods and summer goods, say, like riders as well as strength in more seasonal goods like patio heaters, log splitters, chain saws and outerwear as people are starting to think about the winter and as the fall and winter season approaches. And they're really approaching it with the same mentality as they approached spring.  And in fact, we're seeing a little bit more of even of some stock-up behavior, where I think those who were last in line, so to speak, in the spring and summer, they didn't -- they weren't able to get the patio furniture. They weren't able to get that pool put in. They weren't able to do some of the things that they wanted to do to their backyard. And they're not going to miss out on that here as they go into the fall and into the winter time.  So our comps month-by-month in Q3 were very consistent. Our comps across geographies, very consistent. Our comps across categories, very consistent. We're seeing that continue into Q4 here. And we're seeing the same level of behavior from our customers as we saw in the previous two quarters, with the exception of it just moderating based on the types of categories that are in season right now. Yes. Matt, I'm going to turn it over to Rob here in just a minute to talk a little about technology. And I think that's one of the areas that we've really shown a significant amount of flexibility this year. As you mentioned in other areas also in marketing, as soon as the pandemic kicked in, we transitioned from a dominantly kind of more traditional print-based marketing plan to a digital and television-based marketing plan as we thought that there was going to -- the consumer is going to be right to kind of open their aperture on consideration of what retailers to shop. And certainly, the new customers that we've seen have proven that hypothesis to be true.  I think Seth demonstrated a lot of agility and flexibility in digital. I'll turn to Rob to maybe talk a little bit about some of the things we've done but, importantly, a lot of the things that we have on the horizon. Yes. You want to say something about incentive compensation, Kurt, because that's a big swing. Yes. So I'll take the Petsense piece and then I'll turn it to Seth. And Seth, maybe you can walk through kind of the merchandising category portfolio strategy and kind of the 6 kind of must-wins that your team is focused on. Yes. So Petsense, the business is doing very well. It's -- it too is benefiting from kind of the strength in pet adoption and pet humanization. The management team is doing well. We feel really good about the business. It is continuing to grow. It's reasonably immaterial to the overall Tractor Supply portfolio and size and scale. And kind of more to come, I guess, on Petsense, but the Petsense business is doing very well. We're really pleased with it. Seth, I'll turn it over to you to maybe talk a little bit about our category strategies and where we're really focusing."

            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal and good morning, everyone. I will go through more of the third quarter financial highlights and then come back as part of our strategy update. At that time, I'll share with you greater details on our focus to generate shareholder value. First, I want to build on the overview of our sales that Hal shared earlier and provide a couple of additional highlights. We did have marginal sales benefit from emergency response products as our teams work to support the communities impacted from multiple hurricanes and the wildfires out West. In addition, much like the second quarter, we had ideal weather conditions for the quarter also contributing to the comp sales performance.  Another highlight for the quarter is that we continue to achieve strong year-over-year growth in our private label credit card sales. The largest growth in our PLCC tender came from standard financing while also seeing strength in our big ticket sales. We continue to see strong growth in this program, providing us the confidence that our 5% reward program is resonating with our customers.  Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 36.4% in the third quarter. That's an increase of 138 basis points. This increase was driven principally by a reduction in frequency and depth of promotions and a lower level of clearance, both of them as a result of strong demand for our product categories and our focus on everyday low price. We also benefited from lower transportation costs as a percentage of net sales as most of our cost inputs were favorable to the prior year, such as domestic carrier costs, imports and fuel costs. We did begin to see a meaningful shift in the domestic and import carrier costs beginning in the third quarter, which will begin to flow through the P&L during the fourth quarter. And I'll speak to that in a bit later.  Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 30.7% compared to the prior year's third quarter. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses improved 14 basis points. The robust comp sales performance drove over 250 basis points of leverage in our core SG&A expenses, inclusive of the permanent wage and benefit increases effective in July of this year.  Now the strong leverage was partially offset by incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic; investments in strategic initiatives, including incremental advertising initiatives; and increased incentive compensation, with the majority of that incentive compensation for the benefit of the frontline store teams, given the record sales and profit performance in the quarter. The incremental costs related to COVID-19 pandemic was in line with our expectations, albeit at the higher end of the range and it included additional labor hours and supply costs dedicated to the cleaning and sanitation to enhance the health and safety of our team members and our customers. The 3 incremental cost factors I just pointed out represented the vast majority of the offset to the 250 basis points of leverage.  Turning to profitability. Our operating profit dollars increased $90.4 million over the prior year, with operating profit margin of 9.7%, an improvement of 152 basis points. Net income was $190.6 million, an increase of 56%. Diluted EPS was $1.62, an increase of nearly 59%. When I come back up later in the event, I'll give you a greater perspective on our cash flow, liquidity and capital allocation priorities, all of which builds on the current strength and health of our balance sheet.  Moving now to our guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, our view assumes no significant worsening of the pandemic or any dramatic reclosing of the economy. To date, we continue to see the strong sales momentum in the business. We expect this momentum to continue, albeit at a lower level than the third quarter as we forecast delivering strong sales and profitability for the fourth quarter. We continue to believe it's always better to look at our business by the halves of the year. Due to the unique situation related to COVID-19, we are providing our view on the fourth quarter similar to how we did last quarter. Factors contributing to a heightened level of uncertainty include the duration and impact of shelter-in-place restrictions and social distancing measures, the potential for incremental government stimulus benefits, elevated unemployment levels and the November elections.  Additionally, the fourth quarter is sensitive to shifts in weather trends and seasonal holiday shopping patterns. With this backdrop, we would anticipate the strength in our comparable sales trends to moderate as we move through the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect net sales to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion and comp sales growth in the range of 15% to 20%. Net income is forecasted to be in the range of $163 million to $175 million and diluted EPS of $1.37 to $1.47. We anticipate gross margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of flat to a modest increase compared to the prior year.  There are three factors driving the shift from the more favorable trends of the 2 most recent quarters. One, we are cycling strong prior year gross margin performance in the fourth quarter, which benefited from strong direct margin performance as our merchant teams partnered with our vendors on achieving a solid overall landed margin. And then two, we anticipate the transportation cost to be higher as a percentage of sales due to rising costs in both domestic and import transportation and along with that, higher seasonal surcharges for small package parcels related to our strong and growing e-commerce business. And then three, in comparison to the previous 2 quarters, we are planning more promotional events during this always-promotional-holiday-shopping season.  In regards to SG&A, there are 2 incremental costs to the business factored into our guidance. First, the COVID-19-related costs of approximately $17 million to $20 million to ensure the health and safety of our team members and customers; and then second, an incremental $12 million to $15 million for the prioritization of our strategic growth initiatives. And as a reminder, consistent with our third quarter, our move to permanent wage and benefit changes will represent an incremental $13 million in the quarter. And for modeling purposes, as a percentage of sales, we estimate 40 to 50 basis points impact from incremental incentive compensation based on the strong performance of the quarter and the full year. Lastly, we are forecasting our net income growth for the quarter to be generally in line with the sales growth.  To wrap up, our recent results reinforce the confidence and optimism of our future. We are moving fast to capitalize on the exciting opportunities we see ahead of us. I look forward to coming back here to discuss with you our plans for delivering sustainable shareholder value.  And with that, let me turn it back over to you, Hal. Good morning again, everyone. In these incredibly uncertain and complex times, the Tractor Supply team has found a way to truly thrive. It is a testament to each and every one of our team members and our resilient business model that we have found a way to really be there for our customers, serving them with care and doing our best to have the right products and services for them at the right price and available anytime, anywhere, any way they choose to shop.  Our Life Out Here strategy is grounded in our focus on delivering strong and sustainable total shareholder return. We are humbled by our strong operating financial performance year-to-date, which is a true testament to our differentiated and durable core business. And as you have heard from Hal and others, given our extremely strong financial performance and resources, we plan to make significant investments to enable us to continue to gain market share. We are confident that our planned growth and margin-driving initiatives such as Fusion, Side Lot and FAST, will strengthen our foundation and enable us to emerge even stronger on the other side of the pandemic. My goal is to provide deeper insights on how our disciplined capital stewardship supports our business strategy and can deliver strong and sustainable TSR.  I will first highlight our strong and durable financial performance and the free cash flows that enables us to make the critically important organic investments that we have been discussing with you. These investments will allow us to build on our strong growth platform and strengthen our advantage. I will also highlight how we plan to return excess cash to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. And then finally, I will reinforce our commitment to a healthy and resilient balance sheet with investment-grade credit rating.  We believe the shift in consumer interest and behavior caused by the COVID pandemic has created a sustainable tailwind for Tractor Supply, as shown by the red line on this graph. How long that lasts, we don't know. Nobody has a crystal ball to really indicate when normalcy will return. While the exact dates are uncertain, we view the revenue performance in 3 phases: first, the COVID pandemic phase and then a 1-year post-COVID period and then an extended normalized post-COVID period being beyond 1 year.  The one year post-COVID period represents the period of time for us to comp the current exceptional and unprecedented performance. The 12 months following the end of the pandemic will come with some level of uncertainty in our comp performance, as it will for most retailers. We do expect our comp revenue to be on a different and stronger trajectory post COVID as a result of our strategic investments, as this slide illustrates.  As you see in the pre-COVID time period, we had a healthy trajectory line that was 2.5% to 3% comps. Soon after COVID began significantly impacting us here in the U.S., we saw a major step-up change in our comps. With the step-up in growth we have seen during this pandemic and given the important organic investments and broader macro trends that are favorable to Life Out Here, our goal is to sustain the stepped-up sales growth and to achieve an even stronger growth trend line than pre pandemic the year after we see the environment return to normalcy. And that's shown by the steeper slope in the blue dash line relative to the pre-COVID trajectory.  When we reach the normalized post-COVID period, the main improvement we expect to see is on comp sales, where our key strategic initiatives should be meaningfully accretive to our financial profile. Specifically, we're targeting a sales comp in the 4% to 5% range and total net sales in the 6% to 7% range. We expect to remain consistent in our number of store openings in comparison to pre-COVID period. With the step-up in the base revenue, the new stores contribute less to the overall sales growth than the pre-COVID period. And to remind you, we still have headroom to open another 600 locations.  Looking to margin. We believe that through our greater scale and improvements in efficiencies, we have the ability to deliver operating margin in the mid 9% range. This would lead us to attractive ongoing 8% to 10% EPS growth post normalization, all of that on a much higher base. We will also focus on strong free cash flow generation and maintaining a healthy balance sheet, all while not losing sight of our goal of delivering strong and sustainable TSR.  Our key initiatives are laser-like focus on improving store productivity leading to stronger comp growth. As you've heard today, we're very excited about side lot and the significant amount of outside selling space that we will use more productively, bringing in an entirely new range of seasonal live goods and adding speed and convenience our customers want with drive-through feed and drive-through curbside pickup.  With Project Fusion, we are remodeling stores to bring an even more productive and relevant offering to each community. The multiyear rollout of Side Lot and Project Fusion initiatives are expected to provide ongoing benefits in the years ahead as we move quickly and thoughtfully store-by-store with the goal of an extended period of 4% to 5% comp store revenue growth.  As you heard from Rob, continuing our ONETractor initiatives will help to increase our omnichannel conversion. Neighbor's Club program enhancements are well underway and the FAST program is rolled out, both expected to drive benefits starting in 2021.  One of our great strengths is strong free cash flow generation. We currently expect to generate approximately $3.5 billion in free cash flow over the next 5 years. We've always exercised strong financial discipline focusing on accretive investments to drive the top line, margin dollars and free cash flow. We are taking advantage of our current strong cash flow generation to make further investments for growth and investments to support our team. Our increased focus on technology and training tools to support and strengthen our team members will continue to drive legendary customer service as defined by our customers today. These investments, when coupled with our ongoing profit improvement initiatives and our working capital improvements, are expected to generate higher operating cash flow going forward versus pre COVID.  Our strong balance sheet and our investment-grade capital structure is a strength we can leverage further. As you may have seen, yesterday, both Moody's and S&P announced investment-grade ratings for Tractor Supply. This provides us additional levers in our capital structure to support growth investments. In addition, with this performance, our goal is to return to shareholders approximately $4 billion in total cash payouts through dividends and share repurchases through our strong free cash flow and excess cash on the balance sheet. Additionally, we will have the financial capacity to consider opportunistic tuck-in acquisitions. We will continue to practice strong financial discipline, always with the goal of delivering strong and sustainable TSR to our shareholders.  This chart puts some dollars to what we just talked about. As you see in this cash flow waterfall, our operating cash flow target over this period is approximately $6 billion. Our capital expenditures are expected to be a total of $2.5 billion over the next five years, reflecting approximately $1 billion in incremental growth CapEx to strengthen our advantage. This increased level of spend is critical to continuing to gain market share. And because of our strong operating model, we expect to be in a position to return, through the combination of dividends and share repurchases, approximately $4 billion to shareholders during this time.  As I indicated earlier, our priority will be investing for growth, doubling our organic investments to include significant growth spend. We anticipate growing our dividend per share, returning to a 30% dividend payout on a higher and faster-growing EPS base. We plan to continue to be active in share repurchases to offset dilution effect of equity grants and to opportunistically repurchase with excess cash. We expect dividends and share repurchases to contribute 3% to 4% to our TSR delivery. While not a key priority, we are open to tuck-in acquisitions at the right price.  Historically, our leverage ratio has been approximately 2x. During COVID, we were able to maintain that ratio and we expect our leverage to remain at that level with the flexibility to use our strong balance sheet for incremental investment opportunities. And we're targeting to maintaining a leverage ratio below 2.5x. And we are positioned well to take advantage of our investment-grade rating and may look to refinance a portion of our debt when there is an attractive opportunity.  There has never been a more exciting time at Tractor Supply. We are incredibly proud of our heritage. There have been many key chapters in our amazing history. This is the beginning of a new chapter. Our solid foundation combined with shifts in the macro environment and our Life Out Here strategy provide us with significant growth opportunities. We are purposely aligning our business strategy and our financial strategy with the goal of delivering strong and sustainable total shareholder return.  With that, I will turn it back over to Mary Winn. Yes. Zach, this is Kurt. I'll take that question. In regards to our long-term target, we've been very specific in saying that this COVID pandemic, there's uncertainty as to how long it lasts and when does this 12-month of a cycling begin. And some of that may fall into 2021 and so there may be some noise on exactly the level of performance on a top line that would certainly impact it.  What you've heard from us on our initiatives are that we believe that this business has got strong sustainable growth. We can begin to not only achieve top level sales growth but sustain this level.  And then for 2021, the operating margin that we gave could have a little bit of variability in it. But a 9.0% to 9.5% in our long-term target is a really good sweet spot for us. We feel like the opportunity and our primary focus of gaining market share and being able to have a 9% to 9.5% operating margin range gives the most optimal overall earnings per share and value to our shareholders. And so our focus is on the long term in both top line revenue and that operating margin. I'll take it. I'll take it. Simeon, this is Kurt. In regards to the time frame, first, I'll just point out and remind that slide I gave on the trajectory. There's a lot of uncertainty, there's the COVID pandemic, then there's that 1-year cycling. In regards to the investments, there's more consistency in regards to our expectation as to when to -- the cadence of that investment. The impact on the timing, we're not going to try to go ahead and at this point try to peg over time. But what we are confident is that we can achieve with these investments, as Hal said, investing right now in a position of strength. We're making those investments now. We've got the cash to be able to do that and these investments will begin to provide that level of return.  The exciting thing about this is this level of EPS growth, the operating margin that we believe we can sustain through that is during this period of time where we're committing to and making a stepped-up investment in the business. That's exciting for the near term. It's really exciting for the long-term and the overall total shareholder return. Yes, Michael, this is Kurt. Thank you for the question. Just build on the -- I'll build on the last explanation I gave earlier. The important factor here is that we're making these investments. It's a significant step-up. These investments are for the long term. These investments are the opportunity to achieve greater market share, sustain the stepped-up growth. And when you make this level of investment, in stores in particular, the Side Lot and Fusion are investments in our leasehold assets. And so these stores have 5-, 7-, 10-year leases. There's a burden in that time frame that we've baked into the financials. And so we think it's a very compelling algorithm to be able to produce the same and stepped-up level of operating margin during this time of investment to be able to continue to grow this business.  As Hal mentioned, the last long-term targets that we set out back in 2018. If you think about the size of the business, say, $7.5 billion revenue business on a $4 EPS, we're certainly well beyond those numbers and be able to have the level of EPS growth while returning even greater shares -- greater cash to our shareholders, a commitment to a stronger level of dividend and a consistent share buyback. Overall, I'll just continue to emphasize, for the long term, our focus is total shareholder return. We think it's a very compelling -- much better compelling offer than a previous long-term targets. Yes. Thanks, John. And in regards to geography, the -- over a 3- to 5-year period of time, I'll stay rather directional and really hit 3 points. Starting with the gross margin, that is an area that we believe we have growth opportunity when you compare to the previous guide or the base year of 2019 for a number of the things that you heard today.  But just to hit a few key points on gross margin, we will continue to focus on our supply chain and our sourcing. There's opportunity to be able to take costs out of that part of the business as well as leveraging the scale that we've got and, from the fast program and from fusion and the productivity, does drive some performance in gross margin, so the opportunities in gross margin.  When it comes to the investments, to your point that you pointed out, the burden is principally in the -- from the depreciation from capital. So that's going to hit that SG&A area. And that is offset from very promising, strong, strategic initiatives on profit improvement. So we believe we can mostly offset the SG&A burden and we believe there's opportunity to achieve on the gross margin. All of that plays out to growing the operating margin modestly over this period of time. Yes. Well, I'll share a little bit of information. The -- we're not going to begin to give guidance or any indication on our 2021 plan, but we are beginning to and have been looking at and have multiple scenarios for 2021. We look at and watch closely all of the indications on how the COVID pandemic is playing out. And certainly, an important factor for us is when does this pandemic begin to bring a level of normalcy back to the consumer.  And vaccines and therapeutics are going to be key. And so I want to first say that the timing of when vaccines become available to the public, the therapeutic measurements improve, we believe, as most, that there's some level of normalcy that may return back to the consumer spending and the consumer behavior.  And it's very hard to tell when. As we try to plan, we plan that, that may be mid- to late 2021. And so in that environment, we feel strong about the first half of the year, the first quarter, certainly. And I think we're planning on and investing and being able to have a strong performance in the second quarter.  And then as I indicated, as the chart that I showed indicated as well, that whenever that 1-year period of time to comp, there's some variability in it. We may have some positive growth still, they may be flattish and there's potential for even some downside in those numbers. And so we plan that the first half of the year, there's still a lot of indications for the strength and demand in our business is based on all the macro social distancing and emphasis at home. And then at some point in time, that will begin to fade as there's a level of normalcy that returns. And I think at this point that giving you guys a structure of how we think about it is about the best I can do at this point before we give any 2021 guidance. Okay. Yes. Thanks, Oliver. So there's two questions in there, free cash flow over time and then buybacks. I'll hit on the free cash flow. Certainly, as a reminder, the timing of the pandemic can play, bid into it, but in general, we've planned for a rather consistent pattern on the free cash flow over time. The investments maybe shift between years as to when a distribution center is loaded, but $450 million to $550 million investments into the business over time with a very continued strong level of operating cash flow from this business, we believe it will be relatively consistent throughout the period of time. And we think that's a really strong, compelling part of our business.  It then leaves us the ability to be able to return cash to our shareholders. And that a really purposeful, important part of the Life Out Here strategy for us is the capital allocation. And our first priority, as we've mentioned, is investing organically in the business with all the things that we've just been talking about. But it is exciting that in that period of time, we estimate or targeting returning $4 billion to our shareholders.  The dividends are an important piece of our model. We're targeting to be able to get back to a 30% payout ratio, so there's some strong allocation to dividend. But on the buybacks, we've said in the beginning of the pandemic, we were temporarily pausing that and we did. And it was purposely a planned temporary pause. We do see that as we come out over the last couple of quarters, the business is strong, that share buybacks, as I indicated, are a plan in our capital allocation. So in the next couple of weeks, we'll be talking with our Board about our plans to reengage on the share repurchases and we'll have more information in the near term as to the timing of that. Do you want to take it? Yes. Scott, this is Kurt. In the side lot, I think the important thing to remember is that the side lot today, you've walked it, it's productive. It has a portion of it that you'd view as storage for that large, bulky agricultural-type equipment. And so some of that product outside, is inside other areas, we don't get specific to the productivity of the side lot pre or post on this initiative in there. What we see is a great opportunity for that product itself to be able to sell at or at a greater pace in the modified reduced space for the ag equipment and then reallocate that space to create that environment that's a shopping -- an actual pleasant shopping experience, a convenient shopping experience, leverage it even for the drive-through aspect of the business to capitalize on convenience.  And so it's -- one, it's very early, so it's hard for us to go and say here's what it would -- the productivity is going to be like. But it's also more of a holistic store productivity view for us. And that's how we encourage you to look at it as the convenience that it drives and the new categories that Seth talked about. And what you see in our projections of the stepped-up comps in a normal post-COVID is a primary indicator as you work the number of stores that we roll this out, you can see the level between fusion and side lot and what that's going to be doing to drive productivity in our existing space today.  And we will certainly have more opportunity to share as these first rounds of stores really begin over the next 6, 9 months to show us some true trends in that business. But you certainly can see the excitement of what it does holistically for the store. Yes. Brad, that's good question. And so let me give you some of the directional information as you think about 2021. In regards to COVID, very similar to how it's framed up, how we're looking at 2021, potentially, you would anticipate, we anticipate that the expenses that we've incurred in COVID would continue but yet would likely fade as you move out of a COVID pandemic into a bit of normalcy.  On the COVID expenses, the vast majority of that is labor and supplies focused on safety, cleaning, sanitation, as John talked about. And then there's -- the lesser extent would be medical and sick-related costs and contact tracing, case management. And so you can see how as we transition out of a COVID pandemic, that those costs could dissipate in there as well.  Yes, the permanent wage benefits, we would model that into 2021. On the strategic growth initiatives, the strategy that we just laid out, the primary cost would be in the capital spend and would start to introduce into the depreciation. On the strategic initiatives that we're pointing out today, like in third quarter and even in fourth quarter, the most significant factor was the rollout of the FAST Program, which we said we would do hiring, training, all of that and we would incur that initial burden of the ramp-up of it. And some of that incurs and it's a primary factor in fourth quarter as well.  Third quarter was the next largest piece of the strategic growth initiatives we're advertising. And as Hal mentioned, that's something we may flex in or out as we anticipate. So as we talk about strategic growth initiatives in Q3 and Q4, those are something specific to the back half of the year. And going forward, it's more specific items to these strategic initiatives and may not be at those same levels and likely to be, on a quarterly basis, a level that's lesser than the $12 million to $15 million on a per-quarter basis in 2021. Yes. I mean certainly, incentive compensation, as you model that out, I mean, with the performance in 2021, there's record-level performance and super excited to be able to provide our team members a record level of incentive compensation. And we've talked often, the frontline team members, those in the stores, distribution centers, getting a real strong portion of that incentive compensation. But as we lap that next year, the way that our incentive plans are built, that's actually a leverage point for us in 2021. Okay. Yes, Seth, I think I heard two questions in there. One was a little bit of guidance and I'll stay very directional on 2021 and the flow-through. And then there was a gross margin question on Q4 and maybe a little bit on 2021. Directionally, I would guide towards staying somewhat consistent on the flow-through in 2021 principally because what you've seen and what we've seen in this environment today, with the step-up of demand that the COVID pandemic creates for all the things we talked about, the cost of doing business is also elevated. And as the demand for the product may shift as you move out of a peak COVID, so does some of the expenses that goes with it. So I'd stay somewhere in the range that you've seen in 2020, albeit 2020 is going to have a high level of flow-through. And we'll give more guidance on that on our fourth quarter call.  In regards to gross -- in the gross margin, there are some specific things as I called out the fourth quarter. And so the past 2 quarters had tremendous gross margin growth year-over-year on the rate. And fourth quarter last year, we began to see some of our benefits play out and we had our strongest gross margin performance and we'll cycle that. And there are some things that are transitory to the fourth quarter specific to it.  How long some of the newer pressures in the transportation business sticks may impact 2021. And then particularly to the fourth quarter, as I pointed out, that's typically just generally a more promotional-type environment with the holiday season. So we anticipate some of the benefit of less promotional in Q2, Q3 puts pressure on the fourth quarter to be able to maintain that.  Looking out to 2021, I would just emphasize we will continue to focus on everyday low pricing benefit there and not necessarily going back to a heavier promotional. So we do anticipate focusing on maintaining as much of the gross margin rate benefit that we've seen of late go forward."

            "name": "John Ordus",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn. It's great to talk to you all today about operating The Tractor Way. Before we talk about Tractor Way, I'm going to talk to you about our opportunity. At Tractor Supply, we have a solid operating foundation in place across our more than 1,900 stores. At the same time, we believe there's an opportunity to increase labor productivity. Based on our industry benchmarking, we know we have room to grow to be best-in-class on customer-facing sales-driving initiatives. Our teams have made progress over the last couple of years with a nearly 400 basis point improvement in customer service by adding workforce planning, task management and the rollover of our Tractor Way program. There is still a lot more that we can do to help drive efficiency in our operating processes and structure to free up hours to focus on customer service.  We are going to continue to reinvest in labor efficiencies and the customer experience. We are also going to continue to invest in new stores with a target of 75 to 80 new stores a year, drive productivity of our existing stores, take task work out of our stores and use technology-like initiatives like in-store communication, labor management, interfaces that give team members actionable information and capabilities and optimizing payroll by store.  The foundation of our strategic pillar, operate The Tractor Way, is The Tractor Way program we first launched chain-wide in 2019 as a way to make our freight and recovery process more efficient and reinvest the hours from operational efficiency into customer experience. Our initial program focused on our most time-intensive and high-customer impact processes, things like freight, recovery, daily maintenance, zero-outs and feed the floor. The focus was to drive value to the customers through more time for customer service, improved in-stock position and a recovered store that is easy to shop.  To provide more time for customer service, we drove efficiency in our key processes through designated roles like our assistant manager is now our freight team leader; smart process design that removed wasted steps; we invested in new cards, totes and scanners; and clear finish-line goals and schedules to motivate the team to make sure all stores are following the same process. We have excellent training support and a process built to support all stores and account for normal retail disruptions.  With this foundation, we have built some strong muscle in the world of productivity. I have never seen the field take on a program and execute like they did with The Tractor Way program. They love this program. The outcome of the process improvements allowed us to roll out the GURA sales leader in all stores. I'll talk more about this position in just a minute, but the key point is the position works. Our racetrack in stores engage with every customer. We have the best team members. We hire our customers and they love to talk about our products because they live that Out Here lifestyle.  We're a relationship retailer. Our customers have responded to the changes we made with The Tractor Way initiatives. We measure customer experience in our stores by GURA scores. GURA stands for greet, uncover, recommend and ask. And we also measure overall satisfaction. Our customers score our stores at Tractor Supply. That is who we want to hear from, that is who should score our stores. Even though we are already top box on both metrics, as you can see, we improved our already high scores. This chart highlights the strong improvements in availability of assistance and product availability. Adding the GURA sales leader in every store helps us engage with the customer faster. And as you can see, availability of assistance has increased 250 basis points.  After seeing the success with freight recovery, the most labor-intensive activity in our stores, we are now applying The Tractor Way to other areas of the store. Our field activity support teams are another example of applying The Tractor Way philosophy to remove task work from the stores and make that work more efficient for the teams that are doing it. By removing this highly variable work from those stores and giving it to a specialized team, we have again provided more time for our store team members to execute GURA.  The purpose of FAST is to support the stores in creating the legendary in-store experience for our customers through best-in-class merchandising execution. FAST does this through consistency, speed to market, quality, accountability and flexibility. We launched FAST company-wide on September 2020. Let's take a look at our FAST team member setting an end-cap. As you can see, the FAST team member uses the tools we have, provided to be efficient and safe footsteps. When they are finished, the planogram is completely set and the store manager signs off.  Feedback from the stores has been great so far. I was in the store just right after the leather boots set and the FAST team did it faster and more accurately than in years past. The store teams are giving very positive feedback. In the first 4 weeks of the program, we have seen a significant year-over-year improvement in planograms. This leads to higher sales and much better shopping experience. We now are executing planograms at over 95% compliance, which is 40-plus percent better than last year. This is an industry-leading best practice that we will continue to leverage.  With the launch of FAST in 2020, we have built cross-functional alignment and support. We are already seeing the benefits of the FAST team and how we are going to be able to complete more resets on time with a higher level of execution, bringing benefit to our customers, our store teams and our vendors. We believe FAST can do even more to benefit our customers and our stores as the program matures and the teams gain even more speed and efficiency. Some examples are assembly, top stock, recovery, promotions, physical inventories and a whole lot more. And we'll continue to evolve the FAST capabilities over time.  Now let's talk about GURA. The Tractor Way is driven by the commitment to provide a legendary customer experience for our customers. We do that by executing GURA. GURA is the foundation of our customer experience.  Greet. Team member welcomes the customer upon entering the store, shares their name and ask an open-ended question about their trip. Uncover. A team member uncovers the customers' needs by building a relationship and asking further questions. Recommend. Team member leverages understanding of customer needs and resources available to them. They use things like the stockyard to make sure that we can provide the proper recommendations and ensure that the customer has everything they need to complete their entire project. This is where our team members really stand out as they live that Out Here lifestyle and have deep experience. And ask. Team members have several techniques for closing out the sale.  To see the most value from The Tractor Way, we created the GURA sales leader. The GURA sales leader is the air traffic controller of the store. They are responsible for ensuring every customer experience is GURA and for motivating and coaching team members throughout the store. We cover all open hours with a GURA sales leader in every store. Each GURA sales leader has a shift goal and they're responsible for communicating that goal to the entire team. This allows the day to be broken down into smaller segments and creates competition to beat the goal each shift. That GURA sales leader is connected to the entire team with heads-up and hands-free communication through our in-store communication device. This improves the GURA sales leader's ability to increase the speed of service and be way more efficient. Every team member in the store is equipped with a voice-activated, hands-free device that has effectively served as an intelligent assistant to allow for instant communication and information for the customers' needs. We are continuing to provide enhanced training to equip our GURA sales leaders and our team members to be able to provide an even better customer experience.  In our stores, we live out the mission of Tractor Supply every single day. Our mission is to work hard, have fun and make money by providing legendary service and great products at everyday low prices. Our mission doesn't say good service or okay service, it says legendary service. Our teams talking about legendary service and being that dependable supplier all the time.  To live up to legendary and to have fun, we developed the Hi Five program. This program supports GURA by nurturing our selling culture and providing opportunities for store team members to have some friendly competition in their stores and with their stores in their district. Hi Five is all about selling. 5 selling priorities give the team members some more specifics about add-on selling, which is part of recommend and ask in GURA.  As you can see, our team is really excited about this program. We focus on categories like pet, bird, equine, chicken and seasonally relevant categories. Team members are trained on what makes great add-on sales for them in these categories. This ensures our customers have everything they need and helps the store reach their sales bonus. Hi Five also focuses on additional programs we have to offer the customer, like our Power Plus Protection Plan, Neighbor's Club and our private label credit card. All of these areas are at all-time highs in our company.  We have seen strong success from the Hi Five program and the store team members. This program has been in place for about 2.5 years now. It's always energizing when our teams share their customer success stories when I'm out and in the field visiting stores. I also get hundreds of success stories a month on team members taking care of customers. We hear it from our customers and our team members. This year so far, our great team members have had 743,000 positive comments or 72% of all comments from our customers. 118,000 of these positive comments mentioned a team member by name. This is GURA. That is legendary service.  To wrap up, let me on with some key points. At Tractor Supply, we have an incredible strong foundation through our stores and our committed passionate team members who are proud to serve our customers. Our customer service is key to retaining the new customers that shop with Tractor Supply over the past 7 months. We believe that we have significant opportunity to reinvest efficiencies from our labor productivity into our customer experience to drive more sales. Our field activity support teams will allow us to enhance the quality of the in-store experience for our customers, all while driving more productivity. Through new technology and new applications, we can close the gap in customer-facing hours in store with best-in-class retailers to drive more sales.  A differentiator for Tractor Supply is our culture. It is clear competitive advantage to making Tractor Supply a great place to work and a great place to shop. I've been with Tractor Supply for around 22 years now and I'm incredibly passionate about our team members and our customers. As a relationship retailer, the magic happens when our team member engages with our customer. I love seeing our stores and I think you will, too. Thank you all for your time. Sure. Michael, so what we've done is we put together a store productivity team a couple of years ago. And what that team has done is they continue to look at how we can make things more efficient inside the store. We're doing that, we're able to make sure that we have hours out in the side lot for all open hours of store. So we have people out there to do both the feed floor, the curbside, make sure the propane is taken care of and then also to make sure we have that greenhouse staff outside there. So as we continue to look at more efficiency inside the store, we can continue to make sure that we take hours, reinvest it in customer service and continue with those all-time customer service -- all-time high customer service scores we have. Yes. So since COVID started, we've really spent a lot of time on cleanliness inside of our stores. We wanted -- we saw it coming. We wanted to make sure we saw some benchmarking out there as well. And what we've done is we've invested in that. We've invested in making sure that we're cleaning top to bottom throughout our stores all the time throughout Monday through Friday and then Saturday and Sunday, on the weekends, when our customers are in our stores. We want to make sure we had a clean environment for them. Bathrooms, everything throughout the store are cleaned. And we've seen that we're over-indexing now compared to other retailers as far as where we're at on cleaning.  As far as customer experience goes, I talked a little bit about it earlier today, just customer experience, that high five, the GURA, we rolled out fast. It allowed us to take some of our people that we've hired that are more task-driven and moved them over into a task-driven environment.  Now the other team members that we have inside of our stores, what they do is they love to sell. They live that lifestyle. They love talking about that lifestyle. We hire for attitude. We hire farmers, welders, ranchers, horse owners. And then they're inside the store and they're doing what they really love, that GURA selling skills that are out there in our stores.  We're also investing in training of them. What that's driven us throughout this year is our GURA scores are up about 90 basis points over where they were last year. Over the last 4 years, they're up about 700 basis points. And then overall satisfaction scores continue to go up as well."

Before we address our results for the second quarter, I thought I'd just step back, take a moment, acknowledge the environment in the United States right now. There's no doubt we're in a generational moment. Before the quarter began and for the entirety of this quarter, we've continued to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and really all that's come along with it. And then towards the end of the quarter, we've seen widespread protests focused on racial inequality in America. We're a purpose-driven company at Tractor Supply through all these times. We've stepped back and led with our values, and I'm incredibly proud of that. Been so impressed and inspired how our team has come together and responded. And in all situations and across all functions, the team has moved with speed and focus to address this dynamic environment while also executing and delivering on record-breaking sales. Start off by just talking about team member, health and safety. We've taken extensive and proactive measures in this area. Masks are required for all team members and customers in all stores. Each day, all of our team members take their temperature and go through a symptom screening before coming to work. We are in the process of implementing biweekly testing for over 500 team members who travel, and we will be conducting sample testing within all our DCs to stay on top of that robust large population. Additionally, we've arranged for robust case management to conduct contact tracing and provide health care support for all team members who are impacted by COVID-19. And also, I thought I'd add, where there -- in areas where there's been widespread community outbreaks, such as in Waco, Texas and Costa Grande, Arizona, where we have distribution centers, in those areas over the last 6 weeks independently each, we sent in rapid response teams to conduct facility wide testing in concert with contact tracing and case management. In summary, just want to reinforce how committed we are at Tractor Supply to being a safe place to work and shop and how committed we are to implementing industry-leading best practices across all parameters of safety. We're also committed to advancing a diverse and inclusive culture, built on our core value of respect. To promote social progress, we invested in a dedicated time of reflection for all 38,000 team members to discuss the importance of diversity and inclusion in our company. We did this team by team by team. Additionally, over the last few weeks, we published our first ESG report. We hired a Director of Diversity and Inclusion, and we donated to cause of the supporting quality and strength in our local communities, and you can expect many more actions from us on the diversity inclusion front moving forward. Now turning to the results of the quarter. We experienced unprecedented sales. Notably, they were strong the entire quarter, all 3 months. We had consistent, elevated levels of sales each week, and we had record growth across all channels, product categories and geographic regions. Kind of turning to the numbers. Net sales grew approximately 35% with comparable store sales plus 30.5%, driven by a comparable transaction count increase of 14.6% and a comparable average ticket increase of 15.8%. Diluted earnings per share grew 61% to $2.90. And e-commerce saw significant growth, strong triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we did in the quarter to improve our e-commerce capabilities has certainly resonated with our customers. Kurt will walk you through greater details on the quarter and our outlook and walk you through some more numbers here in a moment when I turn it over to him. But I thought now what I'd do is shift to some operational highlights.  During the second quarter, we announced several strategic investments in our team members who are at the heart of our relationship with our customers. Early responses to the pandemic included paid sick leave and expanded benefits and appreciation bonuses. Totaling -- the benefits and appreciation bonuses totaled $35 million in Q2. And then as we progressed through the quarter, it became clear that we were moving to a new normal, really operating for the foreseeable future with COVID-19, and I'll talk more about that later. And so consequently, we made the decision to permanently enhance our compensation and benefits, including wage increases across all of our stores and distribution centers of a minimum $1 per hour for all hourly team members. In addition to the wage increases, more than 2,000 frontline managers at our stores and distribution centers are now receiving annual restricted stock units with the goal of helping fuel their entrepreneurial spirit and allowing them to benefit in the company's long-term success. We also took the opportunity to ensure we're supporting the health and wellness of our team members. And what we did was we chose to offer health care and benefits to our part-time team members. We are committed to investing in our team members as we believe they are a key competitive differentiator with our customers. Operating in elevated comps for 13 weeks presents a number of challenges. During the second quarter, we added over 5,000 net new team members, primarily across our stores and distribution centers. These team members were critical in our ability to service our customers at these elevated volumes. Also, to facilitate our distribution network's capacity, we opened a new mixing center in Florida. And also, we work closely with our vendor partners. They've been key contributors to our success and supported our supply chain with speed and nimbleness. We'd like to express our sincere appreciation for their collaboration and support of our mutual customers. Our focus remains on working together to ensure we remain in stock for merchandising categories that make us the dependable supplier for products that our customers need to support their lifestyle. During the quarter, we rolled out curbside pickup, same day, next-day delivery, relaunched our website. And in early July, we rolled out our new mobile app. And we've seen acceleration in adoption rates of technology initiatives with multiple years of consumer adoption being compressed into 10 or 12 weeks' time. Our e-commerce results were impressive with triple-digit growth increases. And this triple-digit growth increase included buy online and pickup in-store orders. This sharp acceleration in consumer shopping preferences is becoming ingrained in our customers' behaviors. And we're fostering this relationship in a digital way through frequent communications, whether it's digital marketing or in e-mail, and we're accelerating our focus on the transformation of our digital platforms and services. We have an opportunity to create deeper customer relationships of scale, and we're laser-focused on that opportunity. Speaking of customers, during the quarter, another investment we made was in our brand-building initiatives. Given the current dynamic, we capitalized on the opportunity to shift our marketing spend, which had been traditionally print media, to more digital and national TV. And notably, we launched our first national advertising campaign in over a decade. We launched the initial campaign in March during the early weeks of the COVID pandemic. And the campaign has continued to evolve. And what we're working on is matching the country's mood and the cycle of the pandemic, and we've done 5 different commercials in the last 4 months. Our most recent TV ad has been focused on reinforcing Tractor Supply as a safe and convenient place to shop for all you need for your summer out here. Our research indicates that our unaided brand awareness and Tractor Supply being in the consideration set for shopping trips are both increasing. More importantly, we had our customers shop -- we had more customers shop with us than ever before as we experienced robust growth in our customer base with increased sales across existing customers, new customers and re-acquired customers. And so what I thought I'd do is to share with you 5 kind of key observations of our customer behaviors based on the market data and research that we have. So the first observation I'll mention is we're growing trips and our customers are spending -- and our existing customers are spending more with us. Our core customers, our existing customers are shopping more frequently and their baskets are larger as we benefit from their trip consolidation. And these customers are shopping more categories from us than they ever have before. And we've finished the quarter with close to 17 million Neighbor's Club members.  The second observation I'll share is that we're gaining new customers at the fastest rate in the history of the company. For the second quarter, we saw 3.3 million identifiable new customers, and that represents almost over a 14% year-over-year increase.  The third observation is that we're reengaging our lapsed customers, and they're returning to shop with us at a higher rate than ever before. For the quarter, we reactivated almost 2 million customers, which was an increase of 42% year-over-year.  The fourth observation that I'll share is that the new customers we're acquiring as compared to our core customers, they're skewing younger, higher income and closer to 50% female, which is an increase of 10 percentage points compared to our historical trends of 60% male.  And the fifth and last observation that I'll share is that the new customers are becoming repeat customers at the fastest rate ever. This is at a time when our overall customer satisfaction scores are at an all-time high. We believe key aspects to our customer service such as being a convenient place to shop, a tailored lifestyle-oriented product category, our legendary customer service and our strong in-stock levels are important to keep these new customers engaged with our brands. That's what's attracting them to us. Notably, purchasing patterns for our new and reengaged customers are very similar to our existing customer behaviors and product category engagement.  Looking ahead, we know our opportunity is to capitalize on these trends and to nurture these customers and to gain market share. And we have strong plans in place to retain these customers with marketing and product offerings, continuation of our national advertising campaign, but robust digital onboarding CRM tool kits are being executed. Taking a step back from our Q2 results and actions, I want to share broadly what we're seeing from a macro perspective. Key trends we're seeing that are working to our favor include rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, self-reliant lifestyle movement, including DIY trends; consumer spending shifting from travel and entertainment that kind of trapped spend is now being spent on home and land; and of course, pet adoptions, they're at an all-time high.  In addition, we believe our business benefited from the government stimulus and activity that helped bolster the economy. And while we're not planning for this government stimulus activity to continue, many of the other trends I mentioned, such as pet adoption and trip consolidation and rural revitalization, we definitely expect those to continue and to be prevalent with our customers over the next few quarters. Speaking of that, as we look ahead, we believe many of these consumer behaviors that we saw over the last 3 or 4 months are going to continue in the second half, but there's going to be some nuances and some differences. For instance, we expect -- we definitely expect consumers to still be [indiscernible] with their land and their homes. It is their safe oasis. But the things that they will do will be different. As an example, in the spring, customers were buying lawnmowers and kayaks and working in their yard on their fencing and their gates. And we think in the fall, some of that will continue, but instead of lawnmowers and kayaks, they're going to shift to buying things like patio heaters and firewood and fire pits, but they're still going to be working on their land and on their homes. They're also going to continue to do things that are more outdoor related, but are fall and winter oriented, such as things like raking leaves and winterizing their gardens. Overall, we believe there will be a higher level of category participation in the fall and the winter categories, just like there was in the spring, it's just going to be different, and it will be higher than it's been in the past, and we believe that's going to continue into the second half. Now looking at even further, while we can't predict the future and there is a significant amount of uncertainty, our team is operating under the premise that we will still be dealing with the pandemic in the first half of next year. We're buying to that assumption, and we're orienting our planning around that assumption. Over the past few months, we have navigated unprecedented conditions. We believe that our purposeful actions will allow us to emerge from it stronger and better than ever before. We have an opportunity to create and define our future and extend our leadership for years to come.  And with that, I'll turn now the call over to Kurt to review the quarter in more depth and our outlook before I come back to give some insights on our strategic growth initiatives and other drivers of Q3.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Before discussing our second quarter results, I'd like to recognize and thank our incredible team. I have personally been inspired watching everyone come together to face the current environment, embrace new ways of working and decisively taking actions to serve our team and our customers in the face of unprecedented conditions.  With more than 20 years with Tractor Supply, I could not be prouder to be a part of this team. This quarter was certainly exceptional and like no other in the history of Tractor Supply. The second quarter benefited from the macro trends Hal shared with you. While at the same time, we had a great spring. The weather was ideal across the country with favorable temperatures breaking early in the spring and consistent moisture, providing a sustained spring/summer season. As we rank order our comparable store sales performance, the largest driver was our customers' desire for product categories that supported their Out Here lifestyle, as they shifted from other interests like travel, entertainment and dining. From home studying, land maintenance and fencing, backyard living and caring for their animals and pets, our customers have clearly made the care and improvement in their homes and land a priority. This is also inclusive of living a more self-reliant lifestyle and adopting new hobbies like backyard poultry, gardening and bird feeding.  Now we believe brand awareness and the new customer performance that Hal discussed was the second largest driver of our comparable store sales performance. This was followed by tailwinds such as the favorable spring/summer weather that I mentioned earlier and the benefits from being an essential business that remained open during the early part of the quarter. Underlying these primary drivers, the government stimulus checks likely increase spending across the board in all categories. Now another way to look at this quarter's comparable store sales growth is to break down the comp between transitory factors, such as government stimulus checks and COVID-19-related sales as compared to sustainable, more structural tailwinds like trip consolidation, the increase in new customers and re-engaged customers, the rural revitalization trends and the growth in companion animal ownership. While it is difficult to estimate the impact from each of these drivers, we believe that nearly half of the Q2 comparable store sales growth can be attributed to structural tailwinds, giving us a sustainable opportunity for growth. I'll wrap up my discussion on sales with a few other performance highlights. First, we had robust performance in our big ticket categories, which was generally in line with our overall comp sales growth. This was driven by strength in mowers, trailers, safes, pressure washers and 3-point equipment. Second, our CUE products, consumable, usable and edible, which is a representation of our strength of our core business, had solid mid-teens comp sales growth. And lastly, commodity inflation was essentially flat for the quarter. Moving on to gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 36.4% in the second quarter, an increase of 155 basis points. This increase was driven principally by a reduction in the frequency and depth of promotion as a result of strong demand for our product categories. We also benefited from favorable product mix, along with the lower transportation costs as a percentage of net sales. SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales, was 22.3%, a decrease of 33 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to significant leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs for the strong increase in comparable store sales. The leverage was achieved -- the leverage achieved -- we achieved in these SG&A categories was partially offset by incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased store labor hours to support the significant increase in sales volume and increased incentive compensation given our strong performance in the quarter. We incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19 pandemic of approximately $55 million, including the appreciation wages for team members, PP&E supplies and incremental store labor hours dedicated to managing social distancing in the stores as well as cleaning and sanitation. Operating profit increased nearly 56% with operating profit margin of 14.1%, an improvement of 188 basis points. Net income was $338.7 million, an increase of 55%. Diluted earnings per share was $2.90, an increase of 61%. Turning now to our balance sheet which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $1.69 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing an 8.4% decline in average inventory per store. The reduction in average inventory per store principally reflects the robust sales trends and the solid increase in inventory turns during the quarter. Our supply chain and our vendors are executing at a very high level to meet the customers' current demands. We finished the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $500 million revolver. Moving now to our guidance for the third quarter. To date, we continue to see the strong sales momentum in the business. We expect this momentum to continue, albeit at a lower level than the second quarter, as we forecast delivering strong sales and profitability for the third quarter. While we typically don't provide a unique situation due to COVID-19, we are providing our view on the third quarter. Given the level of uncertainty, it is difficult to provide guidance beyond Q3 right now. Factors contributing to a heightened level of uncertainty include the duration and impact of shelter-in-place restrictions and social distancing measures, the tapering of government stimulus benefits, elevated unemployment levels and even the November elections. With this backdrop, we would anticipate the strength in our comparable store sales trends to moderate as we move through Q3. Overall, we feel very good at about our business leading up to the November election cycle. But as we all recognize, it just creates a significant level of uncertainty for the consumer. For the third quarter, we expect net sales growth of approximately 16% to 22% and comp sales growth in the range of 12% to 18%. Net income is forecast to be in the range of $136 million to $162 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.35.  Two factors to consider that are impacting our outlook for the third quarter include COVID-19-related costs of approximately $15 million to $20 million to ensure the health and safety of our team members and our customers and $15 million for the prioritization of our strategic growth initiatives. And please keep in mind, as we previously disclosed, our move to permanent wage and benefit changes will cost approximately $13 million this quarter as well. We are raising our capital spending outlook to support our strategic growth initiatives that Hal will discuss momentarily. Our previous estimate was $225 million to $275 million. For 2020, we now anticipate capital spending in a range of $300 million to $325 million. Vast majority of the capital spending increase is attributable to new in-store initiatives and supporting technology. Looking beyond the third quarter, we anticipate fourth quarter comp sales performance to be above our original expectations when we enter the year. As mentioned earlier, we expect the current trends to moderate throughout Q3, and we believe that moderation will continue into fourth quarter as our outdoor seasonal sales become a lower concentration of our business and we get back to a higher mix of CUE products. Additionally, we are planning for a more moderate holiday season than normal, but with stronger online growth. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage our capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing in initiatives for long-term growth. We are taking actions to capitalize on the opportunity to capture and sustain a greater share of the market. Year-to-date, we have generated a significant increase in cash from operations. As Hal will discuss in a moment, we are reinvesting a meaningful portion of this incremental cash flow into our business with the strategic goal of emerging from this crisis stronger than before. The team at Tractor Supply is excited about how we will continue to be an innovative leader in our channel. Now I'll turn it back to Hal.\nHarry Lawton: Thanks, Kurt. Let's look ahead. Look, as we think about our business, we have a unique opportunity to capitalize on the powerful customer trends that we're benefiting from now and to retain the record number of new and reengaged customers we're seeing. And our goal is to capitalize on our ability to drive sales and higher productivity. Our financial strength allows us to stay focused on the long term, creating an even greater competitive advantage as we're investing to fuel long-term growth. We continue to operate from a position of strength. And we're laying the groundwork for the future. And so today, we're excited to introduce 2 new strategic initiatives that are being implemented across all stores within the company. The first is the build-out of our field activity support team, and that's focused on improving the productivity of in-store execution. And the second is the expansion of several technology and service enhancements to capitalize on consumer expectations. Turning to the field activity support team. This initiative is designed to improve our merchandising activities in store, which represents the second largest body of work for our team members. This initiative builds on the successful rollout last year of The Tractor Way program, which addressed the largest area of work in our stores, the receiving and stocking of merchandise.  And kind of stepping back, more broadly, our goal is to improve the productivity of our store payroll. And we want to shift hours away from tasking to customer-facing and keep finding ways to be as efficient as possible in what we do in tasking, so that way we can drive customer-facing hours. And this is a very common retail approach. And so the work of the FAST team includes executing a merchandising programs like center court, End Caps, planogram resets, seasonal programs and sales driving initiatives. The FAST team, as mentioned, will allow the store teams to spend more time on customer service, help them improve their in-store execution and ultimately lead to higher comparable store sales. These teams are in the process of ramping up, and we're hiring more than 1,500 FAST team members with 1 FAST team per district. These teams will be in the stores starting in August, and the goal is for each FAST team to be in every store every week. And each team -- and the focus of the team will be to improve store-specific measures and address sales driving activity. Over time, we would anticipate that these teams will receive support from our vendor partners, which is common in the industry, as the work is directly related to the on-shelf execution of their product. And also the FAST team has the potential to help drive store-level efficiencies as the teams ramp up. This type of dedicated team is a proven strategy of cross-sectors of retail, in particular so -- and they've been proven to drive customer satisfaction rates and sales, and they'll allow the store teams to prioritize customer service and continue to drive productivity through your labor in the store to get very efficient on your tasking. Our second initiative is building on our technology and services capabilities. And this includes the rollout of contactless payment in the quarter, expansion of our in-store WiFi capabilities, enhanced ship-from-store online fulfillment and increased delivery capabilities. Within the last few weeks, we had a soft launch of our new mobile app that allows for greater customer convenience and integration with our Neighbor's Club. We will begin to communicate more about the app to our customers in the upcoming weeks. We know mobile access is important to our customers, and our new app makes shopping easier and more convenient.  In addition, we're expanding our ship-from-store capabilities. We're adding subscriptions at the point-of-sale in our stores and implementing contactless payments at the registers in our stores. Further, we're substantially increasing wireless access in our stores as we move from 2 access points in each store to 5 access points at each store. This is all tied to supporting contactless payments and our mobile point-of-sale hardware that we doubled the capacity of earlier this year. Our technology capabilities are becoming a strategic advantage for Tractor Supply. In addition to these 2 chain-wide activities, we are focused on driving our -- we're also focused on driving our space -- of driving space productivity across our stores. The first initiative that we'd like to talk about today is driving the productivity of our side lot. Typically, there's as much space outside of our stores in the side lot as we have inside the store. And the productivity of this space is substantially below the chain average. Our ability to drive higher sales per square foot through reworking of the side lot is in progress, and we're beginning some tests right now here in the third quarter.  In total, we'll do about 75 stores this year in terms of transformation of our side lots. And we have the ability to transform our side lot with expanded product offerings in select categories, enhancing the shopping experience of categories that are already out there. And it can be offered to -- it can be leveraged to offer a wider product assortment in select categories, enter new categories and also offer the convenience through the expansion of buy online, pick up in store and really what it will become is buy online, drive through for pickup. This transformation can help us continue to keep our customers engaged at Tractor Supply and take our customer experience to the next level. During the third quarter, we will also begin testing a new interior space productivity program for our mature stores. Project fusion is our state-of-the-art space productivity program designed to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base and give new customers that may not have shopped with us in the past more reasons to visit. Much like the FAST teams, space productivity programs of mature stores have proven -- have been proven across retail concepts to drive higher sales per square foot when deployed from a consumer's point of view. An active space productivity program is also important to protect the brand image of the Tractor Supply.  Similar to our side lot test, we anticipate completing about 75 fusion stores in 2020, and there will be some overlap between the 2 pilots. Given the size of our store base, both of these efforts are a multiyear opportunity to continue to refresh our store base, create new shopping categories for our customers and further drive comp sales. As we look ahead, we have a robust new product innovation pipeline. One key introduction is the addition of power tools from Makita, a brand known for their reputation for high-quality power tools. In companion animal, we have a significant reset of our dog food offerings occurring right now here in August. This reset will reallocate space for winning brands, along with exclusive and new brand introductions. This will also allow for the expansion of our exclusive line with Miranda Lambert's MuttNation On The Farm and the addition of the Victor dog food. Our customers have been asking us to carry the Victor brand for quite some time, and we're excited to add it to our dog food offering. We will be the first national retailer of Victor. Victor dog food launches -- is online available today with a limited SKU offering, and you can start to see the product, and it's currently rolling out in our stores right now. Across all parts of the store, we had exciting products for the fall and winter as we adapt to serving our customers in the current environment. Our stores will be ready for the change of seasons as we begin to move into fall.  On the marketing front, we're excited to announce our partnership with Turner Sports during the coverage of the upcoming restart of the NBA season. We will be very visible throughout the season with our Stronger Together ad campaign that launched on Tuesday. To wrap up, we're focused on our ability to improve the execution in our stores, enhance our legendary service and transform our stores to make them even more productive and more compelling to our customers. Product innovation and category expansions play a key role in driving our space productivity improvements.  Our technology enhancements and service offering expansions are reflective of the macro trends we're experiencing, and we believe this is a structural shift that will be going on for a long time. Despite the current operating backdrop in the U.S., we have confidence that our strategy and execution will allow us to continue to build a stronger Tractor Supply.  I and the rest of the team remain confident that Tractor Supply will emerge from the pandemic a stronger and larger company. My sincere appreciation goes out to each and every one of our more than 38,000 team members for their dedication to our mission and values. And with that, operator, we'd like to open -- we'd like to now open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs.\nKatharine McShane: My question is centered around inventory. Inventory was down per store, had a pretty strong flip versus your very, very strong comp. I know it's based on very strong demand. But how are you managing this? And how do you expect the inventory piece to evolve over the next couple of quarters?\nHarry Lawton: Kate, absolutely. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, operating at kind of 20%, 25%, 30% comps plus for 13-plus weeks puts some strains on the business that we've not seen historically and really proud of how the team worked through all those challenges to meet the needs of our customers. And inventory has certainly been one of those challenges. And we've taken a number of actions to lean into that in terms of increasing our visibility of forecast with our vendors, obviously increasing receipts and working very closely with them, and in a minute I will ask Seth to talk a little bit more about our vendor interactions. But what I'd say is we would like to have more inventory in our stores.  We would like our inventory levels to be -- in-stock levels to be higher right now. And we are working very closely with our vendors to do that. In many cases, we're selling product right when it comes off the back of a truck. As an example, we are I think the largest seller of stock tanks in the United States. We are selling close to $2,500 of those a week. Our manufacturer is able to make $3,000 a week. So as soon as we get a truck, they hit the floor or hit the outside in the side lot. And we've got will calls and our customers taking them immediately off the lot. And so, again, we wish we had more inventory. We're very focused on getting more in our stores. We're very focused on getting our in-stock levels, and we're working very closely with our vendors on that. And I'll turn it over to Seth to maybe just make a few more comments on that front.\nJonathan Estep: Thanks, Hal. Yes. Kate, so as Hal mentioned, obviously, it's our desire to get as much inventory as possible and one of the things that the merchant team has been doing each and every day is partnering with our supplier base and what I can tell you is that our suppliers are stepping up in ways in which how can we make sure that we can get each of the products that we sell today, but also looking for opportunity buys. And the team has been really nimble in looking at ways to reallocate space in our center court to product that's available when things are supporting the lifestyle that is out there whether that be around backyard and activity and home setting, things of that nature. So really pivoting to new items and new categories.  And as we've gone that route, one of the benefits that we've also had is strong sell throughs. So we have our each -- our replenished items that Hal talked about. But also when you look at our drive-out programs as well, we're sitting on about 30% less clearance inventory today than we have -- than we were this time last year, just based on the overall strength of the business. So it's a couple -- it's again a couple fold. Number one is that we want to make sure that we can have that product in stock to drive each and every day bids for your own programs. But then number two, we also have seen the benefit of strong sell throughs, which have benefited in less clearance inventory, which has allowed us to go after opportunity buys, which are driving some significant comps right now as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Keith from Piper Sandler.\nPeter Keith: Great results, and thanks for the thorough prepared remarks. Maybe a guidance question for Kurt. Given the solid gross margin that you guys posted in Q2, could you help us understand the potential continuation of some of these drivers with Q3 and what's guided via strong sales backdrop?\nKurt Barton: Yes. Certainly, Peter. This is Kurt. And in regards to gross margin and the continuation of that, I'll first start by reflecting back on Q2, where we saw several factors that were favorable and across the board very ideal, and we were able to capitalize on that. And our priority will always be to continue to gain market share while trying to balance good solid gross margin. So as we compare Q2 versus looking ahead, for Q3 and forward, we'll continue to stay focused on EDLP, which does support less promotions. As you just heard Seth mention, our inventory is in its cleanest shape. And so we anticipate some less offseason transition or clearance.  And then we did see some benefit in Q2 on transportation efficiencies. We think that will continue, but albeit at a more moderated level as we start to cycle some of the benefits in the [Technical Difficulty]. We anticipate strong gross margin performance year-over-year. The key drivers of product mix and promotional may not have as strong of a benefit in the second half, but we do continue to think that there's benefit from both of those and the opportunity we have with good, solid, clean inventory going into it. So you'll see from our guide that we anticipate momentum and continued year-over-year strong growth or performance in gross margin.\nPeter Keith: Okay. That's helpful, Kurt. And maybe another question just for Hal. The new customer acquisition numbers that you gave were quite impressive. Now that you're several months into what seems to be elevated acquisition, do you have any observations in recent months on the ability to retain the people that have come into the stores perhaps in March and April?\nHarry Lawton: Yes. So we're monitoring repeat purchase rates of all of our new customers and our reacquired customers. It's a regular muscle and analytical skills that we have set up. It was part of all the work the team did in Q1 of this year and into Q4 last year as we migrated the platform to Microsoft Azure, and we're able to leverage the analytical tool set that comes along with that. And what we are seeing is that we're continuing to see strong new customer counts, we're continuing to see strong reacquired customer counts and we're seeing them shop with us a second and third time at a higher rate than they have historically with us. And those trends have been very consistent from the early days of the pandemic up until now.  And as I mentioned, they've had a -- early on, there were probably slightly more rural. I'd say now it's -- or slightly more suburban. Now it's kind of moderating. It's kind of reasonably mix between suburban and rural. It does have a tendency to be a little more female, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And then online, whether it's direct ship sales or buy online, pickup in store with curbside pickup, does over penetrate some with those new customers. But they're giving us a strong customer satisfaction scores. And in their surveys, they're saying they intend to repeat shopping with us. And then in their actions, they are continuing to shop with us as well. And our aspiration is to invest significantly in digital and national marketing as well as specifically in the -- in our CRM toolkit to continue to engage those customers. And of course, that's one of the reasons we hired 5,000 new team members this quarter, net new team members, was to provide that legendary customer service that we're known for and ensuring that we can serve effectively the increased counts of customers we have in our stores.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Benedict from Baird.\nPeter Benedict: So two questions. First, just -- maybe just on the cadence. You mentioned pretty consistent top line across 2Q and that that's continued in 3Q. So as you're looking forward, you mentioned expecting some moderation, which makes sense. Just trying to understand maybe what your -- what level of moderation you're thinking about there? I mean, you said in 2Q, you thought maybe half of the comp was kind of sustainable structural stuff. Is that a good benchmark for us to think about how maybe you're planning the balance of 3Q? And then, obviously, with some more moderation in 4Q? That's my first question.\nKurt Barton: Yes. Peter, this is Kurt. Thanks for the question. In regards to the comp sales, I'll address the point you made on the second quarter first and then pivot from there to kind of help with the third quarter. We saw, while unprecedented volumes amazingly, consistent performance throughout the second quarter, all 3 months at a fairly strong elevated level. And even when we look at the 2-year stack month-to-month, just continue to show the consistency between April, May and June. And as I mentioned, the level of performance continues through July. We do anticipate that as with what we can see today and having a -- it's just volatile and uncertainty in there that the reasons I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we could anticipate seeing some moderation. And to your point earlier, I believe the strength of the core business is a good indicator of where we would see the third quarter and the last half of the third quarter potentially more falling in the range. So we're giving some prudent evaluation to some of the tailwinds that could have less benefit, causing us in the third quarter while starting off strong to really end in the range that we gave in our overall guidance.\nPeter Benedict: Okay. That's fair. And then just a question maybe for Hal or Seth. Just around the animal ownership trends, and you mentioned the dog adoption, but also I know the backyard poultry trend has been particularly robust. Maybe rank -- if you could rank order maybe the importance of those businesses within your overall animal business, you guys are serving equine, other large animals, so just so we can understand which are the most important categories. And then just what you're doing to kind of capitalize on that backyard poultry trend that's continuing to surge here?\nJonathan Estep: Peter, this is Seth. When you look at our overall pet and animal businesses and talking about rank order of the two, I would kind of look at each of those a little bit independently. So for us, we have a primary desire, obviously, to own the pet customer in the rural marketplace. And a lot of efforts are going in place, whether it be on our pet supplies resets and continue to make sure that we have the product there as we're seeing these record adoption rates. The pet supplies business just showed incredible strength in the quarter. And we're continuing to see that strength. Obviously, Hal mentioned the pet food reset that's coming up as we continue to go where kind of the customer is going and where those trends are. And so pet for us is something we want to make sure that we look at that, whether it be on the tractor side as well as with pet sense that we want to own that category, obviously, in the rural marketplace.  Animal is obviously the other category on its own. And with those, obviously, it's multi-species approach. You talked about backyard poultry, you talked about equine. And the merchant team really puts together independent strategies to really attack each of those areas of the merchant categories. And as we talk about localization and regionalization, the animal side is one of the areas that we see some of the most localized and regional differences at times so that we can go after these categories. So the team, our feed rack is actually done on a store-by-store basis relative to the local assortment. And we obviously want to go after these things, and we're continuing to go after sales here.  Backyard poultry is something that we have seen some really nice strength in. And just to put -- give an example of some of the nimbleness that has occurred throughout the year, our Chick Days, what we call Chick Days, which is one of our big center court events in the spring is typically about a 9-week event. That event actually has not ended. So as we've seen the strength and the momentum in that category. The team was able to be nimble, reallocate center court space. Most of our stores are continuing all of that. And we'll continue with that throughout the fall, as we want to make sure that not only we can capitalize on these trends, but also be that dependable supplier as we're seeing new customers come into the category as well as current customers adding to the flock.  So pet and animal, both, I would just say, are going to be 2 of the primary pillars as we look forward not only this year but for the years to come to drive comp and drive the overall business.\nMary Pilkington: This is Mary Winn. I am going to ask that everyone please keep to 1 question and 1 follow-up. We have a lot of people in the queue, and we'd like to be able to get to as many people as possible. So thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Hal, you've had a remarkable start to your 10-year at Tractor Supply, but you are setting yourself up for a tough act to follow next year. So with all these productive initiatives in place, significant amount of new customer acquisition and knowing what you know today, do you think Tractor Supply can comp positive in 2021?\nHarry Lawton: Great question. And I don't think I've got the crystal ball in front of me on that one. But what I can -- and I would acknowledge just the wide range of uncertainties over the next 18 to 24 months, but I'll reference -- I'll start by referencing what we talked about in our prepared remarks is that we're planning for the COVID-19 pandemic to be a significant factor in the United States and in consumer shopping behavior, at least through the middle of next year. And we're bind to that. We're building our assortment plans around that, and we're putting in place our operational plans to support that.  As we look beyond that, that's where we're -- that's why we're talking about growth initiatives today. We truly are focused on emerging as a stronger company than we entered this pandemic. And we're going to -- we're investing in things like our FAST team to make us more operationally efficient, we're investing in technology to make us easier to do business with, and importantly, we're looking at our format and our store and saying, how do we make it more productive. And for those of you that have followed our business for quite some time, it's been a while since we've gone on a strong space productivity improvement initiative inside of our stores. And we're very -- it's early days, but we like what we see in terms of the initial actions we're taking on the space productivity program, project fusion in our stores, and we're doing 75 of those this year. And then the side lot has always been a -- I think, by all accounts, a big opportunity for us. We've got anywhere between 15,000 to 20,000 square feet in our side lot. It's kind of concrete slab.  Typically, it just holds most of our agricultural products out there. And you think about a lot of other retailers that have a similar side lot and how much more efficient they use that. And so we've got 75 stores that we're standing up this year that radically, radically transform our side lot. And our goal is to see how those 2 different 75 store tests play out as we get through the fall. And then more to come from us on how we would expand that into next year and the years beyond. And like I said, we're investing in from a position of strength right now. We're not sitting on our laurels. We want to lock in these new customers. We want to transform our business, make it a more attractive company to retail to come shop at and also a more efficient retailer as well. And so at this point in time, I'm not sure I could predict the comp for Q3 of next year, but what I can tell you is we're leaning in to make sure that as we exit the pandemic that we've taken all the time we have here to make our company a better company exiting the pandemic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: A little bit related maybe for Hal. I wanted to ask you about the outside space and then the improving productivity. You're doing around $300 a foot, and I think that still includes your e-com. The home improvement retailer, you used to work at, does about $500. And I'm just doing this to illustrate the difference. I know you're not a home improvement store. And then Kurt mentioned some structural tailwinds. Curious if the opportunities that you're testing here to drive sales per foot are incremental or should we be thinking big? And any sense of where these store tests, where you think the store productivity or sales per foot could land?\nHarry Lawton: Yes. So we're not prepared to talk about targets and what we think our goals are yet. We've got these 75 stores in each of the pilots that we're standing up here in the fall. And as we get more data and see the performance of those, we'll certainly share that as appropriate. What I would say is both of them are -- both of the tests are step changes in the company's value proposition and in our format. And notably, in the -- inside the store, it's a significant step forward in how we allocate space, cutting in new programs and new categories and brands, more room for lay down areas to bulk out product and drive sales. And much more clarity around the connectivity of aisles and looking at all -- every SKU has to earn its way. Every program has to earn its way into the store. And Seth and the team have just done a fantastic job in leveraging data to really redefine what that store should look like.  The side lot is a -- it's hard to express [indiscernible] radical transformation. You were basically taking the 15,000 square feet that we have there now, shifting it over to compressing it to about 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 square feet through racking that kind of merchandise this product. If you walked our store, you'll see stock tanks, you'll see corals, you'll see gates. And typically, a lot of times, they're laying on the floor bundled together. We're now putting these up and racking. We're now merchandising that they're shoppable. We're opening up the drive-throughs with automatic gates that allow customers to drive through and pick up. We're looking at certain categories like garden. We're looking at feed and how you drive through and do drive-through pickup on feed. We also selected high-volume buy online, pick up in store orders, so you can do drive through buy online, pick up in store, you don't have to wait out front for it. We're dedicating staffing for outside.  We're putting new Theatro headsets in all of the stores. So that, that way, our team members can talk to each other and manage what will be really, in essence, move from a 15,000 to 18,000 square foot store to a 30,000 to 35,000 square foot store. The side lot will now be covered going forward, much like what you might see in some of the more larger mass and home center stores. So it is a significantly different store than it was before when we were done with these productivity program rollouts. And we're very excited about the opportunity. It gives us an opportunity to really transform the productivity of the outside to bring new categories in. Seth was very involved and kind of led our CUE transformation in 2009, and we think this has an opportunity to serve as another step change for us going forward.\nSimeon Gutman: And the SKU count goes up, Hal?\nHarry Lawton: There will be some modest SKU count, but certainly, those additionals -- that would be more reflective of the outdoor area, where we've got new square footage that we're merchandising. But we're still very focused on space productivity and inventory productivity. But there will be some add of SKUs and some add of inventory to support those higher sales volumes that we're anticipating.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim.\nSteven Forbes: Maybe I'll just put the two questions into 1 here. The focus on the field activity support team. I believe you mentioned 1,500 team members right organized at the district level. And maybe just correct me if I'm wrong here, that's about 8 to 10 per district. And then as we think about the funding for these -- some of your big box peers, right, have gotten some vendor support for these type of initiatives. Maybe just talk about your dialogue with the vendor community, whether there will be some form of vendor participation, either initially or after you prove out, right, some of the productivity gains and then just real quickly, right, where servicing versus tasking hours are today versus where you think they should be?\nHarry Lawton: Yes. So let me kind of hit a few of those. First off, we are working methodically through the core tasks that we put on our stores and looking to make them more efficient such that we can shift those hours to customer-facing. And as you mentioned, that's been a program that's tried and true and been executed across many other retailers very successfully. We started that last year with the Tractor Way program. That is our #1 task that we ask our team members to do is to receive a truck and get the product to the shelves. And we implemented with technology and with process, a significantly improved approach to that. The next biggest task that we had is the merchandising activity that happens in our stores, whether it's seasonal resets, End Cap executions, what we call FCIs, which are resets of certain categories at the completion of the line review, et cetera.  And that's our second largest activity. And as you know, right now, we use existing labor in our stores to execute that. It's again, tried and true across retail. When you could aggregate a team and have them focused solely on those executions and those tasks, they are efficient, you get more efficient because they're putting together -- they're doing the same reset across 15, 20 stores at a time. You also get more efficient in your processes and your systems to drive that execution, whether it's the way you build your planograms, whether it's the way that you load your product on the -- as it comes into the store on pallets and gets set aside, et cetera. And so we are very committed to just driving tasks down in our stores, making it more efficient and shifting it to our customer service. And this is all about how do we make our company more productive, how do we continue to make our company all resources count.  As it relates to the funding for those headcounts, as you said, it is very common in the industry for the vendors to support that sort of program, and I was kind of implying that in my remarks because the activities are directly related to the on-shelf execution of those vendors' programs. We have a vendor conference in a month, and this is one of the discussion points we'll be having with them. And then also, over time, as our stores get more efficient in their tasking, I do think there's opportunity for our payroll to be more efficient in the stores as well. So in the long term, while we have some incremental investment we're making in this team in Q3 and it will slide a little bit into Q4, in the long term, we think this cost is transitory, not structural.\nMary Pilkington: Operator, Carol, we have reached the top of the hour, but given the number of people we have in the queue, I would elect the call go for a few minutes longer. So maybe, we will move to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Ciccarelli from RBC.\nScott Ciccarelli: I had another followup on the new customer front. Just given its importance, your ability to kind of let this year's trend. I was wondering if you guys have any data on who your new customers are and where they're coming from? In other words, are these customers new to the rural environment because you're moving out of urban and suburban areas? Or is it more that they're shopping at other venues and migrate to Tractor Supply? And if it's the latter, what channels are they leaving to come to Tractor Supply?\nHarry Lawton: Yes. It's a little bit of both, Scott. So we all read the same data sets on kind of about mobile data and seeing where people are in the United States, and you're seeing less density of mobile data in cities, and you're seeing more density in suburbia and even more density than past in rural. And when we look at our customers and these new customers and reacquired customers, we're seeing that. It's people have left the cities where we don't have stores. They're moving into suburbans -- they're moving out of the suburbs, so they're moving out to the rural communities. They're embracing the Out Here lifestyle some, and they're shopping Tractor Supply because we are that lifestyle.  And then for the customer -- but we also are gaining share with customers that are already out here, so to speak. And I think it's coming from a -- and it's coming from a variety of places. So -- and I'll head into the categories, just to give you some examples. So in apparel, where our sales have been strong, as we said, all categories were double-digit comping. We think that we are benefiting from trip consolidation there. Instead of customers going to a stand-alone apparel or retailer and they get about that 1 or 2 items and do they really want to kind of take on that kind of safety kind of element, they're coming into Tractor Supply. They're already going to be in there to buy maybe pet food or animal feed, and they're picking up their clothes while they're in there or boots or any other item that we have in the apparel area.  Then you think about pet, all-time high pet adoption, a lot of new customers in the market or maybe customers that used to shop for pet food in say Mars. Our store being 15,000 to 18,000 square feet with a big focus on safety, and we've been very vocal about that. I think we're a kind of convenient location. We're probably -- and many of our customers, in fact, our #1 customer shopping criteria when we do our survey results right now is safety and cleanliness. And we have leaned into that from our actions and then also in our marketing. And so we think we're capturing some of that share, where just people are more comfortable coming into our store. And then you go around on pet feed. There, we think we're taking share from some of our farm and ranch competitors, who maybe are having more difficulty getting access to product right now. As you all know, some of the co-op chains are maybe having a little more of a struggle. And we think this is where the scale of Tractor Supply and being the size that we are and the connections that we have with our vendors, as Seth talked about earlier, really allows us to stay in stock and service that essential retailer for those customers. And we've been very focused, as Kurt was mentioning earlier on, everyday low price. Our pricing in pet food and animal feed right now is as sharp as it's ever been.  And then you go all the way around into garden. And we think we've gained a lot of share in garden this year. And it's been a great spring. But we think even in the context of that spring, we've gained a lot of share. And I think that speaks again to our format. I think the merchandising team did a great job setting ourselves up for garden this year. We are planning on taking a big swing in that category this year. And it really worked out well for us as customers said, \"hey, I'd rather really go to a 13,000, 15,000, 18,000 square foot store, where I feel comfortable going in, I can get in and out quickly, usually a standalone parking lot, not an overwhelmed parking lot.\" And the products that we have in our stores are equivalent to really what the other options they have elsewhere. So it's a little bit of both, new customers, existing customers, and on existing customers, I think we're taking it from many of the places you would think they would have historically shopped. The last thing I'll mention is online. We've been aggressive online. We mentioned the triple-digit online growth that we had this quarter. And we think we're holding our own and taking share online as well from whether it's multichannel players or from e-commerce only.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt McClintock from Raymond James.\nMatthew McClintock: And may I say congrats, great job of executing. My main question here, Hal, is really as we think through everything that you just said on this call, and there's a lot that you said on this call, a lot of initiatives. I think you were already planning on focusing on space productivity before COVID. So I want to understand or better understand what initiatives that you're talking about today were already in place before COVID? And what initiatives, investments are you making now that you're seeing how fundamental consumer behavior might be changing because of COVID? Can you kind of maybe parse those 2 things out just so we can understand the new things that you're putting in place?\nHarry Lawton: Yes, Matt, and thanks for the question. Yes, I'd say, 2 things I would say on that. First off, in March, in mid-March, when we had kind of our meet and greet up in New York, we did talk about space productivity. And I'd say that was kind of early days thinking, if you recall that we were sharing with you and saying we thought this was an opportunity and we were going to go start to take -- put plans in place to attack the opportunity. The first thing I'd say is just outstanding work by Seth and his team and John Ordus and his team and our construction team. We're in the midst of a pandemic, and we're doing all this activity to support our team members, all this activity to drive the business in the midst of it. They're also putting in place plans to address base productivity strategically and look out 18 months, 2 years, 3 years. So first off, I'd say we didn't really have a road map in place in March when we talked about it. It was more of an idea. And over the last 3 to 4 months, the team has kind of not only walked and chewed gum at the same time but jumped rope and pulled together what I think is a very compelling, a potentially transformative plan for the company. The second thing I'd say is we are leaning into those tests in a more aggressive way, given the strength of our business right now though we might have otherwise. We're doing 75 of each one of those stores, which is a pretty aggressive swing for a pilot, but that just demonstrates the bullishness that we have in the solution and also the speed at which we want to execute once we get the data sets out of the pilots.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of our call, and I would like to turn it back to Mary Winn for final comments.\nMary Pilkington: Well, thank you very much, Carol. And I'm glad we were able to get a few more people in there for the Q&A. So thank you all for your cooperation. This does conclude our call today, and thank you for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you on our third quarter call in October. And I'm around along with Marianne if anyone needs anything. So thank you all. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. And once again, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jonathan Estep",
            "content": "Thanks, Hal. Yes. Kate, so as Hal mentioned, obviously, it's our desire to get as much inventory as possible and one of the things that the merchant team has been doing each and every day is partnering with our supplier base and what I can tell you is that our suppliers are stepping up in ways in which how can we make sure that we can get each of the products that we sell today, but also looking for opportunity buys. And the team has been really nimble in looking at ways to reallocate space in our center court to product that's available when things are supporting the lifestyle that is out there whether that be around backyard and activity and home setting, things of that nature. So really pivoting to new items and new categories.  And as we've gone that route, one of the benefits that we've also had is strong sell throughs. So we have our each -- our replenished items that Hal talked about. But also when you look at our drive-out programs as well, we're sitting on about 30% less clearance inventory today than we have -- than we were this time last year, just based on the overall strength of the business. So it's a couple -- it's again a couple fold. Number one is that we want to make sure that we can have that product in stock to drive each and every day bids for your own programs. But then number two, we also have seen the benefit of strong sell throughs, which have benefited in less clearance inventory, which has allowed us to go after opportunity buys, which are driving some significant comps right now as well. Peter, this is Seth. When you look at our overall pet and animal businesses and talking about rank order of the two, I would kind of look at each of those a little bit independently. So for us, we have a primary desire, obviously, to own the pet customer in the rural marketplace. And a lot of efforts are going in place, whether it be on our pet supplies resets and continue to make sure that we have the product there as we're seeing these record adoption rates. The pet supplies business just showed incredible strength in the quarter. And we're continuing to see that strength. Obviously, Hal mentioned the pet food reset that's coming up as we continue to go where kind of the customer is going and where those trends are. And so pet for us is something we want to make sure that we look at that, whether it be on the tractor side as well as with pet sense that we want to own that category, obviously, in the rural marketplace.  Animal is obviously the other category on its own. And with those, obviously, it's multi-species approach. You talked about backyard poultry, you talked about equine. And the merchant team really puts together independent strategies to really attack each of those areas of the merchant categories. And as we talk about localization and regionalization, the animal side is one of the areas that we see some of the most localized and regional differences at times so that we can go after these categories. So the team, our feed rack is actually done on a store-by-store basis relative to the local assortment. And we obviously want to go after these things, and we're continuing to go after sales here.  Backyard poultry is something that we have seen some really nice strength in. And just to put -- give an example of some of the nimbleness that has occurred throughout the year, our Chick Days, what we call Chick Days, which is one of our big center court events in the spring is typically about a 9-week event. That event actually has not ended. So as we've seen the strength and the momentum in that category. The team was able to be nimble, reallocate center court space. Most of our stores are continuing all of that. And we'll continue with that throughout the fall, as we want to make sure that not only we can capitalize on these trends, but also be that dependable supplier as we're seeing new customers come into the category as well as current customers adding to the flock.  So pet and animal, both, I would just say, are going to be 2 of the primary pillars as we look forward not only this year but for the years to come to drive comp and drive the overall business."

            "name": "Harry Lawton",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Before we address our results for the second quarter, I thought I'd just step back, take a moment, acknowledge the environment in the United States right now. There's no doubt we're in a generational moment. Before the quarter began and for the entirety of this quarter, we've continued to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and really all that's come along with it. And then towards the end of the quarter, we've seen widespread protests focused on racial inequality in America. We're a purpose-driven company at Tractor Supply through all these times. We've stepped back and led with our values, and I'm incredibly proud of that. Been so impressed and inspired how our team has come together and responded. And in all situations and across all functions, the team has moved with speed and focus to address this dynamic environment while also executing and delivering on record-breaking sales. Start off by just talking about team member, health and safety. We've taken extensive and proactive measures in this area. Masks are required for all team members and customers in all stores. Each day, all of our team members take their temperature and go through a symptom screening before coming to work. We are in the process of implementing biweekly testing for over 500 team members who travel, and we will be conducting sample testing within all our DCs to stay on top of that robust large population. Additionally, we've arranged for robust case management to conduct contact tracing and provide health care support for all team members who are impacted by COVID-19. And also, I thought I'd add, where there -- in areas where there's been widespread community outbreaks, such as in Waco, Texas and Costa Grande, Arizona, where we have distribution centers, in those areas over the last 6 weeks independently each, we sent in rapid response teams to conduct facility wide testing in concert with contact tracing and case management. In summary, just want to reinforce how committed we are at Tractor Supply to being a safe place to work and shop and how committed we are to implementing industry-leading best practices across all parameters of safety. We're also committed to advancing a diverse and inclusive culture, built on our core value of respect. To promote social progress, we invested in a dedicated time of reflection for all 38,000 team members to discuss the importance of diversity and inclusion in our company. We did this team by team by team. Additionally, over the last few weeks, we published our first ESG report. We hired a Director of Diversity and Inclusion, and we donated to cause of the supporting quality and strength in our local communities, and you can expect many more actions from us on the diversity inclusion front moving forward. Now turning to the results of the quarter. We experienced unprecedented sales. Notably, they were strong the entire quarter, all 3 months. We had consistent, elevated levels of sales each week, and we had record growth across all channels, product categories and geographic regions. Kind of turning to the numbers. Net sales grew approximately 35% with comparable store sales plus 30.5%, driven by a comparable transaction count increase of 14.6% and a comparable average ticket increase of 15.8%. Diluted earnings per share grew 61% to $2.90. And e-commerce saw significant growth, strong triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we did in the quarter to improve our e-commerce capabilities has certainly resonated with our customers. Kurt will walk you through greater details on the quarter and our outlook and walk you through some more numbers here in a moment when I turn it over to him. But I thought now what I'd do is shift to some operational highlights.  During the second quarter, we announced several strategic investments in our team members who are at the heart of our relationship with our customers. Early responses to the pandemic included paid sick leave and expanded benefits and appreciation bonuses. Totaling -- the benefits and appreciation bonuses totaled $35 million in Q2. And then as we progressed through the quarter, it became clear that we were moving to a new normal, really operating for the foreseeable future with COVID-19, and I'll talk more about that later. And so consequently, we made the decision to permanently enhance our compensation and benefits, including wage increases across all of our stores and distribution centers of a minimum $1 per hour for all hourly team members. In addition to the wage increases, more than 2,000 frontline managers at our stores and distribution centers are now receiving annual restricted stock units with the goal of helping fuel their entrepreneurial spirit and allowing them to benefit in the company's long-term success. We also took the opportunity to ensure we're supporting the health and wellness of our team members. And what we did was we chose to offer health care and benefits to our part-time team members. We are committed to investing in our team members as we believe they are a key competitive differentiator with our customers. Operating in elevated comps for 13 weeks presents a number of challenges. During the second quarter, we added over 5,000 net new team members, primarily across our stores and distribution centers. These team members were critical in our ability to service our customers at these elevated volumes. Also, to facilitate our distribution network's capacity, we opened a new mixing center in Florida. And also, we work closely with our vendor partners. They've been key contributors to our success and supported our supply chain with speed and nimbleness. We'd like to express our sincere appreciation for their collaboration and support of our mutual customers. Our focus remains on working together to ensure we remain in stock for merchandising categories that make us the dependable supplier for products that our customers need to support their lifestyle. During the quarter, we rolled out curbside pickup, same day, next-day delivery, relaunched our website. And in early July, we rolled out our new mobile app. And we've seen acceleration in adoption rates of technology initiatives with multiple years of consumer adoption being compressed into 10 or 12 weeks' time. Our e-commerce results were impressive with triple-digit growth increases. And this triple-digit growth increase included buy online and pickup in-store orders. This sharp acceleration in consumer shopping preferences is becoming ingrained in our customers' behaviors. And we're fostering this relationship in a digital way through frequent communications, whether it's digital marketing or in e-mail, and we're accelerating our focus on the transformation of our digital platforms and services. We have an opportunity to create deeper customer relationships of scale, and we're laser-focused on that opportunity. Speaking of customers, during the quarter, another investment we made was in our brand-building initiatives. Given the current dynamic, we capitalized on the opportunity to shift our marketing spend, which had been traditionally print media, to more digital and national TV. And notably, we launched our first national advertising campaign in over a decade. We launched the initial campaign in March during the early weeks of the COVID pandemic. And the campaign has continued to evolve. And what we're working on is matching the country's mood and the cycle of the pandemic, and we've done 5 different commercials in the last 4 months. Our most recent TV ad has been focused on reinforcing Tractor Supply as a safe and convenient place to shop for all you need for your summer out here. Our research indicates that our unaided brand awareness and Tractor Supply being in the consideration set for shopping trips are both increasing. More importantly, we had our customers shop -- we had more customers shop with us than ever before as we experienced robust growth in our customer base with increased sales across existing customers, new customers and re-acquired customers. And so what I thought I'd do is to share with you 5 kind of key observations of our customer behaviors based on the market data and research that we have. So the first observation I'll mention is we're growing trips and our customers are spending -- and our existing customers are spending more with us. Our core customers, our existing customers are shopping more frequently and their baskets are larger as we benefit from their trip consolidation. And these customers are shopping more categories from us than they ever have before. And we've finished the quarter with close to 17 million Neighbor's Club members.  The second observation I'll share is that we're gaining new customers at the fastest rate in the history of the company. For the second quarter, we saw 3.3 million identifiable new customers, and that represents almost over a 14% year-over-year increase.  The third observation is that we're reengaging our lapsed customers, and they're returning to shop with us at a higher rate than ever before. For the quarter, we reactivated almost 2 million customers, which was an increase of 42% year-over-year.  The fourth observation that I'll share is that the new customers we're acquiring as compared to our core customers, they're skewing younger, higher income and closer to 50% female, which is an increase of 10 percentage points compared to our historical trends of 60% male.  And the fifth and last observation that I'll share is that the new customers are becoming repeat customers at the fastest rate ever. This is at a time when our overall customer satisfaction scores are at an all-time high. We believe key aspects to our customer service such as being a convenient place to shop, a tailored lifestyle-oriented product category, our legendary customer service and our strong in-stock levels are important to keep these new customers engaged with our brands. That's what's attracting them to us. Notably, purchasing patterns for our new and reengaged customers are very similar to our existing customer behaviors and product category engagement.  Looking ahead, we know our opportunity is to capitalize on these trends and to nurture these customers and to gain market share. And we have strong plans in place to retain these customers with marketing and product offerings, continuation of our national advertising campaign, but robust digital onboarding CRM tool kits are being executed. Taking a step back from our Q2 results and actions, I want to share broadly what we're seeing from a macro perspective. Key trends we're seeing that are working to our favor include rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, self-reliant lifestyle movement, including DIY trends; consumer spending shifting from travel and entertainment that kind of trapped spend is now being spent on home and land; and of course, pet adoptions, they're at an all-time high.  In addition, we believe our business benefited from the government stimulus and activity that helped bolster the economy. And while we're not planning for this government stimulus activity to continue, many of the other trends I mentioned, such as pet adoption and trip consolidation and rural revitalization, we definitely expect those to continue and to be prevalent with our customers over the next few quarters. Speaking of that, as we look ahead, we believe many of these consumer behaviors that we saw over the last 3 or 4 months are going to continue in the second half, but there's going to be some nuances and some differences. For instance, we expect -- we definitely expect consumers to still be [indiscernible] with their land and their homes. It is their safe oasis. But the things that they will do will be different. As an example, in the spring, customers were buying lawnmowers and kayaks and working in their yard on their fencing and their gates. And we think in the fall, some of that will continue, but instead of lawnmowers and kayaks, they're going to shift to buying things like patio heaters and firewood and fire pits, but they're still going to be working on their land and on their homes. They're also going to continue to do things that are more outdoor related, but are fall and winter oriented, such as things like raking leaves and winterizing their gardens. Overall, we believe there will be a higher level of category participation in the fall and the winter categories, just like there was in the spring, it's just going to be different, and it will be higher than it's been in the past, and we believe that's going to continue into the second half. Now looking at even further, while we can't predict the future and there is a significant amount of uncertainty, our team is operating under the premise that we will still be dealing with the pandemic in the first half of next year. We're buying to that assumption, and we're orienting our planning around that assumption. Over the past few months, we have navigated unprecedented conditions. We believe that our purposeful actions will allow us to emerge from it stronger and better than ever before. We have an opportunity to create and define our future and extend our leadership for years to come.  And with that, I'll turn now the call over to Kurt to review the quarter in more depth and our outlook before I come back to give some insights on our strategic growth initiatives and other drivers of Q3. Thanks, Kurt. Let's look ahead. Look, as we think about our business, we have a unique opportunity to capitalize on the powerful customer trends that we're benefiting from now and to retain the record number of new and reengaged customers we're seeing. And our goal is to capitalize on our ability to drive sales and higher productivity. Our financial strength allows us to stay focused on the long term, creating an even greater competitive advantage as we're investing to fuel long-term growth. We continue to operate from a position of strength. And we're laying the groundwork for the future. And so today, we're excited to introduce 2 new strategic initiatives that are being implemented across all stores within the company. The first is the build-out of our field activity support team, and that's focused on improving the productivity of in-store execution. And the second is the expansion of several technology and service enhancements to capitalize on consumer expectations. Turning to the field activity support team. This initiative is designed to improve our merchandising activities in store, which represents the second largest body of work for our team members. This initiative builds on the successful rollout last year of The Tractor Way program, which addressed the largest area of work in our stores, the receiving and stocking of merchandise.  And kind of stepping back, more broadly, our goal is to improve the productivity of our store payroll. And we want to shift hours away from tasking to customer-facing and keep finding ways to be as efficient as possible in what we do in tasking, so that way we can drive customer-facing hours. And this is a very common retail approach. And so the work of the FAST team includes executing a merchandising programs like center court, End Caps, planogram resets, seasonal programs and sales driving initiatives. The FAST team, as mentioned, will allow the store teams to spend more time on customer service, help them improve their in-store execution and ultimately lead to higher comparable store sales. These teams are in the process of ramping up, and we're hiring more than 1,500 FAST team members with 1 FAST team per district. These teams will be in the stores starting in August, and the goal is for each FAST team to be in every store every week. And each team -- and the focus of the team will be to improve store-specific measures and address sales driving activity. Over time, we would anticipate that these teams will receive support from our vendor partners, which is common in the industry, as the work is directly related to the on-shelf execution of their product. And also the FAST team has the potential to help drive store-level efficiencies as the teams ramp up. This type of dedicated team is a proven strategy of cross-sectors of retail, in particular so -- and they've been proven to drive customer satisfaction rates and sales, and they'll allow the store teams to prioritize customer service and continue to drive productivity through your labor in the store to get very efficient on your tasking. Our second initiative is building on our technology and services capabilities. And this includes the rollout of contactless payment in the quarter, expansion of our in-store WiFi capabilities, enhanced ship-from-store online fulfillment and increased delivery capabilities. Within the last few weeks, we had a soft launch of our new mobile app that allows for greater customer convenience and integration with our Neighbor's Club. We will begin to communicate more about the app to our customers in the upcoming weeks. We know mobile access is important to our customers, and our new app makes shopping easier and more convenient.  In addition, we're expanding our ship-from-store capabilities. We're adding subscriptions at the point-of-sale in our stores and implementing contactless payments at the registers in our stores. Further, we're substantially increasing wireless access in our stores as we move from 2 access points in each store to 5 access points at each store. This is all tied to supporting contactless payments and our mobile point-of-sale hardware that we doubled the capacity of earlier this year. Our technology capabilities are becoming a strategic advantage for Tractor Supply. In addition to these 2 chain-wide activities, we are focused on driving our -- we're also focused on driving our space -- of driving space productivity across our stores. The first initiative that we'd like to talk about today is driving the productivity of our side lot. Typically, there's as much space outside of our stores in the side lot as we have inside the store. And the productivity of this space is substantially below the chain average. Our ability to drive higher sales per square foot through reworking of the side lot is in progress, and we're beginning some tests right now here in the third quarter.  In total, we'll do about 75 stores this year in terms of transformation of our side lots. And we have the ability to transform our side lot with expanded product offerings in select categories, enhancing the shopping experience of categories that are already out there. And it can be offered to -- it can be leveraged to offer a wider product assortment in select categories, enter new categories and also offer the convenience through the expansion of buy online, pick up in store and really what it will become is buy online, drive through for pickup. This transformation can help us continue to keep our customers engaged at Tractor Supply and take our customer experience to the next level. During the third quarter, we will also begin testing a new interior space productivity program for our mature stores. Project fusion is our state-of-the-art space productivity program designed to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base and give new customers that may not have shopped with us in the past more reasons to visit. Much like the FAST teams, space productivity programs of mature stores have proven -- have been proven across retail concepts to drive higher sales per square foot when deployed from a consumer's point of view. An active space productivity program is also important to protect the brand image of the Tractor Supply.  Similar to our side lot test, we anticipate completing about 75 fusion stores in 2020, and there will be some overlap between the 2 pilots. Given the size of our store base, both of these efforts are a multiyear opportunity to continue to refresh our store base, create new shopping categories for our customers and further drive comp sales. As we look ahead, we have a robust new product innovation pipeline. One key introduction is the addition of power tools from Makita, a brand known for their reputation for high-quality power tools. In companion animal, we have a significant reset of our dog food offerings occurring right now here in August. This reset will reallocate space for winning brands, along with exclusive and new brand introductions. This will also allow for the expansion of our exclusive line with Miranda Lambert's MuttNation On The Farm and the addition of the Victor dog food. Our customers have been asking us to carry the Victor brand for quite some time, and we're excited to add it to our dog food offering. We will be the first national retailer of Victor. Victor dog food launches -- is online available today with a limited SKU offering, and you can start to see the product, and it's currently rolling out in our stores right now. Across all parts of the store, we had exciting products for the fall and winter as we adapt to serving our customers in the current environment. Our stores will be ready for the change of seasons as we begin to move into fall.  On the marketing front, we're excited to announce our partnership with Turner Sports during the coverage of the upcoming restart of the NBA season. We will be very visible throughout the season with our Stronger Together ad campaign that launched on Tuesday. To wrap up, we're focused on our ability to improve the execution in our stores, enhance our legendary service and transform our stores to make them even more productive and more compelling to our customers. Product innovation and category expansions play a key role in driving our space productivity improvements.  Our technology enhancements and service offering expansions are reflective of the macro trends we're experiencing, and we believe this is a structural shift that will be going on for a long time. Despite the current operating backdrop in the U.S., we have confidence that our strategy and execution will allow us to continue to build a stronger Tractor Supply.  I and the rest of the team remain confident that Tractor Supply will emerge from the pandemic a stronger and larger company. My sincere appreciation goes out to each and every one of our more than 38,000 team members for their dedication to our mission and values. And with that, operator, we'd like to open -- we'd like to now open the lines for questions. Kate, absolutely. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, operating at kind of 20%, 25%, 30% comps plus for 13-plus weeks puts some strains on the business that we've not seen historically and really proud of how the team worked through all those challenges to meet the needs of our customers. And inventory has certainly been one of those challenges. And we've taken a number of actions to lean into that in terms of increasing our visibility of forecast with our vendors, obviously increasing receipts and working very closely with them, and in a minute I will ask Seth to talk a little bit more about our vendor interactions. But what I'd say is we would like to have more inventory in our stores.  We would like our inventory levels to be -- in-stock levels to be higher right now. And we are working very closely with our vendors to do that. In many cases, we're selling product right when it comes off the back of a truck. As an example, we are I think the largest seller of stock tanks in the United States. We are selling close to $2,500 of those a week. Our manufacturer is able to make $3,000 a week. So as soon as we get a truck, they hit the floor or hit the outside in the side lot. And we've got will calls and our customers taking them immediately off the lot. And so, again, we wish we had more inventory. We're very focused on getting more in our stores. We're very focused on getting our in-stock levels, and we're working very closely with our vendors on that. And I'll turn it over to Seth to maybe just make a few more comments on that front. Yes. So we're monitoring repeat purchase rates of all of our new customers and our reacquired customers. It's a regular muscle and analytical skills that we have set up. It was part of all the work the team did in Q1 of this year and into Q4 last year as we migrated the platform to Microsoft Azure, and we're able to leverage the analytical tool set that comes along with that. And what we are seeing is that we're continuing to see strong new customer counts, we're continuing to see strong reacquired customer counts and we're seeing them shop with us a second and third time at a higher rate than they have historically with us. And those trends have been very consistent from the early days of the pandemic up until now.  And as I mentioned, they've had a -- early on, there were probably slightly more rural. I'd say now it's -- or slightly more suburban. Now it's kind of moderating. It's kind of reasonably mix between suburban and rural. It does have a tendency to be a little more female, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And then online, whether it's direct ship sales or buy online, pickup in store with curbside pickup, does over penetrate some with those new customers. But they're giving us a strong customer satisfaction scores. And in their surveys, they're saying they intend to repeat shopping with us. And then in their actions, they are continuing to shop with us as well. And our aspiration is to invest significantly in digital and national marketing as well as specifically in the -- in our CRM toolkit to continue to engage those customers. And of course, that's one of the reasons we hired 5,000 new team members this quarter, net new team members, was to provide that legendary customer service that we're known for and ensuring that we can serve effectively the increased counts of customers we have in our stores. Great question. And I don't think I've got the crystal ball in front of me on that one. But what I can -- and I would acknowledge just the wide range of uncertainties over the next 18 to 24 months, but I'll reference -- I'll start by referencing what we talked about in our prepared remarks is that we're planning for the COVID-19 pandemic to be a significant factor in the United States and in consumer shopping behavior, at least through the middle of next year. And we're bind to that. We're building our assortment plans around that, and we're putting in place our operational plans to support that.  As we look beyond that, that's where we're -- that's why we're talking about growth initiatives today. We truly are focused on emerging as a stronger company than we entered this pandemic. And we're going to -- we're investing in things like our FAST team to make us more operationally efficient, we're investing in technology to make us easier to do business with, and importantly, we're looking at our format and our store and saying, how do we make it more productive. And for those of you that have followed our business for quite some time, it's been a while since we've gone on a strong space productivity improvement initiative inside of our stores. And we're very -- it's early days, but we like what we see in terms of the initial actions we're taking on the space productivity program, project fusion in our stores, and we're doing 75 of those this year. And then the side lot has always been a -- I think, by all accounts, a big opportunity for us. We've got anywhere between 15,000 to 20,000 square feet in our side lot. It's kind of concrete slab.  Typically, it just holds most of our agricultural products out there. And you think about a lot of other retailers that have a similar side lot and how much more efficient they use that. And so we've got 75 stores that we're standing up this year that radically, radically transform our side lot. And our goal is to see how those 2 different 75 store tests play out as we get through the fall. And then more to come from us on how we would expand that into next year and the years beyond. And like I said, we're investing in from a position of strength right now. We're not sitting on our laurels. We want to lock in these new customers. We want to transform our business, make it a more attractive company to retail to come shop at and also a more efficient retailer as well. And so at this point in time, I'm not sure I could predict the comp for Q3 of next year, but what I can tell you is we're leaning in to make sure that as we exit the pandemic that we've taken all the time we have here to make our company a better company exiting the pandemic. Yes. So we're not prepared to talk about targets and what we think our goals are yet. We've got these 75 stores in each of the pilots that we're standing up here in the fall. And as we get more data and see the performance of those, we'll certainly share that as appropriate. What I would say is both of them are -- both of the tests are step changes in the company's value proposition and in our format. And notably, in the -- inside the store, it's a significant step forward in how we allocate space, cutting in new programs and new categories and brands, more room for lay down areas to bulk out product and drive sales. And much more clarity around the connectivity of aisles and looking at all -- every SKU has to earn its way. Every program has to earn its way into the store. And Seth and the team have just done a fantastic job in leveraging data to really redefine what that store should look like.  The side lot is a -- it's hard to express [indiscernible] radical transformation. You were basically taking the 15,000 square feet that we have there now, shifting it over to compressing it to about 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 square feet through racking that kind of merchandise this product. If you walked our store, you'll see stock tanks, you'll see corals, you'll see gates. And typically, a lot of times, they're laying on the floor bundled together. We're now putting these up and racking. We're now merchandising that they're shoppable. We're opening up the drive-throughs with automatic gates that allow customers to drive through and pick up. We're looking at certain categories like garden. We're looking at feed and how you drive through and do drive-through pickup on feed. We also selected high-volume buy online, pick up in store orders, so you can do drive through buy online, pick up in store, you don't have to wait out front for it. We're dedicating staffing for outside.  We're putting new Theatro headsets in all of the stores. So that, that way, our team members can talk to each other and manage what will be really, in essence, move from a 15,000 to 18,000 square foot store to a 30,000 to 35,000 square foot store. The side lot will now be covered going forward, much like what you might see in some of the more larger mass and home center stores. So it is a significantly different store than it was before when we were done with these productivity program rollouts. And we're very excited about the opportunity. It gives us an opportunity to really transform the productivity of the outside to bring new categories in. Seth was very involved and kind of led our CUE transformation in 2009, and we think this has an opportunity to serve as another step change for us going forward. There will be some modest SKU count, but certainly, those additionals -- that would be more reflective of the outdoor area, where we've got new square footage that we're merchandising. But we're still very focused on space productivity and inventory productivity. But there will be some add of SKUs and some add of inventory to support those higher sales volumes that we're anticipating. Yes. So let me kind of hit a few of those. First off, we are working methodically through the core tasks that we put on our stores and looking to make them more efficient such that we can shift those hours to customer-facing. And as you mentioned, that's been a program that's tried and true and been executed across many other retailers very successfully. We started that last year with the Tractor Way program. That is our #1 task that we ask our team members to do is to receive a truck and get the product to the shelves. And we implemented with technology and with process, a significantly improved approach to that. The next biggest task that we had is the merchandising activity that happens in our stores, whether it's seasonal resets, End Cap executions, what we call FCIs, which are resets of certain categories at the completion of the line review, et cetera.  And that's our second largest activity. And as you know, right now, we use existing labor in our stores to execute that. It's again, tried and true across retail. When you could aggregate a team and have them focused solely on those executions and those tasks, they are efficient, you get more efficient because they're putting together -- they're doing the same reset across 15, 20 stores at a time. You also get more efficient in your processes and your systems to drive that execution, whether it's the way you build your planograms, whether it's the way that you load your product on the -- as it comes into the store on pallets and gets set aside, et cetera. And so we are very committed to just driving tasks down in our stores, making it more efficient and shifting it to our customer service. And this is all about how do we make our company more productive, how do we continue to make our company all resources count.  As it relates to the funding for those headcounts, as you said, it is very common in the industry for the vendors to support that sort of program, and I was kind of implying that in my remarks because the activities are directly related to the on-shelf execution of those vendors' programs. We have a vendor conference in a month, and this is one of the discussion points we'll be having with them. And then also, over time, as our stores get more efficient in their tasking, I do think there's opportunity for our payroll to be more efficient in the stores as well. So in the long term, while we have some incremental investment we're making in this team in Q3 and it will slide a little bit into Q4, in the long term, we think this cost is transitory, not structural. Yes. It's a little bit of both, Scott. So we all read the same data sets on kind of about mobile data and seeing where people are in the United States, and you're seeing less density of mobile data in cities, and you're seeing more density in suburbia and even more density than past in rural. And when we look at our customers and these new customers and reacquired customers, we're seeing that. It's people have left the cities where we don't have stores. They're moving into suburbans -- they're moving out of the suburbs, so they're moving out to the rural communities. They're embracing the Out Here lifestyle some, and they're shopping Tractor Supply because we are that lifestyle.  And then for the customer -- but we also are gaining share with customers that are already out here, so to speak. And I think it's coming from a -- and it's coming from a variety of places. So -- and I'll head into the categories, just to give you some examples. So in apparel, where our sales have been strong, as we said, all categories were double-digit comping. We think that we are benefiting from trip consolidation there. Instead of customers going to a stand-alone apparel or retailer and they get about that 1 or 2 items and do they really want to kind of take on that kind of safety kind of element, they're coming into Tractor Supply. They're already going to be in there to buy maybe pet food or animal feed, and they're picking up their clothes while they're in there or boots or any other item that we have in the apparel area.  Then you think about pet, all-time high pet adoption, a lot of new customers in the market or maybe customers that used to shop for pet food in say Mars. Our store being 15,000 to 18,000 square feet with a big focus on safety, and we've been very vocal about that. I think we're a kind of convenient location. We're probably -- and many of our customers, in fact, our #1 customer shopping criteria when we do our survey results right now is safety and cleanliness. And we have leaned into that from our actions and then also in our marketing. And so we think we're capturing some of that share, where just people are more comfortable coming into our store. And then you go around on pet feed. There, we think we're taking share from some of our farm and ranch competitors, who maybe are having more difficulty getting access to product right now. As you all know, some of the co-op chains are maybe having a little more of a struggle. And we think this is where the scale of Tractor Supply and being the size that we are and the connections that we have with our vendors, as Seth talked about earlier, really allows us to stay in stock and service that essential retailer for those customers. And we've been very focused, as Kurt was mentioning earlier on, everyday low price. Our pricing in pet food and animal feed right now is as sharp as it's ever been.  And then you go all the way around into garden. And we think we've gained a lot of share in garden this year. And it's been a great spring. But we think even in the context of that spring, we've gained a lot of share. And I think that speaks again to our format. I think the merchandising team did a great job setting ourselves up for garden this year. We are planning on taking a big swing in that category this year. And it really worked out well for us as customers said, \"hey, I'd rather really go to a 13,000, 15,000, 18,000 square foot store, where I feel comfortable going in, I can get in and out quickly, usually a standalone parking lot, not an overwhelmed parking lot.\" And the products that we have in our stores are equivalent to really what the other options they have elsewhere. So it's a little bit of both, new customers, existing customers, and on existing customers, I think we're taking it from many of the places you would think they would have historically shopped. The last thing I'll mention is online. We've been aggressive online. We mentioned the triple-digit online growth that we had this quarter. And we think we're holding our own and taking share online as well from whether it's multichannel players or from e-commerce only. Yes, Matt, and thanks for the question. Yes, I'd say, 2 things I would say on that. First off, in March, in mid-March, when we had kind of our meet and greet up in New York, we did talk about space productivity. And I'd say that was kind of early days thinking, if you recall that we were sharing with you and saying we thought this was an opportunity and we were going to go start to take -- put plans in place to attack the opportunity. The first thing I'd say is just outstanding work by Seth and his team and John Ordus and his team and our construction team. We're in the midst of a pandemic, and we're doing all this activity to support our team members, all this activity to drive the business in the midst of it. They're also putting in place plans to address base productivity strategically and look out 18 months, 2 years, 3 years. So first off, I'd say we didn't really have a road map in place in March when we talked about it. It was more of an idea. And over the last 3 to 4 months, the team has kind of not only walked and chewed gum at the same time but jumped rope and pulled together what I think is a very compelling, a potentially transformative plan for the company. The second thing I'd say is we are leaning into those tests in a more aggressive way, given the strength of our business right now though we might have otherwise. We're doing 75 of each one of those stores, which is a pretty aggressive swing for a pilot, but that just demonstrates the bullishness that we have in the solution and also the speed at which we want to execute once we get the data sets out of the pilots."

            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Before discussing our second quarter results, I'd like to recognize and thank our incredible team. I have personally been inspired watching everyone come together to face the current environment, embrace new ways of working and decisively taking actions to serve our team and our customers in the face of unprecedented conditions.  With more than 20 years with Tractor Supply, I could not be prouder to be a part of this team. This quarter was certainly exceptional and like no other in the history of Tractor Supply. The second quarter benefited from the macro trends Hal shared with you. While at the same time, we had a great spring. The weather was ideal across the country with favorable temperatures breaking early in the spring and consistent moisture, providing a sustained spring/summer season. As we rank order our comparable store sales performance, the largest driver was our customers' desire for product categories that supported their Out Here lifestyle, as they shifted from other interests like travel, entertainment and dining. From home studying, land maintenance and fencing, backyard living and caring for their animals and pets, our customers have clearly made the care and improvement in their homes and land a priority. This is also inclusive of living a more self-reliant lifestyle and adopting new hobbies like backyard poultry, gardening and bird feeding.  Now we believe brand awareness and the new customer performance that Hal discussed was the second largest driver of our comparable store sales performance. This was followed by tailwinds such as the favorable spring/summer weather that I mentioned earlier and the benefits from being an essential business that remained open during the early part of the quarter. Underlying these primary drivers, the government stimulus checks likely increase spending across the board in all categories. Now another way to look at this quarter's comparable store sales growth is to break down the comp between transitory factors, such as government stimulus checks and COVID-19-related sales as compared to sustainable, more structural tailwinds like trip consolidation, the increase in new customers and re-engaged customers, the rural revitalization trends and the growth in companion animal ownership. While it is difficult to estimate the impact from each of these drivers, we believe that nearly half of the Q2 comparable store sales growth can be attributed to structural tailwinds, giving us a sustainable opportunity for growth. I'll wrap up my discussion on sales with a few other performance highlights. First, we had robust performance in our big ticket categories, which was generally in line with our overall comp sales growth. This was driven by strength in mowers, trailers, safes, pressure washers and 3-point equipment. Second, our CUE products, consumable, usable and edible, which is a representation of our strength of our core business, had solid mid-teens comp sales growth. And lastly, commodity inflation was essentially flat for the quarter. Moving on to gross profit. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 36.4% in the second quarter, an increase of 155 basis points. This increase was driven principally by a reduction in the frequency and depth of promotion as a result of strong demand for our product categories. We also benefited from favorable product mix, along with the lower transportation costs as a percentage of net sales. SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales, was 22.3%, a decrease of 33 basis points. This decrease was primarily attributable to significant leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs for the strong increase in comparable store sales. The leverage was achieved -- the leverage achieved -- we achieved in these SG&A categories was partially offset by incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased store labor hours to support the significant increase in sales volume and increased incentive compensation given our strong performance in the quarter. We incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19 pandemic of approximately $55 million, including the appreciation wages for team members, PP&E supplies and incremental store labor hours dedicated to managing social distancing in the stores as well as cleaning and sanitation. Operating profit increased nearly 56% with operating profit margin of 14.1%, an improvement of 188 basis points. Net income was $338.7 million, an increase of 55%. Diluted earnings per share was $2.90, an increase of 61%. Turning now to our balance sheet which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $1.69 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing an 8.4% decline in average inventory per store. The reduction in average inventory per store principally reflects the robust sales trends and the solid increase in inventory turns during the quarter. Our supply chain and our vendors are executing at a very high level to meet the customers' current demands. We finished the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $500 million revolver. Moving now to our guidance for the third quarter. To date, we continue to see the strong sales momentum in the business. We expect this momentum to continue, albeit at a lower level than the second quarter, as we forecast delivering strong sales and profitability for the third quarter. While we typically don't provide a unique situation due to COVID-19, we are providing our view on the third quarter. Given the level of uncertainty, it is difficult to provide guidance beyond Q3 right now. Factors contributing to a heightened level of uncertainty include the duration and impact of shelter-in-place restrictions and social distancing measures, the tapering of government stimulus benefits, elevated unemployment levels and even the November elections. With this backdrop, we would anticipate the strength in our comparable store sales trends to moderate as we move through Q3. Overall, we feel very good at about our business leading up to the November election cycle. But as we all recognize, it just creates a significant level of uncertainty for the consumer. For the third quarter, we expect net sales growth of approximately 16% to 22% and comp sales growth in the range of 12% to 18%. Net income is forecast to be in the range of $136 million to $162 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.35.  Two factors to consider that are impacting our outlook for the third quarter include COVID-19-related costs of approximately $15 million to $20 million to ensure the health and safety of our team members and our customers and $15 million for the prioritization of our strategic growth initiatives. And please keep in mind, as we previously disclosed, our move to permanent wage and benefit changes will cost approximately $13 million this quarter as well. We are raising our capital spending outlook to support our strategic growth initiatives that Hal will discuss momentarily. Our previous estimate was $225 million to $275 million. For 2020, we now anticipate capital spending in a range of $300 million to $325 million. Vast majority of the capital spending increase is attributable to new in-store initiatives and supporting technology. Looking beyond the third quarter, we anticipate fourth quarter comp sales performance to be above our original expectations when we enter the year. As mentioned earlier, we expect the current trends to moderate throughout Q3, and we believe that moderation will continue into fourth quarter as our outdoor seasonal sales become a lower concentration of our business and we get back to a higher mix of CUE products. Additionally, we are planning for a more moderate holiday season than normal, but with stronger online growth. As always, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage our capital with the goal of delivering consistent, strong financial performance, while strategically investing in initiatives for long-term growth. We are taking actions to capitalize on the opportunity to capture and sustain a greater share of the market. Year-to-date, we have generated a significant increase in cash from operations. As Hal will discuss in a moment, we are reinvesting a meaningful portion of this incremental cash flow into our business with the strategic goal of emerging from this crisis stronger than before. The team at Tractor Supply is excited about how we will continue to be an innovative leader in our channel. Now I'll turn it back to Hal. Yes. Certainly, Peter. This is Kurt. And in regards to gross margin and the continuation of that, I'll first start by reflecting back on Q2, where we saw several factors that were favorable and across the board very ideal, and we were able to capitalize on that. And our priority will always be to continue to gain market share while trying to balance good solid gross margin. So as we compare Q2 versus looking ahead, for Q3 and forward, we'll continue to stay focused on EDLP, which does support less promotions. As you just heard Seth mention, our inventory is in its cleanest shape. And so we anticipate some less offseason transition or clearance.  And then we did see some benefit in Q2 on transportation efficiencies. We think that will continue, but albeit at a more moderated level as we start to cycle some of the benefits in the [Technical Difficulty]. We anticipate strong gross margin performance year-over-year. The key drivers of product mix and promotional may not have as strong of a benefit in the second half, but we do continue to think that there's benefit from both of those and the opportunity we have with good, solid, clean inventory going into it. So you'll see from our guide that we anticipate momentum and continued year-over-year strong growth or performance in gross margin. Yes. Peter, this is Kurt. Thanks for the question. In regards to the comp sales, I'll address the point you made on the second quarter first and then pivot from there to kind of help with the third quarter. We saw, while unprecedented volumes amazingly, consistent performance throughout the second quarter, all 3 months at a fairly strong elevated level. And even when we look at the 2-year stack month-to-month, just continue to show the consistency between April, May and June. And as I mentioned, the level of performance continues through July. We do anticipate that as with what we can see today and having a -- it's just volatile and uncertainty in there that the reasons I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we could anticipate seeing some moderation. And to your point earlier, I believe the strength of the core business is a good indicator of where we would see the third quarter and the last half of the third quarter potentially more falling in the range. So we're giving some prudent evaluation to some of the tailwinds that could have less benefit, causing us in the third quarter while starting off strong to really end in the range that we gave in our overall guidance."

I want to start off by recognizing this is an extraordinary time. First and foremost, this is a human health crisis, and secondarily a global economic crisis. We hope your loved ones and your family are healthy and safe.  We're living in a generational moment that is unprecedented. Each day requires a close inspection of a very dynamic external environment and a clear determination of how we'll respond. While our call this morning is about our first quarter results, we will focus more on updating you on where we are with the crisis at hand, how we\u2019re navigating the uncertainty and how we are responding to strengthen our business. I want to start by thanking the entire Tractor Supply team who has truly come together to ensure we are taking care of the health, safety and well-being of each other and our customers. This is our absolute, soul, number one focus priority.  The culture and purpose driven nature of Tractor Supply has served us well in responding at this critical time. It has never been more clear or more evident of what an advantage this strong foundation is to the company. I'm incredibly proud of how the Tractor Supply team and our vendor partners have stepped up to every challenge.  Our goal is to make sure we come out of this pandemic stronger. Stepping back, let me share with you how we\u2019ve approached this crisis. As the virus began to gain traction in China, we put together a cross functional team that was dominantly focused on our supply chain. This team worked with each of our factory partners at a purchase order level to identify issues and coordinate substitution products and other merchandising actions that we needed to take to ensure we have product to support the spring and summer seasons.  As the COVID-19 evolved and it became more clear that it would impact the United States and our retail operations here, we chartered a global pandemic response team that was grounded in our previous business continuity planning processes that we had put together. This team is a broad reaching, cross functional team. It has been meeting twice a day, seven days per week since late February, that it\u2019s included not only the Tractor Supply team members, but also supplemental third-party members that can help us on both medical as well as risk and liability.  They are empowered to move fast and make decisions. They have served as the central nervous system for the bulk of our response. As an essential needs based retailer, we are focused on being there for our team members, customers and communities in this unprecedented and uncertain time.  I'd like to take some time to highlight some of the ways that we\u2019ve responded to the COVID-19.  Starting on March 16, for our frontline team members, we began awarding appreciation bonuses. For example, hourly team members receive an incremental $2 per hour. Early on we extended sick pay leave by two weeks for both full and part time team members who self-report contagious flu or COVID-19 like symptoms.  We do not want anyone to come to work who is sick, and we've been very clear on that with our team members. If they're sick, we want them to stay home and get better. To-date we've had over 1,500 team members utilized this sick pay benefits.  We recently announced 100% coverage of COVID-19 medical treatment for team members under the company's medical plan and we're also waiving cost sharing fees for telehealth visits. We've increased personal protective equipment for team members, along with installing plexiglass barriers at cashier stands in stores and expedited the rollout out contactless payment options. We embarked on our most ambitious hiring drive ever, with plans to fill more than 5,000 full time and part time team member positions across our stores and distribution centers. Since our announcement we are seeing significant increases in applications and hiring, and all time hiring week highs.  To continue to enhance the safety of our in-store shopping experience, we've added a dedicated greeter at every store to drive awareness of social distancing, monitor the number of customers in our store and provide additional cleaning support, particularly carts.  We also have modified our store operating hours, and added a designated shopping hour for high risk in seniors 60 and older, while adding store labor hours to improve customer service and safety. We've added incremental inventory to support high velocity consumable skews that our customers count on us to have in stock, as their dependable and essential supplier. We also launched our first national advertising campaign in over a decade to say thank you to our team members and customers. Over the first 10 days that our first TV commercial was shown, it was seen by over 2,200 times with the reach of approximately 700 million impressions, and then just last week released our second ad as a part of this campaign.  To support our team members and communities, we\u2019ve made a commitment of $2 million. This includes a $0.5 million of existing Tractor Supply Employee Assistance fund to assist team members most impacted by COVID-19, and $1.5 million for the establishment of the Tractor Supply Company Foundation, and this foundation will be committed to the growth and development of our rural areas with initial focus on the COVID-19 recovery efforts in these rural markets.  This is a highly fluid crisis, and these are historically unprecedented times. There are broad range of outcomes of how our business will perform in the coming weeks and months, depending on how the crisis evolves. We are doing everything we can to think through how the next several months will play out. We are leveraging our past experiences; we are leveraging numerous third party resources, all to assess the uncertainties and to take very calculated actions.  Some of the uncertainties we are thinking about are how the macro economic factors will evolve, including unemployment and GDP, the impact of the crisis on consumer shopping patterns, the impact of legislation such as the CARES Act on consumer and small businesses, the degree of quarantine measures that may still occur, either in the near term or in the fall season, and then the degree of uncertainty in the economy for the rest of 2020, as well as the degree, the incremental cost of doing business as an essential needs based retailer in the current environment.  With these uncertainties we've taken action to increase our cash on hand. We\u2019ve suspended our share buyback program, we re-prioritized our capital spending and we\u2019re controlling discretionary costs, all the while maintaining our dividend.  Now let me talk about some of the other things we're seeing and experiencing. We are seeing significant changes in consumer shopping behavior, from trip consolidation to their preferences for contactless payments, to their preferences for curbside pickup, and home delivery. And I believe the crisis represents an opportunity for us and we are moving rapidly to capitalize on those opportunities.  We are reprioritizing our capital spent to reflect the changes we're seeing at our consumer shopping behavior and a few things we\u2019ve announced recently. Three weeks ago we launched curbside delivery for our buy-online pick-up-in-stores nationwide. At the same time we also established two dedicated parking spots at every store in the country that are for buy-online, pick-up-in-store or court curbside deliveries.  For curbside delivery, all a customer has to do is order online, when they get an email that says it's available to be picked up, they drive to our store, they pull in one of these two conveniently located parking spots, they call the store and then we bring the items right out to their car in a very contactless way. We\u2019ve seen significant increases in buy-online, pick-up-in-store orders and customer adoption of curbside pickup has been remarkable. With more than 70% of our recent buy-online, pick-up-in store orders utilizing the curbside pickup option.  To enhance the safety of the customer shopping experience and provide greater convenience, we increased by 50% our mobile point of sale hardware capacity in our stores. These additional devices allow our team members to do a number of activities, including line breaking, where we've got queuing occurring at our registers that conduct outside transactions that may be incremental orders occurring on a box transaction, order to help fill up propane and be able to allow the customer to pay right there, and they also allow us to execute curbside delivery. We've got an app that can fully check off the delivery, all contactless.  In less than three weeks we expanded our same-day, next-day delivery offering from about 400 stores or 20% of the chain to all stores. This is a great example of how we're accelerating our capabilities to be more relevant to our customers. We realize this could become a point of differentiation for Tractor Supply and we move fast to capitalize on our customers\u2019 needs for delivery.  In partnership with Roadie, we had plans over the coming year to continue to increase the number of stores that are offering same day and next day as a delivery option. However, given the escalation of the COVID pandemic, customers demand for delivery services became more pronounced and so we responded. Together with Roadie, the team worked and we accelerated the ramp up of same day delivery across the remaining 80% of our stores, again doing this all in about a three week time frame.  Tractor Supply now offers customers the safety and convenience of same day and next day delivery on almost all the inventory in our stores, nearly 15,000 items that our customers need to live the life out there. This includes things like livestock feed, dog food, power tools, Tillers, Riding Lawn Mower, Chicken Coops and even more. They can order all these, have them picked out of our stores, loaded into trucks and cars and brought to their homes, all without having to ever leave their farm or home. We are now the nation's first major general merchandise retailer to offer same day delivery from a 100% of our stores.  Overall during the pandemic, our feedback from our customers has been very positive, with improving customer satisfaction scores. When I am visiting stores, our customers share with me how important Tractor Supply is for them and their families. You can see it on all our social media like Facebook and Instagram. This upbeat customer feedback is very inspiring to the team and reinforcing of them to do what they're doing, which is service to our customers and take care of their team members.  To briefly touch on the first quarter, the Tractor Supply team delivered strong comparable store sales and strategically invested in our operations at the COVID-19 crisis evolved. Importantly, and most importantly, we were there for our team members and customers as the dependable supplier of needs based essentials.  Prior to early March we were on track for an estimated comparable store sales growth in the range of 1% to 1.5% for the quarter. As one of the warmest winters on record, impacted our seasonal businesses in January and February, as well we were lapping a strong 5% comp in the prior year.  Over the last three weeks of the quarter though, as COVID-19 rapidly evolved, we experienced a strong increase in our sales volume as our customers relied on us for the essential everyday products they needed in the face of this crisis.  At the last several weeks to the quarter showed, our customers view us as a critical need, as critical to the needs of their animals and pets, just as the grocery store is to the needs of their family. We experience strength in key essential categories like livestock feed, pet food, heating fuel and other core consumable products as our customers stocked up for their anticipated need. Our e-commerce business experienced remarkable growth as we move through March and that growth is continuing in the second quarter.  The importance of our store network is evident with the strong growth in buy-online, pick-up in-store and it's a more cost effective way for us to fulfill these online orders. This is another area where we're seeing rapid adoption by customers. In the latter half of March nearly 30% of our buy-online pick-up in-store orders were from new customers. Along with that, 65% of the orders were by customers that were using this service for the first time.  As we saw the stock up activity start to slow, our sales activity has continued to stay strong as we're now three weeks into the quarter. Categories that involve living a more sustainable life and enjoying the outdoors are experiencing robust growth. Our customers are engaging in activities such as backyard gardening, lawn care, landscaping, homesteading, fencing and backyard poultry, all these categories are strong and they are playing to our strength. From a customer perspective we're growing with existing customers, but also gaining new customers. Within our Neighbor's Club we're seeing existing customers making their first purchase in other categories, in pet food and livestock feed, poultry departments starting to cross shop like they have not before. In addition, we're reactivating members and we're experiencing record highs in our new customers.  In summary, the first quarter represented solid performance by the team and the second quarter is off to a strong start. I'm incredibly grateful to our store teams who are the heart of our relationship with our customers and our distribution centers who keep the critical supply chain moving. As we look forward to the reopening of the economy, I'm very proud of the opportunity for Tractor Supply to participate in the President's Great American Economic Revival Committee. It is an honor to represent the company and rural America.  Now, I'll return the call over to Kurt to go through some financial highlights and I will come back to share more of what we're doing proactively. \nKurt Barton : Thank you, Hal, and good morning everyone. I hope you, your families and loved ones are safe and healthy. I\u2019ll walk through the highlights of our results for the first quarter and then share what we are doing to respond to the challenges of COVID-19 from a financial perspective.  For the first quarter of 2020 net sales increased 7.5% as we had strong comp store sales growth of 4.3%. The comp store sales growth was driven by a 5.4% increase in comp average ticket, and a 1.1% decrease in comp transactions.  The declining comp transactions resulted principally from two factors. First, the difficult compares in January and February due to the prior year\u2019s strong winter selling season; and second, we believe consumers consolidated shopping trips in March under the current environment as Hal discussed.  Our average ticket was driven by strong units per transaction growth as customers stocked up for essentials. Commodity price inflation had a slight impact on average ticket as inflationary trends moderated during the quarter. As we shared previously, January and February in total tracked in line with our expectations with March up 12% given the stock-up sales we experienced.  For the quarter we had robust growth in our consumable, usable, netable categories with declines in discretionary, clothing and footwear, and to a lesser degree declines in our winter seasonal categories given the milder winter.  Big ticket sales increased in line with our overall comparable store sales growth. Safes, heating stoves, Tillers, Trailers and Generators were drivers of this growth, partially offset by declines in snow blowers and compressors.  For the first quarter gross margin was essentially flat to prior year at 33.8%. The gross margin performance reflected a favorable benefit from transportation costs as a percentage of net sales. Our efforts in 2019 help drive lower year-over-year average carrier rates, as well as reduced average stem miles. Fuel rates were modestly favorable compared to prior year.  The transportation benefit was offset by the strong sell-through of consumable merchandise, which generally carried below chain average gross margin rates, and greater markdowns of winter seasonal merchandise.  Including depreciation, amortization, SG&A as a percentage of net sales improved by seven basis points to 28%. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in comparable store sales, and a net benefit from legal settlements, primarily from the favorable settlement in the Visa MasterCard, interchange fee class action lawsuit.  Partially offsetting these favorable items, certain first quarter costs as a percentage of net sales were higher than the prior year. These were driven by approximately $7 million of incremental costs from COVID-19, such as investments in team member pay and benefits; the impact of additional labor hours, and supply costs dedicated to COVID-19 cleaning actions, and the charitable contributions through our Tractor Supply Foundation to support our team members and our communities during these crisis.  Additionally, specific to the Frankford distribution center, we estimate approximately 10 basis points of impact on SG&A as we had not fully cycled the opening of this new DC, until the latter part of the first quarter.  All in, we are pleased with our performance which helped to contribute to modest operating profit increase. Diluted earnings per share was $0.71, an increase of 12.7%. For the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of our common stock for $263 million and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling about $41 million.  As we move into the second quarter, demand for our products and services continues to be very strong. We believe Tractor Supply is benefiting from the favorable spring weather and the consumer trends associated with COVID-19. As a team, the stores and the distribution centers are well prepared for the spring, the busy spring summer season. We are focused on capturing current opportunities, while managing for the long term.  Turning now to how we are responding to the challenges of COVID-19. We are laser focused on what is within our control. We are looking to capitalize on opportunities and investing in the future, while balancing liquidity and cost mitigation. We're actively managing our supply chain and inventory levels to support key categories where there are strong sales trends. On cost management, we're reviewing all discretionary spending and reducing spending that isn\u2019t appropriate given the macro economic outlook. As an essential needs based retailer, we are faced with an elevated cost outlook for the second quarter in the range of a net incremental cost of $30 million to $50 million. These incremental costs are attributable to the appreciation bonus for our frontline team members, increased store labor and higher safety and cleaning costs.  As this is a very fluid situation, the degree of how these incremental costs will play out for the second quarter, as well as the second half of the year will be determined by the length and depth of this crisis. We continue to forecast capital spending in the range of $225 million to $275 million. We are deferring spending in certain areas, while accelerating spending in digital and other more consumer facing areas to capitalize on the trends that Hal mentioned.  In regard to our new store opening, we remain confident in our 2,500 store target and we are currently on track with our new store opening schedule for 2020. That said, given the practical realities created by the disruption of COVID-19, we believe there is potential for the timing of some of our new store openings to be delayed. This could push some store openings to later in the year or even some into fiscal 2021.  Finally, I'd like to take the opportunity to provide more insight into our ability to navigate COVID-19 from a liquidity standpoint. Given our financial strength, we are confident that we'll be able to maintain appropriate liquidity as we manage through the current crisis. To free up additional equity within our existing credit facility, we executed an accordion loan of $200 million in March and just this week we executed a $350 million loan within our existing bank group.  We currently have over $800 million on hand in cash and cash equivalents, with approximately $165 million of additional liquidity available if needed. To further enhance our financial flexibility, we have also temporarily suspended our share repurchase program effective March 12.  While our quarterly cash dividend is determined each quarter, we do not anticipate suspending or reducing our dividend at this time. Given the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis and the significant economic uncertainty it introduces, we made the decision on April 7 to withdraw our guidance. Once we believe that we have sufficient visibility to reinstate guidance, we will do so.  Tractor Supply successfully weathered business cycles over time. I believe our strong financial position will continue to serve us well in the future, and we are taking the steps to position us to come out of this crisis a stronger company.  As that completes our financial overview, I will turn it back to Hal. \nHal Lawton : Thank you, Kurt. Our top priority is the safety and health of our team members and customers. In the current environment, we are more relevant than ever to our existing customer base. At the same time, we are acquiring new customers and seeing market share gains as a result. We are taking this opportunity to invest in the business, do the right thing to support our team members, but also to strengthen our position.  It seems like a long time ago, but many of us were together on March 10, and during that time we share with you some of our early insights on the business and all those items that we discussed, all still are true and are very relevant and you've heard many and them sprinkled through our comments today. We will certainly be leaning into those as we make our investment decisions through the second quarter and the second half of the year. We are not losing sight of the long term.  During these times, we will focus on the strategic opportunities to serve our existing customers, while also expanding our reach. I believe that the strength of a company is shown in a time of crisis. I am confident in this company. We are navigating this one by leveraging our strength and pursuing opportunities that will help us thrive over the long term.  Tractor Supply is a very resilient business with a proven business model. In closing, my thanks and gratitude go to the entire Tractor Supply team. Thank you.  With that, Mary Winn we are ready for Q&A. \nMary Winn Pilkington : Great! Christina, we\u2019ll open up the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, please go ahead. \nSimeon Gutman : Thanks. Good morning everyone. My first question is on thinking about demand, realizing and respecting that you know there's no guidance and we're in a fluid situation. Thinking about the stocking up in your business, maybe a hangover period and then some normalization, how are you thinking about it and can you glean anything since you have a pretty diverse store base? Yes, you're more or less open, but states have different restrictions and so maybe you have some insight around timing. But just trying to think if we're going to see some peaks and valleys here as we move through the next few months or quarters? \nHal Lawton : Hi Simeon, good morning. This is Hal. Yeah so, maybe I'll just kind of walk through a little bit around kind of the three phases that we have seen in our business and then just talk about how we're thinking about it.  So, the first phase is exactly as you articulated. The last three weeks of March we saw substantive stock up behavior, material stock-up behavior. As we said in the month of March, our comps were 20%. For those three weeks \u2013 sorry, my apologies. For those three weeks our comps were 20%, the comp of March 12%. And that was really driven in areas like livestock feed and pet food and things like propane, these very essential almost grocery like categories that our customers rely on us for.  As the first kind of week of quarantine really took hold across the country, that first week of April, we did see some early give back across the hand, really more than just a few days. And then really for the full three weeks of April here's, as we said our sales have been very strong, and they've really transitioned from kind of livestock and pet food feed stock up, to much more the things that I shared earlier on around the life out here lifestyle; things from homesteading and fence management and fence building to poultry and chickens and coops, to sustainable living, to gardening, to landscaping, to lawn care, all those things are really what are driving our business right now, and what we're finding is that you know our existing customers are shopping, they are cross shopping categories in an increased way. We're seeing reactivated customers, customers that haven\u2019t shopped with us in over 12 months in the store, and we're seeing new customers in our store at an all-time high.  What I'd say is that now I'm going to transition a little bit on how we are thinking about it. There are a variety of goes-ins and goes-out that are impacting our business. And we are monitoring all the data on a minute-by-minute hourly basis to take very calculated decisions on how we're driving the business.  One big \u2013 in fact there\u2019s several factors, and I\u2019ll hit each one of them quickly. One big factor is the fact that 50% of retail is closed and so pick your number. Even if GDP is down 20% or 25% and there's a much smaller pie, but there is only 50% of retailers. So while it\u2019s a smaller pie, there's a bigger piece of the pie for those retailers that are open.  And how that plays out, as there has been a big category shift to spend during that time if you look at things like food service and retail and I mean clothing, and apparel and entertainment and travel, all those are way down, significantly down and I think there's a big, there's a significant out of category shift happening across consumer spending right now that we're benefiting from.  The second thing I would say is where our stores are located. I think you're seeing this widely talked about in media and you can see in the caseloads that are reported publicly, but we can also see in our results that the more rural the store is the better the performance of that story is, and as we all know just the COVID cases as a percent of population not as dense in those areas, and also the rulers of the country have remained kind of more so open during this time.  The third thing I\u2019d talk about is convenience. Our stores, both the format size, the work we've done on our website to create convenient fulfillment options and our \u2013 and the location of our stores typically with a very acceptable parking lot, I think have benefited us for a convenience and being an inviting perspective.  Now those are a lot of the things that are positive, some of those could have some shifts that go against this. I\u2019d say on the flip side, we are absolutely watching how are the reopenings occurring, how is GDP occurring, is consumer spending starting to shift as thing start to reopen and what is that going to mean for us. We are also just watching unemployment overall. We're starting to watch unemployment, how it might affect rural areas and would some of that rural benefit start to give itself back. Certain industries that are in rural areas don't reopen or continue to stay closed.  You know we are watching all those, all those nuances, very, very closely and I\u2019d say collectively up until now they've been very favorable for us, but it's very uncertain how they'll play out over the next month, back half of the year, and really until we reach to either a new normal or a vaccine and we get back to normal. But those are many of the things that we are looking at and a lot of goes-in\u2019s and goes-out\u2019s, up until now very \u2013 it\u2019s going our way, but we're being very calculated in all the actions were taking.  Kurt, anything you\u2019d want to add. \nA \u2013 Kurt Barton : No, I think you hit that and we are recognizing that the favorable items and tail-winds today can shift at any one point in time and it\u2019s just there is a lot of uncertainty and that's, I think what's reflected in the prepared remarks and the release that we issued today. \nSimeon Gutman : That's fair. My one related follow up is anything to glean positive or negative yet in oil markets and you know you can understand the premise of that question. \nA - Kurt Barton: Yes. I mean this is Kurt. I mean certainly the oil market is a very fluid situation, so we're watching it very closely and right now our data is showing us that we're seeing limited impact or decline, but we recognize how quickly and how fluid this situation is. So two points maybe they give you on that, on how we're looking at it. First, I'd say we do anticipate based on the forecast and the fact that there is such a strong supply with a real softness in the demand for oil, that there's got to be some supply taken out, and so the pressure on that local economy will likely exist. We do believe though this is still somewhat different than historical experiences that impacted Tractor Supply like in 2016. And as an example, in 2016, we saw after coming off a peak, 1,800 rig counts went down to about 400 in an 18 month period of time.  In 2020 we're seeing that the rig counts have sustained over the last year, so around 7 to 900, a little over 700 today. Various forecasts show that that may be cut in half and you could be seeing 700 out of 350, so it's quite a bit different in regards to the decline.  The second point is just to remind around our exposure. About 10% to 12% of our stores are in markets where there's oil economy and historically only a percentage of our products have been impacted. So it's a percentage of product in a small percentage of our stores and we will be flexible and nimble in flexing in our product, but while this could prove to be a headwind in the near term, it again is a small percent of our stores and we believe that the strength of our business models needs base can certainly perform well in this situation. \nSimeon Gutman : Thank you. Good luck!\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Baker from Instinet. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Baker: Hi! A couple of follow-ups there and Hal, what a time to start as CEO, but I commend you on the job you're doing.  I'm wondering if you can quantify some things. For instance, the spread between some of your more rural stores or stores that aren't in at rural locations or even quantify April to-date relative to the 20% you're running towards the end of March. And I guess I'll ask up front to the extent that you pass on quantifying, although I think it would be helpful. I did want to ask about the cost.  Why are we looking at $30 million to $50 million in the second quarter versus only $7 million in the first quarter, understanding that the impact in terms of the number of months in the second quarter could be longer. For us its only started towards the end of March, but still that seems like a big increase. Thanks. \nA - Hal Lawton: Hi, this is Hal Lawton. I\u2019ll answer the first couple of components to the question and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Kurt to handle the last part of the question. We're not prepared today to share specific numbers, but what I would say is we are seeing material differences.  First off, I\u2019ll start with all of our stores are generally kind of rural or suburban and we have kind of shades of grey even in the context of that, the way we evaluate and look at our stores. And I guess I'd say is, the more rural the store is, the better the store is performing, speaking generically, and then the closer the city is to an urban area, the lesser the stores performing, kind of speaking generically, and we can kind of map that out. We really see the gradients of their sales performance across almost any category and so you know as you all know, the bulk of our stores are in rural America and core rural America and so that is benefited favorably and I do think many other companies have been talking about a very similar trend.  And then on April to-date, I think what we just say is the growth and the strength that we saw in March has continued into April and we're very pleased with our April results so far. As we said, the customer's category, our behavior has changed significantly and in my view, in a very positive way, the category is demonstrating the essential needs in orientation of our business and into the kind of people's lives and their livelihood and their families and their needs and it's gotten very broad across landscaping, gardening, sustainable living, fencing, homesteading, home care, you know things that really speak to the fullness of the product offering that we as a business carry. So rural stores are very strong. April to-date continues the momentum from March and I\u2019ll turn it over to Kurt and talk about the cost, Q1 versus Q2.\nKurt Barton: Sure Michael, this is Kurt. And in regards to the range of these additional expenses and the difference between Q1 and Q2, first let me just point out the differences between the quarters. You'll recognize from some of the business updates and releases we started to produce in the mid part of March and later that, the efforts that we took in regards to wages, labor and safety and cleaning began in those last three weeks of the quarter. So those expenses that we pointed out for Q1 were principally in the last few weeks of the first quarter and the expectation as we continue to do that and more just extends throughout the second quarter. Let me just talk about what these costs represent and then how it plays out. The bulk of these costs, about 80% roughly is labor related or benefits related and Hal spoke to much of those in his prepared remarks. Most of the remaining 20% is for supplies and safety and cleaning and how that plays out throughout the quarter or even in the second half, as I mentioned, it really depends on the extent and depth of this crisis, specific to Q2.  The low end of the range assumes that these efforts play out through all of April and May. The high end of that range would assume that we extend all of the wage, the benefits or cleaning if the prices would require that, all the way throughout the second quarter. So that's a way you can think about the cost of how it would impact into the second quarter. \nMichael Baker: Thanks. We\u2019ll talk about a related follow-up with how \u2013 it sounds like some of the sales trends in April are strong, but different mix, so I presumed that would have a less negative impact on your gross margin. It seems like it\u2019s being less dominated by Q and more by some of these outdoor areas which I would think would have better margins than Q products. Is that a fair assessment? \nA - Hal Lawton: Yeah, I think that's roughly fair. The other thing I'll add is, and again you know we\u2019ll see how the next two months play out. But like most other retailers that are open, we have pull back on discounting, on coupons, on promotions, you know in the spirit of not trying to drive too much traffic on one day, driving queuing, you know just trying to have more of an everyday ongoing. Really what's the core of us anyway in everyday low price business, which is what we do well every day, and so I think you know we'll see how the next couple months play out and whether or not we \u2013 you know how we need to manage that going forward. That\u2019ll be \u2013 that's something else that you know it's part of our strategy we've been trying to implement. \nMichael Baker: Great, I appreciate all the time. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning. I wanted to start with the Roadie Partnership, right. Clearly a significant accomplishment like to roll up the program in such a short period of time, but how could your same-day, next-day delivery offering evolve, right. As I believe you were or have been testing a few options over the past couple years, what made Roadie the right choice today and/or should we expect incremental investments to maybe alternative forms or options throughout this year as you test and learn from this initiative?\nHal Lawton: Hi Steve, it is Hal. Thank you so much for your question. Hope you're doing well. Yes, to start at the highest level and just say our aspiration is that customers can buy anywhere anytime and get it delivered or picked up or shop with us in any way they want, and you know we talked a little bit about this in early March, in continuing the digitization and omni-channel efforts for Tractor Supply.  Given the COVID-19, you know we rapidly accelerated the rollout of same-day, next-day delivery and I'm just \u2013 I can't say enough about the flexibility and the speed of urgency and just to the implementation precision of Roadie, of our stores and our technology team to really get this executed in a really good way.  Roadie\u2019s been a partner of ours for some time. You know I have a really high regard for them. I worked with them when I was at Home Depot over five years ago now and they're \u2013 you know they serve a large number of retailers in a similar capacity. And since we already had 400 stores rolled out with them, from a speed perspective moving national with them made the most sense, and they do an excellent job. I've had several orders in the last couple of weeks delivered to myself, as have Kurt.  What I would say is though, we know that we need to have a best-in-class solution and that requires us to test a variety of options, and so we're in the process of doing that. We have the Roadie solution as they have kind of built out and is kind of their normal Roadie Solution in all of our stores right now.  We\u2019re going to take in a subset of stores. We have two different subsets of stores, each 250 in size, where over the next two months we will start rolling out some different pilots. One of those will be a dedicated truck and a dedicated trailer and a dedicated driver that are all owned and operated and staffed with a Tractor Supply team member. So that will be a Tractor Supply branded truck, Tractor Supply branded trailer and also tracked by a team member who will be responsible for the delivery. They also will work our stores to do additional B2B intercepts and to drive kind of that, you know that more sales force oriented like delivery model. And then in another 250 stores we\u2019re working with Roadie to replicate something that\u2019s in between their offering and what we're doing with our own branded truck to have a dedicated truck and a dedicated trailer. It expands the offering of products so that they can deliver, also slightly lowers the cost and that will evaluate those three offerings over the next few months and then provide a further update and then of course rollout the solution that we think that are most needed by our customers.  But again in summary, we know that this is where we have to go. Incredibly pleased with the speed at which we moved and we're continuing to test and pilot, to make sure we've got the right solution and at the end of the day we're committed to taking advantage of this opportunity, and as we get to our new normal and hopefully back to normal for Tractor Supply to have emerged in a much stronger place than we were when we started the coronavirus. \nSteven Forbes: Thank you for that. And then just a quick follow up. I think I thought you mentioned strength in new customer growth. I don't know if you can provide some color on how these customers, maybe whether its demographic or the baskets have compared to the average customer. Are they shopping multiple categories or just a few, and then you know a comment may be on the initial initiatives right around customer retention, as you think about growing your customer base. \nA - Hal Lawton: As I said in my prepared remarks, we're seeing unprecedented really record breaking new customer shopping with Tractor Supply and those customers are shopping with us, both on our e-commerce platform, as well as in store. They're leveraging by-online, pick-up-in-store curbside delivery. As I mentioned earlier, there's a large percentage of new customers that are using that.  But as they shop with us inside of our stores, they're shopping across a whole range of categories and you know whether it be pet food or whether it be a more sustainable lawn care landscaping type offerings, so we\u2019re seeing broad shopping behavior from them we're seeing them really engage in many of our new offerings that we rolled out in the last few weeks, including curbside delivery. As it relates to customer retention, you know I'm really pleased with the efforts that the marketing team has taken over the last few weeks. As we've gone in and put in a welcome to the Tractor Supply kind of customer kit in place and day one, day seven, day 14, what are we doing with these customers? How are we touching them? How are we reminding them that we\u2019re here for them? How are we continuing to engage with them, we\u2019re doing that \u2013 and we're doing that not only just in a generic way, but we're also doing it based on the specific categories that they purchased, and the way they purchased with us.  And so, if they bought online with us for the first time, that way we kind of say \u201chey, wasn\u2019t that great? Hope you enjoyed your experience. Let me tell you about some other things we are doing.\u201d If they bought pet food, were saying \u201cHey, thanks for buying pet food. By the way you can sign-up for subscription for us, but you also have a bunch of other categories you can shop with us.\u201d So really, you know textbook like, kind of new customer onboarding program that we've rapidly implemented over the last few weeks to make sure that these new customers are retained. \nSteven Forbes: Thank you, and stay well everyone. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Hal, you laid out a lot of the macro and big picture uncertainties that are going to impact your business. But under what conditions do you think your comps will turn negative and when do you think that critical point is when you'll know. \nKurt Barton : Michael, this is Kurt. Let me take that. Hal pointed out a number of the uncertainties, certainly the things that are favorable to the business right now and all the potential for uncertainty in the near term and even in the back half. The key factors that we were looking at and he mentioned those, we are keeping a close eye on unemployment and consumer sentiment. The timing and extent of the COVID-19 health crisis could impact it, and is there a shift to the impact on rural markets, and then weather always can play a bit of an impact, if you just threw that in there outside of some of the crisis type items.  And those would be the primary ones that we're watching. Most of those are tailwinds right now, and if those were to flip any of those or a combination of those could have that level of impact on the business. But importantly we're confident in our business model and probably never been more evident than these times right now. The strength of our model and being a needs based business in the rural market. So as you can hear, we've got a lot of confidence in our business model and our ability to weather those situations. \nMichael Lasser: Just to follow-up on the timing question. At what point do you exit \u2013 traditionally exit the seasonal lawn and garden category? Is it possible that all of that just didn\u2019t pull forward right now to this timeframe, because folks just staying at home and do have some time on their hands. And then as part of that timing question, there has been some massive declines in a lot of commodity costs, not just oil but across the board. When do you expect to start to see that deflationary impact on your business and what's the reasonable expectation for deflation in the back half of the year? \nKurt Barton : Yeah Michael, this is Kurt. Why don't I first address the question on inflation and then I'll toss it over to Seth on timing of product sales. On the inflationary side of it, as I indicated we saw some slight inflationary benefit in the first quarter. In those particulars as you mentioned, we look at it similarly, there are indications in the near term on both oil and corn that in the near term there's more indicators of deflationary pressures in the business. And we would anticipate as it works its way through the supply chain, that in both of those cases we might start to see some modest deflation even playing into second quarter.  And while hard to predict, if following all the forecasts in both of those categories, we would see that pressure may begin to increase a bit more in the second half of the year, and we're going to be watching it carefully. This is about the best we could probably indicate on prediction of this at this point. \nSeth Estep : Great! Thanks Kurt. Hey Michael, this is Seth. \nMichael Lasser: Hey Seth. \nSeth Estep : Hey! In terms of your question as far as you know potential pull forward and just kind of lawn and garden, you know as you look at the current consumer trends and the shifts in spending activity that Hal spoke to earlier, we believe that there continues to be a runway ahead of us, because not only are we seeing the strength of this among our current customer base, but this is also one of those areas we're seeing new customers engage at Tractor Supply, within some of the new brands that we\u2019ve launched, the ability to partner with some of our key partners in these areas.  We continue to focus on areas such as gardening and increase those hobbies over the last few years, basically going just over 400 stores in certain key live goods to now over 1,700 stores and then when we shift into the summer months as well, you know we believe that consumers will still be around the house, and we're really starting to pivot some of our merchandising tactics and activities to linking parts for center court, as well as go after some of these backyard activities knowing that customers are going to continue to be around the house for the foreseeable future.  So I'm really proud of the work that the merchants are doing. Not only getting products back in stock to make sure we can be that essential retailer for our customers, but also as we look ahead to the future months to be able to go where the customers are going where we believe the hobbies and activities are going to take place. \nMichael Lasser: Thanks a lot, and best of luck! \nSeth Estep : Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nKate McShane: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could help us understand the puts and takes with regards to margin given the increased E-commerce demand you're seeing, especially in light of your change to one-day delivery and increased buy-online, pick-up-in-store, and how do you think it\u2019s evolved as the year goes on? \nKurt Barton : Yeah. Hey Kate, this is Kurt. In regards to the margins, let me just hit the gross margin quickly and then SG&A. While we\u2019ve seen strong growth as Hal mention online, he also mentioned a real strong percentage of that being the buy-online, pick-up-in-stores which does carry \u2013 which is really what the most effective/efficient way for us to sell online merchandise and not a significant pressure in Q1 one on the gross margin.  More specifically, the impact on gross margin, we saw about a 20-basis point impact on the shift in mix in the last few weeks of the quarter. So if you normalized for the mix shift in the last few weeks, the flat gross margin on a more comparable basis outside of that was running about 20 basis points up. That's about in line with our typical last few quarters.  From the expense side of the operating model, I pointed out the 10-basis point de-leverage from the new DC which we've cycled starting in Q2, and the net impact of the incremental COVID expenses offset by the favorable settlements were a few basis points. If you normalize that, SG&A actually, the seven-basis point leverage would be closer to more about a 20-basis point leverage on a compatible basis. \nKate McShane: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nChuck Cerankosky: Good morning everyone. Could you talk about how the balance sheet might normalize after this crisis is over? You've built up debt, built up cash. Is that an opportunity then to perhaps get quickly back into stock repurchase or dividend policy? What might happen there?\nKurt Barton : Yeah Chuck, this is Kurt. As we mentioned, we took some precautionary measures in this environment and in our capital allocation strategy, shifted our priority to liquidity in cash; that's the right prudent thing to do. The business is strong and as we work through this crisis and the macro economic factors and the uncertainties begin to become less uncertain and there's more normalized business, we would anticipate shifting our capital structure back a little bit more to where we previously were.  At this point we're going to emphasize for utmost precautions, just maintain a structure with additional cash. We believe that gives us a real strong position if there were to be a worst case scenario and I would not anticipate reengaging on share repurchases, while we are borrowed on these additional loans at this point.  So we could see ourselves paying those down. We have the ability to prepay whenever we want and upon prepaying down, we would re-evaluate our capital structure, particularly when to re-engage in share repurchases. \nChuck Cerankosky: And finally \u2013 thanks for that Kurt. And finally, Hal could you discuss what categories are in the home setting purchase group that you mentioned? \nHal Lawton: Yes. So hi, it\u2019s good to talk to you today Chuck. I would reference those in terms of those just things people are really doing around their farm and their ranches to just maintain and their homes. So we are seeing, if you think about in our stores if you want, fencing, T-post, you know you are looking at corral gate, you're looking at chickens, you looking at chicken coops, you look at the people creating gardens in their backyard and then buying the vegetables and the rakes and the hose to the tillers to create those. It's really just all the things that our customers do every single day.  You know they are incredibly and a terrible humanitarian crisis, but a byproduct of it is that you know families are spending more time at home and they are spending more time together outside and they are wanting to keep busy and we have really all the things, we are built for that. We are built purposely built to enable people to do those sorts of activities around their homes, their lands, their ranges and their farms and that's the sort of activity that we're seeing, that\u2019s the sort of categories we are seeing lift and drive the business. \nChuck Cerankosky: Thank you very much. Good luck for the rest of 2020. \nHal Lawton: Thank you. \nMary Winn Pilkington: Christina, this is Mary Winn. Now that we tipped the top of the hour, with that we\u2019ll wrap up our call. So everyone thanks for joining us today. I'm around if you need anything and we look forward to talking to you in July.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "A - Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Yes. I mean this is Kurt. I mean certainly the oil market is a very fluid situation, so we're watching it very closely and right now our data is showing us that we're seeing limited impact or decline, but we recognize how quickly and how fluid this situation is. So two points maybe they give you on that, on how we're looking at it. First, I'd say we do anticipate based on the forecast and the fact that there is such a strong supply with a real softness in the demand for oil, that there's got to be some supply taken out, and so the pressure on that local economy will likely exist. We do believe though this is still somewhat different than historical experiences that impacted Tractor Supply like in 2016. And as an example, in 2016, we saw after coming off a peak, 1,800 rig counts went down to about 400 in an 18 month period of time.  In 2020 we're seeing that the rig counts have sustained over the last year, so around 7 to 900, a little over 700 today. Various forecasts show that that may be cut in half and you could be seeing 700 out of 350, so it's quite a bit different in regards to the decline.  The second point is just to remind around our exposure. About 10% to 12% of our stores are in markets where there's oil economy and historically only a percentage of our products have been impacted. So it's a percentage of product in a small percentage of our stores and we will be flexible and nimble in flexing in our product, but while this could prove to be a headwind in the near term, it again is a small percent of our stores and we believe that the strength of our business models needs base can certainly perform well in this situation."

            "name": "A - Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Hi, this is Hal Lawton. I'll answer the first couple of components to the question and then I'll turn it over to Kurt to handle the last part of the question. We're not prepared today to share specific numbers, but what I would say is we are seeing material differences.  First off, I'll start with all of our stores are generally kind of rural or suburban and we have kind of shades of grey even in the context of that, the way we evaluate and look at our stores. And I guess I'd say is, the more rural the store is, the better the store is performing, speaking generically, and then the closer the city is to an urban area, the lesser the stores performing, kind of speaking generically, and we can kind of map that out. We really see the gradients of their sales performance across almost any category and so you know as you all know, the bulk of our stores are in rural America and core rural America and so that is benefited favorably and I do think many other companies have been talking about a very similar trend.  And then on April to-date, I think what we just say is the growth and the strength that we saw in March has continued into April and we're very pleased with our April results so far. As we said, the customer's category, our behavior has changed significantly and in my view, in a very positive way, the category is demonstrating the essential needs in orientation of our business and into the kind of people's lives and their livelihood and their families and their needs and it's gotten very broad across landscaping, gardening, sustainable living, fencing, homesteading, home care, you know things that really speak to the fullness of the product offering that we as a business carry. So rural stores are very strong. April to-date continues the momentum from March and I'll turn it over to Kurt and talk about the cost, Q1 versus Q2. Yeah, I think that's roughly fair. The other thing I'll add is, and again you know we'll see how the next two months play out. But like most other retailers that are open, we have pull back on discounting, on coupons, on promotions, you know in the spirit of not trying to drive too much traffic on one day, driving queuing, you know just trying to have more of an everyday ongoing. Really what's the core of us anyway in everyday low price business, which is what we do well every day, and so I think you know we'll see how the next couple months play out and whether or not we \u2013 you know how we need to manage that going forward. That'll be \u2013 that's something else that you know it's part of our strategy we've been trying to implement. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're seeing unprecedented really record breaking new customer shopping with Tractor Supply and those customers are shopping with us, both on our e-commerce platform, as well as in store. They're leveraging by-online, pick-up-in-store curbside delivery. As I mentioned earlier, there's a large percentage of new customers that are using that.  But as they shop with us inside of our stores, they're shopping across a whole range of categories and you know whether it be pet food or whether it be a more sustainable lawn care landscaping type offerings, so we're seeing broad shopping behavior from them we're seeing them really engage in many of our new offerings that we rolled out in the last few weeks, including curbside delivery. As it relates to customer retention, you know I'm really pleased with the efforts that the marketing team has taken over the last few weeks. As we've gone in and put in a welcome to the Tractor Supply kind of customer kit in place and day one, day seven, day 14, what are we doing with these customers? How are we touching them? How are we reminding them that we're here for them? How are we continuing to engage with them, we're doing that \u2013 and we're doing that not only just in a generic way, but we're also doing it based on the specific categories that they purchased, and the way they purchased with us.  And so, if they bought online with us for the first time, that way we kind of say \u201chey, wasn't that great? Hope you enjoyed your experience. Let me tell you about some other things we are doing.\u201d If they bought pet food, were saying \u201cHey, thanks for buying pet food. By the way you can sign-up for subscription for us, but you also have a bunch of other categories you can shop with us.\u201d So really, you know textbook like, kind of new customer onboarding program that we've rapidly implemented over the last few weeks to make sure that these new customers are retained."

            "name": "Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. I want to start off by recognizing this is an extraordinary time. First and foremost, this is a human health crisis, and secondarily a global economic crisis. We hope your loved ones and your family are healthy and safe.  We're living in a generational moment that is unprecedented. Each day requires a close inspection of a very dynamic external environment and a clear determination of how we'll respond. While our call this morning is about our first quarter results, we will focus more on updating you on where we are with the crisis at hand, how we're navigating the uncertainty and how we are responding to strengthen our business. I want to start by thanking the entire Tractor Supply team who has truly come together to ensure we are taking care of the health, safety and well-being of each other and our customers. This is our absolute, soul, number one focus priority.  The culture and purpose driven nature of Tractor Supply has served us well in responding at this critical time. It has never been more clear or more evident of what an advantage this strong foundation is to the company. I'm incredibly proud of how the Tractor Supply team and our vendor partners have stepped up to every challenge.  Our goal is to make sure we come out of this pandemic stronger. Stepping back, let me share with you how we've approached this crisis. As the virus began to gain traction in China, we put together a cross functional team that was dominantly focused on our supply chain. This team worked with each of our factory partners at a purchase order level to identify issues and coordinate substitution products and other merchandising actions that we needed to take to ensure we have product to support the spring and summer seasons.  As the COVID-19 evolved and it became more clear that it would impact the United States and our retail operations here, we chartered a global pandemic response team that was grounded in our previous business continuity planning processes that we had put together. This team is a broad reaching, cross functional team. It has been meeting twice a day, seven days per week since late February, that it's included not only the Tractor Supply team members, but also supplemental third-party members that can help us on both medical as well as risk and liability.  They are empowered to move fast and make decisions. They have served as the central nervous system for the bulk of our response. As an essential needs based retailer, we are focused on being there for our team members, customers and communities in this unprecedented and uncertain time.  I'd like to take some time to highlight some of the ways that we've responded to the COVID-19.  Starting on March 16, for our frontline team members, we began awarding appreciation bonuses. For example, hourly team members receive an incremental $2 per hour. Early on we extended sick pay leave by two weeks for both full and part time team members who self-report contagious flu or COVID-19 like symptoms.  We do not want anyone to come to work who is sick, and we've been very clear on that with our team members. If they're sick, we want them to stay home and get better. To-date we've had over 1,500 team members utilized this sick pay benefits.  We recently announced 100% coverage of COVID-19 medical treatment for team members under the company's medical plan and we're also waiving cost sharing fees for telehealth visits. We've increased personal protective equipment for team members, along with installing plexiglass barriers at cashier stands in stores and expedited the rollout out contactless payment options. We embarked on our most ambitious hiring drive ever, with plans to fill more than 5,000 full time and part time team member positions across our stores and distribution centers. Since our announcement we are seeing significant increases in applications and hiring, and all time hiring week highs.  To continue to enhance the safety of our in-store shopping experience, we've added a dedicated greeter at every store to drive awareness of social distancing, monitor the number of customers in our store and provide additional cleaning support, particularly carts.  We also have modified our store operating hours, and added a designated shopping hour for high risk in seniors 60 and older, while adding store labor hours to improve customer service and safety. We've added incremental inventory to support high velocity consumable skews that our customers count on us to have in stock, as their dependable and essential supplier. We also launched our first national advertising campaign in over a decade to say thank you to our team members and customers. Over the first 10 days that our first TV commercial was shown, it was seen by over 2,200 times with the reach of approximately 700 million impressions, and then just last week released our second ad as a part of this campaign.  To support our team members and communities, we've made a commitment of $2 million. This includes a $0.5 million of existing Tractor Supply Employee Assistance fund to assist team members most impacted by COVID-19, and $1.5 million for the establishment of the Tractor Supply Company Foundation, and this foundation will be committed to the growth and development of our rural areas with initial focus on the COVID-19 recovery efforts in these rural markets.  This is a highly fluid crisis, and these are historically unprecedented times. There are broad range of outcomes of how our business will perform in the coming weeks and months, depending on how the crisis evolves. We are doing everything we can to think through how the next several months will play out. We are leveraging our past experiences; we are leveraging numerous third party resources, all to assess the uncertainties and to take very calculated actions.  Some of the uncertainties we are thinking about are how the macro economic factors will evolve, including unemployment and GDP, the impact of the crisis on consumer shopping patterns, the impact of legislation such as the CARES Act on consumer and small businesses, the degree of quarantine measures that may still occur, either in the near term or in the fall season, and then the degree of uncertainty in the economy for the rest of 2020, as well as the degree, the incremental cost of doing business as an essential needs based retailer in the current environment.  With these uncertainties we've taken action to increase our cash on hand. We've suspended our share buyback program, we re-prioritized our capital spending and we're controlling discretionary costs, all the while maintaining our dividend.  Now let me talk about some of the other things we're seeing and experiencing. We are seeing significant changes in consumer shopping behavior, from trip consolidation to their preferences for contactless payments, to their preferences for curbside pickup, and home delivery. And I believe the crisis represents an opportunity for us and we are moving rapidly to capitalize on those opportunities.  We are reprioritizing our capital spent to reflect the changes we're seeing at our consumer shopping behavior and a few things we've announced recently. Three weeks ago we launched curbside delivery for our buy-online pick-up-in-stores nationwide. At the same time we also established two dedicated parking spots at every store in the country that are for buy-online, pick-up-in-store or court curbside deliveries.  For curbside delivery, all a customer has to do is order online, when they get an email that says it's available to be picked up, they drive to our store, they pull in one of these two conveniently located parking spots, they call the store and then we bring the items right out to their car in a very contactless way. We've seen significant increases in buy-online, pick-up-in-store orders and customer adoption of curbside pickup has been remarkable. With more than 70% of our recent buy-online, pick-up-in store orders utilizing the curbside pickup option.  To enhance the safety of the customer shopping experience and provide greater convenience, we increased by 50% our mobile point of sale hardware capacity in our stores. These additional devices allow our team members to do a number of activities, including line breaking, where we've got queuing occurring at our registers that conduct outside transactions that may be incremental orders occurring on a box transaction, order to help fill up propane and be able to allow the customer to pay right there, and they also allow us to execute curbside delivery. We've got an app that can fully check off the delivery, all contactless.  In less than three weeks we expanded our same-day, next-day delivery offering from about 400 stores or 20% of the chain to all stores. This is a great example of how we're accelerating our capabilities to be more relevant to our customers. We realize this could become a point of differentiation for Tractor Supply and we move fast to capitalize on our customers' needs for delivery.  In partnership with Roadie, we had plans over the coming year to continue to increase the number of stores that are offering same day and next day as a delivery option. However, given the escalation of the COVID pandemic, customers demand for delivery services became more pronounced and so we responded. Together with Roadie, the team worked and we accelerated the ramp up of same day delivery across the remaining 80% of our stores, again doing this all in about a three week time frame.  Tractor Supply now offers customers the safety and convenience of same day and next day delivery on almost all the inventory in our stores, nearly 15,000 items that our customers need to live the life out there. This includes things like livestock feed, dog food, power tools, Tillers, Riding Lawn Mower, Chicken Coops and even more. They can order all these, have them picked out of our stores, loaded into trucks and cars and brought to their homes, all without having to ever leave their farm or home. We are now the nation's first major general merchandise retailer to offer same day delivery from a 100% of our stores.  Overall during the pandemic, our feedback from our customers has been very positive, with improving customer satisfaction scores. When I am visiting stores, our customers share with me how important Tractor Supply is for them and their families. You can see it on all our social media like Facebook and Instagram. This upbeat customer feedback is very inspiring to the team and reinforcing of them to do what they're doing, which is service to our customers and take care of their team members.  To briefly touch on the first quarter, the Tractor Supply team delivered strong comparable store sales and strategically invested in our operations at the COVID-19 crisis evolved. Importantly, and most importantly, we were there for our team members and customers as the dependable supplier of needs based essentials.  Prior to early March we were on track for an estimated comparable store sales growth in the range of 1% to 1.5% for the quarter. As one of the warmest winters on record, impacted our seasonal businesses in January and February, as well we were lapping a strong 5% comp in the prior year.  Over the last three weeks of the quarter though, as COVID-19 rapidly evolved, we experienced a strong increase in our sales volume as our customers relied on us for the essential everyday products they needed in the face of this crisis.  At the last several weeks to the quarter showed, our customers view us as a critical need, as critical to the needs of their animals and pets, just as the grocery store is to the needs of their family. We experience strength in key essential categories like livestock feed, pet food, heating fuel and other core consumable products as our customers stocked up for their anticipated need. Our e-commerce business experienced remarkable growth as we move through March and that growth is continuing in the second quarter.  The importance of our store network is evident with the strong growth in buy-online, pick-up in-store and it's a more cost effective way for us to fulfill these online orders. This is another area where we're seeing rapid adoption by customers. In the latter half of March nearly 30% of our buy-online pick-up in-store orders were from new customers. Along with that, 65% of the orders were by customers that were using this service for the first time.  As we saw the stock up activity start to slow, our sales activity has continued to stay strong as we're now three weeks into the quarter. Categories that involve living a more sustainable life and enjoying the outdoors are experiencing robust growth. Our customers are engaging in activities such as backyard gardening, lawn care, landscaping, homesteading, fencing and backyard poultry, all these categories are strong and they are playing to our strength. From a customer perspective we're growing with existing customers, but also gaining new customers. Within our Neighbor's Club we're seeing existing customers making their first purchase in other categories, in pet food and livestock feed, poultry departments starting to cross shop like they have not before. In addition, we're reactivating members and we're experiencing record highs in our new customers.  In summary, the first quarter represented solid performance by the team and the second quarter is off to a strong start. I'm incredibly grateful to our store teams who are the heart of our relationship with our customers and our distribution centers who keep the critical supply chain moving. As we look forward to the reopening of the economy, I'm very proud of the opportunity for Tractor Supply to participate in the President's Great American Economic Revival Committee. It is an honor to represent the company and rural America.  Now, I'll return the call over to Kurt to go through some financial highlights and I will come back to share more of what we're doing proactively. Thank you, Kurt. Our top priority is the safety and health of our team members and customers. In the current environment, we are more relevant than ever to our existing customer base. At the same time, we are acquiring new customers and seeing market share gains as a result. We are taking this opportunity to invest in the business, do the right thing to support our team members, but also to strengthen our position.  It seems like a long time ago, but many of us were together on March 10, and during that time we share with you some of our early insights on the business and all those items that we discussed, all still are true and are very relevant and you've heard many and them sprinkled through our comments today. We will certainly be leaning into those as we make our investment decisions through the second quarter and the second half of the year. We are not losing sight of the long term.  During these times, we will focus on the strategic opportunities to serve our existing customers, while also expanding our reach. I believe that the strength of a company is shown in a time of crisis. I am confident in this company. We are navigating this one by leveraging our strength and pursuing opportunities that will help us thrive over the long term.  Tractor Supply is a very resilient business with a proven business model. In closing, my thanks and gratitude go to the entire Tractor Supply team. Thank you.  With that, Mary Winn we are ready for Q&A. Hi Simeon, good morning. This is Hal. Yeah so, maybe I'll just kind of walk through a little bit around kind of the three phases that we have seen in our business and then just talk about how we're thinking about it.  So, the first phase is exactly as you articulated. The last three weeks of March we saw substantive stock up behavior, material stock-up behavior. As we said in the month of March, our comps were 20%. For those three weeks \u2013 sorry, my apologies. For those three weeks our comps were 20%, the comp of March 12%. And that was really driven in areas like livestock feed and pet food and things like propane, these very essential almost grocery like categories that our customers rely on us for.  As the first kind of week of quarantine really took hold across the country, that first week of April, we did see some early give back across the hand, really more than just a few days. And then really for the full three weeks of April here's, as we said our sales have been very strong, and they've really transitioned from kind of livestock and pet food feed stock up, to much more the things that I shared earlier on around the life out here lifestyle; things from homesteading and fence management and fence building to poultry and chickens and coops, to sustainable living, to gardening, to landscaping, to lawn care, all those things are really what are driving our business right now, and what we're finding is that you know our existing customers are shopping, they are cross shopping categories in an increased way. We're seeing reactivated customers, customers that haven't shopped with us in over 12 months in the store, and we're seeing new customers in our store at an all-time high.  What I'd say is that now I'm going to transition a little bit on how we are thinking about it. There are a variety of goes-ins and goes-out that are impacting our business. And we are monitoring all the data on a minute-by-minute hourly basis to take very calculated decisions on how we're driving the business.  One big \u2013 in fact there's several factors, and I'll hit each one of them quickly. One big factor is the fact that 50% of retail is closed and so pick your number. Even if GDP is down 20% or 25% and there's a much smaller pie, but there is only 50% of retailers. So while it's a smaller pie, there's a bigger piece of the pie for those retailers that are open.  And how that plays out, as there has been a big category shift to spend during that time if you look at things like food service and retail and I mean clothing, and apparel and entertainment and travel, all those are way down, significantly down and I think there's a big, there's a significant out of category shift happening across consumer spending right now that we're benefiting from.  The second thing I would say is where our stores are located. I think you're seeing this widely talked about in media and you can see in the caseloads that are reported publicly, but we can also see in our results that the more rural the store is the better the performance of that story is, and as we all know just the COVID cases as a percent of population not as dense in those areas, and also the rulers of the country have remained kind of more so open during this time.  The third thing I'd talk about is convenience. Our stores, both the format size, the work we've done on our website to create convenient fulfillment options and our \u2013 and the location of our stores typically with a very acceptable parking lot, I think have benefited us for a convenience and being an inviting perspective.  Now those are a lot of the things that are positive, some of those could have some shifts that go against this. I'd say on the flip side, we are absolutely watching how are the reopenings occurring, how is GDP occurring, is consumer spending starting to shift as thing start to reopen and what is that going to mean for us. We are also just watching unemployment overall. We're starting to watch unemployment, how it might affect rural areas and would some of that rural benefit start to give itself back. Certain industries that are in rural areas don't reopen or continue to stay closed.  You know we are watching all those, all those nuances, very, very closely and I'd say collectively up until now they've been very favorable for us, but it's very uncertain how they'll play out over the next month, back half of the year, and really until we reach to either a new normal or a vaccine and we get back to normal. But those are many of the things that we are looking at and a lot of goes-in's and goes-out's, up until now very \u2013 it's going our way, but we're being very calculated in all the actions were taking.  Kurt, anything you'd want to add. \nA \u2013 Kurt Barton:No, I think you hit that and we are recognizing that the favorable items and tail-winds today can shift at any one point in time and it's just there is a lot of uncertainty and that's, I think what's reflected in the prepared remarks and the release that we issued today. Hi Steve, it is Hal. Thank you so much for your question. Hope you're doing well. Yes, to start at the highest level and just say our aspiration is that customers can buy anywhere anytime and get it delivered or picked up or shop with us in any way they want, and you know we talked a little bit about this in early March, in continuing the digitization and omni-channel efforts for Tractor Supply.  Given the COVID-19, you know we rapidly accelerated the rollout of same-day, next-day delivery and I'm just \u2013 I can't say enough about the flexibility and the speed of urgency and just to the implementation precision of Roadie, of our stores and our technology team to really get this executed in a really good way.  Roadie's been a partner of ours for some time. You know I have a really high regard for them. I worked with them when I was at Home Depot over five years ago now and they're \u2013 you know they serve a large number of retailers in a similar capacity. And since we already had 400 stores rolled out with them, from a speed perspective moving national with them made the most sense, and they do an excellent job. I've had several orders in the last couple of weeks delivered to myself, as have Kurt.  What I would say is though, we know that we need to have a best-in-class solution and that requires us to test a variety of options, and so we're in the process of doing that. We have the Roadie solution as they have kind of built out and is kind of their normal Roadie Solution in all of our stores right now.  We're going to take in a subset of stores. We have two different subsets of stores, each 250 in size, where over the next two months we will start rolling out some different pilots. One of those will be a dedicated truck and a dedicated trailer and a dedicated driver that are all owned and operated and staffed with a Tractor Supply team member. So that will be a Tractor Supply branded truck, Tractor Supply branded trailer and also tracked by a team member who will be responsible for the delivery. They also will work our stores to do additional B2B intercepts and to drive kind of that, you know that more sales force oriented like delivery model. And then in another 250 stores we're working with Roadie to replicate something that's in between their offering and what we're doing with our own branded truck to have a dedicated truck and a dedicated trailer. It expands the offering of products so that they can deliver, also slightly lowers the cost and that will evaluate those three offerings over the next few months and then provide a further update and then of course rollout the solution that we think that are most needed by our customers.  But again in summary, we know that this is where we have to go. Incredibly pleased with the speed at which we moved and we're continuing to test and pilot, to make sure we've got the right solution and at the end of the day we're committed to taking advantage of this opportunity, and as we get to our new normal and hopefully back to normal for Tractor Supply to have emerged in a much stronger place than we were when we started the coronavirus. Yes. So hi, it's good to talk to you today Chuck. I would reference those in terms of those just things people are really doing around their farm and their ranches to just maintain and their homes. So we are seeing, if you think about in our stores if you want, fencing, T-post, you know you are looking at corral gate, you're looking at chickens, you looking at chicken coops, you look at the people creating gardens in their backyard and then buying the vegetables and the rakes and the hose to the tillers to create those. It's really just all the things that our customers do every single day.  You know they are incredibly and a terrible humanitarian crisis, but a byproduct of it is that you know families are spending more time at home and they are spending more time together outside and they are wanting to keep busy and we have really all the things, we are built for that. We are built purposely built to enable people to do those sorts of activities around their homes, their lands, their ranges and their farms and that's the sort of activity that we're seeing, that's the sort of categories we are seeing lift and drive the business. Thank you."

            "content": "Great! Thanks Kurt. Hey Michael, this is Seth. Hey! In terms of your question as far as you know potential pull forward and just kind of lawn and garden, you know as you look at the current consumer trends and the shifts in spending activity that Hal spoke to earlier, we believe that there continues to be a runway ahead of us, because not only are we seeing the strength of this among our current customer base, but this is also one of those areas we're seeing new customers engage at Tractor Supply, within some of the new brands that we've launched, the ability to partner with some of our key partners in these areas.  We continue to focus on areas such as gardening and increase those hobbies over the last few years, basically going just over 400 stores in certain key live goods to now over 1,700 stores and then when we shift into the summer months as well, you know we believe that consumers will still be around the house, and we're really starting to pivot some of our merchandising tactics and activities to linking parts for center court, as well as go after some of these backyard activities knowing that customers are going to continue to be around the house for the foreseeable future.  So I'm really proud of the work that the merchants are doing. Not only getting products back in stock to make sure we can be that essential retailer for our customers, but also as we look ahead to the future months to be able to go where the customers are going where we believe the hobbies and activities are going to take place. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Hal, and good morning everyone. I hope you, your families and loved ones are safe and healthy. I'll walk through the highlights of our results for the first quarter and then share what we are doing to respond to the challenges of COVID-19 from a financial perspective.  For the first quarter of 2020 net sales increased 7.5% as we had strong comp store sales growth of 4.3%. The comp store sales growth was driven by a 5.4% increase in comp average ticket, and a 1.1% decrease in comp transactions.  The declining comp transactions resulted principally from two factors. First, the difficult compares in January and February due to the prior year's strong winter selling season; and second, we believe consumers consolidated shopping trips in March under the current environment as Hal discussed.  Our average ticket was driven by strong units per transaction growth as customers stocked up for essentials. Commodity price inflation had a slight impact on average ticket as inflationary trends moderated during the quarter. As we shared previously, January and February in total tracked in line with our expectations with March up 12% given the stock-up sales we experienced.  For the quarter we had robust growth in our consumable, usable, netable categories with declines in discretionary, clothing and footwear, and to a lesser degree declines in our winter seasonal categories given the milder winter.  Big ticket sales increased in line with our overall comparable store sales growth. Safes, heating stoves, Tillers, Trailers and Generators were drivers of this growth, partially offset by declines in snow blowers and compressors.  For the first quarter gross margin was essentially flat to prior year at 33.8%. The gross margin performance reflected a favorable benefit from transportation costs as a percentage of net sales. Our efforts in 2019 help drive lower year-over-year average carrier rates, as well as reduced average stem miles. Fuel rates were modestly favorable compared to prior year.  The transportation benefit was offset by the strong sell-through of consumable merchandise, which generally carried below chain average gross margin rates, and greater markdowns of winter seasonal merchandise.  Including depreciation, amortization, SG&A as a percentage of net sales improved by seven basis points to 28%. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in comparable store sales, and a net benefit from legal settlements, primarily from the favorable settlement in the Visa MasterCard, interchange fee class action lawsuit.  Partially offsetting these favorable items, certain first quarter costs as a percentage of net sales were higher than the prior year. These were driven by approximately $7 million of incremental costs from COVID-19, such as investments in team member pay and benefits; the impact of additional labor hours, and supply costs dedicated to COVID-19 cleaning actions, and the charitable contributions through our Tractor Supply Foundation to support our team members and our communities during these crisis.  Additionally, specific to the Frankford distribution center, we estimate approximately 10 basis points of impact on SG&A as we had not fully cycled the opening of this new DC, until the latter part of the first quarter.  All in, we are pleased with our performance which helped to contribute to modest operating profit increase. Diluted earnings per share was $0.71, an increase of 12.7%. For the quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of our common stock for $263 million and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling about $41 million.  As we move into the second quarter, demand for our products and services continues to be very strong. We believe Tractor Supply is benefiting from the favorable spring weather and the consumer trends associated with COVID-19. As a team, the stores and the distribution centers are well prepared for the spring, the busy spring summer season. We are focused on capturing current opportunities, while managing for the long term.  Turning now to how we are responding to the challenges of COVID-19. We are laser focused on what is within our control. We are looking to capitalize on opportunities and investing in the future, while balancing liquidity and cost mitigation. We're actively managing our supply chain and inventory levels to support key categories where there are strong sales trends. On cost management, we're reviewing all discretionary spending and reducing spending that isn't appropriate given the macro economic outlook. As an essential needs based retailer, we are faced with an elevated cost outlook for the second quarter in the range of a net incremental cost of $30 million to $50 million. These incremental costs are attributable to the appreciation bonus for our frontline team members, increased store labor and higher safety and cleaning costs.  As this is a very fluid situation, the degree of how these incremental costs will play out for the second quarter, as well as the second half of the year will be determined by the length and depth of this crisis. We continue to forecast capital spending in the range of $225 million to $275 million. We are deferring spending in certain areas, while accelerating spending in digital and other more consumer facing areas to capitalize on the trends that Hal mentioned.  In regard to our new store opening, we remain confident in our 2,500 store target and we are currently on track with our new store opening schedule for 2020. That said, given the practical realities created by the disruption of COVID-19, we believe there is potential for the timing of some of our new store openings to be delayed. This could push some store openings to later in the year or even some into fiscal 2021.  Finally, I'd like to take the opportunity to provide more insight into our ability to navigate COVID-19 from a liquidity standpoint. Given our financial strength, we are confident that we'll be able to maintain appropriate liquidity as we manage through the current crisis. To free up additional equity within our existing credit facility, we executed an accordion loan of $200 million in March and just this week we executed a $350 million loan within our existing bank group.  We currently have over $800 million on hand in cash and cash equivalents, with approximately $165 million of additional liquidity available if needed. To further enhance our financial flexibility, we have also temporarily suspended our share repurchase program effective March 12.  While our quarterly cash dividend is determined each quarter, we do not anticipate suspending or reducing our dividend at this time. Given the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis and the significant economic uncertainty it introduces, we made the decision on April 7 to withdraw our guidance. Once we believe that we have sufficient visibility to reinstate guidance, we will do so.  Tractor Supply successfully weathered business cycles over time. I believe our strong financial position will continue to serve us well in the future, and we are taking the steps to position us to come out of this crisis a stronger company.  As that completes our financial overview, I will turn it back to Hal. Sure Michael, this is Kurt. And in regards to the range of these additional expenses and the difference between Q1 and Q2, first let me just point out the differences between the quarters. You'll recognize from some of the business updates and releases we started to produce in the mid part of March and later that, the efforts that we took in regards to wages, labor and safety and cleaning began in those last three weeks of the quarter. So those expenses that we pointed out for Q1 were principally in the last few weeks of the first quarter and the expectation as we continue to do that and more just extends throughout the second quarter. Let me just talk about what these costs represent and then how it plays out. The bulk of these costs, about 80% roughly is labor related or benefits related and Hal spoke to much of those in his prepared remarks. Most of the remaining 20% is for supplies and safety and cleaning and how that plays out throughout the quarter or even in the second half, as I mentioned, it really depends on the extent and depth of this crisis, specific to Q2.  The low end of the range assumes that these efforts play out through all of April and May. The high end of that range would assume that we extend all of the wage, the benefits or cleaning if the prices would require that, all the way throughout the second quarter. So that's a way you can think about the cost of how it would impact into the second quarter. Michael, this is Kurt. Let me take that. Hal pointed out a number of the uncertainties, certainly the things that are favorable to the business right now and all the potential for uncertainty in the near term and even in the back half. The key factors that we were looking at and he mentioned those, we are keeping a close eye on unemployment and consumer sentiment. The timing and extent of the COVID-19 health crisis could impact it, and is there a shift to the impact on rural markets, and then weather always can play a bit of an impact, if you just threw that in there outside of some of the crisis type items.  And those would be the primary ones that we're watching. Most of those are tailwinds right now, and if those were to flip any of those or a combination of those could have that level of impact on the business. But importantly we're confident in our business model and probably never been more evident than these times right now. The strength of our model and being a needs based business in the rural market. So as you can hear, we've got a lot of confidence in our business model and our ability to weather those situations. Yeah Michael, this is Kurt. Why don't I first address the question on inflation and then I'll toss it over to Seth on timing of product sales. On the inflationary side of it, as I indicated we saw some slight inflationary benefit in the first quarter. In those particulars as you mentioned, we look at it similarly, there are indications in the near term on both oil and corn that in the near term there's more indicators of deflationary pressures in the business. And we would anticipate as it works its way through the supply chain, that in both of those cases we might start to see some modest deflation even playing into second quarter.  And while hard to predict, if following all the forecasts in both of those categories, we would see that pressure may begin to increase a bit more in the second half of the year, and we're going to be watching it carefully. This is about the best we could probably indicate on prediction of this at this point. Yeah. Hey Kate, this is Kurt. In regards to the margins, let me just hit the gross margin quickly and then SG&A. While we've seen strong growth as Hal mention online, he also mentioned a real strong percentage of that being the buy-online, pick-up-in-stores which does carry \u2013 which is really what the most effective/efficient way for us to sell online merchandise and not a significant pressure in Q1 one on the gross margin.  More specifically, the impact on gross margin, we saw about a 20-basis point impact on the shift in mix in the last few weeks of the quarter. So if you normalized for the mix shift in the last few weeks, the flat gross margin on a more comparable basis outside of that was running about 20 basis points up. That's about in line with our typical last few quarters.  From the expense side of the operating model, I pointed out the 10-basis point de-leverage from the new DC which we've cycled starting in Q2, and the net impact of the incremental COVID expenses offset by the favorable settlements were a few basis points. If you normalize that, SG&A actually, the seven-basis point leverage would be closer to more about a 20-basis point leverage on a compatible basis. Yeah Chuck, this is Kurt. As we mentioned, we took some precautionary measures in this environment and in our capital allocation strategy, shifted our priority to liquidity in cash; that's the right prudent thing to do. The business is strong and as we work through this crisis and the macro economic factors and the uncertainties begin to become less uncertain and there's more normalized business, we would anticipate shifting our capital structure back a little bit more to where we previously were.  At this point we're going to emphasize for utmost precautions, just maintain a structure with additional cash. We believe that gives us a real strong position if there were to be a worst case scenario and I would not anticipate reengaging on share repurchases, while we are borrowed on these additional loans at this point.  So we could see ourselves paying those down. We have the ability to prepay whenever we want and upon prepaying down, we would re-evaluate our capital structure, particularly when to re-engage in share repurchases."

Before Hal and Kurt joined us, we wanted to share some of the big wins for Tractor Supply in 2021, many of which we will be discussing later today in detail. Let\u2019s take a look. [Video Presentation]\nHal Lawton: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are here in cold Nashville. We are excited to update you in greater detail on our Life Out Here strategy that we first shared with you back in October 2020. As our Year Review video highlighted, we are just getting started. At Tractor Supply, we are very early on our journey to build on the momentum in our business and capture the tremendous growth opportunities that we see ahead of us. As we operated early through the early days of the pandemic back in 2020, we set our sights on ensuring that our business would emerge stronger than before. Today, our business has never been stronger. We have significant momentum, our team is executing at a high level and our results demonstrate that our multiyear Life Out Here strategy is working. We are operating from a position of strength. We have a lot of exciting news and progress we want to share with you today. Kurt and I will take you through our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results and review our outlook for 2022 before the team provides an update on our strategic priorities. Retail is ever evolving, that our most important strategic asset remains constant in our team members. They nurture our relationship with our customers and they make us who we are and what we stand for as a company. As a purpose-driven company, our team members create a sense of community in our stores and with each other. Our 46,000 team members are passionate about Life Out Here. Over the last 22 months of the pandemic, they have lived our mission and values to ensure that Tractor Supply is the dependable supplier that our customers count on. This team has worked diligently with grit and determination to overcome the challenging operating environment. They have come together to support the increased sales volume through our DCs, to our stores and online, welcome new customers into the lifestyle, onboarded new team members and navigated the supply chain disruptions. We have enhanced our IT capabilities and done so much more. My thanks goes out to their hard work and dedication to each other, our customers and the communities we call home. Thanks to the team. 2021 was a record year for our business as we successfully comped our record performance in 2020. And as we will share throughout today\u2019s presentation, we are benefiting from the many market trends that continue to be structurally sound. So, let\u2019s recap a few of the milestones in 2021. We celebrated the opening of our 2,000th store in December right here in our home state of Tennessee. We announced the acquisition of Orscheln Farm & Home. And we remain committed to the acquisition, which continues to be reviewed by the FTC and we hope to have an update soon. The strength in our customer base is supporting our market share gains across our categories. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club program is growing with membership up 24% year-over-year as we transition from an affinity program to a tier rewards program. We have robust retention rates and engagement, especially with our highest value tier members. We are committed to making Tractor Supply a household name. Through our targeted investments in marketing, we are seeing a remarkable increase of 21 points in our unaided brand awareness. We are also investing in our supply chain as we announced the first of 3 new distribution centers over the next 5 years. And in September, we announced new robust ESG goals to further reduce our carbon emissions from our operations as well as new diversity equity inclusion goals. And the team has done a remarkable job managing through the well-documented challenges across the global supply chain and dealt with an unprecedented level of inflation. We have tremendous strength and it is broad-based. And now, let me provide some specific color on our fourth quarter performance. Our comparable store sales grew a robust 12.7% and this represents a 40% stack on a 2-year basis. Continuing the trend, we have had several quarters now. Every week was positive with broad-based strength across all regions and all categories. We believe we are significantly outpacing the industry in our growth and continuing to gain market share both online and in store. Inflation, it contributed over 850 basis points to comparable store sales as we navigated the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. Where necessary, we are taking price increases to pass through some of the cost pressures that we cannot offset. And our merchants and supply chain teams are currently navigating this challenging and disruptive environment extremely well and they are most focused on being that advocate for our customer to be everyday low price. As we closely monitor our customers\u2019 purchasing behaviors, we are focused on product unit trends and as I said, we are committed to being priced right everyday. Consumable, usable and edible products, they continue to perform well with comps above the chain average. These categories, as we discussed often are needs-based, demand-driven and they drive trips to Tractor Supply. And key categories in our C.U.E. area, dry dog food, livestock feed, equine health and pet treats were among some of the strongest categories that continue to perform very well. While we were comping exceptional strength in the fourth quarter of last year for our big ticket categories, we had double-digit growth again this quarter. Looking at the cadence for the quarter, December was modestly below October and November comp performance. And as a reminder, December was the warmest on record in 30 plus years. That said, we exited the quarter strong as weather normalized and as we all know, January has started off quite cold. So to recap our sales performance, we had a remarkable year with consistency that gives us confidence that the trends we are experiencing are more structural in nature. The execution by our team has been excellent. Our store teams and distribution centers, along with our supply chain partners, have navigated another challenging year with outstanding execution of our operational playbook. We have faced every challenge head on, focused on controlling what we control, all the while staying true to being the dependable supplier for the Out Here lifestyle. The strength and diversity of our comp growth in 2021 on top of our record results in 2020 is very compelling. As evidenced in our share gains, the health of our customer continues to be very robust. All customer segments had strong growth with the fastest growth in our core farm and ranch segment. We continue to see stellar performance from our highest spending customers. Our retention rates remain higher than historical standards, and it\u2019s even higher from our Neighbor\u2019s Club members. 1 in 5 or 20% of our new customers came to Tractor Supply through our digital channels in the fourth quarter, reinforcing the importance of the investments we are making in this area. We are supercharging how we serve customers with convenience and meeting them how they want to engage with us. To recap, we are experiencing more customers shopping us than ever before. They are visiting us more frequently. And when they come to shop with us, whether it\u2019s in our stores or online, they are spending more money per trip. Throughout the team\u2019s upcoming presentations today, you will learn much more about our plans to continue to build on this positive momentum that we have with our customers. Before we get to the update on our Life Out Here strategy, Kurt will go through some of the key highlights of our fourth quarter and share more details around our 2022 financial outlook. Kurt?\nKurt Barton: Thanks, Hal and hello everyone. Thank you for joining us. We really appreciate your time and attention today to hear more about our substantial progress and our very bright future. As Hal covered a good bit about our top line results and impressive customer trends, I will pickup with our gross margin performance. Our fourth quarter gross margin rate was 33.8%, a decrease of 83 basis points versus last year. This was generally in line with our expectation as we expected inflationary pressures to continue in both product and transportation costs. As has been very well documented, the cost environment remains elevated across imports and domestic freight, commodities and labor wages. Hal shared with you our approach to managing through the current environment. I commend our team for the great job they are doing in the current environment. The Tractor Supply team effectively offset a significant portion through our retail price management program. The fourth quarter comparable ticket growth included the benefit of approximately 850 basis points of inflation. For fiscal 2021, inflation benefited comp sales by approximately 550 basis points. Across the network, we have been nimble to navigate the unprecedented supply chain environment and macro issues, including inflationary pressures. Additionally, we continue to see favorability in the frequency and depth of promotions. This is due to our commitment to our everyday low pricing strategy and a continued strong demand for our product categories. Turning to SG&A, our fourth quarter adjusted SG&A expense ratio, including depreciation and amortization, improved by 68 basis points versus last year to 24.9%. This improvement as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to good leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in our comparable store sales, along with lower COVID-19 pandemic response costs and decreased incentive compensation. This leverage was partially offset by higher wage rates, incremental store labor hours to ensure we are providing a great customer service and investments in our Life Out Here strategic initiatives. Moving to our profitability, adjusted operating profit increased 13.4%, adjusted net income increased 14.6% and diluted earnings per share was $1.93, an increase of 17.7% on an adjusted basis from the fourth quarter of last year. This slide recaps our record performance for the year, all on an adjusted basis. Our operating income increased 22%. And for the fiscal year, we had an operating profit margin of 10.3%. Net income was just under $1 billion, with diluted EPS growth of over 25% for the year. Turning now to a few additional financial highlights, the strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a position of strength for Tractor Supply. Fiscal 2021 was a year of strong cash flow from operations, which totaled $1.14 billion. Our balance sheet remains incredibly healthy and we exited the year with a 2x leverage ratio. At the end of the year, our merchandise inventories were $2.2 billion and on a per store basis, inventory increased about 15%. This increase reflects our commitment to support our strong sales trends and be in stock for our customers, along with an increase from inflation. In 2021, the team opened 80 new Tractor Supply stores. We continue to see very robust new store economics. For the full year, we returned a total of around $1 billion in capital to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. With another year of remarkable performance in the books, let\u2019s now turn to our outlook for 2022. We detailed our 2022 guidance in our press release, but I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. We have momentum. We will continue to invest in the business through our Life Out Here strategy. We have the opportunity to create and define our future and extend our leadership for years to come. And this team is committed to doing just that. We continue to operate in a time of heightened uncertainty regarding the pandemic. This uncertainty includes product cost inflation and supply chain constraints as well as the impact that these factors will have on the broader economy and the consumer. As a needs-based business, Tractor Supply has a long history of resilience during volatility. Starting with sales, please keep in mind that we are cycling tailwinds from generally favorable weather and government stimulus, principally in the first half of the year. With that backdrop, we believe we can comp the comp as our view is that our customer is healthy, even despite their concerns over the state of the broader economy. We anticipate the insights and initiatives you will hear more about today, including Neighbor\u2019s Club, Digital, Fusion and Side Lot and investments in the customer experience to contribute to our positive comp range of 3% to 4.5%. We are planning for positive comp transaction growth. We are also planning for positive ticket growth, which assumes an inflation benefit of approximately 4 percentage points. This is partially offset by an average ticket decline from lapping the strength in big ticket and other select categories from last year\u2019s stimulus benefit. The 53rd week adds about 1.5 percentage points of net sales growth for fiscal 2022 and about $0.15 of earnings per diluted share. Please keep in mind the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm & Home is not included in our guidance. We believe gross margin and SG&A will remain flattish to the prior year. Key drivers for gross margin include assumptions that transportation and inflation pressures will continue, but at a slightly lesser pace offset by our price management and continued limited promotions. Turning to SG&A, we are planning to make investments in strategic initiatives and wages, offset by leverage of fixed costs, normalized incentive compensation expense, reduced COVID costs and operational efficiencies. As to the cadence of the business in 2022, Q1 is our toughest compare at 39% sales comp, benefiting from favorable weather and stimulus. In 2021, we estimated those two had 9 points of comp benefit on the first quarter. The gross margin and overall operating margin are also the toughest compare in Q1 as we had favorable mix of product due to weather and strong leverage on comps and limited pressure from inflation. We anticipate comps to be flat to slightly positive in Q1, driven primarily from positive comp ticket. Q4 will have the strongest year-over-year sales growth due to the 53rd week. Sales comps are expected to be relatively consistent in Q2 through Q4, all within our guidance range. Our ninth distribution center is expected to begin operating in the fall. Our outlook is for capital spending in the range of $625 million to $675 million, with 70% for growth initiatives. Depreciation expense is estimated to increase approximately $70 million, up about 25% year-over-year due to the investments in our business. We anticipate continuing our strong track record of returning capital to shareholders. We are planning on share repurchases of $700 million to $800 million, with an expected 2% net reduction in weighted shares outstanding. To wrap up, 2022 is positioned to be a great year for Tractor Supply. There is no doubt that Tractor Supply is stronger than we were entering the pandemic. We are delivering against our goals. And most importantly, we have a compelling, incredible plan to continue to grow. I look forward to sharing more on our long-term outlook later in the presentation. Now, let me turn it back to Hal to share a broader update on our Life Out Here strategy. Hal?\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Kurt. Wow, what again outstanding 2021 on top of a record 2020. Yes, the team did a great job, they did, just fantastic. Alright. Let\u2019s transition out of a typical earnings dialogue and look to the future. We have a very bright past with more than 83 years of serving Life Out Here. We are coming off a record 2 years of performance. But from our point of view, we are just getting started. We believe Tractor Supply is well-positioned for a bright future. We are in the early stages of the next transformation of Tractor Supply. This transformation should allow us to both grow our top line and earnings sustainably over a long period of time, while operating at a higher margin profile. Given the robust growth of our stores and online that have experienced, we have had a step function change in our business that is evident in our market share gains, sales growth and profitability. We are dedicated to investing and to continue strengthening our position in the marketplace and separate ourselves from our competition. We are committed to creating sustainable value creation for all of shareholders, for our team members, our customers, for the communities we call home, for our supply chain and vendor partners and ultimately, our shareholders. The roots of our long history of growth were established in 1938 when C.E. Schmidt founded a mail order catalog for tractor parts. We opened our first store in Minot, North Dakota, the following year. We serve Life Out Here. We are focused on the needs of recreational farmers, ranchers and all those who enjoy living the rural lifestyle. As I mentioned earlier, in December, we celebrated our 2,000th store opening in White House, Tennessee. This is a testament to all of our team members who continue to support each other, our customers and our communities. Not many companies have gotten to this milestone and I doubt C.E. Schmidt ever imagined this milestone when he started his tractor parts catalog business 83 years ago. Our mission and values are the foundation for our success. Our culture is shaped around our mission and values. We have lived by these principles for over 80 years and we will continue to do so for decades to come. Our mission and values help us in our business decisions and they serve as guiding beacons to ensure we maintain course even in uncertain times. It is not something that you can put in a financial model, but it makes a huge difference on our bottom line, but they are more than that. Our mission and values are what you feel when you walk into one of our stores and talk with one of our team members. We are not like other retailers. We are a relationship retailer. Our customers are passionate about family, their land and animals and their communities and they count on us, Tractor Supply, to be their dependable supplier. We are able to serve our customers so well, because we know our customers so well. We hire our customers. Our team members are members of and representative of the community. They are experts in equine and welding, gardening and pets. They are involved in 4-H and FFA. Our team members are the largest and most important strategic asset of our company. And I encourage you all to visit us out here to experience it for yourself. At Tractor Supply, we are committed to preserving Life Out Here for future generations. 13 years ago, we launched our stewardship program. As ESG has emerged as the universal standard for good corporate citizenship, we have adapted our stewardship program to align with this direction. And over the past year, we have made significant progress in our ESG efforts. A few highlights include significantly reducing our energy and water consumption, materially increasing the gender and ethnic diversity of our board, management executive committee and our overall team member population, conducting unconscious bias training for over 40,000 team members and implementing a new 6-week paid parental leave policy for full-time salary and hourly team members. In September of 2021, we announced new robust goals to further reduce our carbon emissions as well as continue our progress on diversity, equity and inclusion. After exceeding our initial carbon reduction goals set in 2018, Tractor Supply established more aggressive commitments. By 2025, we will reduce our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from what they were in 2020. By 2030, we will reduce those emissions by 50%. And by 2040, we\u2019re committed to achieving net zero emissions across all our operations. Over the past 2 years, we\u2019ve rallied around the theme of stronger together and made material investments to accelerate our initiatives for DE&I. Recently, we announced a 5-year goal to support and advance underrepresented groups across our workforce, vendors, suppliers and communities. Our commitment to being a good corporate citizen has been broadly recognized. Recently, we were named to Investor Business Daily\u2019s 100 Best ESG Companies of 2021. Just yesterday, it was announced we were included in Bloomberg\u2019s Gender Equality Index. And today, it was announced that we received a perfect score from the Human Rights Council. We are committed to being a leader in ESG as this is authentic to our mission and values while also making great business sense. Over our rich 83-year history, this business has a strong track record of success, complemented by consistency and resiliency. Highlights include 30 consecutive years of revenue gain, 12 consecutive positive comp store sales growth and an average share price performance of 28.3% since the year 2000. And this ranks as the fourth best-performing stock in the S&P 500 over the last 21 years. Thank you to our investors for their confidence and we continue to strive to earn your trust and build on it. And today is all about that, the future of Tractor Supply. As demonstrated by the highlights of 2021 that you saw in our opening video, our business has never been stronger. Our team has done an outstanding job navigating the challenges in ever-changing environment over the last 2 years. We\u2019re benefiting from many market trends that continue to be structurally sound. We have strengthened our customer base, and we\u2019re gaining market share across our categories. Importantly, our total addressable market has grown materially, and we see significant opportunities for organic growth as well as an increased number of new stores. And we will continue to invest from a position of strength to capture this growth through our Life Out Here strategy. Out here, Tractor Supply enjoys significant structural advantages. And these advantages have allowed us to gain substantial share over the past 2 years. Our unaided brand awareness is 55%. And that puts us among the best in retail and well above our farm and ranch competitors. With a network of over 2,000 stores and nearly $1 billion in digital business, supported by 8 million square feet across our distribution centers, we have a unique ability to serve our customers wherever and however they choose to shop. We believe no other rural lifestyle retailer provides a comparable experience. And we have deep relationships with our vendors and in many cases are their largest customer. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club program has 23.6 million members. It is engineered to drive customer behavior, and it is the foundation for a sophisticated marketing platform and enables deep customer insights. Our brand, scale, our supply chain, our digital capabilities, our loyalty program, all in combination creates significant and enduring strategic advantages for our business. Our structural advantages are the result of long-term investments in the foundation of our business and the deep seated values embedded in our culture. These roots have enabled us to adapt in the face of the pandemic and the ripple effects of other impacts like the tight labor market, unprecedented inflation and supply chain challenges that are impacting our industry. At the same time, broad-based macro category trends towards self reliance, world revitalization, pet adoption, home setting, these things are benefiting our business. And when you add to that, the acceleration of trip consolidation as people are shopping single retailers more, you think about the adoption of digital trends and you put all these themes together and they are working to our advantage as customers value us for our proximity as a one-stop shop grows. These lifestyle changes are accompanied by long-term commitments by our customer to care for and maintain their land and animals. We believe these trends have staying power and are structurally and substantially sound. These changes align with our investments in the business and dovetail well with our strategic positioning as the dependable supplier for Life Out Here. And as the dependable supplier for Life Out Here, we offer a wide assortment for our customers\u2019 lifestyle. Our total addressable market is large and growing, and it\u2019s heavily fragmented. In 2019, we estimated the total addressable market for Tractor Supply to be about $110 billion and we shared that with you in October of 2020. Today, we estimate our addressable market to be much larger at $180 billion. The tailwinds and structural changes that we just outlined earlier contributed an estimated $30 billion increase in the TAM. And that\u2019s a 25% growth over the past 2 years in our market. But by comparison, if you look at our business, we grew 50% over the past 2 years and consequently gained significant share in this market. Now in addition to our core market, we\u2019ve expanded our TAM by over $40 billion given our investments and initiatives like Project Fusion and Side Lot, which have expanded our category offerings in areas like pet and lawn and garden. With a market share of about 7% of this $180 billion market, we see substantial opportunity for growth in an increasingly attractive market, both deepening our relationship with our current customers as well as reaching new customers. Given our total addressable market growth, continued strong performance of our new stores and our strategic initiatives, we\u2019re revising our long-term store targets from 2,500 to 2,700 Tractor Supply stores in the United States. And we\u2019re excited to serve 700-plus more communities over the next decade. Of note, we view the Orscheln acquisition to be accretive to our overall store growth opportunity. Opening highly productive new stores is a core strength and competency of Tractor Supply. We continue to have strong new store productivity metrics, with performance outpacing our historical investment thesis. And our stores are profitable in year 1. With compelling returns, we continue to have significant runway for growth with high-return new stores. Given the attractiveness of our market, we\u2019re investing in growth through our Life Out Here strategy. We shared this strategy with you in the fall of 2020. And as a reminder, there are 5 pillars of our strategy, and they include deliver legendary customer experiences which focuses on driving greater traffic and increasing conversion; number two, advancing our ONETractor capabilities to reach new customers and deepen our connection with existing customers by offering a truly omni-channel experience; number three, operate The Tractor Way, which enhances the productivity and efficiency of our existing retail assets; number four, go the country mile for our team to ensure we continue to support and show our appreciation for our team members who drive our business every day; and then number five, generate healthy shareholder returns, which reinforces our commitment to effective stewardship of our shareholders\u2019 capital. To support these transformational growth initiatives, we increased our capital investments from $275 million in 2019 to over $600 million in 2021. We made excellent progress in year 1 of our strategy and are on track with our expectations. We continue to be very excited about our strategy given our customers\u2019 response, the performance of the key initiatives and the robust long-term growth prospects. Two key tenets of our Life Out Here strategy are the Fusion and Side Lot initiatives. They are designed to drive space productivity and sweat our existing assets. Project Fusion is a multiyear store remodel program that both revitalizes the store environment and introduces an improved layout and expanded offerings. These changes are designed with the customer and our team members in mind to drive productivity through areas like enhanced experiences like pet washes and wellness clinics, but operational improvements as well to better support growing demand, things like our feed rooms. Also, though, driving space allocation trade-offs such as the service desk, but also widening our assortment across departments like apparel and animal and tools. Complementing Project Fusion is the Side Lot initiative, which transforms and expands our existing outdoor side lot retail space to drive greater productivity and convenience with the addition of a garden center and a drive-through pickup lane to support our omni-channel technology investments. Importantly, these projects are delivering on the return expectations with material sales lifts, existing customer sentiment improvements and new customer acquisition. By 2026, nearly 100% of the store base will be in the Fusion layout, and 60% to 70% will have had executed the Side Lot initiative in it. By 2022, we plan to exit the year with nearly 30% of our chain in the Fusion layout and over 15% of our chain with Side Lot. And Seth will take us through a more detailed walk of these exciting transformations later in the presentation. Another key component of our Life Out Here strategy is the enhanced focus on customer service. This isn\u2019t just about training, but also about enabling our team members to spend more time with our customers. To accomplish this, we rolled out the FAST program, the Field Activity Support Team. And we started this program with 1,200 team members in late 2020. And we expanded it by another 200 in 2021 and plan to add 300 to 400 more team members in the first half of this year. This team\u2019s sole focus is on merchandising execution. And this specialization improves our store merchandising while simultaneously enabling our store team members to focus more time on customer service. And with over 95% on-time planogram completion, our stores have never looked better or been more shoppable for our customers. And this team enables improved store productivity and is funded significantly by our vendor partners. It\u2019s truly a winning-winning program for all of our stakeholders. And John will share more details on our initiatives to fuel our legendary customer service later on. Tractor Supply is fortunate to have a highly engaged and loyal customer base. Last year, as we discussed, we converted our Neighbor\u2019s Club from an affinity program to a tiered points-based reward program. Simply said, the more you spend, the more you save. And this conversion is resonating with our customers. And year-over-year, we\u2019ve added 4.6 million new customers to the program, and we\u2019re seeing broad strength continuing across our customer base. More customers than ever are shopping at Tractor Supply. And these customers are making more trips and are spending more money per trip. We\u2019re experiencing strong retention of customers that have shopped us over the last 12 months. Our retention rates continue to run above our historical standards. And I\u2019m excited for you to hear more customer insights and details on how we intend to continue to engage our new customers and drive retention of our existing customers from Christi. More than 5 years ago, we introduced our ONETractor strategy that drove significant progress in providing a seamless customer experience. Our focus on engaging with our customers anytime, anywhere and any way they choose has allowed us to reach nearly $1 billion in e-commerce sales last year. Our customer is deeply engaged with Tractor Supply. And this transformation is happening across the whole shopper journey. Our customer behaviors continue to evolve, embracing convenient ways of shopping with a continued preference for mobility. Since launching our mobile app in late 2020, we\u2019ve had 2 million-plus downloads, with the app already $100-plus million platform for us. We remain focused on introducing new capabilities, improving the shopping journey and ensuring we have scalable platforms. As we enter 2022, we are more excited than ever about the future of Tractor Supply. We see significant opportunity to continue to grow the business, expand our competitive moat and drive business productivity all the while creating value for our shareholders. As we\u2019ve completed the rollout of FAST and Neighbor\u2019s Club, we freed up some bandwidth, and that\u2019s going to allow us to focus on two new initiatives as well as evolve the focus of our digital initiative. The first one is lead with legendary service. We consistently rank in the top 10% to 20% of retailers on customer service, right out there with the best of them. But our goal is to be number one. And we have all the assets to achieve it. We\u2019ve got the right format, the right team, the right culture. And we have made and will be making investments in our team, in their technology and in their training. And you\u2019re going to hear more from John on our plans in this area in his presentation. Increasing mobile engagement. Mobile will be the next moat that we create around our business. We\u2019re going to convert our nearly 24 million Neighbor\u2019s Club members into power users. And Rob will share more highlights of our plans to accelerate our growth and achieve more than $2 billion in digital sales by 2026. Deliver on C.U.E. We talked often about how important this business is to us. We have the number one market share in bag feed, and we\u2019re in the top five in pet food. And given our growth in these categories over the past 2 years, we\u2019ve increased cubic volume by 26% running through our stores compared to 2019. These are destination categories. And it is critical for us to ensure we have capacity for future growth and, importantly, that we are the lowest cost to serve in the market in these categories. And our supply chain is a critical differentiator for us to deliver on C.U.E. And Colin will share more details on our ability to continue to widen the gap with our competition. Given our recent performance, and the significant opportunity that I\u2019ve just outlined, we\u2019re updating our long-term guidance. Now we\u2019re maintaining our sales outlook of plus 6% to plus 7% in spite of a much higher base of sales. We\u2019re increasing our operating margin guidance to a range of 10.1% to 10.6%, and that\u2019s an increase from our previous guidance of 9% to 9.5%. We\u2019re also increasing the top end of our range for EPS growth to 11%. And notably, we\u2019re increasing our dividend payout to 40% while maintaining our commitment to share repurchases. And we\u2019re spending approximately $650 million annually of capital. These are aggressive but achievable targets that will create significant shareholder value over time. And Kurt will share more details as he focuses on our ability to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder return. From our founding 83 years ago, Tractor Supply has proven to be a business model that has stood the test of time to be resilient and differentiated. This business has shown the ability to evolve over the years to reflect our customers\u2019 changing needs. And we\u2019re investing to continue to evolve and capture the significant opportunities for growth. And underpinning our strategy is an experienced retail team that knows retail and our culture and our team members, and they are passionate about the out here lifestyle. As we enter year 2 of our multiyear Life Out Here strategy, our business is substantially stronger than before the pandemic. Our resilient and differentiated business model allows us to capitalize on the structural consumer trends, benefiting our business with a long runway of growth ahead of us. We have momentum in our business. And our results demonstrate that our multiyear Life Out Here strategy is working. We will continue to evolve our business from a position of strength. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it to the team to walk you through more detailed plans. Thanks so much.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thank you, Hal. Building on Hal\u2019s outlook on the positive momentum of our Life Out Here strategy is Senior Vice President of Marketing, Christi Korzekwa. Christi will share insight on our potential to capitalize on consumer behavior trends that emerged during the pandemic and several exciting initiatives to forge a deeper connection with our growing customer base. Christi?\nChristi Korzekwa: Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning. As you\u2019ve already heard from Hal and Kurt, our future at Tractor Supply is extremely bright and promising, that\u2019s why I\u2019m excited to take a few minutes and give you an update on our customers, provide some insights into what we know about our ever-expanding marketplace and how we are using our industry-leading Neighbor\u2019s Club program to drive our growth. Most importantly, we continue to see significant growth in the farm and ranch market which, as previously mentioned, we estimate to be more than $180 billion. And the pandemic continues to reshape and rewrite customer behavior. And it\u2019s why we see such a large migration of customers from urban centers to rural and suburban areas moving into Tractor Supply\u2019s neighborhoods. We also have seen customers\u2019 homes become their sanctuaries during the pandemic, inspiring more home, outdoor living and land projects. And we only see that continuing as hybrid workforces are the new norm. We\u2019ve also seen more pets become family members with record adoptions across the U.S. And with the pandemic\u2019s disruptions to daily life and the broader supply chain, we\u2019re recognizing a growing interest in self-reliance, sustainability and the desire to consolidate shopping trips. And this migration into a more rural, self-reliant lifestyle, or what we call Life Out Here, we believe, is a continuing cycle with lasting tailwinds. And according to our analysis, we have the potential to capture the interest of more than 40 million additional customers in our trade areas who do not shop at Tractor Supply today. So let me share some insights into our current customers. We\u2019re seeing significant expansion with increased participation from our core farm and ranch customers and a surge in new customers. Core farm and ranch customers increased the number of animals and pets they care for and they expanded their gardens and land projects. They rely on Tractor to be open and ready to support them and they prefer Tractor over our competition. Based on data from Earnest Research, since the onset of the pandemic, Tractor Supply has seen six consecutive quarters of outpacing the farm and ranch channel in market share gains. And beyond our core customer, we have seen record levels of new customers as more move into our trade areas, adopt new pets, start of flock, and grow gardens. What both customer groups share is a passion or growing passion for Life Out Here. And with the increase in share among existing customers and the addition of so many new customers, our investment in and growth of the Neighbor\u2019s Club to a best-in-class loyalty program this past year is key to our success. We\u2019ve reimagined our Neighbor\u2019s Club program to enhance our Neighbor\u2019s Club members\u2019 benefits and experiences. Based on feedback from our customers, we relaunched the Neighbor\u2019s Club program last April, creating a tier-based program, enabling members to earn loyalty points tied to their spending levels. They can also access tier-specific benefits such as same-day delivery and trailer rentals. In essence, the more they spend, the more benefits they receive. And we continue to enhance the program with new benefits and member exclusive experiences every day. We see this program as another differentiator for Tractor Supply. No other farm and ranch program offers the scale and exclusivity of benefits that Neighbor\u2019s Club can offer our members. The response to our Neighbor\u2019s Club enhancements continues to be overwhelmingly positive as it increases customer retention and market share. Our program enrollment is now 23.6 million members strong and we added over 4.6 million members in the last 12 months. Our members represent 70% of our sales, they shop more frequently and they spend 3x more than nonmembers. We also annually retain over 97% of our high-value Neighbor\u2019s Club members. And 90% of those members were active in the last 3 months. Our overall customer retention and recency is industry-leading. In addition, we\u2019re seeing new customers join the program at record levels, with over 30% of all new customers joining with their initial purchase. We also continue to gain extremely rich and valuable insights about our customers and they are shopping us more frequently and across more categories. For example, taking a deeper dive into our core customers, we\u2019ve seen explosive growth in our high-value farm and ranch customers. The number of extremely loyal customers, those who spend greater than $1,000 per year, has grown over 50% since 2019. While many of these customers rely on us for feed and supplies to take care of their growing pets and animals, we\u2019ve learned they also shopped more broadly across our store as part of the continued change to consolidate all of their shopping trips. And we discovered their spending was structural across more high-repeat categories, including pet food, gardening, tools, home and outdoor living, supporting their self-reliant mindset for their families, homes, animals and land. Here is a snapshot of a customer from our highest loyalty tier, Preferred Plus. Jake has been a Tractor Supply regular for years, but we can see he\u2019s changed his behavior over time, shopping more at the store and more categories each year. Many of them repeat consumable categories. He now spends approximately $4,500 each year and shops over 30x. Analysis of his transaction shows he regularly shops our pet food and feed categories, but he also frequently expand his basket with purchases in other categories like gardening and outdoor living. It\u2019s so exciting to see millions of our high-value customers shop us in a similar fashion. But also playing a meaningful part in our growth are the 19 million new customers we\u2019ve welcomed since the beginning of the pandemic. Many customers made initial trips in 2020 for home and yard improvement projects to shop for pets as well as for initial purchases in the backyard poultry and gardening categories. Because of our Neighbor\u2019s Club program, we quickly recognized the surge of new customers early in the pandemic. And we were able to develop dedicated relevant marketing messages to connect with these new customers drive awareness for our pet, home and poultry-related offerings. These efforts help a record number of our new customers, with the highest recorded retention. Over 55% of our new customers returned to Tractor Supply for another purchase. These 10 million-plus new customers are engaging in high repeat activities, such as starting a new garden, adopting a new pet or starting a flock. And to bring these new customers to life, the data from our Neighbor\u2019s Club regarding our new customers\u2019 show they tend to be younger, more female and digitally engaged. We\u2019re also seeing more millennials, who represent 30% of our new customers. Sarah is an excellent example, visiting us for the first time in the early part of 2020. She is one of our more than 1 million customers who started a backyard flock during the pandemic. And that initial poultry trip led her to buying pet food, clothing and gardening supplies from us. Like many new customers entering the poultry category for the first time, Sarah needed and continues to need trusted advice and expertise regarding her new flock, and we\u2019re providing that. Whether it\u2019s information we\u2019re sharing through our digital channels or our store team members, we believe that our Welcome to Life Out Here marketing campaign and our offering of expert know-how in the Out Here lifestyle is a significant differentiator for us. I do want to point out something very important here. While Tractor Supply is enjoying record highs for attracting new customers, we\u2019re also seeing all-time highs in their basket size. Average sales for new customers in 2021, was up $26 from the prior year, marking an expansion of nearly 40% since 2019. The rich insights we gain from our Neighbor\u2019s Club members also allows us to personalize our messaging in a highly targeted and relevant manner. We can effectively segment our customers based on their interest because we know which categories they shop. Moreover, we know where they live and the local events they are passionate about. This continues to allow us to personalize our messages to each customer based on their specific interest and reasons for shopping Tractor Supply. Our core farm and ranch customer is more likely to receive content regarding livestock and equine feed or bulk pricing on fencing, while our newer customers might receive pet or poultry messaging. We have robust capabilities to target these personalized messages across various marketing channels and at significant scale, in digital advertising, within our mobile app, e-mails, push notifications, social media, text messages and our sizable website. This ability to deliver highly relevant messages to the right customer at the right time has allowed us to build an even stronger relationship with our members. Another major shift we have made to capitalize on our rich and growing customer opportunity is a transition from traditional promotional print marketing to highly targeted and broader reaching, brand building television, streaming and digital support. Early in the pandemic, we expanded our brand marketing to leverage national cable news and digital streaming while also partnering with marquee television properties and high-impact programming that resonates with our customers. It was an approach centered on programs that genuinely support our customers\u2019 passions and Life Out Here, including the wildly popular Yellowstone series, it\u2019s prequel 1883, Professional Bull Riding, NFL Sports and home networks like Discovery and HDTV. Looking ahead to 2022, we plan to lean deeper into this strategy as we have seen it drive the significant increases in key brand awareness metrics. At the beginning of the pandemic, we have recognized that we were one of the best kept secrets in retail for new customers. Then as more new customers shopped with us and became interested in living Life Out Here, we continued to grow awareness with our TV and digital strategies. We know from our customers that our assortment, convenience and know-how are significant reasons that they shop at Tractor, so we highlight these in all of our marketing. And as the metrics show, our expanded and targeted marketing efforts are paying off. Our unaided brand awareness is up 2,100 basis points. Customers considering Tractor for their Life Out Here needs is up 1,000 basis points. And we have seen a 25% increase in our ranking as their favorite retailer of choice. These are remarkable results we are incredibly excited about, particularly as we look to future growth. We are continuing to elevate our brand perception as our customers\u2019 retailer of choice and are well on our way to making Tractor a household name synonymous with Life Out Here. So looking ahead, here is our game plan. First, Tractor Supply is part of a robust, growing and attractive market. We see significant opportunity for durable and sustained growth. Second, our customers are extremely engaged and loyal and return again and again, making us their retailer of choice for Life Out Here. Third, Neighbor\u2019s Club is an industry-leading loyalty program, continuing to grow at a record pace, and is a key differentiator that allows us to drive expansive, continuous growth of our highly engaged customer base. Fourth, we have one of the best marketing technology platforms in the industry, allowing us to customize messages that cultivate loyalty. And last, we will continue our meaningful investments in high-profile, marquee marketing partnerships reinforcing our position with our customers and all of those potential customers that we are synonymous with Life Out Here. I look forward to answering any questions that you may have in our upcoming Q&A session in just a bit. But before we go to John to talk about legendary customer service, let\u2019s hear from one of our customers. [Video Presentation]\nJohn Ordus: I love hearing stories like that from our customers. I get a bunch of notes every week from our customers and our team members. I will share another one with you in just a few minutes. But I am excited to talk to you today about something I am very passionate about, taking care of our customers. I believe we have the best customers in retail. And our job is to always live up to their expectations at Tractor Supply enables them to live on their terms. I will walk you through how we are going to lead with legendary service in 2022 and beyond. We are going to talk about our mission, GURA and the Country Mile, our stores, team members and customers, leading with legendary service and our game plan for growth. Our mission is to work hard, have fun and make money by providing legendary service and great products at everyday low prices. Our store team members take the words legendary very serious. That means your visit will be the best at any given time in any one of our stores. Our team members are empowered to do whatever it takes to support our customers. Our mission to be legendary is not new to us though. Over my 24 years at Tractor Supply, we have had a dedication to be legendary. We have been on a journey to deliver on this promise to our customers for many years. Looking ahead, this is a significant step-up in our commitment to legendary customer service. We have strong foundational values and the culture, both in the field and at the store support center that puts the customer first in our decision-making. In 2019, we launched our Tractor Way operating model, which continuously optimizes the relationship between task time, customer time, enabling more time for service. Further, we continue to invest and deliver on our omnichannel roadmap to keep pace with our customers\u2019 demand for convenience and our store team members\u2019 ability to execute our new offerings, things like buy online, pick up at store, ship to store, and our drive-thrus. Today, above all things that we do, it\u2019s our team members that make a difference to our customers. When you have a horse, you love talking about your horse. When you weld, you love talking about welding and how to weld. That\u2019s why we hire our customers, they live the Out Here lifestyle and as team members can provide seasoned advice. We have a customer service approach called GURA. GURA is our way of life. It\u2019s our battle cry and it\u2019s how we drive our results. The G in GURA is for greeting. Every customer should be greeted with an open-ended greeting. The U is for uncover. Our team members ask the right questions to better understand exactly what the customer is looking for. For example, the age of your dog, how many acres are you going to be mowing. Once we know what the customer needs, we can move into the R for recommend. Recommend is where the power of the red vest comes in and our team member\u2019s seasoned advice makes a difference. Our customers trust us to give them the best product recommendation. A is for ask, this is where we offer to help the customer load up their purchase or take it to the register for them. And with our mobile POS units, we can ring up our customers anywhere in the store. Our team members know what we value and what we reward. We value people who make commitments and keep them. Our commitments matter and our promise to be legendary is more than just words in our mission and values. We have strategic programs like Hi5 and our Country Mile program that reward desired selling behaviors. Hi5 is all about uncovering and recommending. Our Country Mile program is all about recognition. Whether it\u2019s peer-to-peer, team-to-team or supervisor-to-team, this program is an opportunity for team members to recognize one another for going above and beyond in our commitment to the customer and to each other. Last year alone, we gave over 300,000 Country Mile badges. By rewarding what we value, we have further positioned ourselves as a relationship retailer. Let me give you an example about Jacob, our team member in our Jonesborough, Tennessee store. This is from Jacob\u2019s manager. I had a customer come to me this morning to let me know what a great team member we have in Jake. Last week, the customer went outside about 7:30 p.m. to find they had a brand-new baby goat. The mother was not allowing it to nurse, so they jumped in their vehicle and drove straight to our store. They barely made it before we closed, but they realized once they were there that they had forgotten their wallets at home. Jake said, \u201cThat\u2019s not a problem,\u201d and paid for everything the customer needed to save the baby goat. The customers came in this morning to pay Jake back and let him know that the baby had survived and was doing well. Jake was taken aback and said he had truly done it out of kindness of his heart. Jake, thank you for demonstrating what true kindness and community is all about. Our customers are special to us at Tractor Supply. I get thousands of positive letters from customers with great experiences inside our stores, just like that one. What our team members do inside our stores every day is making a difference. They love this lifestyle because they live it. Tractor Supply is already really good when it comes to the customer experience, but we are on a journey to being legendary. And being legendary means best in class. We hire for winning attitudes. We are enhancing our training for selling skills and product knowledge. The size of our box allows us to see the customer at any given time and get them out of the store as quick as they would like. We are moving all three of these metrics to be the best. Our Tractor Way operating model is the foundation and will continue to be. Our process efficiency mindset is what allows us to compete on key aspects, like team member knowledge and friendliness, without overinvesting in payroll. Through the Tractor Way, we unlock value for our customers through improved on-shelf availability and more efficient processes that created time for selling. Our field activity support teams are another example of applying the Tractor Way philosophy to remove task work from the stores and make that work more efficient for the teams that are doing it. Our FAST teams are doing an outstanding job and we have seen significant increases in completing tasks on time. By removing this highly variable work from the stores and giving it to the specialized team, we have again provided more time for our store team members to execute GURA. We have spent 2021 adjusting the Tractor Way operating model to reflect the needs of our higher-volume stores. We have also begun to further define roles and responsibilities and related metrics, including that of the sales team versus the operations team versus the FAST team. Expanding on these delineation of roles, we have optimized our scheduling to define when work should get done and what type of work is best done off hours, which allows us to sell during the power hours. We are also working on what other tasks we can take to eliminate, to repurpose, to make sure that we are selling and where an hour of labor investment is best spent. We will measure this operating model through metrics we know work, like GURA, implementing new traffic counters and measuring conversion to better optimize our scheduling capabilities and to identify and coach lost sales opportunities. This is full contact retail. And at Tractor Supply, we believe in belly-to-belly selling. We know that execution of GURA has a direct impact on our customers\u2019 experience, sales and our units per transaction. In fact, when all four steps of GURA are executed, we see an over 15% increase in that transaction. As such, to support our operating model changes, we will heavily focus on improving our training and ability to execute GURA. Our leadership team will champion this program through how we message, what we message and our actions always starting with the customer and the why behind what we are asking. We will begin the shift with the re-launch of GURA at our upcoming leaders meetings and annual sales meetings. Everyone in operations will be talking about the customer experience and GURA. There will be new GURA sales leader scorecards and improved visibility for our district managers. All our communications, meetings, celebrations will be centered around the customer experience and GURA. We will also train to drive confidence in executing GURA. Part of this training will focus on vendor-sponsored product training, selling skills training and product knowledge training. On our team members\u2019 first day, as we tractorize them, they will have enhanced GURA training to make sure we onboard them the right way. And we continue to invest in our district learning centers to make sure our management teams understand how to coach selling. Enable convenience is all about equipping our team members to sell both within the four walls of the store and beyond. Our single integrated team member mobile device is putting all the power and information in the hands of our team. We continue to expand on Theatro capabilities for driving sales and team member efficiency. Our team loves these communication devices, and we are already seeing efficiency and communication improve. We are getting to our customers faster than ever before. We are teaming up cross-functionally to bring the best tools to our team members and customers like things like Wayfinder, conversion metrics and to ask the expert. And we are building upon our current strategy to roll out greenhouses with drive-thrus. Alright. So, here is our game plan for growth and how we are going to lead with legendary service. Our team members provide a differentiated relationship-driven customer experience. Our customers trust our team members\u2019 seasoned advice and product recommendations. Our operating model will be used to create more customer time. We will continue to reduce task and move task work to off-peak hours. New and existing technology will be used to create even more convenience for our customers. Our team members are our number one strategic asset. They are the backbone of this company. We will drive productivity, be more efficient with tasking and service, leverage expenses, continue to invest in our FAST team and we are going to deliver on our commitment to provide legendary customer service to every Tractor Supply customer. We will be best-in-class on customer service.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thank you, John. We will take a moment here for a quick break. When we return, Chief Technology, Digital Commerce and Strategy Officer, Rob Mills, will share details on consumer-facing digital initiatives; Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer, Seth Estep, will provide an update on remodeling efforts inside and outside of our stores; and our Chief Supply Chain Officer, Colin Yankee, will share our vigorous efforts to meet strong consumer demand in a challenging supply chain environment. We will see you back in a few minutes. [Video Presentation] Welcome back. A reminder that a Q&A session with members of our executive team is coming up after this round of executive presentations. So, please stay with us. Joining us now to share how investments in our digital platforms are providing better customer experiences is EVP, Chief Technology and Digital Officer, Rob Mills.\nRob Mills: Thank you, Mary Winn. I am very excited about being here today to talk about the activities that we will continue to grow our legendary customer experience. It\u2019s great to be here. We have made significant opportunities to continue to grow and capture and build momentum on our digital business we have seen over the past few years. We have accelerated our digital journey, focused on creating a seamless experience regardless of how our customer shops anytime, anywhere, any way. When we introduced our Life Out Here strategy in 2020, this continued to be a focus for Tractor Supply, continuing to advance our ONETractor digital capabilities. Over the past 12 months, we have made significant progress on this journey. The team is living our values every day, driving change, taking initiative and being accountable to the expectations of our customers and our shareholders, introducing new capabilities to enhance our customer interactions, such as curbside pickup and our customer mobile app. We have taken a mobile-first approach in everything we do, using geofencing, which enables store efficiency and enables fast and convenient service for our customers. We have also worked to enrich the customer experience across browse, search and checkout. We are leveraging the rich data from our Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program to serve personalized and relevant content to our customers. And we have expanded the ability to purchase from inventory beyond our stores, allowing our customers to buy items that are in transit from our DC to our stores, ensuring that they have access to the products they always need. As you heard Hal mentioned, we continue to grow our online presence, completing our 38th quarter of double-digit growth. Our customers continue to leverage the digital convenience of buy online, pick up in store and curbside pickup. We have seen continued adoption of our customer mobile app as we rolled out capabilities that provide convenience and interaction with our customers. Within 1 year, we have grown 10% of e-commerce sales occurring on the mobile app. We have grown visitors to our website and our mobile app nearly 20% year-over-year and attracted 1.4 million first-time customers through the digital channel. Over the past 12 months, we have driven over 2 million downloads within the mobile app. And even with this digital growth that we have seen, there is still a tremendous opportunity ahead of us compared to other hardlines and specialty retailers. We are definitely the digital leader in the farm and ranch industry. In just 2 years, we have doubled our digital sales, now representing 7% of our total business and have plans continue to grow share to over 15% by 2026, exceeding $2 billion of our total sales. I will share more about our plans for growth today, all of which focuses on the mobile experience that Hal shared earlier. Our customers\u2019 behaviors continue to evolve, embracing convenient ways of shopping and continued preference on mobility. Over 70% of our customer interacts with us on a mobile device, outpacing the industry. And their satisfaction directly ties to the convenience the mobile interaction provides. Our customer satisfaction scores are 500 basis points higher when our customers shop on the mobile app. We will differentiate our digital offering for our customers through the mobile app. For example, we deployed the ability for a customer to request propane refill from the app. This capability simplifies the purchase process, giving the customer the ability to notify a team member that they need assistance with the refill. Through a tap of a button, a team member is notified that the customer is in the parking lot and needs a refill. The team member can acknowledge the request, proceed to the refill station and complete the transaction on a mobile device, making it simple and convenient for the customer. By extending the team member and the customer interactions beyond the store, we are able to improve the customer experience by providing two-way communication, allowing the team member to know and plan for the next customer interaction, which ultimately leads to the legendary customer experience. So, let\u2019s talk a little bit about what\u2019s ahead of us on the digital front. Our activities in 2022 will focus in three primary areas, areas that Hal referenced earlier when he talked about advancing the ONETractor capabilities and that are part of the Life Out Here strategy. First, increasing mobile engagement by creating the best-in-class digital interactions; second, connecting our customers to care for their pets and animals, capitalizing on the strengths in these categories; and third, advancing the omnichannel delivery experience by leveraging conversational commerce. Let\u2019s look at each of these. Our customers tell us through data. They prefer to interact with us through a mobile device. We will continue to increase engagement by providing legendary customer service through frictionless experiences. By using data analytics powered by artificial intelligence, we will drive personalized experiences. And we will continue to differentiate the experience by introducing capabilities that improve the customer interactions and convenience. We will leverage our Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program to drive engagement with easy access to program benefits, including rewards and the market, catering to our top-tier customers, providing tools to make their Life Out Here easier. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club power users will easily view reward status, offers and coupons as well as store payment options within a newly redesigned wallet. We will integrate reorder options and introduce Wayfinding to make locating products easier and faster for our customers and our team members. And we will allow customers to obtain on-demand assistance from anywhere in the store or outside the store. The mobile app will drive a personalized experience to our customers, and we will talk to our customers about products and services they need. Using data and analytics, we will offer knowledge to our customer base on their shopping trends, while introducing one-stop shop for all customers\u2019 pet needs within the mobile app. My Pet feature will provide customers with easy access to pet prescriptions, vet services and managing their product subscriptions and scheduling interactions. We will make the experience for the customer, embedding the capabilities into the shopping experience and updating the customer pet profiles based upon their shopping habits and purchase. We will continue to differentiate ourselves by integrating the in-store and digital experience to create a best-in-class omnichannel experience, integrating our digital shopping cart with the in-store cart, allowing checkout on a mobile device or with a team member, introducing one shopping cart regardless of how you shop or this channel you shop in. We will offer our customer connections to our team members from any locations, introducing conversational commerce embedded in the mobile app. This will allow us to provide seasoned advice about their projects, land and animal anytime, anywhere, any way. Providing connections to both the products and services our customers needs for their pets and animals is a part of what enables our ability to deliver legendary service and be the authority for Out Here lifestyle. The My Pet feature, I mentioned will create a one-stop-shop experience for all things related to our customers\u2019 needs for their pets, from prescription medications to reoccurring feed or food needs, offering product subscriptions delivered to their home or set aside for pickup in store, we want to make any item our customer needs easily available, making it convenient and dependable. As the lifestyle leader we have a significant opportunity to continue to widen the gap with our competition in this space. One of the most important parts of the digital interaction is the delivery experience, ensuring that no matter how our customers want their products we exceed their expectations. By continuing to bridge the customer team member experience across the digital lines, we can improve the customer experience and the ability to meet their needs while gaining market share. Let\u2019s look at a quick example. Kelly has placed an online order for curbside pickup. She has purchased several items, including bags of chicken feed and a bag of oyster shell. In Kelly\u2019s customer profile and her mobile app, she has designated a preference to be contacted by a team member in the event a product is unavailable, allowing the team member to suggest a substitution. When Kelly\u2019s order is submitted, a team member in the store receives a notification on his personal communication device that a curbside order is ready to be picked. He picks the chicken feed and then realizes the store doesn\u2019t have the oyster shell she ordered. Mark presses the substitution button on his mobile device and is immediately connected to Kelly via chat. He apologizes for the out of stock and provides her with two similar options, including one of our exclusive brands. Kelly chooses the substitution and Mark completes the order. By keeping our customers and our team members always connected, we can extend the legendary customer service Tractor Supply is known for beyond the four walls of the store. I am very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us as a company and in the digital business. As you hear from Seth and Colin, you will see the items I have shared support our broader Life Out Here strategy from continuing to evolve the Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program to supporting legendary customer service to how we move product efficiently from our distribution centers to our stores. Each element of the Life Out Here strategy is tied together, ensuring that the work we are doing is focused on supporting the needs of our customers and the Out Here lifestyle, providing a great team member experience and a best-in-class omni-channel experience. The three key highlights I want to leave you with today are: first, we will capture significant market share by creating a best-in-class digital experience; second, we will deploy best-in-breed technology that capitalizes on our unique strength in the pet and animal categories, widening the gap with our competition and we will own the relationship with our customers at all times through conversational commerce, maintaining our position as the Out Here authority. We are uniquely positioned to deliver against the significant digital opportunity we see for Tractor Supply. The Tractor Supply team continues to be excited and passionate about the digital vision and how it is fueling our growth. I am thrilled and proud to continue to be a part of this great organization. Seth, I will hand it over to you.\nSeth Estep: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Tractor Supply has been busy making headway with our Life Out Here strategy. In 2020, we outlined initiatives to grow space productivity as a major opportunity to deliver consistent comp store sales. This was a primary goal of our Operate the Tractor Way pillar. When we launched this strategy, we knew we had significant opportunity for improvement in sales per square foot compared to our hardline and specialty retail peers. Since then, we have been focused on our Project Fusion and the Side Lot transformation to drive convenience and to optimize our indoor and outdoor assortment. Importantly, we are making progress and we are driving significant productivity gains. Today, I want to walk you through a local store, updating you on the improvements and how we have continued to evolve our store layout with Fusion and Side Lot, highlighting some of the successes we are seeing as we rollout these strategic initiatives. Let\u2019s get started. Welcome to one of our Tractor Supply stores, where we recently completed a combo Project Fusion and Side Lot Transformation remodel. For today\u2019s tour, we are starting outside in our roughly 4,000 square foot garden center. When we first introduced our space productivity initiatives, we highlighted that our most significant opportunity to drive incremental sales, traffic and market share was through our Side Lot Transformation program. In this, we convert a space that\u2019s traditionally been utilized for storage to a garden center that\u2019s tailored to the lifestyle of our Out Here customers. We knew from customer research that the lawn and garden category, specifically live goods and bag products, was the number one hobby of our shopper where they did not look to Tractor Supply as their primary destination. And as the weather turns warmer and we enter spring 2022, we are excited to have more than 160 garden centers to start capitalizing on this opportunity. Our merchants have been aggressively adding growers to prepare for the season. In these garden centers, we will be offering a broad assortment of live goods with a focus on vegetable gardening, shrubs, trees as well as a full assortment of color to create excitement with our customers. Our offering is differentiated for the Out Here lifestyle. We are also introducing additional products in seasonally relevant categories, such as furniture, planners, drilling and outdoor living. From our early reads, we believe that these additions will drive share of wallet with both our core customers and attract new customers to Tractor Supply. From a performance perspective, we are seeing positive lifts in the seasonal department despite very few stores having a garden center in 2021 during the peak season. In our 27 stores where we added only a garden center and did not do a Fusion remodel, we are seeing triple-digit lifts in our live goods and the lift for packaged seeds leaves the chain with strong double-digit lifts on top of triple-digit lifts in 2020. Let\u2019s now shift to the exciting trends of our Fusion and Side Lot combos, particularly the 15 combo stores that were opened for the 2021 spring selling season. In those stores, we are seeing double-digit sales lift performance for the entire store and strong performance across all merchandising divisions. Specific to our seasonal division, which includes our lawn and garden categories, the total seasonal product division lift in these stores is up more than 30% and we are getting incredible feedback from our customers as a shopper updated side lot, in our updated seasonal corner, in our fusion layout. In aisle, we are seeing successes in handheld products, belts, blades and everyday lawn and garden items. Looking ahead to 2022, all garden centers will be built in combination with a Fusion remodel as well as the vast majority of new stores will open with the garden center. As we know, we get the greatest sales lift when we combine our Project Fusion and our Side Lot initiative. These categories are a key focus for Tractor Supply to continue to capture share as identified in our total addressable market opportunities. I hope you share our excitement with our Side Lot Transformation. Now, let\u2019s walk a few of the other areas inside the store and highlight some of the updates and the initial results that we are seeing from our Project Fusion remodels. As you enter the store, our customers immediately experience a dramatic update as they are greeted by the customer service hub, which consolidates our cash registers and customer service desk. Sight lines have also dramatically been improved with the implementation of the new Department Lightboxes. Customer feedback to these changes has been overwhelmingly positive. Our shopper survey results show positive increases in cleanliness, speed needs and checkout and availability of team member assistance. Also, our score for a variety of merchandise in store has improved more than 120 basis points in our Fusion customer survey results. And by moving the customer service desk to the hub, we added approximately 300 square feet of selling space in the center of the store that is more effectively being used to drive space productivity and show additional merchandising programs. So as we move to our pet department, we have reworked adjacencies, updated space allocations and increased the number of pallet positions. One of the biggest changes in our Fusion pet layout is leading the flow of the department with ct products. We know we have significant opportunity to grow sales and share of wallet in cat. And by placing it on the first aisle on Fusion, we are giving greater visibility and access. And when looking at the results, we are excited to see that our Fusion stores are over-indexing in new customer growth in this category. And existing Tractor Supply customers buying in this category is up 600 basis points versus non-Fusion stores. We are also seeing positive sales lifts in wet cat food and supplies across all-time periods post remodel. Since we first introduced you to our Fusion layout, we have also had an additional run of dry dog food in select stores, like you see here, which maximizes holding power and increases space allocations to accelerate growth in this key category. We believe approximately 40% of the Fusion remodels will have the space to add this additional footage in our pet department. We are confident that these changes will continue to drive our market share gains in pet. In addition to pet products, we continue to enhance the services we offer our pet parents, like self-service pet wash stations, which are now in more than 500 locations. In a small subset of stores, we are also piloting wellness centers, which operate in 44 stores to-date with a full-time veterinarian staff 5 days a week. Wellness centers are also complemented with mobile pet vet clinics that operate in more than 1,400 stores today. And in 2021, we serviced over 1.2 million pets through pet wash, wellness centers, pet vet clinics and televet solutions. We will continue to look to grow our pet services as an opportunity to increase customer lifetime value and bring in new customers. In our Fusion stores, we continue to drive space productivity in our livestock feed, health and supplies categories. Just like dog food, these sections, along with the entire pet department, are among the most highly productive areas of the store already. We have updated adjacencies, reallocated square footage and visually improved the department to support this important category. The most significant positive impact is the equine supplement, leg care and fly control categories, which are trending between 400 and 800 basis points above trend. And in select stores, we have added a feed barn that gives the stores the inventory holding power needed to stay in stock and allows customers to drive through and load heavy animal feed, fencing and other core categories directly into their vehicles. These are trip-driving categories where we will win as the 100% dependable supplier. Colin will share more details on how we will widen the gap versus the competition in this key area. Moving into our truck tool and hardware area, this part of the store experienced some of the most significant merchandising updates with the introduction of new brands, new fixtures and significant changes to space allocations. As a result, we are seeing growth in traffic counts, attachment and cross shopping in our power tool department. We see that existing customers are finding and shopping the power tool aisle for the first time. And these customers are much more likely to attach an accessory to the power tool purchase at a Fusion store versus a non-Fusion store. We have also rolled out this tool crowd concept to more than 300 additional non-Fusion stores based on the early results. And what really excites me is that our TAM assessment indicates that these are categories, where we continue to have significant share opportunities. And finally, let\u2019s take a look at our apparel section, which is experiencing the most significant lifts inside the store across all of our Fusion remodel categories. In many remodels, we actually reduced the footprint of the department by consolidating our presentation, with new fixturing and merchandising. In these Fusion stores, apparel is running at comp above 35%, with high single-digit lift as compared to control stores. This is a category that gets an immediate response from the consumer and the lifts have been sustained over time. We believe this is attributed to the visual impact post conversion, updated space allocations of categories and brands as well as the expansion of women\u2019s with brands like Carhartt, Ariat and Wrangler. Apparel is now a key customer mission for people to come to Tractor Supply. We are also excited to showcase brands throughout the department like Carhartt, that you can see here, store within a store concept in 90 locations, which are running departmental comps above company averages. We will continue to look for ways to differentiate our offering in apparel that support our customers\u2019 lifestyles. So thanks for coming along with me on the store tour today. I hope you get the opportunity to get in store yourself and see our new Fusion and Side Lot upgrade soon. I hope you found our store tour insightful today. We believe that investing in our stores is just table stakes to win in today\u2019s omnichannel retail environment. Overall, we are encouraged by the early results we are seeing from our Fusion and Side Lot initiatives, with the biggest impact coming when their innovations have reached a maturity of about 9 months post completion. As we look ahead, our target for Fusion-only stores is a mid-single-digit sales lift post project maturity and we are targeting a high single-digit sales lift on the Fusion and Side Lot combo stores. Our goal is to have 100% of the chain in the Fusion format by the end of 2026, while our combo Fusion and Side Lot stores will ultimately be across 60% to 70% of the chain. We are making significant progress towards our space productivity goals and delivering on the strategic pillar of operate The Tractor Way. We have a best-in-class customer-focused merchant team that will continue to grow sales and profit by driving innovation and optimizing our differentiated merchandising assortment. We are highly focused on capturing market share of our expanded TAM. And we have a compelling game plan for growth that will serve our core customers while bringing in new customers to the Tractor Supply family. All-in-all, we are committed to being the indispensable supplier for Life Out Here and widening the gap versus our competition. Thank you again for going on this Fusion and Side Lot store tour with me today. Next up is Colin, who plays such a key role in serving our customers. With the recent complications to the supply chain, Colin and his team have done an amazing job keeping our stores in stock.\nColin Yankee: I really appreciate that, Seth. Thank you so much. It\u2019s great to be here with you to share the transformation that we are on across our supply chain. Tractor Supply is differentiated as the largest retailer for bagged animal feed in the country and the leader in meeting our customers\u2019 needs for poultry, equine, dog and cat food, forge and other C.U.E. or consumable, usable and edible products that are core to living the Out Here lifestyle. Last year, we moved 8 billion pounds of C.U.E. through our supply chain. And as we have grown our sales and market share in C.U.E., our logistics network, our distribution centers and our stores have stepped up to handle that volume and meet the demand. In fact, compared to 2019, last year, the average Tractor Supply store moved 18% more units and 26% more cubic volume of C.U.E. product. And those volumes in total and per store are continuing to grow. We have seen a significant growth in C.U.E. customers because of our product portfolio with breadth across national, local and exclusive brands and products that cover the spectrum of species for all stages of life. We know C.U.E. products are traffic drivers, attracting new and younger customers. We know that customers who shop for C.U.E. at Tractor Supply are some of our most loyal customers, on average making 4x more transactions and shopping across a larger set of categories than a non-C.U.E. customer. And we know how important being in stock and a price leader are to customer satisfaction and retention. With the success of our Fusion and Side Lot remodels and the Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program, the increased volume, velocity and variety of C.U.E. products moving through our supply chain and through our stores presents an opportunity to use our scale and sophistication to widen our leadership position with the C.U.E. customer. While we always take an end-to-end view of our supply chain, the growth we have already experienced and the growth we anticipate in C.U.E. requires a fresh look at the operations, and that\u2019s exactly what we are going to do with our effort to deliver on C.U.E. We are bringing together a powerful new technology with the strength of our distribution center and mixing center network and continuous improvement within our store processes drive more C.U.E. volume through the same-store footprint with maximum efficiency. And we are going to deliver best-in-class on-shelf availability for our customers, whether they shop with us in store, use buy online, pickup in store or we access that inventory to fulfill orders from stores. As Hal mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in our supply chain capacity. We are currently building our ninth distribution center located in Novara, Ohio and we are on track to open that facility later this year. In 2022, we will also start construction on our tenth distribution center, which will be located in Arkansas. We are planning on a facility opening in late 2023 and we will continue to look for locations to best support our operations as we grow the store network, turning our attention next towards distribution points in the Pacific Northwest. To leverage our expanded distribution network with the power of our vendor base, we are deploying a new inventory forecasting and replenishment system in 2022. This new system takes in more data on demand patterns like seasonality and day of the week variations, business decisions like promotions, price changes and changes in display and space and external factors like weather, traffic and local events. Using advanced mathematical techniques and near real-time information, we are creating an even better picture of future demand, supporting higher in-stock rates, with less inventory. The new platform allows us to be more collaborative with our vendors. By sharing information that is fed directly to our vendors\u2019 production planning processes, we can create more accurate orders for these fast-turning products. In our initial test and use cases, the forecast accuracy improvement has lowered total inventory, increased our in-stock rates, driven production efficiencies and improved our response and recovery to changes in demand. We are also deploying new capabilities that allow us to be faster and more responsive inside of our distribution centers. The new replenishment logic allows for high velocity and large C.U.E. products to get picked, loaded and dynamically routed to stores faster and more frequently than we are able to do today and that speed reduces the amount of inventory held in the backrooms. While this new replenishment logic is geared towards our C.U.E. items, we will also strategically apply it to big ticket items, like gun safes and riding lawnmowers, helping us get the right product in the right stores at the right time to optimally use inventory and the store\u2019s capacity. To further support more just-in-time replenishment, we will continue to expand the number and reach of our mixing centers. Mixing centers are rapid replenishment centers designed to deliver the 100 fastest moving C.U.E. items in full pallet quantities. Over the last several years, our mixing centers have proven to reduce the days of inventory coverage required in stores to support sales, relieving pressure on our store backrooms while increasing in-stocks. Today, we operate 12 mixing centers, covering about half of the stores in the chain. And as part delivering on C.U.E., we will service more stores from our existing mixing centers and look to add more mixing center locations to the network over the next several years. Our store teams are agile and they do an incredible job managing the volume and tonnage and the number of deliveries that backup against our store every week. But we are going to give them even greater visibility to that workload. With a new set of visibility dashboards that uses historical data, real-time tracking and predictive analytics, our stores will have greater insight on estimated times of arrival, allowing them to track inbound deliveries from distribution centers, mixing centers and vendors, equipping them to manage tasks and equipment in the store more effectively throughout the day. At the network level, this new visibility provides a rich source of data for analyzing and optimizing inbound workload to inform staffing and operational support for continued optimization efforts. So we are applying new technology and logistics processes to impact product flow, but we are also focused on maximizing efficiency in the stores. In our stores, we are optimizing the backroom layout to reduce the number of touches and the amount of travel our team members need to take while moving product from the trailer to the sales force. For our highest volume or more space-constrained stores, we have seen the success of creating dedicated feed rooms that add pallet drops and storage capacity. By the end of 2022, we anticipate having 160 to 180 feed rooms in our network and we will continue to build out dedicated feed rooms as needed when the store is going through the Fusion and Side Lot remodel process. These layout changes support an increased level of efficiency, building on the existing operating procedures in the store. Because C.U.E. items are the most space and labor-intensive products in our stores, we are focused on new levels of process standardization and engineering in our freight and replenishment tasks. Our stores are adapting staffing models to handle more frequent deliveries, more throughput and faster replenishment to the shelf. By driving greater process engineering and optimizing the backrooms of our stores, we will free up time that can go back to delivering legendary service to our customers. We see the growth in our C.U.E. categories as part of an enduring consumer shift and a central part of our long-term growth plans. To support our long-term sales per store projections, we need solutions to drive more C.U.E., more deliveries and more units through the same-store footprint with greater visibility, predictability and cost efficiency. We are embarking on a multiyear program to optimize the entire C.U.E. supply chain, from the vendor to the store using new technology, logistics processes and store operating procedures. The benefits of these continuous improvement efforts will ultimately drive greater efficiency across the entire assortment, further enhancing the competitive advantage our supply chain provides within farm and ranch space, but importantly, ensuring we are the most dependable supplier for those consumable, usable and edible essentials. Thanks for taking part in the event today. And I\u2019ll hand it over to Mary Winn.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thank you, Colin. Before Hal joins us to share his closing thoughts, EVP, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Kurt Barton, rejoins us to deliver Tractor Supply\u2019s strategy for robust shareholder returns.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Mary Winn. It\u2019s been 15 months since our October 2020 enhanced earnings event, and I am excited to talk to you again about Tractor Supply\u2019s strategy, our new supporting strategic initiatives and our plan to continue to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder return. At that time, we outlined our Life Out Here strategy and our focus on TSR. We are pleased with the strong progress that we have made against all elements of the Life Out Here strategy. We have continued to deliver on our highly differentiated proposition as the number one farm and ranch retailer. We have accelerated execution of all our strategic priorities and we have remained disciplined and focused on how we have allocated our capital. This team has worked hard to deliver outstanding financial results and are honored that our shareholders have benefited from the S&P 500 top decile TSR that we have delivered over the last 2 years. Despite our strong progress, we are not resting on our laurels. We continue to add important new strengths to reinforce our focus on delivering strong and sustainable TSR. Our top line revenue growth is compelling, not only in magnitude, but also in its quality and durability. The Life Out Here strategy continues to expand and we have added new strategic initiatives. As you heard from John, we plan to lead with legendary service and aim to achieve that number one position in customer experience. And as you heard from Rob, we are deeply focused on digital as part of our omni-channel approach and intend to dramatically lift our mobile engagement. And as you heard from Colin, we are investing in our supply chain to support the growth in key products that are core to living the Out Here lifestyle. We are proud that our strong and durable free cash flow enables the Power of AND ensuring that we can fully support and fund all of our most important growth investments and return significant capital to shareholders at the same time. The growth that Tractor Supply has generated over the past 2 years is highly differentiated within retail and is firing on all cylinders. Rarely can a retailer founded more than 80 years ago demonstrate the magnitude, diversity and quality of growth that Tractor Supply has delivered over the past 2 years. Almost one-third of our growth came from new customers and over two-thirds has come from increasing share of wallet with our passionate and loyal existing customers. The volume and basket growth that we have delivered has meaningfully exceeded any top line tailwinds that we have seen from inflation. Our e-commerce growth continues to accelerate with 2-year CAGR of 80% in our digital channel, forming a larger part of our growth that we have ever seen before and new and expanding categories in lawn and garden, grilling, apparel, power tools and pet drove almost one-third of our comp growth, along with strong increases in our core businesses such as C.U.E. The diverse mix of growth that we have seen highlights the underlying strength of Tractor Supply\u2019s top line organic growth. This gives us deep confidence in the strength and quality of our growth trajectory. As we look to the future, we expect to deliver a high-quality and sustainable top line organic growth trajectory that builds on the substantially higher revenue base that we have achieved in the last 2 years. Our long-term financial outlook includes a revenue growth of 6% to 7%, with a 4% to 5% contribution from comps and 2% contribution from new store openings. Our 4% to 5% comps outlook is underpinned by growth in customer demand from our loyal customer base and new customer growth. Expansion of our TAM through the new and expanded categories I mentioned earlier, such as lawn and garden, grilling and pets and continued execution of our Life Out Here strategy, with key roles being played by the lift in store productivity from Fusion and Side Lot, our goal of being the number one legendary customer experience and our strong focus on customer retention and further engagement through our powerful Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program. We are pleased that our most recent market analysis has indicated that we have more new store growth headroom than we shared with you in the fall of 2020. And as a result, we are increasing our total store target by 200 to 2,700 stores. Our target of 2,700 stores will be achieved organically. We are excited that with this increased target we will have a decade of future growth runway in non-comps growth ahead. As Hal mentioned, we remain optimistic about the FTC process regarding Orscheln, which would be additive to our total store target of 2,700. Given our recent performance, increased scale and greater line of sight into some of our most important cost drivers, we are raising our long-term operating margin target to a range of 10.1% to 10.6%. Since initially providing this guidance in the fall of 2020, we have gained greater line of sight into the operating margin drivers that you see on the left side of this page. As a result, we believe we can sustain an operating margin above 10% and feel that there is upside margin potential beyond last year\u2019s operating margin of 10.3%. We have seen favorable impacts from pricing and promotion, expansion of our product mix, our operating efficiency program and the improved operating leverage generated from our high-quality growth. Despite the headwinds from inflation, higher transportation costs as well as maintaining the significant investment programs we have underway, we see our current margin levels in the 10.1% to 10.6% range as sustainable longer term. As I mentioned earlier, our operating margin guidance for fiscal year 2022 is in the range of 10.1% to 10.3%. And from this, you can infer that over the next 5 years, we feel that we have the opportunity at least to maintain and potentially grow margins towards the top of that range. In addition to the operating margin outlook range, we believe there are other opportunities that while uncertain provide the potential for further margin upside if they progress favorably. These include the normalization of investment levels to sustain our growth trajectory, lower transportation and COVID-related costs and reduced inflationary pressures such as wages. We have made enormous progress in the execution of our Life Out Here strategy. The rollout of our two key store remodeling programs, Fusion and Side Lot has accelerated. As Seth shared with you, our expectation for Fusion-only stores is a mid single-digit sales lift post-project maturity and a high single-digit sales lift on the Fusion and Side Lot combo stores. By end of 2026, we are targeting 100% of our stores to have the completed Fusion remodel and 60% to 70% of our stores base to have the new Side Lot with garden center. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program is seeing very strong growth and helping us provide even greater value and engagement with our deeply loyal Life Out Here customers. As Christi mentioned, our Neighbor\u2019s Club members remain one of our most valuable assets, driving approximately 70% of total sales and spending 3x more than non-loyalty customers. Our e-commerce performance has been fantastic, delivering 80% annual growth in sales over the past 2 years. Our mobile app just launched late 2020, already makes up 10% of our digital sales revenue. We are excited to target a digital penetration of approximately 15% and over $2 billion in sales by the end of 2026 and we will continue to invest behind and strengthen our digital capabilities. We continue to focus on our disciplined capital allocation with a clear set of priorities and how we think about optimal capital allocation to support the delivery of strong and sustainable TSR. Investing in the business to drive organic growth remains our number one priority with the clear ambition of sustaining our high-quality growth trajectory long-term. We remain committed to outstanding return of capital to our shareholders, firstly, through our growing dividend at least as fast as earnings and secondly, by returning excess cash through a strong and consistent share repurchase program. Where appropriate, we will pursue tuck-in acquisitions to add to our growth and key capabilities for the future. All of this is underpinned by our commitment to cash flow generation, a healthy balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. This compelling free cash flow that we expect to generate over the next 5 years, which includes a cumulative $8 billion of operating cash flow, $5 billion of free cash flow puts us in a very attractive position and enables the Power of AND. The strength and durability of our future cash flow delivery means that we can fully fund all of our growth oriented, high return initiatives and return a significant amount of capital to shareholders simultaneously. Over the next 5 years, we plan to invest $3 billion in CapEx, in Fusion and Side Lot distribution centers, technology and customer experience with the objective of delivering our long-term growth ambition. While organic growth investments are our highest priority, the strong and growing free cash flow enables us to remain fully committed to our capital return. In our October 2020 enhanced earnings call, I indicated that our 5-year return of capital to shareholders would be approximately $4 billion. Based on the expectation of our stronger cash flow generation and our updated long-term financial outlook, we now expect to return more than $6 billion in capital over the next 5 years. This return of capital is expected to exceed our free cash flow by utilizing existing cash on the balance sheet and modestly increasing our leverage, ensuring we are putting every dollar of cash and cash flow to use. As announced in our earnings release today, we will significantly increase our quarterly dividend by 77% to $0.92 per share. This level will approximately equate to a target 40% payout ratio as a percent of net income. Moving forward, we plan to grow our dividend per share at a rate that is equal to or greater than our earnings per share over the next 5 years. It is important to note that future quarterly dividends are subject to Board of Directors discretion and approval. This dividend increase and future growth highlights our strong commitment to disciplined capital allocation and our confidence in Tractor Supply\u2019s trajectory. Now, we also remain committed to a consistent share repurchase program and our increased dividend should not be seen as being at the expense of our share repurchase program, but reinforcing the Power of AND. Let\u2019s now look at our long-term financial outlook. When comparing back to our 2019 long-term outlook, we have pulled forward 6 years of targeted growth into the past 2 years. We expect to build from our stronger revenue base and deliver 4% to 5% comps, 6% to 7% total sales on average over the next 5 years based on the solid evidence of the success of our Life Out Here strategy and the structural shifts in our markets as you heard from the team today. As I mentioned earlier, our greater line of sight into the cost drivers has enabled us to lift our long-term operating margin outlook from 10.1% to 10.6% range. This means that our compelling top line growth, operating margin outlook and consistent share repurchase program will enable us to deliver an 8% to 11% earnings per share growth over the next 5 years. Pulling this strong financial outlook together highlights Tractor Supply\u2019s long-term, double-digit TSR delivery potential. This double-digit TSR potential includes 8% to 11% EPS growth and an approximate 1.5% current dividend yield with further room to grow relative to earnings. Beyond this double-digit TSR, we see further potential upside that can be achieved by accelerating strategic initiatives and executing on tuck-in acquisitions. As I wrap up, I would like to leave you with some final thoughts. The strong finance performance and outlook I have talked through with you today is reflective of our success with our customers. The tireless and dedicated work of all of Tractor Supply\u2019s team, combined with the deep and growing loyalty of our customers is what makes Tractor Supply the company that it is. Building on my statements at our last enhanced earnings event, whether I look at our strong and sustainable growth outlook, the operating margin potential, the Power of AND and our double-digit TSR potential, in my 22 years at Tractor Supply, I cannot recall a time in which I have been more proud and excited about the future of the company. And I hope you all feel the same way. With that, I will turn it back over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Kurt. We appreciate everyone in the audience spending the last couple of hours with us. As we transition to Q&A, I hope you found compelling the updates we shared with you today. Kind of a quick summary of the incremental news we discussed. One, we are capitalizing the many macro structural benefits such as rural revitalization, self-reliance, home steady and pet ownership and we are investing in our capabilities like digital and loyalty to continue to widen our moat with the competition. Two, we provided an update to our long-term financial outlook that includes raising our operating margin to 10.1% to 10.6%. Three, we operate in a large, attractive and fragmented growing market that we now estimate to be $180 billion. Four, with our growing total addressable market and the vibrancy of our trade areas, we now see the opportunity for an additional 200 Tractor Supply stores, bringing our total store opportunity to 2,700 locations. Five, we had the financial flexibility to invest in our Life Out Here strategy and return capital to shareholders through the combination of dividends and share repurchases. Today, we announced our Board\u2019s approval to increase our quarterly dividend by 77% and an additional share repurchase authorization of $2 billion. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create value for our shareholders. Tractor Supply has a deep history and a track record of success. We are coming off a record 2 years. We have compelling opportunities for continued growth and the team to execute. The future tomorrow is bright for Tractor Supply. Thank you. Now we\u2019ll take a 5-minute break before we go to the Q&A segment. See you in a minute. [Video Presentation]\nA - Mary Winn Pilkington: Welcome back to the Q&A session of Tractor Supply\u2019s enhanced earnings event. We have assembled all of today\u2019s presenters and they are ready to take your questions. A couple of housekeeping notes first. Please limit your question to one per call with a clarifying follow-up only if necessary. We have been very proactive in trying to show plenty \u2013 and allow plenty of time for this Q&A session, so you are welcome to get back in the queue to ask any additional questions if time allows. For anyone just tuning in, a quick introduction of our team, President and CEO, Hal Lawton; CFO, Kurt Barton; Christi Korzekwa, SVP of Marketing; John Ordus, Chief Stores Officer; Rob Mills, Chief Technology, Digital Commerce and Strategy Officer; Seth Estep, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Colin Yankee, Chief Supply Chain Officer. We have a line of folks already standing by. So, let\u2019s take our first question. Our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Good morning, Kate.\nKate McShane: Hi, good morning. Nice to see everyone. Our question is centered around the operating margin opportunity. So I guess this question is for Kurt. We wondered about the cadence of the operating margin expansion over the next 5 years. Is it fairly even each year? And what is the biggest difference in this outlook versus what you gave us in October when it was a 9% to 9.5% range? I am just thinking that since the last time we spoke with you, transportation and labor is higher, while the top line outlook is staying the same?\nKurt Barton: Yes, hey, good morning Kate and thank you for the questions. On operating margin, as you think about the long-term targets, one, we are extremely pleased with the performance of the business. And the last 15 months have really shown in regards to is it structural, is it transitory in regards to the performance of the company, a lot more visibility and confidence in the structural nature of our business. And really that was one of the key factors when you look back to our enhanced earnings event 15 months ago. So, what we have seen first from the top line is that the belief in the structural nature of that really gives us the confidence on the SG&A that you have got that leverage. In regards to your question about how the cadence and what are some of the factors? I\u2019ll break it down between gross margin and SG&A and over time. So with gross margin, certainly, we recognize right now we are in unprecedented inflationary times, managing that really well. We expect that inflation, as I mentioned, our 2022 guidance, to persist in over the next few years we expect a general inflationary environment, but more typical modest inflation and we believe we can manage that through our scale and through our retail price management. Transportation and the supply chain disruptions, we believe those maybe a little bit longer in nature and it might take a few more years to be able to actually normalize on it. But in the back end of that timeframe some of that transportation easing and normalization. In addition to that, on the SG&A side, we look at it in our investments right now we are hitting some of the peak investments. We understand that those investments put pressure on the SG&A and it\u2019s the right thing for the long-term, along with investment in wages. So, the next couple of years have a stronger pressure in operating margin, but when you take the easing on the gross margin pressures of inflation, when you think about us beginning to have traction on the investments and our ability to drive efficiencies. I\u2019ll even mention really proud about our profit improvement, our operating efficiency programs that we\u2019ve got. We believe those are key drivers along with leverage from scale that allows us to be able to invest for the long-term, grow the top line. And during this time of investment, where you heard from Seth, really transforming many of our stores that we can do that while maintaining and potentially even grow our operating margin in the next 5 years. So it again, will be a little bit of easing into that. And maybe perhaps in the back end of it is more the upside of it, but we like that algorithm and the excitement that having an operating margin above 10% with phenomenal growth.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thank you. All right and our next question will come from Peter Benedict with Baird. Good afternoon. I guess, your time Peter. Nice to see you think morning.\nPeter Benedict: Hi, Mary Winn, yes, nice to see you all. Congratulations. Great event today. I guess maybe I just wanted to ask one about the cadence around Fusion and Side Lot, the rollouts there. Maybe you can talk a little bit more about how you see that over the next few years, how you gave some guidance on \u201822. Maybe something on the cost and the time to complete there is Side Lot tougher to get done here with some of the supply chain issues out there. And then maybe just an updated view on your Lawn and Garden TAM, what are you really going after here with Side Lot, and what type of share do you think you guys can get within those incremental categories over the next few years? Thank you.\nHal Lawton: Hey, Peter, and thanks for joining us today. I appreciate your question. If we look backwards last year, I just can\u2019t say enough about the fortitude and grit determination of the team to get 80 new stores open, to have 300-plus Fusion stores and over 150 Side Lot stores. And as you mentioned, given all the disruption from COVID is related permitting and construction crews and the availability of things like fixtures and other materials. To be able to still achieve our goals from the beginning of the year, it\u2019s just a real tribute to that team. In light of those issues, which we expect to persist for all of this year, we kind of kept our cadence for this year, similar to last year, as we talked about a couple of hundred Fusion stores, around 150 side lot stores and again, another 80 new store. And then if you kind of \u2013 all of our new stores also will be done with Fusion and many of our new stores also have garden centers. And then if you kind of take the balance, it will be really equally spread over the remaining 4 years as we lead to 2026, and that does assume a slight step-up in annual cadence from \u201823 and beyond. On the returns, we are very \u2013 continue to be very pleased with the returns of both Fusion and Side Lot. As we shared on our last earnings call, the Fusion-only stores are running in that kind of mid-single-digit comp once they get kind of the 12-month kind of cycle, maturity cycle. And then our combo stores are right at that kind of high single-digit comp. We\u2019re very excited that we\u2019ve got about 150 stores in our Side Lot combos that will be hitting that 12-month mark right around the time spring hit. So it\u2019s going to be a great opportunity for us to drive some sales and drive some share with those fresh stores. On the TAM, we talked about in my presentation about adding $40 billion to our TAM. And that is dominantly lawn and gardening, kind of live goods. And it\u2019s a fresh category for us, and one we think is a great opportunity. Our customers qualitatively, as we talked about, I talked about it being the number one category that they participate in that we least serve them in. And we\u2019re seeing great results as we talked about in the first cohort of stores. On the cost, it\u2019s hard to get each individual store because there is so much nuance depending on the setup of the store and the age of the store. But toughly, the way to think about it is we took our capital from $300 million to $600 million, roughly. About $100 million of that is supply chain with little technology. That leaves about a couple of hundred million left that involves our store investments. And then if you take the kind of 350 combo Fusion, Side Lot stores this year, you can kind of divide those into each other and get a sense. The range is anywhere from $0.5 million to $1 million a store that really just depending upon the nuances around that store. But again, really pleased with the return we\u2019re getting strong return on investment capital it\u2019s hitting all of our business cases. And as I said, we\u2019re really excited about having over 150 Side Lot stores open for business when we hit the spring garden season.\nPeter Benedict: That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks so much, guys.\nMary Winn Pilkington: And our next question comes from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Hey, Zach.\nZach Fadem: Hey, thanks for taking the question. And thanks for all the great data today. So following up on the last question, you noted that combo stores with Fusion and Side Lot are seeing high single-digit lift in year 1, which alone looks like about a 100 to 200 basis point comp lift per year through 2026. So first of all, it sounds like the early 2021 cohorts performed closer to a double-digit lift. So I just wanted to confirm that. And then curious if you have any thoughts on what those stores could in year 2 and beyond and whether they will continue to outcomp the fleet or fall back more in line with the broader company average.\nHal Lawton: Hey. Zach, and I appreciate your question, and thanks for joining us today. I\u2019d say two things. First off, kind of to clarify, high single-digit I think is kind of what we\u2019re on the record right now, around the 12-month mark for the combo stores. As it relates to the impact on comp, I think that\u2019s around \u2013 that\u2019s roughly right. You take, call it, 9%, 10% lift on kind of 10% of the store base annually. And do the math, and that\u2019s about what the contribution should be. That\u2019s certainly baked guidance. And as Kurt said, it\u2019s the thing that really gives us confidence in our guidance. And the last time we did an investor enhanced earnings call was in October 2020, we\u2019re roughly 35%, 40% bigger in revenue, right, larger revenues from that date. And yet we\u2019re still holding to our 4% to 5% long-term comp growth and 6% to 7% revenue growth. And it is because of the investments we\u2019re making in the Side Lot and in Fusion and there are other areas that we\u2019re confident they are really going to go after that growth and drive those sales and that we can do that mid-single-digit comp on top of revenue growth of over 50% in the last 2 years. And as we said, again, we\u2019re very excited about having well over 150 Side Lot stores business here in the spring season, and we\u2019re getting even a better read on the impact that it can have on our business.\nZach Fadem: Thanks so much. Really appreciate the time today.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Zach.\nMary Winn Pilkington: And our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Hi, Peter.\nPeter Keith: Hi, thanks, everyone. Good to see you and a terrific presentation today. I wanted to dig into some of the gross margin discussion. I think in thinking about the forward gross margin drivers, product mix was mentioned as a positive driver. That kind of goes counter to what we seen historically with the business, with the growth in C.U.E. I would think that product mix could also be hindered by the garden center expansion. So maybe you could unpack that a little bit on how you feel about product mix and what categories do you think can drive that positive shift? And then furthermore, just thinking about the other positive drivers to gross margin, pricing and promotions, there might be some skepticism on lower promotions, because there hasn\u2019t been lot of promotions in the last 2 years? So maybe you could unpack how you\u2019re thinking about delivering margin expansion on those, too?\nSeth Estep: Hey, thanks, Peter, this is Seth. Great question. Good to see you today. And when we look at gross margin as we manage forward, I would say if you look where we were historically, when we\u2019ve talked about C.U.E. outpacing the fleet now potentially could put a little bit of pressure on the company. What I would say today is that the balance of the four walls is really performing. So while C.U.E. is outpacing, we\u2019re continuing to premiumize even our C.U.E., we\u2019re pushing people, call it, into that premium segment. But outside of that, we\u2019re also seeing the apparel segment do really well for us today, right? We\u2019re seeing our truck and toy area is doing really well for us today. I could go around the four walls of the store, and we look at our sales forecast and we look at particularly, this upcoming year, we\u2019re anticipating all four walls continue to contribute to that sales number and that estimate that we have out there. So while C.U.E. is continuing to outperform, we\u2019re looking to continue to drive that C.U.E., drive those footsteps, coupled with the balance of the store, along with our pricing technology that we have today, which is much more sophisticated than we continue to have in the past. We feel confident in the ability to be able to look at the pressures that are coming in the business, manage the mix of the product and be able to deliver those gross margin targets that we have out there.\nPeter Keith: Okay, thanks so much, guys. Good luck.\nMary Winn Pilkington: And our next question comes from Steve Forbes at Guggenheim.\nSteve Forbes: Good afternoon, everybody.\nHal Lawton: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Forbes: I wanted to focus on e-commerce and digital growth. So Hal or Rob, you mentioned 15% penetration by 2026, which is a, I think, about a mid \u201820 CAGR in the next couple of years. So can you comment on how the average customer engages with this channel? The profitability of this channel, how that\u2019s evolved? And whether your initiatives behind this channel has increased the average numbers of transactions that you\u2019re seeing within all customer cohorts?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Absolutely, Steve. Thanks for your question. And I\u2019ll pass it over to Rob to address that. I appreciate it.\nRob Mills: Good morning, Steve. Great to see you, and thank you for the question. So in regards to the customer and the customer interaction, they are definitely engaging with from a digital perspective. And as you heard through my presentation, the focus around mobility first is very key as well as leveraging the power of the data that we have with Neighbor\u2019s Club. We have seen tremendous growth. We are extremely confident with that penetration rate. And we\u2019re holding in to really drive a personalized experience with that customer, telling what they need for the product, their services and just really simply, how do you remove any of the friction and really driving that convenience. From ability perspective, we\u2019re profitable. We deliver contributions back to Tractor Supply. We have a profitable online business. We will continue, of course, to look at profitability, ways to improve the profitability, leveraging all the great work that\u2019s being driven through either the analytics and understanding of our business through the product assortment mix as well as the work that\u2019s being done and can\u2019t see him. We look at the store as our primary hub, how do we fulfill from this store? Same day delivery, delivering from the store capability as well as buy online pickup as well as curbside pickup, which has been a tremendous growth opportunity. Lastly, I shared some core capabilities that we\u2019re focusing on. And going back to the mobile piece, it is around how we\u2019re putting mobile first. We\u2019re using the power of the Neighbor\u2019s Club and that analytics and knowing that customer to ensure that we\u2019re always connected with that customer at all times. When they are researching items so you are leveraging as the expert, so all the way through the ordering process, when you\u2019re actually fulfilling that customer order and how do you drive that connection back to the store, the store hub and being connected back to that team member. So we\u2019re providing that knowledge, that trust and the authority that our customer trusted. And so I guess I\u2019ll leave you with that. We have a clear road map, a strategy to move forward, both how we\u2019re engaging to the customer. We listen to the customer. We leverage the data and we\u2019re as well as we will continue to focus on the profitability, but we\u2019re strong and we\u2019re ready.\nSteve Forbes: Thank you.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thanks, Steve. And our next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli at Truist. Hey, Scot. Nice to see you.\nScot Ciccarelli: Thanks a lot, Mary Winn, good to see you as well. So my question has to do with the new customers. Obviously, new customers have been a significant source of growth for the last 2 years. And I think we can kind of all get our heads around kind of 2020 patterns, people moved away from urban centers. But I guess my question is, when you look at your cohort \u2013 the new customer cohort from \u201821, is it the same kind of cause and effect? Or is this a new customer acquired because some of the changes that Tractor Supply has been able to institute over the last few years?\nHal Lawton: Yes, hey, Scott. Thanks so much for the question today. I appreciate you joining us for the event. And I\u2019ll toss it over to Christi to talk about our new customers and the customer insights for seeing.\nChristi Korzekwa: Hi, Scott, thanks for the question. I\u2019m looking forward to talking to you about our new customers. You\u2019re right. I mean, we\u2019ve had record growth in 2020 during the pandemic of new customers, but that really didn\u2019t wane during 2021. We saw a very similar, if not even a larger pre-pandemic number in 2021. So those customers are coming back to us, are coming to us even in 2021. We see that, that has a lot to do with those structural changes that are happening in \u2013 with the pandemic relative to rural revitalization and more millennials moving in from urban to suburban, ex-urban and rural areas. And what we\u2019re finding is that 30% of our sales are coming from these new customers. So we feel incredibly positive about growth of the new customer, and it will continue. A lot of that given to the structural nature of our business, need space. They are moving into our trade areas, our Tractor Supply neighborhoods. They are buying homes there. They are starting garden, they are starting flocks, pet adoptions at record highs. So, just incredibly optimistic that our runway is still far from at an end and certainly, we identified 40 million customers that we can still talk to that should be shopping us that are within our trade areas, so just lot of momentum and a lot of power behind those new customers just excited about it.\nScot Ciccarelli: So just to clarify, if I might, so this isn\u2019t because you guys have expanded garden and live goods, this is just the customer migration towards kind of your areas and regions, which is what\u2019s driven it?\nChristi Korzekwa: I would say it\u2019s a combination of many things. I would say it is certainly the fact that we have a lot of customers moving into our trade areas. It\u2019s because we have our individuals maturing into the lifestyle. I would say it\u2019s because of our merchandising mix, I would say it\u2019s because of the trends and the work from home. So there is many factors that are attributing to the growth, certainly glad that we have a lot of runway with the 40 million customers that \u2013 or should be shopping us in our trade areas that we are going to be attracting over the next years to come.\nScot Ciccarelli: Thank you very much.\nChristi Korzekwa: Thank you.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Hi, Simeon. Nice to see you.\nSimeon Gutman: How are you doing? I look funny on camera. I wanted to go at Kurt, a follow-up to the question that Kate asked you about operating margin. If you look at your business in 2021 versus 2019, your sales per store were up just over 40% and your SG&A per store were up about 39%. So you spent into all of your growth, and that\u2019s about the tightest spreads you get across all of the companies we follow. So if your business continues to grow at 4% to 5% comps and new compound going forward, and your investment cycle is going to peak. Unless your SG&A continues for your gross margin comes down, it would seem like there is a lot of upward pressure on your EBIT margin way past the numbers you guided today. So what\u2019s wrong with that logic?\nKurt Barton: Simeon, yes, thank you for the question. I think it\u2019s a great one. And this team is basically focused on managing our operating margin overall. Here\u2019s a couple of the things that in regards to over the next 3 to 5 years. You pointed out the investments that we\u2019re making on the business. When we look at our operating margin, we look at what we\u2019re doing to invest from a position of strength and for the future. We\u2019re making key investments in the SG&A, and we\u2019re making investments in our supply chain. And those investments in the supply chain will help drive the market share and the sales that will help drive gross margin. We\u2019re making investments field activity support team. We\u2019re making investments in our IT technology. So we\u2019re making the right investments, and yes, that puts some pressure on the SG&A, but our focus on driving market share for the long-term and the ability to be able to enhance that gross margin, it\u2019s going to differ between the years. But we\u2019re going to be really focused on top line being competitive and getting a good price to our customer and maintaining a good operating margin and keeping that even balanced. I\u2019ve mentioned in my presentation, I put in that slide that we recognize there is some uncertainties in the financial algorithm today, unprecedented inflation. We\u2019re seeing wage inflation and make sure that we\u2019re positioned again to invest in our stores, in our technology by doing all of those things along with just having COVID expenses still in the business like most of retail. All of those costs we have some expectations continue to play into the financial algorithm, and there is opportunity. We want to be careful. We want to be prudent in our operating margin. And we feel like some of those factors turn positive in the long-term, that does give us the opportunity for that while we\u2019re being pretty prudent in that approach and making sure that we\u2019re doing the right thing for the business and real steady throughout these 5 years.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you, everyone.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Simeon.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thanks, Simeon. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Hey, Michael.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Your guidance for this year assumes that you\u2019re going to get 400 basis points of an inflation contribution. You also mentioned you expect traffic to be up. So let\u2019s assume that\u2019s going to be up 50 basis you the high end of your comp range. You also mentioned that you expect big ticket to be under pressure this year. Presumably, your core customer also saw an extraordinary amount of government support from stimulus, enhanced unemployment and child tax payments last year. How have you factored that into your guidance for this year? And as a follow-up, and a quick clarifying, after we get through fiscal supply chain disruption, what\u2019s the prospect for some potential deflation in your categories?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey, Michael, and tanks for the question. I mean I think the math you provided is really kind of the math that our guidance reflect is about four points of inflation in the year that will drive ticket up, kind of a give back on ticket of a couple of points because of stimulus due to last year\u2019s kind of surge in big ticket, kind of netting to a couple of points. And then the balance of our comp range made up of comp transactions to kind of get there, so in kind of that 1% to 2% range on the comp transactions. And we feel very good about that formula. And we\u2019re committed to unit growth, and we\u2019re committed to comp transaction growth this year. And we gained substantial share over the past years we talked about. We think there is a big opportunity to continue to do that. And then on deflation, I think there is a likely \u2013 there is \u2013 that\u2019s always out there. I think it\u2019s really unlikely for the foreseeable future for a variety of reasons. Dominantly that the majority of the inflation we\u2019ve seen is, I think, structural in terms of the new levels that we\u2019re at, whether that\u2019s wages, many of the cost of goods, freight, imports. I think we\u2019re going to see a kind of a structural holding of a lot of those costs. I don\u2019t know they will continue to see inflation, but I don\u2019t know we\u2019re going to see significant deflation on that certainly in the next 18, 24 months or so. And the other thing I\u2019d say is our past cycle on inflation, it\u2019s been really kind of the core commodities that drove it. And here, it\u2019s really across the board. I mean, we\u2019re seeing cost of goods increases due to wages, cost of goods due to steel, cost of goods due at other raw materials and our manufacturers\u2019 wages. So I think it\u2019s more structural in nature. The final thing I would leave is we lot more sophistication around our pricing tools and our competitive pricing engines that we had before. And so we\u2019re just a lot more sophisticated in the way we can navigate through that. But regardless of how the environment evolves, I think we\u2019ve shown our ability to be flexible, agile, deliberate performance, stay priced in the market, continue to gain share and deliver results, and that\u2019s our commitment, whether it\u2019s an inflationary environment or a deflationary environment.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you and good luck.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thanks, Michael. Our next question is going to come from Chris Horvers at JPMorgan. Hey, Chris, how are you?\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good afternoon, thank you for the presentation. So a bit of a follow-up question to Michael. So as you think about elasticity and inflation, you saw some headwinds to gross margin rate from product cost inflation. Is that simply you managing the business from a gross profit dollar perspective versus not a gross margin rate perspective? And then similarly, on the macro side, as you think about your potential sensitivity to wealth effect and higher rates in housing, have you taken any of that into account considering your expectation for continued ruralization?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey, Chris and good to speak with you today. And I\u2019d say, first off, on pricing. I think the team has done a fantastic job navigating the cost environment, finding offsets to many of the inflation factors and productivity and efficiency. Also being that advocate for the customer on price and making sure we\u2019re staying price right every single day. And then where we have found it necessary and needed to, we have passed through price. I mean, to the tune of 7% price inflation in Q3 and 8.5% price inflation in Q4. I think our guidance as we talked about a 4% inflation for 2022 reflects kind of the higher single-digit price inflation through the first half starting to cycle that and settle back into low single digits in the second half. If you look at all the puts and takes, I think there is more risk to the upside on our inflation assumption than there is to the downside. But the team will continue to navigate, navigate through that as we go forward. And remind me, Chris, the second part of the question?\nChris Horvers: So as you think about \u2013 clearly, you\u2019ve had a strong wealth effect for the consumer low rates, house price increases, stock market benefit. Surely, that\u2019s had some impact to your consumer and the sort of ruralization that you\u2019ve seen as people sort of spend more time in rural homes. So have you taken any potential headwinds into account from rates moving up and decelerating the housing and wealth engine?\nHal Lawton: Yes. It\u2019s something we certainly watch closely. Christi and the team have a number of ways that they monitor the health of our customer, whether it\u2019s quantitative and qualitative. I\u2019d say, right now, the home market is really strong, right? There is less than 1 million homes that are available on the market around, I think, 900,000 last month, 1.6 million, 1.7 million new homes being built right now on an annualized basis. existing home sales, well above $6 million. I think that\u2019s going to continue for really the next couple of years at a minimum, even in spite of interest rates and even likely in spite of \u2013 within reason, home prices. You just got a millennial generation that\u2019s now wanting to purchase homes. And I think in general, that\u2019s good for us. When people buy homes or transact around homes, it creates projects. It\u2019s a big project starter, and we see that in our business. And I think it\u2019s going to continue on. The consumer still has over $2 trillion of pent-up savings. I think the last month or 2, if you look at the data, they have started to tap into that a little bit. But there is runway certainly for the balance of this year as they draw down, so to speak, on those pent-up savings to drive the GDP growth that I think is being forecasted really across the country. And I think rural customers have navigated this environment better than the average kind of a consumer out there. And I think we\u2019re in a very favorable market as we head into 2022. Thanks so much, Chris for your questions.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thanks, Chris. And up next is Scott Mushkin with R5. Hey, Scott, how are you, today?\nScott Mushkin: Hi, Mary Winn. How are you guys doing? Thanks for having me on and thanks for conducting. This is great. So I wanted to actually attack the revenue side of things, your revenue growth algorithm. It seems to me if you look over the next several years. And I think you guys said it right, like you kind of only just begun to make these changes. I mean, clearly, Lawn and Garden is an adjacent category, but there is a lot more where as you guys transition into the more kind of lifestyle superstore. It seems like there is a lot of other categories you could get into become bigger and some are available online. So I wanted to ask you about that. I also wanted to ask about the making store more experiential. We have the check based and stuff like that, but it\u2019s obviously more you can do that way. And then finally on services, again, another enormous opportunity for the company to layer in additional services and so there is a lot here. And do you guys have a speed to attack all this, and it seems like revenue growth could actually come in significantly higher?\nHal Lawton: Hey, Scott, thanks so much of the question. And I think we\u2019re going to break that up into two parts with Seth, can you maybe talk a little bit about the assortment and how we\u2019re evolving and much of that he shared in the video and kind of recap some of that. And then maybe John can talk a little bit about the experiences in our stores, whether it\u2019s chip days, pet watches, clinics and many of the other things, the 4-H and FFA type stuff that we do. But Seth, you want to hit the assortment expansion first?\nSeth Estep: Yes, absolutely. Hey, Scott, great to see you. Thanks for the question. I\u2019m incredibly excited about exactly what you\u2019re talking about and how I outlined earlier our expansion of our total addressable market. And from a merchandising perspective, that\u2019s what really, really excites us because we know we have opportunities across our business as we\u2019re seeing both our core shopper and these new shoppers that are finding Tractor Supply as we\u2019re introducing them to this lifestyle. They are finding the buying and where we know we have that considerable market share opportunity. Our merchants are continuing to attack that with partnerships, exclusivity, going after differentiation, driving experiences in the store that John will talk both inside the box, but also looking at outside the box. Obviously, with what we\u2019re looking garden centers, our front aprons could go on and on. And so we\u2019re looking at this year. Again, I mean, you talk about things like apparel and the trends that we\u2019re seeing like in Carhartt, Ariat as well as our own exclusive brands, whether it be like in Ridgecut and expanding into women\u2019s, those are the things that we\u2019re really looking to attack. As well as like in pet, constant, constant newness that the team is going after, whether it be like the introduction of brands like Victor and Tractor Supply as well as doubling down on brands that we\u2019re really seeing growth for like that would be considered specialty for the rural marketplace like science diet, Proplan, etcetera. And I can go around the store. And if you think about things like where we have big opportunities, we\u2019re approaching spring. And you mentioned Chick Days, we\u2019ve talked about live goods. But we\u2019ve also got things like the electrification of these new shoppers that are in \u2013 or the OPE market, these new shoppers per coming in. We announced this past week, our partnership that I\u2019m really excited about with Greenworks and Greenworks Pro. We know shoppers have been trending towards the battery market, but we\u2019ve been really waiting on a product that we believe that would stand up to the demands of consumer. And that\u2019s what we really went after and have created this partnership with them. That\u2019s just like one area and one category that we continue to talk to. But we\u2019re really not playing in today, but we\u2019re going after, and we\u2019re going to continue to go after that with market share and play in the future. So absolutely agree that I can talk about product all day long and within our store and not just in the store, but also online with Rob and team with the product expansion there. So John, I\u2019ll turn it over to talk about experiences.\nJohn Ordus: Yes. Hey, Scott. Good to see you, again.\nScott Mushkin: Hey, John. Good to see you.\nJohn Ordus: So I\u2019m going to break it down in a couple different parts. So one is we hire our customers. So our team members love talking about everything that we have inside of our stores. So you brought up chick days, it\u2019s an event side of our store, where we have chick captains in there. They know the chicks. They work with the chicks when customers come in here, there is a good conversation that goes back and forth between that customer and that team member. The other things we do is stuff for our Greenworks, like we love theater inside of the side of the store. So some events we\u2019re doing this year, like try before you buy, we have an even a weekend where our team members are all going to be outside, and we\u2019re going to be test driving the Greenworks and using the blowers and using the weed whipper and different things and using our different power equipment materials. The other thing is we love to be able to have the community involvement. So we bring in things like 4-H, FFA. We do things like hot dogs outside. We\u2019ve come in, our customers do donations for them, but we have it where they can talk to each other, do chicken swaps and different things out front. So we kind of break up into many different parts, but we look to be part of those individual communities.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Thanks so much, Scott, for the question. And as you were mentioning, just in wrap up here, we are literally pushing every corner of the store really into kind of a more modern, contemporary assortment, right? A Seth shared, shared expansion of power tools into kind of a legitimate tool chorale, expansion of pet into full fledge pet offering, deepening our commitment around animal feed, expanding into live goods, bringing in services like pet wash. John has over 250 stores now doing delivery with our own trucks. So just so many things that we\u2019re pushing the envelope, so to speak, on every inch of the store, all around just sweating our assets more, getting more productivity out of those stores and delivering those mid-single-digit comps. Our goal is to gain market share every single year to grow above GDP, to grow above retail and to grow above growth rates. And we think we\u2019ve got an exciting plan to do that.\nScott Mushkin: Thanks, guys.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Scott.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thanks so much, Scott. Up next is Joe Feldman with TAG. Hi, Joe. Please go ahead with your question.\nJoe Feldman: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask, given everything you just said about all the opportunities that you do have in front of you. You\u2019ve mentioned tuck-in acquisitions a few times. And I\u2019m just wondering what you\u2019re thinking there. Is that more to acquire small competitors? Is it getting into new product lines or categories or even just for infrastructure to run the business better? I just wanted you to share some thoughts on that.\nHal Lawton: Yes, Kurt, do you want to share our capital allocation strategy and then talk about tuck-in acquisitions after that?\nKurt Barton: Yes, definitely. Just to \u2013 I\u2019ll start with reiterating the capital allocation. Certainly, our number one priority is investing in our stores, and we see still significant opportunity, as I mentioned, nearly a decade of growth in the runway of new stores. The investments we\u2019re making to sweat those assets and put more productivity in the stores that already have the occupancy and the rent there. So Joe, to your point, first, we\u2019ve got so much opportunity in the growth of the business and grab the total addressable market and grab market share there. Then of course, after that, we feel with the tremendous step-up in growth and the consistent operating cash flow will return to with the opportunity, both dividend and share repurchases, thrilled to be able to announce the Board\u2019s approval of a 77% increase in dividends. As far as the tuck-in acquisitions then, where there are opportunities. We\u2019ve not been highly acquisitive. We feel there is so much opportunity in our core. But where there are opportunities, Tractor Supply is sometimes that an exit strategy in our niche industry, where there is area that we are not in. I mean we\u2019re open to that opportunity. If we look at it and say, hey, there is opportunity to grab the real estate we\u2019re not in or to complement. And so if there is a acquisition, if there is a capability that builds on one of the strategic initiatives that you hear from us as part of Life Out Here strategy to buy versus build, we will look at that opportunity. But it\u2019s certainly more of that opportunistic things on our radar and really excited about what we\u2019ve got right in front of us, and there may be complementary opportunities.\nJoe Feldman: Thank you.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thanks, Joe. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer. Hi, Brian, how are you?\nBrian Nagel: Good. How are you doing? Good morning. Great presentation, thank you. So my question \u2013 I know it\u2019s a bit of a follow-up to some of the prior questions. But I mean clearly one of the big themes in today\u2019s meet in all the comments is just the rebasing higher sales. And as I think about that dynamic, clearly, there is now \u2013 there is more people sort of say there is a large portion of population living a lifestyle that wins to Tractor Supply. But at the same time, you have \u2013 you\u2019ve taken market share gains. There is always been this market share opportunity for Tractor Supply, and we talked about that for years. But I guess as you look \u2013 maybe more color on what you\u2019re actually seeing with market share? I mean through the academic where there are more permanent changes in your competitive set that lend to these sustainability some market share gains? Or \u2013 and on the other side, are you seeing \u2013 is this is happening? Are you starting to see some competitors that maybe seeded share starting to fight back more now?\nHal Lawton: Hey, Brian, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll break it into three buckets. First off, we talked about over the last few years, our market grew at about 25% in aggregate over those 2 years. And I think that does say to all the trends that we\u2019ve outlined and you implied in your question. The second two things I\u2019ll highlight are really around investment. We\u2019ve got substantial structural advantages in our digital business, in our Neighbor\u2019s Club, in our supply chain, in our store base and the way we train our team members, the technology we use inside of our stores for our team members like our Theatro headsets and our Honeywell handheld devices. And so \u2013 and those are things that we have historically invested in and there are things we invested in over the last 2 years. It was mentioned earlier about our operating margins come up in the context of our sales, perhaps not grown as much as some others out there. And the reason is because we put a lot of that expense back into the business, we kept our stores heavily staffed, we paid the appropriate wages, we invested in marketing, we invested in digital. And I think as we talked we gained \u2013 our sales grew over 50% over the last few years. And it\u2019s really \u2013 the reason we been able to double the market growth rate is because we had the inventory in our stores. We had the people to service them. We had buy online, pick up in store when others didn\u2019t. We had a Neighbor\u2019s Club program talk those customers and bringing them back into the stores. We had a supply chain that partnerships that allow product to flow in a way that others couldn\u2019t. And once people over 2 years change their shopping behaviors, it\u2019s really quite infrequent for them to slip back unless we let them down. The third thing is all the structural all the incremental investments we\u2019ve made in our Life Out Here strategy, the Fusion stores, the garden center stores, all the incremental technology investments we made. Last year, we talked about mid-single digits on Fusion, doubled \u2013 high single digits on the Side Lot combo stores. And that was only on 300 and 150 stores. So we are starting to see kind of the initial impact of those in our comps, and we\u2019re excited about those continuing to drive our business in the future, plus it\u2019s holding on to those customers and having a higher sales base. But I kind of break it into those three buckets, structural trends driving the overall market, us being committed to operating with excellence in the midst of the last 2 years and then investing on top of that with that momentum to gain even more share.\nBrian Nagel: Thanks, Hal. That\u2019s really helpful. Congrats.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Brian.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thanks, Brian. Next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. Hi, Karen. How are you today?\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks very much everyone. Yes, a couple of questions. Just actually following up on that, when you think about your top line growth versus your unit growth within the context of your algorithm, how should we think about that relationship? Because depending on the scenarios, I guess growing a little bit at rate and sales on the algorithm. And then the second question I had is on your increased unit potential, I was wondering if you could just talk about that analysis in more detail, given the 40 million incremental potential customers, I actually would have thought that your unit potential is higher?\nHal Lawton: Yes. So, I will take the unit potential question then turn it back to Kurt to talk about operating margin leverage. On the unit potential, what we have is John and the team have been very sophisticated kind of map of our country, kind of ZIP code by ZIP code. We know what the demand potential is. We know where our stores are, we know where competitive stores are. And we look at those void spaces that are in that map. We then take those void spaces and bounce them up against the financial model and say, does it create value if we put a store there? And historically, that analysis has led us to 2,500 stores. Now with the growth in our market, that creates one, some new void spaces, but also it makes some void spaces that were not previously financially attractive, more financially attractive now. As I mentioned, our new stores over the last 3 years have significantly outperformed their business case. Our new stores are profitable in the first year. And so the combination of those factors led us to take our new store target up from 2,500 to 2,700. And we feel very confident in that number. And hopefully, in a couple of years, there is more on top of that, but we feel very good about that number. And Kurt can talk about our operating margin leverage.\nKurt Barton: Yes. Hey Karen, good to see you. Let me ask for clarification because you broke up a it on the question on EBIT. So, I know it was an EBIT margin question and also referencing sales growth, but maybe just clarify that.\nKaren Short: Well, no, it was thinking about the EBIT growth percent relative to the sales growth, right? So, we don\u2019t know what you have done historically, but within your guidance, I think that to a decent rainwear site to range where the growth grows in line with sales growth or it grows slightly at a greater rate. So, just wondering how you think about that within the context of the algorithm?\nKurt Barton: Yes, great. From an operating standpoint, I mean the \u2013 again, I will just reference the key \u2013 if the question is regarding our long-term outlook, and we think about the EBIT margin in there is that we see an important opportunity right now to make investments, and a lot of that investment will be in the stores technology and in our supply chain. And so as we make the investments and those investment pressures are on SG&A, we also see great leverage through our operating efficiencies, the leverage from the growth in the sales. And so we have \u2013 over the next 3 years to 5 years, we see definite inflation and pressure from investments that we can offset with the leverage and with the operating efficiencies. On the gross margin side, we also see over time that we have got the opportunity from those investments able to grow our gross margin. So, there is some good opportunity in here with our scale and with the work that Colin and Seth are doing to be able to grow some of that gross margin at a faster rate and really see that opportunity there. So, from the algorithm, our assumption is that these investments are growing the top line, but also giving our gross margin an opportunity to grow. And there is likely to be more growth in the operating margin over that 5-year period in our assumption from the gross margin side as we balance out our efficiencies, our investments in the SG&A side.\nKaren Short: Okay. Thank you very much.\nHal Lawton: And Karen, the only thing I would say is like in a really simple way for me is you have got revenue growth of kind of 6% to 7%. And then you got the EPS growth, which Kurt took us through at 8% to 11%, and then you were buying a couple of percent of share back. So, if you take those out, we are kind of growing EPS kind of 6% to 9% organically, which means earnings are going to grow kind of with sales or slightly better on an annualized basis on average. And which means kind of particularly after this next year to cycle of investment, we will grow kind of operating margin about 0.1 point a year, and that kind of leads you up to that 10.6%.\nMary Winn Pilkington: That\u2019s great clarification there Hal. Up next on the line is Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom: Hi. Thanks. Great presentation, everyone. A lot of great statistics today, but the one that really called my eye was the 40 million additional customers in your trade area. So, I was hoping, Christi could speak to the timeline for acquiring these new shoppers. And then as a follow-up for Hal on the gross margins, I believe you spoke to roughly flattish for 2022. How should we think about the cadence of gross margins throughout the year?\nChristi Korzekwa: Yes. Hi Chuck. Thanks for the question. I love talking about our customers. And just thinking about our customers pre-pandemic or when the pandemic first started through 2020, we acquired 11 million new customers. We are still comping the pre-pandemic numbers in 2021. We have more new customers in 2021 than we did pre-pandemic. So, 10 million to 11 million a year is what we are attracting, and 50% of those are returning to us after they shop. So, we are attracting and retaining a lot of new customers. And with the new work with the TAM and the opportunity in Fusion and Side Lot, there is so much more opportunity for us to really begin to attract even more than those 10 million a year new customers. But we are on a trend line right now of 10 million to 11 million new customers every year, and I would see us just accelerating that over time.\nHal Lawton: Yes. And I would just speak, Christi and the team are just doing an outstanding job. I think raising the awareness of our business, going from 34 points 2 years ago to 55 points. Now, that 21-point awareness increase, I think has really helped kind of drive traffic into our stores. And then whether it\u2019s through online and product assortment or John and the team at customer service, that conversion in the store and then holding those customers. And then I think just continues to build on top of itself as we continue to grow that awareness and have that fantastic experience in our store and online. As it relates to the kind of operating margin algorithm, I think the way we think about it is very similar to the way we have talked about the last couple of years, which is we would see us continuing to kind of that 10.1% to 10.6%. Last year, we did a 10.3%. The year before that, it was a 10.1%. And the bulk of that gain was really in gross margin rate as we held SG&A kind of roughly flat. As we think about the next few years, particularly once we get through this peak investment over this year and next year. I think gross margins will hold to maybe moderate some. And then the leverage is where that we will see will be in SG&A. And that\u2019s what kind of gives us that range between 10.1% and 10.6% with us creeping towards the middle to higher end of the range as we get into the out years of the 5-year range. And Seth and the team are doing a fantastic job navigating all the cost inflations that are coming through, offsetting it in ways they can and then passing through some on price. And then importantly, maintaining little to no promotions and then also little to no clearance. And the great thing is we list on last year, we were asking whether or not the little to no promotions could remain kind of structural in nature or whether or not that would creep back in. And I think after a couple of years, really the behaviors in the market have evolved, particularly as we look at this year and continuing to be constrained still in supply chain. So, we feel really good about maintaining kind of little to no promotions as we look into future and kind of stay in core to our EDLP trip routes.\nChuck Grom: Alright. Thank you.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thanks Chuck. And our next question comes from Oli Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. Hey Oli, how are you today.\nOli Wintermantel: Hi. I am good. Thanks. Thanks very much for the presentations today. I had a question regarding the longer term outlook on your transactions or traffic within the comps. If you think about what drives your traffic within the stores. And then on an inflation basis, if that normalizes over the next 5 years, how do you think about the mix between traffic and transactions?\nKurt Barton: Yes. Hey Oliver, I will take that. First, I will start by just talking about 2022 as a quick reminder, and then beyond that. So, for 2022, what we have said is we plan and are targeting positive comp transaction and positive comp ticket. And ticket likely to lead more than transaction in 2022. Beyond 2022, while every year could be a bit different, what we think about it is it\u2019s really going to be pretty balanced. And if you refer back to some of the real drivers of our comps that we have talked about, you have got Fusion and Side Lot that are driving traffic into the store with new categories. They are also driving ticket, digital doing the same thing, the work that John and Colin talked about on delivering on legendary service. These types of things, we really see the strategic initiatives that we have got and the momentum in the business that in the 2023 to 2026 period of time is that we have got opportunity to be really balanced between both of those because these strategic initiatives are focused long-term on driving market share, which means traffic, which means footsteps into the stores and clicks on the website.\nOli Wintermantel: Okay. Thanks very much. Good luck.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thanks so much. Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro at Stephens. Hi Daniel, how are you?\nDaniel Imbro: Hi, good morning. Thanks for all the info today and taking the question. I had a two-parter for Hal and Colin, just as we think about growth on your existing infrastructure, maybe how in the stores, as we think about store efficiency, are you seeing any throughput issues as the team is handling more volume? How is store turnover doing as the team members are being asked to handle more? And then Colin, you talked about the DC investments. But can you talk about any investments in existing DCs to improve efficiencies? And then maybe you can provide an update on turnover given the wage investments you made?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hi Daniel. Thanks for joining us today and I appreciate the question. I would start by saying, we have seen some modest increases in our turnover this year, certainly relative to last year when turnovers were at all-time lows. But I think we fared much better than most companies. One, first and foremost, because of our culture and our commitment to mission and values and all the things that John talked about earlier around our commitment to the communities and hiring our customers. And then secondly, we have made substantial investments in wages and benefits and other benefits over the last couple of years, which have served us well in terms of retention. And then in terms of kind of flow through the business, our \u2013 we are up substantially on C.U.E. over the last couple of years. No one sells more animal feed and bag animal feed in the country than we do. We are one of the top retailers on pet food as well. And interestingly, on \u2013 particularly on the pet side, our customers skew larger on their pets, right. So, we sell more than anyone 50-pound bags of dog food and certainly the vast majority of our animal food are 50-pound bags, and that\u2019s flow through, a lot of tonnage through. We are the lowest cost to serve all those in the market. We are committed to being the lowest cost to serve. We are committed to be able to be in stock on those. And that\u2019s really a lot of what Colin\u2019s presentation and focus is going to be on for the next couple of years and let him elaborate a bit on that.\nColin Yankee: Sure. Daniel, thanks for the question. As far as turnover, I think Hal answered that. But with investment in our existing distribution centers to drive throughput, I just can\u2019t thank our team enough. They hit a record level throughput this last year. And I would say it\u2019s more than just the distribution centers. It\u2019s really tough to execute that we have a planning problem. So, it starts upstream with working with our vendors, with our replenishment allocation, with our transportation team to make sure we set the distribution centers are for success. So, the team is at phenomenally in 2020 and 2021, given all the different disruptions that we have well publicized across the supply chain. Within the four walls of our existing distribution centers, we are really reaping the benefits this last year and going into 2022 of investments we made in profit improvement over the previous years with bringing all of our systems up to the common execution platform across all distribution centers. Two, engineered labor standards within our facilities to drive throughput and efficiency to schedule flexibility and communication with our team members. And most importantly, to the quality of leadership that we have in developing our frontline leaders because we know our team members can go work at other distribution centers, and these distribution centers intense kind of geographical areas, but they choose to work at Tractor Supply because of our culture, because of our mission, because of the way they are treated in those facilities. And that\u2019s an enduring strength that\u2019s going to carry us through for the next foreseeable future.\nDaniel Imbro: Thank you. Good luck.\nHal Lawton: Thanks Daniel. Appreciate it.\nMary Winn Pilkington: And our next question comes from Steve Zaccone at Citi. Hi Steve.\nSteve Zaccone: Great. Hi Mary Winn. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for the presentation today. I had a question on 2022 and then just a follow-up on like the longer term targets. So, we think about 2022 from an inflation perspective, could you talk about the level of inflation from maybe a category perspective relative to what you saw in 2021? It seems like it\u2019s more broad-based than the nature. And the other question I had just on the longer term targets, the last time you met with us, you talked about a potential giveback year to cycling some of the strength. It doesn\u2019t seem like this is factoring in a give-back year. What\u2019s really driving the confidence that you don\u2019t have that give-back here?\nSeth Estep: Hi Steve, this is Seth. Relative to inflation and what that outlook is this year versus this past year, what I would say is if you were to go back to 2021 in the beginning of that year, it really started with the commodity markets, right? And you think about grains, then we move more into steel, then other cost pressures continued on our supplier side, continue to roll to, call it, cost of goods pressure, whether that would be getting components from overseas to here, their labor rates, etcetera. And what I would say is we are \u2013 as we have entered into 2022 and where we are today, it is more broad-based. And so relative to last year, you are looking more broad-based across the four walls. What I would say about that, though, is when we think about our pricing sophistication, we know where the price is coming at us. And we know what\u2019s in front of us and our \u2013 and the team has done a fantastic job from an analyst perspective, utilizing our tools to be able to go out and make sure that be priced right in the market, to drive market share, measure elasticities and at the same time, make sure that we can manage the P&L accordingly. So, as you look at last year, it did really started commodities, really went into steel. Now it is more broad-based and that\u2019s where we see it heading in 2022.\nKurt Barton: Hi, Steven. I will take the question on the reference back to the last enhanced earnings call, where we had that give-back year. And your reference, I am assuming you go back to that line graph that many have referred back when they are talking with me about it. And really back then, the question was all about structural or transitory, and really how resilient is this step-up in growth. And 15 months ago, there was that legitimate question of how much of this growth is a temporary shift in behavior that\u2019s in favor of Tractor Supply. But all the things that we have talked about and what Christi mentioned in regards to the permanent shifts in some of the customers, not only geographic locations, but what the hobbies are and people entering in our lifestyle, millennials buying homes, those types of things began to get answered over an 18-month period of time. I will reference back to, as an example, one of the slides I presented, I think is really powerful that over this period of time, what we saw that we had growth from new customers, 30% but then growth in existing new categories of the product as well into existing digital as well as in brick-and-mortar and the fact that our growth was from transactions and ticket. And when you look at transaction and basket, it was the biggest piece of it, so really broad, diverse growth in it and the fact that we have had consistency. Best way to give an example on the consistency. Last three quarters, 40% almost to a tee, each of those quarters, 2 years back on the comp. So, as we work through that, it really solidified that these are enduring customer relationships that are benefiting Tractor Supply. It\u2019s really the difference between what our outlook was 15 months ago versus what we are presenting today, and really excited about that for the future.\nSteve Zaccone: Very helpful guys. Thanks very much.\nHal Lawton: Thanks Steven. Appreciate it.\nMary Winn Pilkington: And our next question comes from Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Hi Liz.\nLiz Suzuki: Hey. Thanks so much for hosting this event. I just had a follow-up to Karen\u2019s question about the store base. Is it correct to assume that essentially all of those 2,700 stores will ultimately have Fusion layout and that the vast majority will have Side Lot, or are there any alternative store formats that might be considered in that 2,700 number? And a related question about Petsense, and what you view as the long-term opportunity for that store base?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hi Liz. Yes, that\u2019s correct. All new stores are being built with the Fusion layouts. So \u2013 and that was the case in 2021 and will be the case moving forward. As it relates to the garden center, it\u2019s really on a store-by-store basis, whether or not the store is built with a garden center, depends on what the market opportunity assessment tells us. What I would say is this year in 2022, the vast majority of our new stores will have the garden center, and that\u2019s incremental to some of the guidance that we gave on our existing store base through the presentation. And then as it relates to Petsense, we haven\u2019t had a chance to talk about that business today, but the business is doing very well. Matthew Rubin joined us last year about this time to lead the business, done an excellent job of kind of driving the business. They had an excellent year, strong sales growth and profit growth, a number of new stores built. We have made several elements of integration that are customer facing like we now sell for health branded food inside of Petsense. We are in the process of doing some things in terms of integration later in the year on Neighbor\u2019s Club and also some integration on branding. We are also taking our software now implemented that inside of Petsense. And we are also working on kind of a centralized inventory platform, whereas right now, the stores are done via kind of the individual store base. And so a lot of work is going on to leverage the breadth of Tractor Supply to make Petsense better. The team is doing a great job driving it. We have got a number of new stores that will be built for Petsense this year, and we are excited about the future of that business.\nLiz Suzuki: Great. Thank you so much.\nMary Winn Pilkington: We have got time for two more questions. So, we will go up to two more questions. And up next is Bobby Griffin with Raymond James. Hi Bobby. Bobby, we are having a little bit of trouble hearing you.\nBobby Griffin: Thank you, Mary Winn. Yes. Sorry about that. I guess I just want to quickly unpack the long-term growth targets. Is the rate \u2013 and what the embedded market rate is in those targets? Is the right way to think about it is the market grows, say, 3 to 4 Tractor that picks up a point of market growth share in comps, or is the market growth going to grow in line with comps and then the market share gains come from the new store growth?\nHal Lawton: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And I think we think about it the latter, that kind of long-term GDP, the country is kind of 2% to 3%. Our market typically maybe grows kind of 0.5-ish point above that, 2.5% to 3.5%, maybe ease up to 4% with our comp guidance of 4% and 5%. We are certainly taking share in the markets that we are already in. And then the building of new stores just allows us to take incremental share on top of that. So, it\u2019s a bit of a blend of the two scenarios you mentioned, but it\u2019s certainly taking share with our existing stores, growing our sales productivity. And then on top of that, also gaining it through both new store build-outs as well as digital.\nBobby Griffin: Thank you. Best of luck.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thanks Bobby. And our last question will come from John Lawrence with Benchmark. John, please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Lawrence: Great. Thanks for doing this today, that\u2019s great and congrats on the year. Can you talk a little bit about the pet business. And you mentioned the pet washes and the wellness clinics. Can you talk a little bit what happens when you add one of those into the business? Does that customer go around and shop? Just so how much does he pull from other categories? I think you mentioned you had over 40. How big could that business be? And what are you seeing with the availability of veterinarians in this environment?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hi. Thanks for the questions. First off, I would start off by saying our pet business is incredibly strong. We talked about our C.U.E. and its performance over the last handful of quarters, out-comping our overall store. And then we mentioned that pet particularly dry dog food is outperforming even our C.U.E. business. So, our pet business is very strong, both in-store and online. And then we certainly want to make sure we are providing a full suite of services around that. And I will let John talk a little bit about the dynamics and we have a pet wash or a pet clinic or a mobile clinic and how that plays out in our stores.\nJohn Ordus: Yes. Thanks John for the question. So, our pet washes \u2013 so as soon as a customer uses the pet wash, they continue to come back and back and back. They love using the pet wash. They like to come back. We have pet washers where some stores will do over 100 a week in pet washes. So, the customer really likes it. They enjoy it, they love that feed and they like being able to take care of their pet. It doesn\u2019t have to always be a dog though. Sometimes it\u2019s something else. You asked about what they do after that. So, let\u2019s go into the store and the number one thing they buy is the collar. Because the first thing you do if you wash your pet is you want to get something new for the pet, so you will get a collar. They will also pick up some other while they can\u2019t get the rest of their shopping done. Out of the pet wellness clinics or the mobile clinics that come up to the front of our stores, we have lines out in front of our stores for these clinics. Customers use them. We advertise them out there, Christi and her team to get it out there. And then customers will come in, they will sign up and then they love getting their dogs taking care of out there. So, it\u2019s something our customers really like. They love the fact that we do it for them, they love the convenience about it.\nJohn Lawrence: How many of those stores could you add over time or those projects?\nHal Lawton: Yes. So, pet wash is now kind of a core component set outline of our Fusion stores. Really, the only time it\u2019s not going into a Fusion stores when there is a legit kind of a real space limitation. So, we see over time, the vast majority of our stores having a pet wash. The mobile clinics, the vast majority of our stores already have mobile clinics. At a minimum, it\u2019s every two weeks, but there is a lot of our stores that had it twice a week. And then on the wellness clinics, that what I think is still a bit more in a testing mode for us. As Seth talked, we are in that kind of 50 store, 60 store range. We will add some more this year through Fusion, but we are really excited about the benefits and the performance of those, and we will look to do more as we see the performance over the next year or 2 years.\nJohn Lawrence: Alright. Thanks. Congratulations and good luck.\nHal Lawton: Thank you.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Alright. Well, that\u2019s going to be our final question. As always, those were some great questions. So thank you, everybody, for your time today. We really appreciate you joining us virtually to learn more about what we think makes Tractor Supply such a special company. I also wanted to take a minute to thank Marianne Denenberg, and a multitude of others at the company who helped pull off today\u2019s event to showcase Tractor Supply. An event of this scale takes a lot of partnership to all of those at Tractor Supply that supported Investor Relations program. Please accept my sincere appreciation and gratitude on behalf of the investment community. And thanks to all of you for taking time out of your day to join us virtually. We look forward to speaking to you again on our first quarter 2020 call in April. And Marianne and I will be around today to take any questions this afternoon. Take care, and please stay safe.",

            "name": "Colin Yankee",
            "content": "I really appreciate that, Seth. Thank you so much. It's great to be here with you to share the transformation that we are on across our supply chain. Tractor Supply is differentiated as the largest retailer for bagged animal feed in the country and the leader in meeting our customers' needs for poultry, equine, dog and cat food, forge and other C.U.E. or consumable, usable and edible products that are core to living the Out Here lifestyle. Last year, we moved 8 billion pounds of C.U.E. through our supply chain. And as we have grown our sales and market share in C.U.E., our logistics network, our distribution centers and our stores have stepped up to handle that volume and meet the demand. In fact, compared to 2019, last year, the average Tractor Supply store moved 18% more units and 26% more cubic volume of C.U.E. product. And those volumes in total and per store are continuing to grow. We have seen a significant growth in C.U.E. customers because of our product portfolio with breadth across national, local and exclusive brands and products that cover the spectrum of species for all stages of life. We know C.U.E. products are traffic drivers, attracting new and younger customers. We know that customers who shop for C.U.E. at Tractor Supply are some of our most loyal customers, on average making 4x more transactions and shopping across a larger set of categories than a non-C.U.E. customer. And we know how important being in stock and a price leader are to customer satisfaction and retention. With the success of our Fusion and Side Lot remodels and the Neighbor's Club loyalty program, the increased volume, velocity and variety of C.U.E. products moving through our supply chain and through our stores presents an opportunity to use our scale and sophistication to widen our leadership position with the C.U.E. customer. While we always take an end-to-end view of our supply chain, the growth we have already experienced and the growth we anticipate in C.U.E. requires a fresh look at the operations, and that's exactly what we are going to do with our effort to deliver on C.U.E. We are bringing together a powerful new technology with the strength of our distribution center and mixing center network and continuous improvement within our store processes drive more C.U.E. volume through the same-store footprint with maximum efficiency. And we are going to deliver best-in-class on-shelf availability for our customers, whether they shop with us in store, use buy online, pickup in store or we access that inventory to fulfill orders from stores. As Hal mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in our supply chain capacity. We are currently building our ninth distribution center located in Novara, Ohio and we are on track to open that facility later this year. In 2022, we will also start construction on our tenth distribution center, which will be located in Arkansas. We are planning on a facility opening in late 2023 and we will continue to look for locations to best support our operations as we grow the store network, turning our attention next towards distribution points in the Pacific Northwest. To leverage our expanded distribution network with the power of our vendor base, we are deploying a new inventory forecasting and replenishment system in 2022. This new system takes in more data on demand patterns like seasonality and day of the week variations, business decisions like promotions, price changes and changes in display and space and external factors like weather, traffic and local events. Using advanced mathematical techniques and near real-time information, we are creating an even better picture of future demand, supporting higher in-stock rates, with less inventory. The new platform allows us to be more collaborative with our vendors. By sharing information that is fed directly to our vendors' production planning processes, we can create more accurate orders for these fast-turning products. In our initial test and use cases, the forecast accuracy improvement has lowered total inventory, increased our in-stock rates, driven production efficiencies and improved our response and recovery to changes in demand. We are also deploying new capabilities that allow us to be faster and more responsive inside of our distribution centers. The new replenishment logic allows for high velocity and large C.U.E. products to get picked, loaded and dynamically routed to stores faster and more frequently than we are able to do today and that speed reduces the amount of inventory held in the backrooms. While this new replenishment logic is geared towards our C.U.E. items, we will also strategically apply it to big ticket items, like gun safes and riding lawnmowers, helping us get the right product in the right stores at the right time to optimally use inventory and the store's capacity. To further support more just-in-time replenishment, we will continue to expand the number and reach of our mixing centers. Mixing centers are rapid replenishment centers designed to deliver the 100 fastest moving C.U.E. items in full pallet quantities. Over the last several years, our mixing centers have proven to reduce the days of inventory coverage required in stores to support sales, relieving pressure on our store backrooms while increasing in-stocks. Today, we operate 12 mixing centers, covering about half of the stores in the chain. And as part delivering on C.U.E., we will service more stores from our existing mixing centers and look to add more mixing center locations to the network over the next several years. Our store teams are agile and they do an incredible job managing the volume and tonnage and the number of deliveries that backup against our store every week. But we are going to give them even greater visibility to that workload. With a new set of visibility dashboards that uses historical data, real-time tracking and predictive analytics, our stores will have greater insight on estimated times of arrival, allowing them to track inbound deliveries from distribution centers, mixing centers and vendors, equipping them to manage tasks and equipment in the store more effectively throughout the day. At the network level, this new visibility provides a rich source of data for analyzing and optimizing inbound workload to inform staffing and operational support for continued optimization efforts. So we are applying new technology and logistics processes to impact product flow, but we are also focused on maximizing efficiency in the stores. In our stores, we are optimizing the backroom layout to reduce the number of touches and the amount of travel our team members need to take while moving product from the trailer to the sales force. For our highest volume or more space-constrained stores, we have seen the success of creating dedicated feed rooms that add pallet drops and storage capacity. By the end of 2022, we anticipate having 160 to 180 feed rooms in our network and we will continue to build out dedicated feed rooms as needed when the store is going through the Fusion and Side Lot remodel process. These layout changes support an increased level of efficiency, building on the existing operating procedures in the store. Because C.U.E. items are the most space and labor-intensive products in our stores, we are focused on new levels of process standardization and engineering in our freight and replenishment tasks. Our stores are adapting staffing models to handle more frequent deliveries, more throughput and faster replenishment to the shelf. By driving greater process engineering and optimizing the backrooms of our stores, we will free up time that can go back to delivering legendary service to our customers. We see the growth in our C.U.E. categories as part of an enduring consumer shift and a central part of our long-term growth plans. To support our long-term sales per store projections, we need solutions to drive more C.U.E., more deliveries and more units through the same-store footprint with greater visibility, predictability and cost efficiency. We are embarking on a multiyear program to optimize the entire C.U.E. supply chain, from the vendor to the store using new technology, logistics processes and store operating procedures. The benefits of these continuous improvement efforts will ultimately drive greater efficiency across the entire assortment, further enhancing the competitive advantage our supply chain provides within farm and ranch space, but importantly, ensuring we are the most dependable supplier for those consumable, usable and edible essentials. Thanks for taking part in the event today. And I'll hand it over to Mary Winn. Sure. Daniel, thanks for the question. As far as turnover, I think Hal answered that. But with investment in our existing distribution centers to drive throughput, I just can't thank our team enough. They hit a record level throughput this last year. And I would say it's more than just the distribution centers. It's really tough to execute that we have a planning problem. So, it starts upstream with working with our vendors, with our replenishment allocation, with our transportation team to make sure we set the distribution centers are for success. So, the team is at phenomenally in 2020 and 2021, given all the different disruptions that we have well publicized across the supply chain. Within the four walls of our existing distribution centers, we are really reaping the benefits this last year and going into 2022 of investments we made in profit improvement over the previous years with bringing all of our systems up to the common execution platform across all distribution centers. Two, engineered labor standards within our facilities to drive throughput and efficiency to schedule flexibility and communication with our team members.

And that's an enduring strength that's going to carry us through for the next foreseeable future."

            "name": "Christi Korzekwa",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning. As you've already heard from Hal and Kurt, our future at Tractor Supply is extremely bright and promising, that's why I'm excited to take a few minutes and give you an update on our customers, provide some insights into what we know about our ever-expanding marketplace and how we are using our industry-leading Neighbor's Club program to drive our growth. Most importantly, we continue to see significant growth in the farm and ranch market which, as previously mentioned, we estimate to be more than $180 billion. And the pandemic continues to reshape and rewrite customer behavior. And it's why we see such a large migration of customers from urban centers to rural and suburban areas moving into Tractor Supply's neighborhoods. We also have seen customers' homes become their sanctuaries during the pandemic, inspiring more home, outdoor living and land projects. And we only see that continuing as hybrid workforces are the new norm. We've also seen more pets become family members with record adoptions across the U.S. And with the pandemic's disruptions to daily life and the broader supply chain, we're recognizing a growing interest in self-reliance, sustainability and the desire to consolidate shopping trips. And this migration into a more rural, self-reliant lifestyle, or what we call Life Out Here, we believe, is a continuing cycle with lasting tailwinds. And according to our analysis, we have the potential to capture the interest of more than 40 million additional customers in our trade areas who do not shop at Tractor Supply today. So let me share some insights into our current customers. We're seeing significant expansion with increased participation from our core farm and ranch customers and a surge in new customers. Core farm and ranch customers increased the number of animals and pets they care for and they expanded their gardens and land projects. They rely on Tractor to be open and ready to support them and they prefer Tractor over our competition. Based on data from Earnest Research, since the onset of the pandemic, Tractor Supply has seen six consecutive quarters of outpacing the farm and ranch channel in market share gains. And beyond our core customer, we have seen record levels of new customers as more move into our trade areas, adopt new pets, start of flock, and grow gardens. What both customer groups share is a passion or growing passion for Life Out Here. And with the increase in share among existing customers and the addition of so many new customers, our investment in and growth of the Neighbor's Club to a best-in-class loyalty program this past year is key to our success. We've reimagined our Neighbor's Club program to enhance our Neighbor's Club members' benefits and experiences. Based on feedback from our customers, we relaunched the Neighbor's Club program last April, creating a tier-based program, enabling members to earn loyalty points tied to their spending levels. They can also access tier-specific benefits such as same-day delivery and trailer rentals. In essence, the more they spend, the more benefits they receive. And we continue to enhance the program with new benefits and member exclusive experiences every day. We see this program as another differentiator for Tractor Supply. No other farm and ranch program offers the scale and exclusivity of benefits that Neighbor's Club can offer our members. The response to our Neighbor's Club enhancements continues to be overwhelmingly positive as it increases customer retention and market share. Our program enrollment is now 23.6 million members strong and we added over 4.6 million members in the last 12 months. Our members represent 70% of our sales, they shop more frequently and they spend 3x more than nonmembers. We also annually retain over 97% of our high-value Neighbor's Club members. And 90% of those members were active in the last 3 months. Our overall customer retention and recency is industry-leading. In addition, we're seeing new customers join the program at record levels, with over 30% of all new customers joining with their initial purchase. We also continue to gain extremely rich and valuable insights about our customers and they are shopping us more frequently and across more categories. For example, taking a deeper dive into our core customers, we've seen explosive growth in our high-value farm and ranch customers. The number of extremely loyal customers, those who spend greater than $1,000 per year, has grown over 50% since 2019. While many of these customers rely on us for feed and supplies to take care of their growing pets and animals, we've learned they also shopped more broadly across our store as part of the continued change to consolidate all of their shopping trips. And we discovered their spending was structural across more high-repeat categories, including pet food, gardening, tools, home and outdoor living, supporting their self-reliant mindset for their families, homes, animals and land. Here is a snapshot of a customer from our highest loyalty tier, Preferred Plus. Jake has been a Tractor Supply regular for years, but we can see he's changed his behavior over time, shopping more at the store and more categories each year. Many of them repeat consumable categories. He now spends approximately $4,500 each year and shops over 30x. Analysis of his transaction shows he regularly shops our pet food and feed categories, but he also frequently expand his basket with purchases in other categories like gardening and outdoor living. It's so exciting to see millions of our high-value customers shop us in a similar fashion. But also playing a meaningful part in our growth are the 19 million new customers we've welcomed since the beginning of the pandemic. Many customers made initial trips in 2020 for home and yard improvement projects to shop for pets as well as for initial purchases in the backyard poultry and gardening categories. Because of our Neighbor's Club program, we quickly recognized the surge of new customers early in the pandemic. And we were able to develop dedicated relevant marketing messages to connect with these new customers drive awareness for our pet, home and poultry-related offerings. These efforts help a record number of our new customers, with the highest recorded retention. Over 55% of our new customers returned to Tractor Supply for another purchase. These 10 million-plus new customers are engaging in high repeat activities, such as starting a new garden, adopting a new pet or starting a flock. And to bring these new customers to life, the data from our Neighbor's Club regarding our new customers' show they tend to be younger, more female and digitally engaged. We're also seeing more millennials, who represent 30% of our new customers. Sarah is an excellent example, visiting us for the first time in the early part of 2020. She is one of our more than 1 million customers who started a backyard flock during the pandemic. And that initial poultry trip led her to buying pet food, clothing and gardening supplies from us. Like many new customers entering the poultry category for the first time, Sarah needed and continues to need trusted advice and expertise regarding her new flock, and we're providing that. Whether it's information we're sharing through our digital channels or our store team members, we believe that our Welcome to Life Out Here marketing campaign and our offering of expert know-how in the Out Here lifestyle is a significant differentiator for us. I do want to point out something very important here. While Tractor Supply is enjoying record highs for attracting new customers, we're also seeing all-time highs in their basket size. Average sales for new customers in 2021, was up $26 from the prior year, marking an expansion of nearly 40% since 2019. The rich insights we gain from our Neighbor's Club members also allows us to personalize our messaging in a highly targeted and relevant manner. We can effectively segment our customers based on their interest because we know which categories they shop. Moreover, we know where they live and the local events they are passionate about. This continues to allow us to personalize our messages to each customer based on their specific interest and reasons for shopping Tractor Supply. Our core farm and ranch customer is more likely to receive content regarding livestock and equine feed or bulk pricing on fencing, while our newer customers might receive pet or poultry messaging. We have robust capabilities to target these personalized messages across various marketing channels and at significant scale, in digital advertising, within our mobile app, e-mails, push notifications, social media, text messages and our sizable website. This ability to deliver highly relevant messages to the right customer at the right time has allowed us to build an even stronger relationship with our members. Another major shift we have made to capitalize on our rich and growing customer opportunity is a transition from traditional promotional print marketing to highly targeted and broader reaching, brand building television, streaming and digital support. Early in the pandemic, we expanded our brand marketing to leverage national cable news and digital streaming while also partnering with marquee television properties and high-impact programming that resonates with our customers. It was an approach centered on programs that genuinely support our customers' passions and Life Out Here, including the wildly popular Yellowstone series, it's prequel 1883, Professional Bull Riding, NFL Sports and home networks like Discovery and HDTV. Looking ahead to 2022, we plan to lean deeper into this strategy as we have seen it drive the significant increases in key brand awareness metrics. At the beginning of the pandemic, we have recognized that we were one of the best kept secrets in retail for new customers. Then as more new customers shopped with us and became interested in living Life Out Here, we continued to grow awareness with our TV and digital strategies. We know from our customers that our assortment, convenience and know-how are significant reasons that they shop at Tractor, so we highlight these in all of our marketing. And as the metrics show, our expanded and targeted marketing efforts are paying off. Our unaided brand awareness is up 2,100 basis points. Customers considering Tractor for their Life Out Here needs is up 1,000 basis points. And we have seen a 25% increase in our ranking as their favorite retailer of choice. These are remarkable results we are incredibly excited about, particularly as we look to future growth. We are continuing to elevate our brand perception as our customers' retailer of choice and are well on our way to making Tractor a household name synonymous with Life Out Here. So looking ahead, here is our game plan. First, Tractor Supply is part of a robust, growing and attractive market. We see significant opportunity for durable and sustained growth. Second, our customers are extremely engaged and loyal and return again and again, making us their retailer of choice for Life Out Here. Third, Neighbor's Club is an industry-leading loyalty program, continuing to grow at a record pace, and is a key differentiator that allows us to drive expansive, continuous growth of our highly engaged customer base. Fourth, we have one of the best marketing technology platforms in the industry, allowing us to customize messages that cultivate loyalty. And last, we will continue our meaningful investments in high-profile, marquee marketing partnerships reinforcing our position with our customers and all of those potential customers that we are synonymous with Life Out Here. I look forward to answering any questions that you may have in our upcoming Q&A session in just a bit. But before we go to John to talk about legendary customer service, let's hear from one of our customers. [Video Presentation] Hi, Scott, thanks for the question. I'm looking forward to talking to you about our new customers. You're right. I mean, we've had record growth in 2020 during the pandemic of new customers, but that really didn't wane during 2021. We saw a very similar, if not even a larger pre-pandemic number in 2021. So those customers are coming back to us, are coming to us even in 2021. We see that, that has a lot to do with those structural changes that are happening in \u2013 with the pandemic relative to rural revitalization and more millennials moving in from urban to suburban, ex-urban and rural areas. And what we're finding is that 30% of our sales are coming from these new customers. So we feel incredibly positive about growth of the new customer, and it will continue. A lot of that given to the structural nature of our business, need space. They are moving into our trade areas, our Tractor Supply neighborhoods. They are buying homes there. They are starting garden, they are starting flocks, pet adoptions at record highs. So, just incredibly optimistic that our runway is still far from at an end and certainly, we identified 40 million customers that we can still talk to that should be shopping us that are within our trade areas, so just lot of momentum and a lot of power behind those new customers just excited about it. I would say it's a combination of many things. I would say it is certainly the fact that we have a lot of customers moving into our trade areas. It's because we have our individuals maturing into the lifestyle. I would say it's because of our merchandising mix, I would say it's because of the trends and the work from home. So there is many factors that are attributing to the growth, certainly glad that we have a lot of runway with the 40 million customers that \u2013 or should be shopping us in our trade areas that we are going to be attracting over the next years to come. Thank you. Yes. Hi Chuck. Thanks for the question. I love talking about our customers. And just thinking about our customers pre-pandemic or when the pandemic first started through 2020, we acquired 11 million new customers. We are still comping the pre-pandemic numbers in 2021. We have more new customers in 2021 than we did pre-pandemic. So, 10 million to 11 million a year is what we are attracting, and 50% of those are returning to us after they shop. So, we are attracting and retaining a lot of new customers. And with the new work with the TAM and the opportunity in Fusion and Side Lot, there is so much more opportunity for us to really begin to attract even more than those 10 million a year new customers. But we are on a trend line right now of 10 million to 11 million new customers every year, and I would see us just accelerating that over time."

            "name": "Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are here in cold Nashville. We are excited to update you in greater detail on our Life Out Here strategy that we first shared with you back in October 2020. As our Year Review video highlighted, we are just getting started. At Tractor Supply, we are very early on our journey to build on the momentum in our business and capture the tremendous growth opportunities that we see ahead of us. As we operated early through the early days of the pandemic back in 2020, we set our sights on ensuring that our business would emerge stronger than before. Today, our business has never been stronger. We have significant momentum, our team is executing at a high level and our results demonstrate that our multiyear Life Out Here strategy is working. We are operating from a position of strength. We have a lot of exciting news and progress we want to share with you today. Kurt and I will take you through our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results and review our outlook for 2022 before the team provides an update on our strategic priorities. Retail is ever evolving, that our most important strategic asset remains constant in our team members. They nurture our relationship with our customers and they make us who we are and what we stand for as a company. As a purpose-driven company, our team members create a sense of community in our stores and with each other. Our 46,000 team members are passionate about Life Out Here. Over the last 22 months of the pandemic, they have lived our mission and values to ensure that Tractor Supply is the dependable supplier that our customers count on. This team has worked diligently with grit and determination to overcome the challenging operating environment. They have come together to support the increased sales volume through our DCs, to our stores and online, welcome new customers into the lifestyle, onboarded new team members and navigated the supply chain disruptions. We have enhanced our IT capabilities and done so much more. My thanks goes out to their hard work and dedication to each other, our customers and the communities we call home. Thanks to the team. 2021 was a record year for our business as we successfully comped our record performance in 2020. And as we will share throughout today's presentation, we are benefiting from the many market trends that continue to be structurally sound. So, let's recap a few of the milestones in 2021. We celebrated the opening of our 2,000th store in December right here in our home state of Tennessee. We announced the acquisition of Orscheln Farm & Home. And we remain committed to the acquisition, which continues to be reviewed by the FTC and we hope to have an update soon. The strength in our customer base is supporting our market share gains across our categories. Our Neighbor's Club program is growing with membership up 24% year-over-year as we transition from an affinity program to a tier rewards program. We have robust retention rates and engagement, especially with our highest value tier members. We are committed to making Tractor Supply a household name. Through our targeted investments in marketing, we are seeing a remarkable increase of 21 points in our unaided brand awareness. We are also investing in our supply chain as we announced the first of 3 new distribution centers over the next 5 years. And in September, we announced new robust ESG goals to further reduce our carbon emissions from our operations as well as new diversity equity inclusion goals. And the team has done a remarkable job managing through the well-documented challenges across the global supply chain and dealt with an unprecedented level of inflation. We have tremendous strength and it is broad-based. And now, let me provide some specific color on our fourth quarter performance. Our comparable store sales grew a robust 12.7% and this represents a 40% stack on a 2-year basis. Continuing the trend, we have had several quarters now. Every week was positive with broad-based strength across all regions and all categories. We believe we are significantly outpacing the industry in our growth and continuing to gain market share both online and in store. Inflation, it contributed over 850 basis points to comparable store sales as we navigated the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. Where necessary, we are taking price increases to pass through some of the cost pressures that we cannot offset. And our merchants and supply chain teams are currently navigating this challenging and disruptive environment extremely well and they are most focused on being that advocate for our customer to be everyday low price. As we closely monitor our customers' purchasing behaviors, we are focused on product unit trends and as I said, we are committed to being priced right everyday. Consumable, usable and edible products, they continue to perform well with comps above the chain average. These categories, as we discussed often are needs-based, demand-driven and they drive trips to Tractor Supply. And key categories in our C.U.E. area, dry dog food, livestock feed, equine health and pet treats were among some of the strongest categories that continue to perform very well. While we were comping exceptional strength in the fourth quarter of last year for our big ticket categories, we had double-digit growth again this quarter. Looking at the cadence for the quarter, December was modestly below October and November comp performance. And as a reminder, December was the warmest on record in 30 plus years. That said, we exited the quarter strong as weather normalized and as we all know, January has started off quite cold. So to recap our sales performance, we had a remarkable year with consistency that gives us confidence that the trends we are experiencing are more structural in nature. The execution by our team has been excellent. Our store teams and distribution centers, along with our supply chain partners, have navigated another challenging year with outstanding execution of our operational playbook. We have faced every challenge head on, focused on controlling what we control, all the while staying true to being the dependable supplier for the Out Here lifestyle. The strength and diversity of our comp growth in 2021 on top of our record results in 2020 is very compelling. As evidenced in our share gains, the health of our customer continues to be very robust. All customer segments had strong growth with the fastest growth in our core farm and ranch segment. We continue to see stellar performance from our highest spending customers. Our retention rates remain higher than historical standards, and it's even higher from our Neighbor's Club members. 1 in 5 or 20% of our new customers came to Tractor Supply through our digital channels in the fourth quarter, reinforcing the importance of the investments we are making in this area. We are supercharging how we serve customers with convenience and meeting them how they want to engage with us. To recap, we are experiencing more customers shopping us than ever before. They are visiting us more frequently. And when they come to shop with us, whether it's in our stores or online, they are spending more money per trip. Throughout the team's upcoming presentations today, you will learn much more about our plans to continue to build on this positive momentum that we have with our customers. Before we get to the update on our Life Out Here strategy, Kurt will go through some of the key highlights of our fourth quarter and share more details around our 2022 financial outlook. Kurt? Thanks, Kurt. Wow, what again outstanding 2021 on top of a record 2020. Yes, the team did a great job, they did, just fantastic. Alright. Let's transition out of a typical earnings dialogue and look to the future. We have a very bright past with more than 83 years of serving Life Out Here. We are coming off a record 2 years of performance. But from our point of view, we are just getting started. We believe Tractor Supply is well-positioned for a bright future. We are in the early stages of the next transformation of Tractor Supply. This transformation should allow us to both grow our top line and earnings sustainably over a long period of time, while operating at a higher margin profile. Given the robust growth of our stores and online that have experienced, we have had a step function change in our business that is evident in our market share gains, sales growth and profitability. We are dedicated to investing and to continue strengthening our position in the marketplace and separate ourselves from our competition. We are committed to creating sustainable value creation for all of shareholders, for our team members, our customers, for the communities we call home, for our supply chain and vendor partners and ultimately, our shareholders. The roots of our long history of growth were established in 1938 when C.E. Schmidt founded a mail order catalog for tractor parts. We opened our first store in Minot, North Dakota, the following year. We serve Life Out Here. We are focused on the needs of recreational farmers, ranchers and all those who enjoy living the rural lifestyle. As I mentioned earlier, in December, we celebrated our 2,000th store opening in White House, Tennessee. This is a testament to all of our team members who continue to support each other, our customers and our communities. Not many companies have gotten to this milestone and I doubt C.E. Schmidt ever imagined this milestone when he started his tractor parts catalog business 83 years ago. Our mission and values are the foundation for our success. Our culture is shaped around our mission and values. We have lived by these principles for over 80 years and we will continue to do so for decades to come. Our mission and values help us in our business decisions and they serve as guiding beacons to ensure we maintain course even in uncertain times. It is not something that you can put in a financial model, but it makes a huge difference on our bottom line, but they are more than that. Our mission and values are what you feel when you walk into one of our stores and talk with one of our team members. We are not like other retailers. We are a relationship retailer. Our customers are passionate about family, their land and animals and their communities and they count on us, Tractor Supply, to be their dependable supplier. We are able to serve our customers so well, because we know our customers so well. We hire our customers. Our team members are members of and representative of the community. They are experts in equine and welding, gardening and pets. They are involved in 4-H and FFA. Our team members are the largest and most important strategic asset of our company. And I encourage you all to visit us out here to experience it for yourself. At Tractor Supply, we are committed to preserving Life Out Here for future generations. 13 years ago, we launched our stewardship program. As ESG has emerged as the universal standard for good corporate citizenship, we have adapted our stewardship program to align with this direction. And over the past year, we have made significant progress in our ESG efforts. A few highlights include significantly reducing our energy and water consumption, materially increasing the gender and ethnic diversity of our board, management executive committee and our overall team member population, conducting unconscious bias training for over 40,000 team members and implementing a new 6-week paid parental leave policy for full-time salary and hourly team members. In September of 2021, we announced new robust goals to further reduce our carbon emissions as well as continue our progress on diversity, equity and inclusion. After exceeding our initial carbon reduction goals set in 2018, Tractor Supply established more aggressive commitments. By 2025, we will reduce our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from what they were in 2020. By 2030, we will reduce those emissions by 50%. And by 2040, we're committed to achieving net zero emissions across all our operations. Over the past 2 years, we've rallied around the theme of stronger together and made material investments to accelerate our initiatives for DE&I. Recently, we announced a 5-year goal to support and advance underrepresented groups across our workforce, vendors, suppliers and communities. Our commitment to being a good corporate citizen has been broadly recognized. Recently, we were named to Investor Business Daily's 100 Best ESG Companies of 2021. Just yesterday, it was announced we were included in Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index. And today, it was announced that we received a perfect score from the Human Rights Council. We are committed to being a leader in ESG as this is authentic to our mission and values while also making great business sense. Over our rich 83-year history, this business has a strong track record of success, complemented by consistency and resiliency. Highlights include 30 consecutive years of revenue gain, 12 consecutive positive comp store sales growth and an average share price performance of 28.3% since the year 2000. And this ranks as the fourth best-performing stock in the S&P 500 over the last 21 years. Thank you to our investors for their confidence and we continue to strive to earn your trust and build on it. And today is all about that, the future of Tractor Supply. As demonstrated by the highlights of 2021 that you saw in our opening video, our business has never been stronger. Our team has done an outstanding job navigating the challenges in ever-changing environment over the last 2 years. We're benefiting from many market trends that continue to be structurally sound. We have strengthened our customer base, and we're gaining market share across our categories. Importantly, our total addressable market has grown materially, and we see significant opportunities for organic growth as well as an increased number of new stores. And we will continue to invest from a position of strength to capture this growth through our Life Out Here strategy. Out here, Tractor Supply enjoys significant structural advantages. And these advantages have allowed us to gain substantial share over the past 2 years. Our unaided brand awareness is 55%. And that puts us among the best in retail and well above our farm and ranch competitors. With a network of over 2,000 stores and nearly $1 billion in digital business, supported by 8 million square feet across our distribution centers, we have a unique ability to serve our customers wherever and however they choose to shop. We believe no other rural lifestyle retailer provides a comparable experience. And we have deep relationships with our vendors and in many cases are their largest customer. Our Neighbor's Club program has 23.6 million members. It is engineered to drive customer behavior, and it is the foundation for a sophisticated marketing platform and enables deep customer insights. Our brand, scale, our supply chain, our digital capabilities, our loyalty program, all in combination creates significant and enduring strategic advantages for our business. Our structural advantages are the result of long-term investments in the foundation of our business and the deep seated values embedded in our culture. These roots have enabled us to adapt in the face of the pandemic and the ripple effects of other impacts like the tight labor market, unprecedented inflation and supply chain challenges that are impacting our industry. At the same time, broad-based macro category trends towards self reliance, world revitalization, pet adoption, home setting, these things are benefiting our business. And when you add to that, the acceleration of trip consolidation as people are shopping single retailers more, you think about the adoption of digital trends and you put all these themes together and they are working to our advantage as customers value us for our proximity as a one-stop shop grows. These lifestyle changes are accompanied by long-term commitments by our customer to care for and maintain their land and animals. We believe these trends have staying power and are structurally and substantially sound. These changes align with our investments in the business and dovetail well with our strategic positioning as the dependable supplier for Life Out Here. And as the dependable supplier for Life Out Here, we offer a wide assortment for our customers' lifestyle. Our total addressable market is large and growing, and it's heavily fragmented. In 2019, we estimated the total addressable market for Tractor Supply to be about $110 billion and we shared that with you in October of 2020. Today, we estimate our addressable market to be much larger at $180 billion. The tailwinds and structural changes that we just outlined earlier contributed an estimated $30 billion increase in the TAM. And that's a 25% growth over the past 2 years in our market. But by comparison, if you look at our business, we grew 50% over the past 2 years and consequently gained significant share in this market. Now in addition to our core market, we've expanded our TAM by over $40 billion given our investments and initiatives like Project Fusion and Side Lot, which have expanded our category offerings in areas like pet and lawn and garden. With a market share of about 7% of this $180 billion market, we see substantial opportunity for growth in an increasingly attractive market, both deepening our relationship with our current customers as well as reaching new customers. Given our total addressable market growth, continued strong performance of our new stores and our strategic initiatives, we're revising our long-term store targets from 2,500 to 2,700 Tractor Supply stores in the United States. And we're excited to serve 700-plus more communities over the next decade. Of note, we view the Orscheln acquisition to be accretive to our overall store growth opportunity. Opening highly productive new stores is a core strength and competency of Tractor Supply. We continue to have strong new store productivity metrics, with performance outpacing our historical investment thesis. And our stores are profitable in year 1. With compelling returns, we continue to have significant runway for growth with high-return new stores. Given the attractiveness of our market, we're investing in growth through our Life Out Here strategy. We shared this strategy with you in the fall of 2020. And as a reminder, there are 5 pillars of our strategy, and they include deliver legendary customer experiences which focuses on driving greater traffic and increasing conversion; number two, advancing our ONETractor capabilities to reach new customers and deepen our connection with existing customers by offering a truly omni-channel experience; number three, operate The Tractor Way, which enhances the productivity and efficiency of our existing retail assets; number four, go the country mile for our team to ensure we continue to support and show our appreciation for our team members who drive our business every day; and then number five, generate healthy shareholder returns, which reinforces our commitment to effective stewardship of our shareholders' capital. To support these transformational growth initiatives, we increased our capital investments from $275 million in 2019 to over $600 million in 2021. We made excellent progress in year 1 of our strategy and are on track with our expectations. We continue to be very excited about our strategy given our customers' response, the performance of the key initiatives and the robust long-term growth prospects. Two key tenets of our Life Out Here strategy are the Fusion and Side Lot initiatives. They are designed to drive space productivity and sweat our existing assets. Project Fusion is a multiyear store remodel program that both revitalizes the store environment and introduces an improved layout and expanded offerings. These changes are designed with the customer and our team members in mind to drive productivity through areas like enhanced experiences like pet washes and wellness clinics, but operational improvements as well to better support growing demand, things like our feed rooms. Also, though, driving space allocation trade-offs such as the service desk, but also widening our assortment across departments like apparel and animal and tools. Complementing Project Fusion is the Side Lot initiative, which transforms and expands our existing outdoor side lot retail space to drive greater productivity and convenience with the addition of a garden center and a drive-through pickup lane to support our omni-channel technology investments. Importantly, these projects are delivering on the return expectations with material sales lifts, existing customer sentiment improvements and new customer acquisition. By 2026, nearly 100% of the store base will be in the Fusion layout, and 60% to 70% will have had executed the Side Lot initiative in it. By 2022, we plan to exit the year with nearly 30% of our chain in the Fusion layout and over 15% of our chain with Side Lot. And Seth will take us through a more detailed walk of these exciting transformations later in the presentation. Another key component of our Life Out Here strategy is the enhanced focus on customer service. This isn't just about training, but also about enabling our team members to spend more time with our customers. To accomplish this, we rolled out the FAST program, the Field Activity Support Team. And we started this program with 1,200 team members in late 2020. And we expanded it by another 200 in 2021 and plan to add 300 to 400 more team members in the first half of this year. This team's sole focus is on merchandising execution. And this specialization improves our store merchandising while simultaneously enabling our store team members to focus more time on customer service. And with over 95% on-time planogram completion, our stores have never looked better or been more shoppable for our customers. And this team enables improved store productivity and is funded significantly by our vendor partners. It's truly a winning-winning program for all of our stakeholders. And John will share more details on our initiatives to fuel our legendary customer service later on. Tractor Supply is fortunate to have a highly engaged and loyal customer base. Last year, as we discussed, we converted our Neighbor's Club from an affinity program to a tiered points-based reward program. Simply said, the more you spend, the more you save. And this conversion is resonating with our customers. And year-over-year, we've added 4.6 million new customers to the program, and we're seeing broad strength continuing across our customer base. More customers than ever are shopping at Tractor Supply. And these customers are making more trips and are spending more money per trip. We're experiencing strong retention of customers that have shopped us over the last 12 months. Our retention rates continue to run above our historical standards. And I'm excited for you to hear more customer insights and details on how we intend to continue to engage our new customers and drive retention of our existing customers from Christi. More than 5 years ago, we introduced our ONETractor strategy that drove significant progress in providing a seamless customer experience. Our focus on engaging with our customers anytime, anywhere and any way they choose has allowed us to reach nearly $1 billion in e-commerce sales last year. Our customer is deeply engaged with Tractor Supply. And this transformation is happening across the whole shopper journey. Our customer behaviors continue to evolve, embracing convenient ways of shopping with a continued preference for mobility. Since launching our mobile app in late 2020, we've had 2 million-plus downloads, with the app already $100-plus million platform for us. We remain focused on introducing new capabilities, improving the shopping journey and ensuring we have scalable platforms. As we enter 2022, we are more excited than ever about the future of Tractor Supply. We see significant opportunity to continue to grow the business, expand our competitive moat and drive business productivity all the while creating value for our shareholders. As we've completed the rollout of FAST and Neighbor's Club, we freed up some bandwidth, and that's going to allow us to focus on two new initiatives as well as evolve the focus of our digital initiative. The first one is lead with legendary service. We consistently rank in the top 10% to 20% of retailers on customer service, right out there with the best of them. But our goal is to be number one. And we have all the assets to achieve it. We've got the right format, the right team, the right culture. And we have made and will be making investments in our team, in their technology and in their training. And you're going to hear more from John on our plans in this area in his presentation. Increasing mobile engagement. Mobile will be the next moat that we create around our business. We're going to convert our nearly 24 million Neighbor's Club members into power users. And Rob will share more highlights of our plans to accelerate our growth and achieve more than $2 billion in digital sales by 2026. Deliver on C.U.E. We talked often about how important this business is to us. We have the number one market share in bag feed, and we're in the top five in pet food. And given our growth in these categories over the past 2 years, we've increased cubic volume by 26% running through our stores compared to 2019. These are destination categories. And it is critical for us to ensure we have capacity for future growth and, importantly, that we are the lowest cost to serve in the market in these categories. And our supply chain is a critical differentiator for us to deliver on C.U.E. And Colin will share more details on our ability to continue to widen the gap with our competition. Given our recent performance, and the significant opportunity that I've just outlined, we're updating our long-term guidance. Now we're maintaining our sales outlook of plus 6% to plus 7% in spite of a much higher base of sales. We're increasing our operating margin guidance to a range of 10.1% to 10.6%, and that's an increase from our previous guidance of 9% to 9.5%. We're also increasing the top end of our range for EPS growth to 11%. And notably, we're increasing our dividend payout to 40% while maintaining our commitment to share repurchases. And we're spending approximately $650 million annually of capital. These are aggressive but achievable targets that will create significant shareholder value over time. And Kurt will share more details as he focuses on our ability to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder return. From our founding 83 years ago, Tractor Supply has proven to be a business model that has stood the test of time to be resilient and differentiated. This business has shown the ability to evolve over the years to reflect our customers' changing needs. And we're investing to continue to evolve and capture the significant opportunities for growth. And underpinning our strategy is an experienced retail team that knows retail and our culture and our team members, and they are passionate about the out here lifestyle. As we enter year 2 of our multiyear Life Out Here strategy, our business is substantially stronger than before the pandemic. Our resilient and differentiated business model allows us to capitalize on the structural consumer trends, benefiting our business with a long runway of growth ahead of us. We have momentum in our business. And our results demonstrate that our multiyear Life Out Here strategy is working. We will continue to evolve our business from a position of strength. And with that, I'll turn it to the team to walk you through more detailed plans. Thanks so much. Thanks, Kurt. We appreciate everyone in the audience spending the last couple of hours with us. As we transition to Q&A, I hope you found compelling the updates we shared with you today. Kind of a quick summary of the incremental news we discussed. One, we are capitalizing the many macro structural benefits such as rural revitalization, self-reliance, home steady and pet ownership and we are investing in our capabilities like digital and loyalty to continue to widen our moat with the competition. Two, we provided an update to our long-term financial outlook that includes raising our operating margin to 10.1% to 10.6%. Three, we operate in a large, attractive and fragmented growing market that we now estimate to be $180 billion. Four, with our growing total addressable market and the vibrancy of our trade areas, we now see the opportunity for an additional 200 Tractor Supply stores, bringing our total store opportunity to 2,700 locations. Five, we had the financial flexibility to invest in our Life Out Here strategy and return capital to shareholders through the combination of dividends and share repurchases. Today, we announced our Board's approval to increase our quarterly dividend by 77% and an additional share repurchase authorization of $2 billion. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create value for our shareholders. Tractor Supply has a deep history and a track record of success. We are coming off a record 2 years. We have compelling opportunities for continued growth and the team to execute. The future tomorrow is bright for Tractor Supply. Thank you. Now we'll take a 5-minute break before we go to the Q&A segment. See you in a minute. [Video Presentation] Hey, Peter, and thanks for joining us today. I appreciate your question. If we look backwards last year, I just can't say enough about the fortitude and grit determination of the team to get 80 new stores open, to have 300-plus Fusion stores and over 150 Side Lot stores. And as you mentioned, given all the disruption from COVID is related permitting and construction crews and the availability of things like fixtures and other materials. To be able to still achieve our goals from the beginning of the year, it's just a real tribute to that team. In light of those issues, which we expect to persist for all of this year, we kind of kept our cadence for this year, similar to last year, as we talked about a couple of hundred Fusion stores, around 150 side lot stores and again, another 80 new store. And then if you kind of \u2013 all of our new stores also will be done with Fusion and many of our new stores also have garden centers. And then if you kind of take the balance, it will be really equally spread over the remaining 4 years as we lead to 2026, and that does assume a slight step-up in annual cadence from \u201823 and beyond. On the returns, we are very \u2013 continue to be very pleased with the returns of both Fusion and Side Lot. As we shared on our last earnings call, the Fusion-only stores are running in that kind of mid-single-digit comp once they get kind of the 12-month kind of cycle, maturity cycle. And then our combo stores are right at that kind of high single-digit comp. We're very excited that we've got about 150 stores in our Side Lot combos that will be hitting that 12-month mark right around the time spring hit. So it's going to be a great opportunity for us to drive some sales and drive some share with those fresh stores. On the TAM, we talked about in my presentation about adding $40 billion to our TAM. And that is dominantly lawn and gardening, kind of live goods. And it's a fresh category for us, and one we think is a great opportunity. Our customers qualitatively, as we talked about, I talked about it being the number one category that they participate in that we least serve them in. And we're seeing great results as we talked about in the first cohort of stores. On the cost, it's hard to get each individual store because there is so much nuance depending on the setup of the store and the age of the store. But toughly, the way to think about it is we took our capital from $300 million to $600 million, roughly. About $100 million of that is supply chain with little technology. That leaves about a couple of hundred million left that involves our store investments. And then if you take the kind of 350 combo Fusion, Side Lot stores this year, you can kind of divide those into each other and get a sense. The range is anywhere from $0.5 million to $1 million a store that really just depending upon the nuances around that store. But again, really pleased with the return we're getting strong return on investment capital it's hitting all of our business cases. And as I said, we're really excited about having over 150 Side Lot stores open for business when we hit the spring garden season. Hey. Zach, and I appreciate your question, and thanks for joining us today. I'd say two things. First off, kind of to clarify, high single-digit I think is kind of what we're on the record right now, around the 12-month mark for the combo stores. As it relates to the impact on comp, I think that's around \u2013 that's roughly right. You take, call it, 9%, 10% lift on kind of 10% of the store base annually. And do the math, and that's about what the contribution should be. That's certainly baked guidance. And as Kurt said, it's the thing that really gives us confidence in our guidance. And the last time we did an investor enhanced earnings call was in October 2020, we're roughly 35%, 40% bigger in revenue, right, larger revenues from that date. And yet we're still holding to our 4% to 5% long-term comp growth and 6% to 7% revenue growth. And it is because of the investments we're making in the Side Lot and in Fusion and there are other areas that we're confident they are really going to go after that growth and drive those sales and that we can do that mid-single-digit comp on top of revenue growth of over 50% in the last 2 years. And as we said, again, we're very excited about having well over 150 Side Lot stores business here in the spring season, and we're getting even a better read on the impact that it can have on our business. Thanks, Zach. Hi, Steve. Yes. Absolutely, Steve. Thanks for your question. And I'll pass it over to Rob to address that. I appreciate it. Yes, hey, Scott. Thanks so much for the question today. I appreciate you joining us for the event. And I'll toss it over to Christi to talk about our new customers and the customer insights for seeing. Thanks, Simeon. Yes. Hey, Michael, and tanks for the question. I mean I think the math you provided is really kind of the math that our guidance reflect is about four points of inflation in the year that will drive ticket up, kind of a give back on ticket of a couple of points because of stimulus due to last year's kind of surge in big ticket, kind of netting to a couple of points. And then the balance of our comp range made up of comp transactions to kind of get there, so in kind of that 1% to 2% range on the comp transactions. And we feel very good about that formula. And we're committed to unit growth, and we're committed to comp transaction growth this year. And we gained substantial share over the past years we talked about. We think there is a big opportunity to continue to do that. And then on deflation, I think there is a likely \u2013 there is \u2013 that's always out there. I think it's really unlikely for the foreseeable future for a variety of reasons. Dominantly that the majority of the inflation we've seen is, I think, structural in terms of the new levels that we're at, whether that's wages, many of the cost of goods, freight, imports. I think we're going to see a kind of a structural holding of a lot of those costs. I don't know they will continue to see inflation, but I don't know we're going to see significant deflation on that certainly in the next 18, 24 months or so. And the other thing I'd say is our past cycle on inflation, it's been really kind of the core commodities that drove it. And here, it's really across the board. I mean, we're seeing cost of goods increases due to wages, cost of goods due to steel, cost of goods due at other raw materials and our manufacturers' wages. So I think it's more structural in nature. The final thing I would leave is we lot more sophistication around our pricing tools and our competitive pricing engines that we had before. And so we're just a lot more sophisticated in the way we can navigate through that. But regardless of how the environment evolves, I think we've shown our ability to be flexible, agile, deliberate performance, stay priced in the market, continue to gain share and deliver results, and that's our commitment, whether it's an inflationary environment or a deflationary environment. Yes. Hey, Chris and good to speak with you today. And I'd say, first off, on pricing. I think the team has done a fantastic job navigating the cost environment, finding offsets to many of the inflation factors and productivity and efficiency. Also being that advocate for the customer on price and making sure we're staying price right every single day. And then where we have found it necessary and needed to, we have passed through price. I mean, to the tune of 7% price inflation in Q3 and 8.5% price inflation in Q4. I think our guidance as we talked about a 4% inflation for 2022 reflects kind of the higher single-digit price inflation through the first half starting to cycle that and settle back into low single digits in the second half. If you look at all the puts and takes, I think there is more risk to the upside on our inflation assumption than there is to the downside. But the team will continue to navigate, navigate through that as we go forward. And remind me, Chris, the second part of the question? Yes. It's something we certainly watch closely. Christi and the team have a number of ways that they monitor the health of our customer, whether it's quantitative and qualitative. I'd say, right now, the home market is really strong, right? There is less than 1 million homes that are available on the market around, I think, 900,000 last month, 1.6 million, 1.7 million new homes being built right now on an annualized basis. existing home sales, well above $6 million. I think that's going to continue for really the next couple of years at a minimum, even in spite of interest rates and even likely in spite of \u2013 within reason, home prices. You just got a millennial generation that's now wanting to purchase homes. And I think in general, that's good for us. When people buy homes or transact around homes, it creates projects. It's a big project starter, and we see that in our business. And I think it's going to continue on. The consumer still has over $2 trillion of pent-up savings. I think the last month or 2, if you look at the data, they have started to tap into that a little bit. But there is runway certainly for the balance of this year as they draw down, so to speak, on those pent-up savings to drive the GDP growth that I think is being forecasted really across the country. And I think rural customers have navigated this environment better than the average kind of a consumer out there. And I think we're in a very favorable market as we head into 2022. Thanks so much, Chris for your questions. Hey, Scott, thanks so much of the question. And I think we're going to break that up into two parts with Seth, can you maybe talk a little bit about the assortment and how we're evolving and much of that he shared in the video and kind of recap some of that. And then maybe John can talk a little bit about the experiences in our stores, whether it's chip days, pet watches, clinics and many of the other things, the 4-H and FFA type stuff that we do. But Seth, you want to hit the assortment expansion first? Yes. Thanks so much, Scott, for the question. And as you were mentioning, just in wrap up here, we are literally pushing every corner of the store really into kind of a more modern, contemporary assortment, right? A Seth shared, shared expansion of power tools into kind of a legitimate tool chorale, expansion of pet into full fledge pet offering, deepening our commitment around animal feed, expanding into live goods, bringing in services like pet wash. John has over 250 stores now doing delivery with our own trucks. So just so many things that we're pushing the envelope, so to speak, on every inch of the store, all around just sweating our assets more, getting more productivity out of those stores and delivering those mid-single-digit comps. Our goal is to gain market share every single year to grow above GDP, to grow above retail and to grow above growth rates. And we think we've got an exciting plan to do that. Thanks, Scott. Yes, Kurt, do you want to share our capital allocation strategy and then talk about tuck-in acquisitions after that? Hey, Brian, thanks for the question. I'll break it into three buckets. First off, we talked about over the last few years, our market grew at about 25% in aggregate over those 2 years. And I think that does say to all the trends that we've outlined and you implied in your question. The second two things I'll highlight are really around investment. We've got substantial structural advantages in our digital business, in our Neighbor's Club, in our supply chain, in our store base and the way we train our team members, the technology we use inside of our stores for our team members like our Theatro headsets and our Honeywell handheld devices. And so \u2013 and those are things that we have historically invested in and there are things we invested in over the last 2 years. It was mentioned earlier about our operating margins come up in the context of our sales, perhaps not grown as much as some others out there. And the reason is because we put a lot of that expense back into the business, we kept our stores heavily staffed, we paid the appropriate wages, we invested in marketing, we invested in digital. And I think as we talked we gained \u2013 our sales grew over 50% over the last few years. And it's really \u2013 the reason we been able to double the market growth rate is because we had the inventory in our stores. We had the people to service them. We had buy online, pick up in store when others didn't. We had a Neighbor's Club program talk those customers and bringing them back into the stores. We had a supply chain that partnerships that allow product to flow in a way that others couldn't. And once people over 2 years change their shopping behaviors, it's really quite infrequent for them to slip back unless we let them down. The third thing is all the structural all the incremental investments we've made in our Life Out Here strategy, the Fusion stores, the garden center stores, all the incremental technology investments we made. Last year, we talked about mid-single digits on Fusion, doubled \u2013 high single digits on the Side Lot combo stores. And that was only on 300 and 150 stores. So we are starting to see kind of the initial impact of those in our comps, and we're excited about those continuing to drive our business in the future, plus it's holding on to those customers and having a higher sales base. But I kind of break it into those three buckets, structural trends driving the overall market, us being committed to operating with excellence in the midst of the last 2 years and then investing on top of that with that momentum to gain even more share. Thanks, Brian. Yes. So, I will take the unit potential question then turn it back to Kurt to talk about operating margin leverage. On the unit potential, what we have is John and the team have been very sophisticated kind of map of our country, kind of ZIP code by ZIP code. We know what the demand potential is. We know where our stores are, we know where competitive stores are. And we look at those void spaces that are in that map. We then take those void spaces and bounce them up against the financial model and say, does it create value if we put a store there? And historically, that analysis has led us to 2,500 stores. Now with the growth in our market, that creates one, some new void spaces, but also it makes some void spaces that were not previously financially attractive, more financially attractive now. As I mentioned, our new stores over the last 3 years have significantly outperformed their business case. Our new stores are profitable in the first year. And so the combination of those factors led us to take our new store target up from 2,500 to 2,700. And we feel very confident in that number. And hopefully, in a couple of years, there is more on top of that, but we feel very good about that number. And Kurt can talk about our operating margin leverage. And Karen, the only thing I would say is like in a really simple way for me is you have got revenue growth of kind of 6% to 7%. And then you got the EPS growth, which Kurt took us through at 8% to 11%, and then you were buying a couple of percent of share back. So, if you take those out, we are kind of growing EPS kind of 6% to 9% organically, which means earnings are going to grow kind of with sales or slightly better on an annualized basis on average. And which means kind of particularly after this next year to cycle of investment, we will grow kind of operating margin about 0.1 point a year, and that kind of leads you up to that 10.6%. Yes. And I would just speak, Christi and the team are just doing an outstanding job. I think raising the awareness of our business, going from 34 points 2 years ago to 55 points. Now, that 21-point awareness increase, I think has really helped kind of drive traffic into our stores. And then whether it's through online and product assortment or John and the team at customer service, that conversion in the store and then holding those customers. And then I think just continues to build on top of itself as we continue to grow that awareness and have that fantastic experience in our store and online. As it relates to the kind of operating margin algorithm, I think the way we think about it is very similar to the way we have talked about the last couple of years, which is we would see us continuing to kind of that 10.1% to 10.6%. Last year, we did a 10.3%. The year before that, it was a 10.1%. And the bulk of that gain was really in gross margin rate as we held SG&A kind of roughly flat. As we think about the next few years, particularly once we get through this peak investment over this year and next year. I think gross margins will hold to maybe moderate some. And then the leverage is where that we will see will be in SG&A. And that's what kind of gives us that range between 10.1% and 10.6% with us creeping towards the middle to higher end of the range as we get into the out years of the 5-year range. And Seth and the team are doing a fantastic job navigating all the cost inflations that are coming through, offsetting it in ways they can and then passing through some on price. And then importantly, maintaining little to no promotions and then also little to no clearance. And the great thing is we list on last year, we were asking whether or not the little to no promotions could remain kind of structural in nature or whether or not that would creep back in. And I think after a couple of years, really the behaviors in the market have evolved, particularly as we look at this year and continuing to be constrained still in supply chain. So, we feel really good about maintaining kind of little to no promotions as we look into future and kind of stay in core to our EDLP trip routes. Yes. Hi Daniel. Thanks for joining us today and I appreciate the question. I would start by saying, we have seen some modest increases in our turnover this year, certainly relative to last year when turnovers were at all-time lows. But I think we fared much better than most companies. One, first and foremost, because of our culture and our commitment to mission and values and all the things that John talked about earlier around our commitment to the communities and hiring our customers. And then secondly, we have made substantial investments in wages and benefits and other benefits over the last couple of years, which have served us well in terms of retention. And then in terms of kind of flow through the business, our \u2013 we are up substantially on C.U.E. over the last couple of years. No one sells more animal feed and bag animal feed in the country than we do. We are one of the top retailers on pet food as well. And interestingly, on \u2013 particularly on the pet side, our customers skew larger on their pets, right. So, we sell more than anyone 50-pound bags of dog food and certainly the vast majority of our animal food are 50-pound bags, and that's flow through, a lot of tonnage through. We are the lowest cost to serve all those in the market. We are committed to being the lowest cost to serve. We are committed to be able to be in stock on those. And that's really a lot of what Colin's presentation and focus is going to be on for the next couple of years and let him elaborate a bit on that. Thanks Daniel. Appreciate it. Thanks Steven. Appreciate it. Yes. Hi Liz. Yes, that's correct. All new stores are being built with the Fusion layouts. So \u2013 and that was the case in 2021 and will be the case moving forward. As it relates to the garden center, it's really on a store-by-store basis, whether or not the store is built with a garden center, depends on what the market opportunity assessment tells us. What I would say is this year in 2022, the vast majority of our new stores will have the garden center, and that's incremental to some of the guidance that we gave on our existing store base through the presentation. And then as it relates to Petsense, we haven't had a chance to talk about that business today, but the business is doing very well. Matthew Rubin joined us last year about this time to lead the business, done an excellent job of kind of driving the business. They had an excellent year, strong sales growth and profit growth, a number of new stores built. We have made several elements of integration that are customer facing like we now sell for health branded food inside of Petsense. We are in the process of doing some things in terms of integration later in the year on Neighbor's Club and also some integration on branding. We are also taking our software now implemented that inside of Petsense. And we are also working on kind of a centralized inventory platform, whereas right now, the stores are done via kind of the individual store base. And so a lot of work is going on to leverage the breadth of Tractor Supply to make Petsense better. The team is doing a great job driving it. We have got a number of new stores that will be built for Petsense this year, and we are excited about the future of that business. Yes, it's a great question. And I think we think about it the latter, that kind of long-term GDP, the country is kind of 2% to 3%. Our market typically maybe grows kind of 0.5-ish point above that, 2.5% to 3.5%, maybe ease up to 4% with our comp guidance of 4% and 5%. We are certainly taking share in the markets that we are already in. And then the building of new stores just allows us to take incremental share on top of that. So, it's a bit of a blend of the two scenarios you mentioned, but it's certainly taking share with our existing stores, growing our sales productivity. And then on top of that, also gaining it through both new store build-outs as well as digital. Yes. Hi. Thanks for the questions. First off, I would start off by saying our pet business is incredibly strong. We talked about our C.U.E. and its performance over the last handful of quarters, out-comping our overall store. And then we mentioned that pet particularly dry dog food is outperforming even our C.U.E. business. So, our pet business is very strong, both in-store and online. And then we certainly want to make sure we are providing a full suite of services around that. And I will let John talk a little bit about the dynamics and we have a pet wash or a pet clinic or a mobile clinic and how that plays out in our stores. Yes. So, pet wash is now kind of a core component set outline of our Fusion stores. Really, the only time it's not going into a Fusion stores when there is a legit kind of a real space limitation. So, we see over time, the vast majority of our stores having a pet wash. The mobile clinics, the vast majority of our stores already have mobile clinics. At a minimum, it's every two weeks, but there is a lot of our stores that had it twice a week. And then on the wellness clinics, that what I think is still a bit more in a testing mode for us. As Seth talked, we are in that kind of 50 store, 60 store range. We will add some more this year through Fusion, but we are really excited about the benefits and the performance of those, and we will look to do more as we see the performance over the next year or 2 years. Thank you."

            "name": "Seth Estep",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Tractor Supply has been busy making headway with our Life Out Here strategy. In 2020, we outlined initiatives to grow space productivity as a major opportunity to deliver consistent comp store sales. This was a primary goal of our Operate the Tractor Way pillar. When we launched this strategy, we knew we had significant opportunity for improvement in sales per square foot compared to our hardline and specialty retail peers. Since then, we have been focused on our Project Fusion and the Side Lot transformation to drive convenience and to optimize our indoor and outdoor assortment. Importantly, we are making progress and we are driving significant productivity gains. Today, I want to walk you through a local store, updating you on the improvements and how we have continued to evolve our store layout with Fusion and Side Lot, highlighting some of the successes we are seeing as we rollout these strategic initiatives. Let's get started. Welcome to one of our Tractor Supply stores, where we recently completed a combo Project Fusion and Side Lot Transformation remodel. For today's tour, we are starting outside in our roughly 4,000 square foot garden center. When we first introduced our space productivity initiatives, we highlighted that our most significant opportunity to drive incremental sales, traffic and market share was through our Side Lot Transformation program. In this, we convert a space that's traditionally been utilized for storage to a garden center that's tailored to the lifestyle of our Out Here customers. We knew from customer research that the lawn and garden category, specifically live goods and bag products, was the number one hobby of our shopper where they did not look to Tractor Supply as their primary destination. And as the weather turns warmer and we enter spring 2022, we are excited to have more than 160 garden centers to start capitalizing on this opportunity. Our merchants have been aggressively adding growers to prepare for the season. In these garden centers, we will be offering a broad assortment of live goods with a focus on vegetable gardening, shrubs, trees as well as a full assortment of color to create excitement with our customers. Our offering is differentiated for the Out Here lifestyle. We are also introducing additional products in seasonally relevant categories, such as furniture, planners, drilling and outdoor living. From our early reads, we believe that these additions will drive share of wallet with both our core customers and attract new customers to Tractor Supply. From a performance perspective, we are seeing positive lifts in the seasonal department despite very few stores having a garden center in 2021 during the peak season. In our 27 stores where we added only a garden center and did not do a Fusion remodel, we are seeing triple-digit lifts in our live goods and the lift for packaged seeds leaves the chain with strong double-digit lifts on top of triple-digit lifts in 2020. Let's now shift to the exciting trends of our Fusion and Side Lot combos, particularly the 15 combo stores that were opened for the 2021 spring selling season. In those stores, we are seeing double-digit sales lift performance for the entire store and strong performance across all merchandising divisions. Specific to our seasonal division, which includes our lawn and garden categories, the total seasonal product division lift in these stores is up more than 30% and we are getting incredible feedback from our customers as a shopper updated side lot, in our updated seasonal corner, in our fusion layout. In aisle, we are seeing successes in handheld products, belts, blades and everyday lawn and garden items. Looking ahead to 2022, all garden centers will be built in combination with a Fusion remodel as well as the vast majority of new stores will open with the garden center. As we know, we get the greatest sales lift when we combine our Project Fusion and our Side Lot initiative. These categories are a key focus for Tractor Supply to continue to capture share as identified in our total addressable market opportunities. I hope you share our excitement with our Side Lot Transformation. Now, let's walk a few of the other areas inside the store and highlight some of the updates and the initial results that we are seeing from our Project Fusion remodels. As you enter the store, our customers immediately experience a dramatic update as they are greeted by the customer service hub, which consolidates our cash registers and customer service desk. Sight lines have also dramatically been improved with the implementation of the new Department Lightboxes. Customer feedback to these changes has been overwhelmingly positive. Our shopper survey results show positive increases in cleanliness, speed needs and checkout and availability of team member assistance. Also, our score for a variety of merchandise in store has improved more than 120 basis points in our Fusion customer survey results. And by moving the customer service desk to the hub, we added approximately 300 square feet of selling space in the center of the store that is more effectively being used to drive space productivity and show additional merchandising programs. So as we move to our pet department, we have reworked adjacencies, updated space allocations and increased the number of pallet positions. One of the biggest changes in our Fusion pet layout is leading the flow of the department with ct products. We know we have significant opportunity to grow sales and share of wallet in cat. And by placing it on the first aisle on Fusion, we are giving greater visibility and access. And when looking at the results, we are excited to see that our Fusion stores are over-indexing in new customer growth in this category. And existing Tractor Supply customers buying in this category is up 600 basis points versus non-Fusion stores. We are also seeing positive sales lifts in wet cat food and supplies across all-time periods post remodel. Since we first introduced you to our Fusion layout, we have also had an additional run of dry dog food in select stores, like you see here, which maximizes holding power and increases space allocations to accelerate growth in this key category. We believe approximately 40% of the Fusion remodels will have the space to add this additional footage in our pet department. We are confident that these changes will continue to drive our market share gains in pet. In addition to pet products, we continue to enhance the services we offer our pet parents, like self-service pet wash stations, which are now in more than 500 locations. In a small subset of stores, we are also piloting wellness centers, which operate in 44 stores to-date with a full-time veterinarian staff 5 days a week. Wellness centers are also complemented with mobile pet vet clinics that operate in more than 1,400 stores today. And in 2021, we serviced over 1.2 million pets through pet wash, wellness centers, pet vet clinics and televet solutions. We will continue to look to grow our pet services as an opportunity to increase customer lifetime value and bring in new customers. In our Fusion stores, we continue to drive space productivity in our livestock feed, health and supplies categories. Just like dog food, these sections, along with the entire pet department, are among the most highly productive areas of the store already. We have updated adjacencies, reallocated square footage and visually improved the department to support this important category. The most significant positive impact is the equine supplement, leg care and fly control categories, which are trending between 400 and 800 basis points above trend. And in select stores, we have added a feed barn that gives the stores the inventory holding power needed to stay in stock and allows customers to drive through and load heavy animal feed, fencing and other core categories directly into their vehicles. These are trip-driving categories where we will win as the 100% dependable supplier. Colin will share more details on how we will widen the gap versus the competition in this key area. Moving into our truck tool and hardware area, this part of the store experienced some of the most significant merchandising updates with the introduction of new brands, new fixtures and significant changes to space allocations. As a result, we are seeing growth in traffic counts, attachment and cross shopping in our power tool department. We see that existing customers are finding and shopping the power tool aisle for the first time. And these customers are much more likely to attach an accessory to the power tool purchase at a Fusion store versus a non-Fusion store. We have also rolled out this tool crowd concept to more than 300 additional non-Fusion stores based on the early results. And what really excites me is that our TAM assessment indicates that these are categories, where we continue to have significant share opportunities. And finally, let's take a look at our apparel section, which is experiencing the most significant lifts inside the store across all of our Fusion remodel categories. In many remodels, we actually reduced the footprint of the department by consolidating our presentation, with new fixturing and merchandising. In these Fusion stores, apparel is running at comp above 35%, with high single-digit lift as compared to control stores. This is a category that gets an immediate response from the consumer and the lifts have been sustained over time. We believe this is attributed to the visual impact post conversion, updated space allocations of categories and brands as well as the expansion of women's with brands like Carhartt, Ariat and Wrangler. Apparel is now a key customer mission for people to come to Tractor Supply. We are also excited to showcase brands throughout the department like Carhartt, that you can see here, store within a store concept in 90 locations, which are running departmental comps above company averages. We will continue to look for ways to differentiate our offering in apparel that support our customers' lifestyles. So thanks for coming along with me on the store tour today. I hope you get the opportunity to get in store yourself and see our new Fusion and Side Lot upgrade soon. I hope you found our store tour insightful today. We believe that investing in our stores is just table stakes to win in today's omnichannel retail environment. Overall, we are encouraged by the early results we are seeing from our Fusion and Side Lot initiatives, with the biggest impact coming when their innovations have reached a maturity of about 9 months post completion. As we look ahead, our target for Fusion-only stores is a mid-single-digit sales lift post project maturity and we are targeting a high single-digit sales lift on the Fusion and Side Lot combo stores. Our goal is to have 100% of the chain in the Fusion format by the end of 2026, while our combo Fusion and Side Lot stores will ultimately be across 60% to 70% of the chain. We are making significant progress towards our space productivity goals and delivering on the strategic pillar of operate The Tractor Way. We have a best-in-class customer-focused merchant team that will continue to grow sales and profit by driving innovation and optimizing our differentiated merchandising assortment. We are highly focused on capturing market share of our expanded TAM. And we have a compelling game plan for growth that will serve our core customers while bringing in new customers to the Tractor Supply family. All-in-all, we are committed to being the indispensable supplier for Life Out Here and widening the gap versus our competition. Thank you again for going on this Fusion and Side Lot store tour with me today. Next up is Colin, who plays such a key role in serving our customers. With the recent complications to the supply chain, Colin and his team have done an amazing job keeping our stores in stock. Hey, thanks, Peter, this is Seth. Great question. Good to see you today. And when we look at gross margin as we manage forward, I would say if you look where we were historically, when we've talked about C.U.E. outpacing the fleet now potentially could put a little bit of pressure on the company. What I would say today is that the balance of the four walls is really performing. So while C.U.E. is outpacing, we're continuing to premiumize even our C.U.E., we're pushing people, call it, into that premium segment. But outside of that, we're also seeing the apparel segment do really well for us today, right? We're seeing our truck and toy area is doing really well for us today. I could go around the four walls of the store, and we look at our sales forecast and we look at particularly, this upcoming year, we're anticipating all four walls continue to contribute to that sales number and that estimate that we have out there. So while C.U.E. is continuing to outperform, we're looking to continue to drive that C.U.E., drive those footsteps, coupled with the balance of the store, along with our pricing technology that we have today, which is much more sophisticated than we continue to have in the past. We feel confident in the ability to be able to look at the pressures that are coming in the business, manage the mix of the product and be able to deliver those gross margin targets that we have out there. Yes, absolutely. Hey, Scott, great to see you. Thanks for the question. I'm incredibly excited about exactly what you're talking about and how I outlined earlier our expansion of our total addressable market. And from a merchandising perspective, that's what really, really excites us because we know we have opportunities across our business as we're seeing both our core shopper and these new shoppers that are finding Tractor Supply as we're introducing them to this lifestyle. They are finding the buying and where we know we have that considerable market share opportunity. Our merchants are continuing to attack that with partnerships, exclusivity, going after differentiation, driving experiences in the store that John will talk both inside the box, but also looking at outside the box. Obviously, with what we're looking garden centers, our front aprons could go on and on. And so we're looking at this year. Again, I mean, you talk about things like apparel and the trends that we're seeing like in Carhartt, Ariat as well as our own exclusive brands, whether it be like in Ridgecut and expanding into women's, those are the things that we're really looking to attack. As well as like in pet, constant, constant newness that the team is going after, whether it be like the introduction of brands like Victor and Tractor Supply as well as doubling down on brands that we're really seeing growth for like that would be considered specialty for the rural marketplace like science diet, Proplan, etcetera. And I can go around the store. And if you think about things like where we have big opportunities, we're approaching spring. And you mentioned Chick Days, we've talked about live goods. But we've also got things like the electrification of these new shoppers that are in \u2013 or the OPE market, these new shoppers per coming in. We announced this past week, our partnership that I'm really excited about with Greenworks and Greenworks Pro. We know shoppers have been trending towards the battery market, but we've been really waiting on a product that we believe that would stand up to the demands of consumer. And that's what we really went after and have created this partnership with them. That's just like one area and one category that we continue to talk to. But we're really not playing in today, but we're going after, and we're going to continue to go after that with market share and play in the future. So absolutely agree that I can talk about product all day long and within our store and not just in the store, but also online with Rob and team with the product expansion there. So John, I'll turn it over to talk about experiences. Hi Steve, this is Seth. Relative to inflation and what that outlook is this year versus this past year, what I would say is if you were to go back to 2021 in the beginning of that year, it really started with the commodity markets, right? And you think about grains, then we move more into steel, then other cost pressures continued on our supplier side, continue to roll to, call it, cost of goods pressure, whether that would be getting components from overseas to here, their labor rates, etcetera. And what I would say is we are \u2013 as we have entered into 2022 and where we are today, it is more broad-based. And so relative to last year, you are looking more broad-based across the four walls. What I would say about that, though, is when we think about our pricing sophistication, we know where the price is coming at us. And we know what's in front of us and our \u2013 and the team has done a fantastic job from an analyst perspective, utilizing our tools to be able to go out and make sure that be priced right in the market, to drive market share, measure elasticities and at the same time, make sure that we can manage the P&L accordingly. So, as you look at last year, it did really started commodities, really went into steel. Now it is more broad-based and that's where we see it heading in 2022."

            "content": "Thanks, Hal and hello everyone. Thank you for joining us. We really appreciate your time and attention today to hear more about our substantial progress and our very bright future. As Hal covered a good bit about our top line results and impressive customer trends, I will pickup with our gross margin performance. Our fourth quarter gross margin rate was 33.8%, a decrease of 83 basis points versus last year. This was generally in line with our expectation as we expected inflationary pressures to continue in both product and transportation costs. As has been very well documented, the cost environment remains elevated across imports and domestic freight, commodities and labor wages. Hal shared with you our approach to managing through the current environment. I commend our team for the great job they are doing in the current environment. The Tractor Supply team effectively offset a significant portion through our retail price management program. The fourth quarter comparable ticket growth included the benefit of approximately 850 basis points of inflation. For fiscal 2021, inflation benefited comp sales by approximately 550 basis points. Across the network, we have been nimble to navigate the unprecedented supply chain environment and macro issues, including inflationary pressures. Additionally, we continue to see favorability in the frequency and depth of promotions. This is due to our commitment to our everyday low pricing strategy and a continued strong demand for our product categories. Turning to SG&A, our fourth quarter adjusted SG&A expense ratio, including depreciation and amortization, improved by 68 basis points versus last year to 24.9%. This improvement as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to good leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in our comparable store sales, along with lower COVID-19 pandemic response costs and decreased incentive compensation. This leverage was partially offset by higher wage rates, incremental store labor hours to ensure we are providing a great customer service and investments in our Life Out Here strategic initiatives. Moving to our profitability, adjusted operating profit increased 13.4%, adjusted net income increased 14.6% and diluted earnings per share was $1.93, an increase of 17.7% on an adjusted basis from the fourth quarter of last year. This slide recaps our record performance for the year, all on an adjusted basis. Our operating income increased 22%. And for the fiscal year, we had an operating profit margin of 10.3%. Net income was just under $1 billion, with diluted EPS growth of over 25% for the year. Turning now to a few additional financial highlights, the strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a position of strength for Tractor Supply. Fiscal 2021 was a year of strong cash flow from operations, which totaled $1.14 billion. Our balance sheet remains incredibly healthy and we exited the year with a 2x leverage ratio. At the end of the year, our merchandise inventories were $2.2 billion and on a per store basis, inventory increased about 15%. This increase reflects our commitment to support our strong sales trends and be in stock for our customers, along with an increase from inflation. In 2021, the team opened 80 new Tractor Supply stores. We continue to see very robust new store economics. For the full year, we returned a total of around $1 billion in capital to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. With another year of remarkable performance in the books, let's now turn to our outlook for 2022. We detailed our 2022 guidance in our press release, but I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. We have momentum. We will continue to invest in the business through our Life Out Here strategy. We have the opportunity to create and define our future and extend our leadership for years to come. And this team is committed to doing just that. We continue to operate in a time of heightened uncertainty regarding the pandemic. This uncertainty includes product cost inflation and supply chain constraints as well as the impact that these factors will have on the broader economy and the consumer. As a needs-based business, Tractor Supply has a long history of resilience during volatility. Starting with sales, please keep in mind that we are cycling tailwinds from generally favorable weather and government stimulus, principally in the first half of the year. With that backdrop, we believe we can comp the comp as our view is that our customer is healthy, even despite their concerns over the state of the broader economy. We anticipate the insights and initiatives you will hear more about today, including Neighbor's Club, Digital, Fusion and Side Lot and investments in the customer experience to contribute to our positive comp range of 3% to 4.5%. We are planning for positive comp transaction growth. We are also planning for positive ticket growth, which assumes an inflation benefit of approximately 4 percentage points. This is partially offset by an average ticket decline from lapping the strength in big ticket and other select categories from last year's stimulus benefit. The 53rd week adds about 1.5 percentage points of net sales growth for fiscal 2022 and about $0.15 of earnings per diluted share. Please keep in mind the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm & Home is not included in our guidance. We believe gross margin and SG&A will remain flattish to the prior year. Key drivers for gross margin include assumptions that transportation and inflation pressures will continue, but at a slightly lesser pace offset by our price management and continued limited promotions. Turning to SG&A, we are planning to make investments in strategic initiatives and wages, offset by leverage of fixed costs, normalized incentive compensation expense, reduced COVID costs and operational efficiencies. As to the cadence of the business in 2022, Q1 is our toughest compare at 39% sales comp, benefiting from favorable weather and stimulus. In 2021, we estimated those two had 9 points of comp benefit on the first quarter. The gross margin and overall operating margin are also the toughest compare in Q1 as we had favorable mix of product due to weather and strong leverage on comps and limited pressure from inflation. We anticipate comps to be flat to slightly positive in Q1, driven primarily from positive comp ticket. Q4 will have the strongest year-over-year sales growth due to the 53rd week. Sales comps are expected to be relatively consistent in Q2 through Q4, all within our guidance range. Our ninth distribution center is expected to begin operating in the fall. Our outlook is for capital spending in the range of $625 million to $675 million, with 70% for growth initiatives. Depreciation expense is estimated to increase approximately $70 million, up about 25% year-over-year due to the investments in our business. We anticipate continuing our strong track record of returning capital to shareholders. We are planning on share repurchases of $700 million to $800 million, with an expected 2% net reduction in weighted shares outstanding. To wrap up, 2022 is positioned to be a great year for Tractor Supply. There is no doubt that Tractor Supply is stronger than we were entering the pandemic. We are delivering against our goals. And most importantly, we have a compelling, incredible plan to continue to grow. I look forward to sharing more on our long-term outlook later in the presentation. Now, let me turn it back to Hal to share a broader update on our Life Out Here strategy. Hal? Thank you, Mary Winn. It's been 15 months since our October 2020 enhanced earnings event, and I am excited to talk to you again about Tractor Supply's strategy, our new supporting strategic initiatives and our plan to continue to deliver strong and sustainable total shareholder return. At that time, we outlined our Life Out Here strategy and our focus on TSR. We are pleased with the strong progress that we have made against all elements of the Life Out Here strategy. We have continued to deliver on our highly differentiated proposition as the number one farm and ranch retailer. We have accelerated execution of all our strategic priorities and we have remained disciplined and focused on how we have allocated our capital. This team has worked hard to deliver outstanding financial results and are honored that our shareholders have benefited from the S&P 500 top decile TSR that we have delivered over the last 2 years. Despite our strong progress, we are not resting on our laurels. We continue to add important new strengths to reinforce our focus on delivering strong and sustainable TSR. Our top line revenue growth is compelling, not only in magnitude, but also in its quality and durability. The Life Out Here strategy continues to expand and we have added new strategic initiatives. As you heard from John, we plan to lead with legendary service and aim to achieve that number one position in customer experience. And as you heard from Rob, we are deeply focused on digital as part of our omni-channel approach and intend to dramatically lift our mobile engagement. And as you heard from Colin, we are investing in our supply chain to support the growth in key products that are core to living the Out Here lifestyle. We are proud that our strong and durable free cash flow enables the Power of AND ensuring that we can fully support and fund all of our most important growth investments and return significant capital to shareholders at the same time. The growth that Tractor Supply has generated over the past 2 years is highly differentiated within retail and is firing on all cylinders. Rarely can a retailer founded more than 80 years ago demonstrate the magnitude, diversity and quality of growth that Tractor Supply has delivered over the past 2 years. Almost one-third of our growth came from new customers and over two-thirds has come from increasing share of wallet with our passionate and loyal existing customers. The volume and basket growth that we have delivered has meaningfully exceeded any top line tailwinds that we have seen from inflation. Our e-commerce growth continues to accelerate with 2-year CAGR of 80% in our digital channel, forming a larger part of our growth that we have ever seen before and new and expanding categories in lawn and garden, grilling, apparel, power tools and pet drove almost one-third of our comp growth, along with strong increases in our core businesses such as C.U.E. The diverse mix of growth that we have seen highlights the underlying strength of Tractor Supply's top line organic growth. This gives us deep confidence in the strength and quality of our growth trajectory. As we look to the future, we expect to deliver a high-quality and sustainable top line organic growth trajectory that builds on the substantially higher revenue base that we have achieved in the last 2 years. Our long-term financial outlook includes a revenue growth of 6% to 7%, with a 4% to 5% contribution from comps and 2% contribution from new store openings. Our 4% to 5% comps outlook is underpinned by growth in customer demand from our loyal customer base and new customer growth. Expansion of our TAM through the new and expanded categories I mentioned earlier, such as lawn and garden, grilling and pets and continued execution of our Life Out Here strategy, with key roles being played by the lift in store productivity from Fusion and Side Lot, our goal of being the number one legendary customer experience and our strong focus on customer retention and further engagement through our powerful Neighbor's Club loyalty program. We are pleased that our most recent market analysis has indicated that we have more new store growth headroom than we shared with you in the fall of 2020. And as a result, we are increasing our total store target by 200 to 2,700 stores. Our target of 2,700 stores will be achieved organically. We are excited that with this increased target we will have a decade of future growth runway in non-comps growth ahead. As Hal mentioned, we remain optimistic about the FTC process regarding Orscheln, which would be additive to our total store target of 2,700. Given our recent performance, increased scale and greater line of sight into some of our most important cost drivers, we are raising our long-term operating margin target to a range of 10.1% to 10.6%. Since initially providing this guidance in the fall of 2020, we have gained greater line of sight into the operating margin drivers that you see on the left side of this page. As a result, we believe we can sustain an operating margin above 10% and feel that there is upside margin potential beyond last year's operating margin of 10.3%. We have seen favorable impacts from pricing and promotion, expansion of our product mix, our operating efficiency program and the improved operating leverage generated from our high-quality growth. Despite the headwinds from inflation, higher transportation costs as well as maintaining the significant investment programs we have underway, we see our current margin levels in the 10.1% to 10.6% range as sustainable longer term. As I mentioned earlier, our operating margin guidance for fiscal year 2022 is in the range of 10.1% to 10.3%. And from this, you can infer that over the next 5 years, we feel that we have the opportunity at least to maintain and potentially grow margins towards the top of that range. In addition to the operating margin outlook range, we believe there are other opportunities that while uncertain provide the potential for further margin upside if they progress favorably. These include the normalization of investment levels to sustain our growth trajectory, lower transportation and COVID-related costs and reduced inflationary pressures such as wages. We have made enormous progress in the execution of our Life Out Here strategy. The rollout of our two key store remodeling programs, Fusion and Side Lot has accelerated. As Seth shared with you, our expectation for Fusion-only stores is a mid single-digit sales lift post-project maturity and a high single-digit sales lift on the Fusion and Side Lot combo stores. By end of 2026, we are targeting 100% of our stores to have the completed Fusion remodel and 60% to 70% of our stores base to have the new Side Lot with garden center. Our Neighbor's Club loyalty program is seeing very strong growth and helping us provide even greater value and engagement with our deeply loyal Life Out Here customers. As Christi mentioned, our Neighbor's Club members remain one of our most valuable assets, driving approximately 70% of total sales and spending 3x more than non-loyalty customers. Our e-commerce performance has been fantastic, delivering 80% annual growth in sales over the past 2 years. Our mobile app just launched late 2020, already makes up 10% of our digital sales revenue. We are excited to target a digital penetration of approximately 15% and over $2 billion in sales by the end of 2026 and we will continue to invest behind and strengthen our digital capabilities. We continue to focus on our disciplined capital allocation with a clear set of priorities and how we think about optimal capital allocation to support the delivery of strong and sustainable TSR. Investing in the business to drive organic growth remains our number one priority with the clear ambition of sustaining our high-quality growth trajectory long-term. We remain committed to outstanding return of capital to our shareholders, firstly, through our growing dividend at least as fast as earnings and secondly, by returning excess cash through a strong and consistent share repurchase program. Where appropriate, we will pursue tuck-in acquisitions to add to our growth and key capabilities for the future. All of this is underpinned by our commitment to cash flow generation, a healthy balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. This compelling free cash flow that we expect to generate over the next 5 years, which includes a cumulative $8 billion of operating cash flow, $5 billion of free cash flow puts us in a very attractive position and enables the Power of AND. The strength and durability of our future cash flow delivery means that we can fully fund all of our growth oriented, high return initiatives and return a significant amount of capital to shareholders simultaneously. Over the next 5 years, we plan to invest $3 billion in CapEx, in Fusion and Side Lot distribution centers, technology and customer experience with the objective of delivering our long-term growth ambition. While organic growth investments are our highest priority, the strong and growing free cash flow enables us to remain fully committed to our capital return. In our October 2020 enhanced earnings call, I indicated that our 5-year return of capital to shareholders would be approximately $4 billion. Based on the expectation of our stronger cash flow generation and our updated long-term financial outlook, we now expect to return more than $6 billion in capital over the next 5 years. This return of capital is expected to exceed our free cash flow by utilizing existing cash on the balance sheet and modestly increasing our leverage, ensuring we are putting every dollar of cash and cash flow to use. As announced in our earnings release today, we will significantly increase our quarterly dividend by 77% to $0.92 per share. This level will approximately equate to a target 40% payout ratio as a percent of net income. Moving forward, we plan to grow our dividend per share at a rate that is equal to or greater than our earnings per share over the next 5 years. It is important to note that future quarterly dividends are subject to Board of Directors discretion and approval. This dividend increase and future growth highlights our strong commitment to disciplined capital allocation and our confidence in Tractor Supply's trajectory. Now, we also remain committed to a consistent share repurchase program and our increased dividend should not be seen as being at the expense of our share repurchase program, but reinforcing the Power of AND. Let's now look at our long-term financial outlook. When comparing back to our 2019 long-term outlook, we have pulled forward 6 years of targeted growth into the past 2 years. We expect to build from our stronger revenue base and deliver 4% to 5% comps, 6% to 7% total sales on average over the next 5 years based on the solid evidence of the success of our Life Out Here strategy and the structural shifts in our markets as you heard from the team today. As I mentioned earlier, our greater line of sight into the cost drivers has enabled us to lift our long-term operating margin outlook from 10.1% to 10.6% range. This means that our compelling top line growth, operating margin outlook and consistent share repurchase program will enable us to deliver an 8% to 11% earnings per share growth over the next 5 years. Pulling this strong financial outlook together highlights Tractor Supply's long-term, double-digit TSR delivery potential. This double-digit TSR potential includes 8% to 11% EPS growth and an approximate 1.5% current dividend yield with further room to grow relative to earnings. Beyond this double-digit TSR, we see further potential upside that can be achieved by accelerating strategic initiatives and executing on tuck-in acquisitions. As I wrap up, I would like to leave you with some final thoughts. The strong finance performance and outlook I have talked through with you today is reflective of our success with our customers. The tireless and dedicated work of all of Tractor Supply's team, combined with the deep and growing loyalty of our customers is what makes Tractor Supply the company that it is. Building on my statements at our last enhanced earnings event, whether I look at our strong and sustainable growth outlook, the operating margin potential, the Power of AND and our double-digit TSR potential, in my 22 years at Tractor Supply, I cannot recall a time in which I have been more proud and excited about the future of the company. And I hope you all feel the same way. With that, I will turn it back over to Hal. Yes, hey, good morning Kate and thank you for the questions. On operating margin, as you think about the long-term targets, one, we are extremely pleased with the performance of the business. And the last 15 months have really shown in regards to is it structural, is it transitory in regards to the performance of the company, a lot more visibility and confidence in the structural nature of our business. And really that was one of the key factors when you look back to our enhanced earnings event 15 months ago. So, what we have seen first from the top line is that the belief in the structural nature of that really gives us the confidence on the SG&A that you have got that leverage. In regards to your question about how the cadence and what are some of the factors? I'll break it down between gross margin and SG&A and over time. So with gross margin, certainly, we recognize right now we are in unprecedented inflationary times, managing that really well. We expect that inflation, as I mentioned, our 2022 guidance, to persist in over the next few years we expect a general inflationary environment, but more typical modest inflation and we believe we can manage that through our scale and through our retail price management. Transportation and the supply chain disruptions, we believe those maybe a little bit longer in nature and it might take a few more years to be able to actually normalize on it. But in the back end of that timeframe some of that transportation easing and normalization. In addition to that, on the SG&A side, we look at it in our investments right now we are hitting some of the peak investments. We understand that those investments put pressure on the SG&A and it's the right thing for the long-term, along with investment in wages. So, the next couple of years have a stronger pressure in operating margin, but when you take the easing on the gross margin pressures of inflation, when you think about us beginning to have traction on the investments and our ability to drive efficiencies. I'll even mention really proud about our profit improvement, our operating efficiency programs that we've got. We believe those are key drivers along with leverage from scale that allows us to be able to invest for the long-term, grow the top line. And during this time of investment, where you heard from Seth, really transforming many of our stores that we can do that while maintaining and potentially even grow our operating margin in the next 5 years. So it again, will be a little bit of easing into that. And maybe perhaps in the back end of it is more the upside of it, but we like that algorithm and the excitement that having an operating margin above 10% with phenomenal growth. Simeon, yes, thank you for the question. I think it's a great one. And this team is basically focused on managing our operating margin overall. Here's a couple of the things that in regards to over the next 3 to 5 years. You pointed out the investments that we're making on the business. When we look at our operating margin, we look at what we're doing to invest from a position of strength and for the future. We're making key investments in the SG&A, and we're making investments in our supply chain. And those investments in the supply chain will help drive the market share and the sales that will help drive gross margin. We're making investments field activity support team. We're making investments in our IT technology. So we're making the right investments, and yes, that puts some pressure on the SG&A, but our focus on driving market share for the long-term and the ability to be able to enhance that gross margin, it's going to differ between the years. But we're going to be really focused on top line being competitive and getting a good price to our customer and maintaining a good operating margin and keeping that even balanced. I've mentioned in my presentation, I put in that slide that we recognize there is some uncertainties in the financial algorithm today, unprecedented inflation. We're seeing wage inflation and make sure that we're positioned again to invest in our stores, in our technology by doing all of those things along with just having COVID expenses still in the business like most of retail. All of those costs we have some expectations continue to play into the financial algorithm, and there is opportunity. We want to be careful. We want to be prudent in our operating margin. And we feel like some of those factors turn positive in the long-term, that does give us the opportunity for that while we're being pretty prudent in that approach and making sure that we're doing the right thing for the business and real steady throughout these 5 years. Yes, definitely. Just to \u2013 I'll start with reiterating the capital allocation. Certainly, our number one priority is investing in our stores, and we see still significant opportunity, as I mentioned, nearly a decade of growth in the runway of new stores. The investments we're making to sweat those assets and put more productivity in the stores that already have the occupancy and the rent there. So Joe, to your point, first, we've got so much opportunity in the growth of the business and grab the total addressable market and grab market share there. Then of course, after that, we feel with the tremendous step-up in growth and the consistent operating cash flow will return to with the opportunity, both dividend and share repurchases, thrilled to be able to announce the Board's approval of a 77% increase in dividends. As far as the tuck-in acquisitions then, where there are opportunities. We've not been highly acquisitive. We feel there is so much opportunity in our core. But where there are opportunities, Tractor Supply is sometimes that an exit strategy in our niche industry, where there is area that we are not in. I mean we're open to that opportunity. If we look at it and say, hey, there is opportunity to grab the real estate we're not in or to complement. And so if there is a acquisition, if there is a capability that builds on one of the strategic initiatives that you hear from us as part of Life Out Here strategy to buy versus build, we will look at that opportunity. But it's certainly more of that opportunistic things on our radar and really excited about what we've got right in front of us, and there may be complementary opportunities. Yes. Hey Karen, good to see you. Let me ask for clarification because you broke up a it on the question on EBIT. So, I know it was an EBIT margin question and also referencing sales growth, but maybe just clarify that. Yes, great. From an operating standpoint, I mean the \u2013 again, I will just reference the key \u2013 if the question is regarding our long-term outlook, and we think about the EBIT margin in there is that we see an important opportunity right now to make investments, and a lot of that investment will be in the stores technology and in our supply chain. And so as we make the investments and those investment pressures are on SG&A, we also see great leverage through our operating efficiencies, the leverage from the growth in the sales. And so we have \u2013 over the next 3 years to 5 years, we see definite inflation and pressure from investments that we can offset with the leverage and with the operating efficiencies. On the gross margin side, we also see over time that we have got the opportunity from those investments able to grow our gross margin. So, there is some good opportunity in here with our scale and with the work that Colin and Seth are doing to be able to grow some of that gross margin at a faster rate and really see that opportunity there. So, from the algorithm, our assumption is that these investments are growing the top line, but also giving our gross margin an opportunity to grow. And there is likely to be more growth in the operating margin over that 5-year period in our assumption from the gross margin side as we balance out our efficiencies, our investments in the SG&A side. Yes. Hey Oliver, I will take that. First, I will start by just talking about 2022 as a quick reminder, and then beyond that. So, for 2022, what we have said is we plan and are targeting positive comp transaction and positive comp ticket. And ticket likely to lead more than transaction in 2022. Beyond 2022, while every year could be a bit different, what we think about it is it's really going to be pretty balanced. And if you refer back to some of the real drivers of our comps that we have talked about, you have got Fusion and Side Lot that are driving traffic into the store with new categories. They are also driving ticket, digital doing the same thing, the work that John and Colin talked about on delivering on legendary service. These types of things, we really see the strategic initiatives that we have got and the momentum in the business that in the 2023 to 2026 period of time is that we have got opportunity to be really balanced between both of those because these strategic initiatives are focused long-term on driving market share, which means traffic, which means footsteps into the stores and clicks on the website. Hi, Steven. I will take the question on the reference back to the last enhanced earnings call, where we had that give-back year. And your reference, I am assuming you go back to that line graph that many have referred back when they are talking with me about it. And really back then, the question was all about structural or transitory, and really how resilient is this step-up in growth. And 15 months ago, there was that legitimate question of how much of this growth is a temporary shift in behavior that's in favor of Tractor Supply. But all the things that we have talked about and what Christi mentioned in regards to the permanent shifts in some of the customers, not only geographic locations, but what the hobbies are and people entering in our lifestyle, millennials buying homes, those types of things began to get answered over an 18-month period of time. I will reference back to, as an example, one of the slides I presented, I think is really powerful that over this period of time, what we saw that we had growth from new customers, 30% but then growth in existing new categories of the product as well into existing digital as well as in brick-and-mortar and the fact that our growth was from transactions and ticket. And when you look at transaction and basket, it was the biggest piece of it, so really broad, diverse growth in it and the fact that we have had consistency. Best way to give an example on the consistency. Last three quarters, 40% almost to a tee, each of those quarters, 2 years back on the comp. So, as we work through that, it really solidified that these are enduring customer relationships that are benefiting Tractor Supply. It's really the difference between what our outlook was 15 months ago versus what we are presenting today, and really excited about that for the future."

            "name": "Rob Mills",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn. I am very excited about being here today to talk about the activities that we will continue to grow our legendary customer experience. It's great to be here. We have made significant opportunities to continue to grow and capture and build momentum on our digital business we have seen over the past few years. We have accelerated our digital journey, focused on creating a seamless experience regardless of how our customer shops anytime, anywhere, any way. When we introduced our Life Out Here strategy in 2020, this continued to be a focus for Tractor Supply, continuing to advance our ONETractor digital capabilities. Over the past 12 months, we have made significant progress on this journey. The team is living our values every day, driving change, taking initiative and being accountable to the expectations of our customers and our shareholders, introducing new capabilities to enhance our customer interactions, such as curbside pickup and our customer mobile app. We have taken a mobile-first approach in everything we do, using geofencing, which enables store efficiency and enables fast and convenient service for our customers. We have also worked to enrich the customer experience across browse, search and checkout. We are leveraging the rich data from our Neighbor's Club loyalty program to serve personalized and relevant content to our customers. And we have expanded the ability to purchase from inventory beyond our stores, allowing our customers to buy items that are in transit from our DC to our stores, ensuring that they have access to the products they always need. As you heard Hal mentioned, we continue to grow our online presence, completing our 38th quarter of double-digit growth. Our customers continue to leverage the digital convenience of buy online, pick up in store and curbside pickup. We have seen continued adoption of our customer mobile app as we rolled out capabilities that provide convenience and interaction with our customers. Within 1 year, we have grown 10% of e-commerce sales occurring on the mobile app. We have grown visitors to our website and our mobile app nearly 20% year-over-year and attracted 1.4 million first-time customers through the digital channel. Over the past 12 months, we have driven over 2 million downloads within the mobile app. And even with this digital growth that we have seen, there is still a tremendous opportunity ahead of us compared to other hardlines and specialty retailers. We are definitely the digital leader in the farm and ranch industry. In just 2 years, we have doubled our digital sales, now representing 7% of our total business and have plans continue to grow share to over 15% by 2026, exceeding $2 billion of our total sales. I will share more about our plans for growth today, all of which focuses on the mobile experience that Hal shared earlier. Our customers' behaviors continue to evolve, embracing convenient ways of shopping and continued preference on mobility. Over 70% of our customer interacts with us on a mobile device, outpacing the industry. And their satisfaction directly ties to the convenience the mobile interaction provides. Our customer satisfaction scores are 500 basis points higher when our customers shop on the mobile app. We will differentiate our digital offering for our customers through the mobile app. For example, we deployed the ability for a customer to request propane refill from the app. This capability simplifies the purchase process, giving the customer the ability to notify a team member that they need assistance with the refill. Through a tap of a button, a team member is notified that the customer is in the parking lot and needs a refill. The team member can acknowledge the request, proceed to the refill station and complete the transaction on a mobile device, making it simple and convenient for the customer. By extending the team member and the customer interactions beyond the store, we are able to improve the customer experience by providing two-way communication, allowing the team member to know and plan for the next customer interaction, which ultimately leads to the legendary customer experience. So, let's talk a little bit about what's ahead of us on the digital front. Our activities in 2022 will focus in three primary areas, areas that Hal referenced earlier when he talked about advancing the ONETractor capabilities and that are part of the Life Out Here strategy. First, increasing mobile engagement by creating the best-in-class digital interactions; second, connecting our customers to care for their pets and animals, capitalizing on the strengths in these categories; and third, advancing the omnichannel delivery experience by leveraging conversational commerce. Let's look at each of these. Our customers tell us through data. They prefer to interact with us through a mobile device. We will continue to increase engagement by providing legendary customer service through frictionless experiences. By using data analytics powered by artificial intelligence, we will drive personalized experiences. And we will continue to differentiate the experience by introducing capabilities that improve the customer interactions and convenience. We will leverage our Neighbor's Club loyalty program to drive engagement with easy access to program benefits, including rewards and the market, catering to our top-tier customers, providing tools to make their Life Out Here easier. Our Neighbor's Club power users will easily view reward status, offers and coupons as well as store payment options within a newly redesigned wallet. We will integrate reorder options and introduce Wayfinding to make locating products easier and faster for our customers and our team members. And we will allow customers to obtain on-demand assistance from anywhere in the store or outside the store. The mobile app will drive a personalized experience to our customers, and we will talk to our customers about products and services they need. Using data and analytics, we will offer knowledge to our customer base on their shopping trends, while introducing one-stop shop for all customers' pet needs within the mobile app. My Pet feature will provide customers with easy access to pet prescriptions, vet services and managing their product subscriptions and scheduling interactions. We will make the experience for the customer, embedding the capabilities into the shopping experience and updating the customer pet profiles based upon their shopping habits and purchase. We will continue to differentiate ourselves by integrating the in-store and digital experience to create a best-in-class omnichannel experience, integrating our digital shopping cart with the in-store cart, allowing checkout on a mobile device or with a team member, introducing one shopping cart regardless of how you shop or this channel you shop in. We will offer our customer connections to our team members from any locations, introducing conversational commerce embedded in the mobile app. This will allow us to provide seasoned advice about their projects, land and animal anytime, anywhere, any way. Providing connections to both the products and services our customers needs for their pets and animals is a part of what enables our ability to deliver legendary service and be the authority for Out Here lifestyle. The My Pet feature, I mentioned will create a one-stop-shop experience for all things related to our customers' needs for their pets, from prescription medications to reoccurring feed or food needs, offering product subscriptions delivered to their home or set aside for pickup in store, we want to make any item our customer needs easily available, making it convenient and dependable. As the lifestyle leader we have a significant opportunity to continue to widen the gap with our competition in this space. One of the most important parts of the digital interaction is the delivery experience, ensuring that no matter how our customers want their products we exceed their expectations. By continuing to bridge the customer team member experience across the digital lines, we can improve the customer experience and the ability to meet their needs while gaining market share. Let's look at a quick example. Kelly has placed an online order for curbside pickup. She has purchased several items, including bags of chicken feed and a bag of oyster shell. In Kelly's customer profile and her mobile app, she has designated a preference to be contacted by a team member in the event a product is unavailable, allowing the team member to suggest a substitution. When Kelly's order is submitted, a team member in the store receives a notification on his personal communication device that a curbside order is ready to be picked. He picks the chicken feed and then realizes the store doesn't have the oyster shell she ordered. Mark presses the substitution button on his mobile device and is immediately connected to Kelly via chat. He apologizes for the out of stock and provides her with two similar options, including one of our exclusive brands. Kelly chooses the substitution and Mark completes the order. By keeping our customers and our team members always connected, we can extend the legendary customer service Tractor Supply is known for beyond the four walls of the store. I am very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us as a company and in the digital business. As you hear from Seth and Colin, you will see the items I have shared support our broader Life Out Here strategy from continuing to evolve the Neighbor's Club loyalty program to supporting legendary customer service to how we move product efficiently from our distribution centers to our stores. Each element of the Life Out Here strategy is tied together, ensuring that the work we are doing is focused on supporting the needs of our customers and the Out Here lifestyle, providing a great team member experience and a best-in-class omni-channel experience. The three key highlights I want to leave you with today are: first, we will capture significant market share by creating a best-in-class digital experience; second, we will deploy best-in-breed technology that capitalizes on our unique strength in the pet and animal categories, widening the gap with our competition and we will own the relationship with our customers at all times through conversational commerce, maintaining our position as the Out Here authority. We are uniquely positioned to deliver against the significant digital opportunity we see for Tractor Supply. The Tractor Supply team continues to be excited and passionate about the digital vision and how it is fueling our growth. I am thrilled and proud to continue to be a part of this great organization. Seth, I will hand it over to you. Good morning, Steve. Great to see you, and thank you for the question. So in regards to the customer and the customer interaction, they are definitely engaging with from a digital perspective. And as you heard through my presentation, the focus around mobility first is very key as well as leveraging the power of the data that we have with Neighbor's Club. We have seen tremendous growth. We are extremely confident with that penetration rate. And we're holding in to really drive a personalized experience with that customer, telling what they need for the product, their services and just really simply, how do you remove any of the friction and really driving that convenience. From ability perspective, we're profitable. We deliver contributions back to Tractor Supply. We have a profitable online business. We will continue, of course, to look at profitability, ways to improve the profitability, leveraging all the great work that's being driven through either the analytics and understanding of our business through the product assortment mix as well as the work that's being done and can't see him. We look at the store as our primary hub, how do we fulfill from this store? Same day delivery, delivering from the store capability as well as buy online pickup as well as curbside pickup, which has been a tremendous growth opportunity. Lastly, I shared some core capabilities that we're focusing on. And going back to the mobile piece, it is around how we're putting mobile first. We're using the power of the Neighbor's Club and that analytics and knowing that customer to ensure that we're always connected with that customer at all times. When they are researching items so you are leveraging as the expert, so all the way through the ordering process, when you're actually fulfilling that customer order and how do you drive that connection back to the store, the store hub and being connected back to that team member. So we're providing that knowledge, that trust and the authority that our customer trusted. And so I guess I'll leave you with that. We have a clear road map, a strategy to move forward, both how we're engaging to the customer. We listen to the customer. We leverage the data and we're as well as we will continue to focus on the profitability, but we're strong and we're ready."

            "name": "John Ordus",
            "content": "I love hearing stories like that from our customers. I get a bunch of notes every week from our customers and our team members. I will share another one with you in just a few minutes. But I am excited to talk to you today about something I am very passionate about, taking care of our customers. I believe we have the best customers in retail. And our job is to always live up to their expectations at Tractor Supply enables them to live on their terms. I will walk you through how we are going to lead with legendary service in 2022 and beyond. We are going to talk about our mission, GURA and the Country Mile, our stores, team members and customers, leading with legendary service and our game plan for growth. Our mission is to work hard, have fun and make money by providing legendary service and great products at everyday low prices. Our store team members take the words legendary very serious. That means your visit will be the best at any given time in any one of our stores. Our team members are empowered to do whatever it takes to support our customers. Our mission to be legendary is not new to us though. Over my 24 years at Tractor Supply, we have had a dedication to be legendary. We have been on a journey to deliver on this promise to our customers for many years. Looking ahead, this is a significant step-up in our commitment to legendary customer service. We have strong foundational values and the culture, both in the field and at the store support center that puts the customer first in our decision-making. In 2019, we launched our Tractor Way operating model, which continuously optimizes the relationship between task time, customer time, enabling more time for service. Further, we continue to invest and deliver on our omnichannel roadmap to keep pace with our customers' demand for convenience and our store team members' ability to execute our new offerings, things like buy online, pick up at store, ship to store, and our drive-thrus. Today, above all things that we do, it's our team members that make a difference to our customers. When you have a horse, you love talking about your horse. When you weld, you love talking about welding and how to weld. That's why we hire our customers, they live the Out Here lifestyle and as team members can provide seasoned advice. We have a customer service approach called GURA. GURA is our way of life. It's our battle cry and it's how we drive our results. The G in GURA is for greeting. Every customer should be greeted with an open-ended greeting. The U is for uncover. Our team members ask the right questions to better understand exactly what the customer is looking for. For example, the age of your dog, how many acres are you going to be mowing. Once we know what the customer needs, we can move into the R for recommend. Recommend is where the power of the red vest comes in and our team member's seasoned advice makes a difference. Our customers trust us to give them the best product recommendation. A is for ask, this is where we offer to help the customer load up their purchase or take it to the register for them. And with our mobile POS units, we can ring up our customers anywhere in the store. Our team members know what we value and what we reward. We value people who make commitments and keep them. Our commitments matter and our promise to be legendary is more than just words in our mission and values. We have strategic programs like Hi5 and our Country Mile program that reward desired selling behaviors. Hi5 is all about uncovering and recommending. Our Country Mile program is all about recognition. Whether it's peer-to-peer, team-to-team or supervisor-to-team, this program is an opportunity for team members to recognize one another for going above and beyond in our commitment to the customer and to each other. Last year alone, we gave over 300,000 Country Mile badges. By rewarding what we value, we have further positioned ourselves as a relationship retailer. Let me give you an example about Jacob, our team member in our Jonesborough, Tennessee store. This is from Jacob's manager. I had a customer come to me this morning to let me know what a great team member we have in Jake. Last week, the customer went outside about 7:30 p.m. to find they had a brand-new baby goat. The mother was not allowing it to nurse, so they jumped in their vehicle and drove straight to our store. They barely made it before we closed, but they realized once they were there that they had forgotten their wallets at home. Jake said, \u201cThat's not a problem,\u201d and paid for everything the customer needed to save the baby goat. The customers came in this morning to pay Jake back and let him know that the baby had survived and was doing well. Jake was taken aback and said he had truly done it out of kindness of his heart. Jake, thank you for demonstrating what true kindness and community is all about. Our customers are special to us at Tractor Supply. I get thousands of positive letters from customers with great experiences inside our stores, just like that one. What our team members do inside our stores every day is making a difference. They love this lifestyle because they live it. Tractor Supply is already really good when it comes to the customer experience, but we are on a journey to being legendary. And being legendary means best in class. We hire for winning attitudes. We are enhancing our training for selling skills and product knowledge. The size of our box allows us to see the customer at any given time and get them out of the store as quick as they would like. We are moving all three of these metrics to be the best. Our Tractor Way operating model is the foundation and will continue to be. Our process efficiency mindset is what allows us to compete on key aspects, like team member knowledge and friendliness, without overinvesting in payroll. Through the Tractor Way, we unlock value for our customers through improved on-shelf availability and more efficient processes that created time for selling. Our field activity support teams are another example of applying the Tractor Way philosophy to remove task work from the stores and make that work more efficient for the teams that are doing it. Our FAST teams are doing an outstanding job and we have seen significant increases in completing tasks on time. By removing this highly variable work from the stores and giving it to the specialized team, we have again provided more time for our store team members to execute GURA. We have spent 2021 adjusting the Tractor Way operating model to reflect the needs of our higher-volume stores. We have also begun to further define roles and responsibilities and related metrics, including that of the sales team versus the operations team versus the FAST team. Expanding on these delineation of roles, we have optimized our scheduling to define when work should get done and what type of work is best done off hours, which allows us to sell during the power hours. We are also working on what other tasks we can take to eliminate, to repurpose, to make sure that we are selling and where an hour of labor investment is best spent. We will measure this operating model through metrics we know work, like GURA, implementing new traffic counters and measuring conversion to better optimize our scheduling capabilities and to identify and coach lost sales opportunities. This is full contact retail. And at Tractor Supply, we believe in belly-to-belly selling. We know that execution of GURA has a direct impact on our customers' experience, sales and our units per transaction. In fact, when all four steps of GURA are executed, we see an over 15% increase in that transaction. As such, to support our operating model changes, we will heavily focus on improving our training and ability to execute GURA. Our leadership team will champion this program through how we message, what we message and our actions always starting with the customer and the why behind what we are asking. We will begin the shift with the re-launch of GURA at our upcoming leaders meetings and annual sales meetings. Everyone in operations will be talking about the customer experience and GURA. There will be new GURA sales leader scorecards and improved visibility for our district managers. All our communications, meetings, celebrations will be centered around the customer experience and GURA. We will also train to drive confidence in executing GURA. Part of this training will focus on vendor-sponsored product training, selling skills training and product knowledge training. On our team members' first day, as we tractorize them, they will have enhanced GURA training to make sure we onboard them the right way. And we continue to invest in our district learning centers to make sure our management teams understand how to coach selling. Enable convenience is all about equipping our team members to sell both within the four walls of the store and beyond. Our single integrated team member mobile device is putting all the power and information in the hands of our team. We continue to expand on Theatro capabilities for driving sales and team member efficiency. Our team loves these communication devices, and we are already seeing efficiency and communication improve. We are getting to our customers faster than ever before. We are teaming up cross-functionally to bring the best tools to our team members and customers like things like Wayfinder, conversion metrics and to ask the expert. And we are building upon our current strategy to roll out greenhouses with drive-thrus. Alright. So, here is our game plan for growth and how we are going to lead with legendary service. Our team members provide a differentiated relationship-driven customer experience. Our customers trust our team members' seasoned advice and product recommendations. Our operating model will be used to create more customer time. We will continue to reduce task and move task work to off-peak hours. New and existing technology will be used to create even more convenience for our customers. Our team members are our number one strategic asset. They are the backbone of this company. We will drive productivity, be more efficient with tasking and service, leverage expenses, continue to invest in our FAST team and we are going to deliver on our commitment to provide legendary customer service to every Tractor Supply customer. We will be best-in-class on customer service. Yes. Hey, Scott. Good to see you, again. So I'm going to break it down in a couple different parts. So one is we hire our customers. So our team members love talking about everything that we have inside of our stores. So you brought up chick days, it's an event side of our store, where we have chick captains in there. They know the chicks. They work with the chicks when customers come in here, there is a good conversation that goes back and forth between that customer and that team member. The other things we do is stuff for our Greenworks, like we love theater inside of the side of the store. So some events we're doing this year, like try before you buy, we have an even a weekend where our team members are all going to be outside, and we're going to be test driving the Greenworks and using the blowers and using the weed whipper and different things and using our different power equipment materials. The other thing is we love to be able to have the community involvement. So we bring in things like 4-H, FFA. We do things like hot dogs outside. We've come in, our customers do donations for them, but we have it where they can talk to each other, do chicken swaps and different things out front. So we kind of break up into many different parts, but we look to be part of those individual communities. Yes. Thanks John for the question. So, our pet washes \u2013 so as soon as a customer uses the pet wash, they continue to come back and back and back. They love using the pet wash. They like to come back. We have pet washers where some stores will do over 100 a week in pet washes. So, the customer really likes it. They enjoy it, they love that feed and they like being able to take care of their pet. It doesn't have to always be a dog though. Sometimes it's something else. You asked about what they do after that. So, let's go into the store and the number one thing they buy is the collar. Because the first thing you do if you wash your pet is you want to get something new for the pet, so you will get a collar. They will also pick up some other while they can't get the rest of their shopping done. Out of the pet wellness clinics or the mobile clinics that come up to the front of our stores, we have lines out in front of our stores for these clinics. Customers use them. We advertise them out there, Christi and her team to get it out there. And then customers will come in, they will sign up and then they love getting their dogs taking care of out there. So, it's something our customers really like. They love the fact that we do it for them, they love the convenience about it."

Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal.\nHal Lawton : Thank you, Mary Winn. And thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. The Tractor Supply Team delivered strong results for the third quarter with net sales of 15.8%. Comparable store sales increase of 13.1% and diluted earnings per share of 20.4%. Team is doing an outstanding job navigating a very dynamic and challenging operating environment. We continue to benefit for many market trends that we see as very structurally sound. We have strengthened our customer base. We're gaining market share across our categories. We continue to advance our Life Out Here Strategy. Our business has never been stronger. And we see tremendous opportunities for growth ahead of us. As we've consistently shared with you over the last 18 months, our strong results are a testament to our 45,000+ team members and I'd like to thank them for all their efforts in the quarter. They kept each other safe as we went through another COVID-19 wave, and navigated through broad based supply chain disruptions, cost of goods increases, and navigated and manage through a tight labor market. Through it all, they've been resilient and persevere to deliver strong customer satisfaction scores, including all-time high [Indiscernible] scores. Our team members are our greatest strategic asset, and a key competitive differentiator with our customers.. Our loyal and highly engaged team members have helped us fare better than most as far as staffing across our stores and [Indiscernible]. Back in June, we raised our minimum opening wage to $11.25 per hour. Our recent wage actions bring our average hourly wage rate at our stores to nearly $15 per hour as we exit the year, with our DC at a higher rate. The investments we have made in store labor are being recognized by our customers, by the overall customer satisfaction scores that I just mentioned. I'd also like to say thank you to our vendors and supply chain partners, as we've worked together to overcome challenges in the global supply chain network and together we've been very focused on controlling what we can control to deliver these results. Across our network, we've been nimble and been able to navigate the unprecedented supply chain environment and macro issues, including inflationary pressures, and the team has done a great job addressing issues ranging from import container shortages in port delays, driver shortages, higher freight rates, and a multitude of other supply chain constraints. To mitigate these challenges, the team has leveraged dedicated container ship, pop-up [Indiscernible], expansion of mixing centers and direct-to-store shipment. Despite these challenges, our inventory is in good shape and our in-stock rates finished above last year at the end of the quarter. Our diversified vendor base with only about 12% direct import is a strong point of differentiation for us during these supply chain times. Given our scale and sophistication, we believe that our network is a competitive advantage to being the dependable supplier for the Out Here Lifestyle. Categories in which we participate, in the Out Here Lifestyle that we serve continue to have elevated consumer spending levels well above pre -COVID levels. We fully anticipate this environment we're in is going to continue for the foreseeable future. And consequently, we think that the sales growth that we've seen is structurally sound, given the changes in consumer behavior and the lifestyle investments that are now much more ingrained in the consumer psyche. Key structural trends that continue to work in our favor include things like rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omni -channel adoption, and a self-reliant lifestyle movement, including DIY trends and investments in hobbies like gardening, backyard poultry, and of course, pet ownership. For many workers, the return to office has been pushed out until next year. And even then, we'll very likely be in a hybrid environment at most employers. And at this point, our customers will have been great for over two years as [Indiscernible] we anticipate that their behaviors are much more sustainable and structural. Provide some color on our results. Let me share a few other highlights of the third quarter. Like the second quarter, every week had positive comps. Also, like the second quarter, our growth was broad-based across regions and product categories. Our e-commerce business continues to experience strong momentum with double-digit sales increases of over 40%, and in just under a year, our mobile app already has more than 2 million downloads and now represents over 10% of our e-commerce sales. We continue to gain share across all categories. This has been a consistent trend for multiple quarters now. And the share gain has been both online and in stores. The share gain has been aided by the increase in our unaided brand awareness, which has improved by 21% points since November of 2019. This improvement combined with positive trends in our overall customer satisfaction, are a significant contributor to the share gains we're experiencing. Also consistent from previous quarters, all customer segments were strong, with notable strength in our Core Farm and Ranch, which is the largest and most important of our customer base. At the same time, our digital ad campaign to target millennials supporting a significant growth we're seeing in this important demographic. We think the relevancy of Tractor Supply to millennial customers have staying power given the structural changes in the market and our customer behaviors and we're certainly seeing that consistently quarter-after-quarter in our data as our average age of customer trend down. For the year, more customers than ever have shopped at Tractor Supply. These customers are making more trips and are spending more money per trip and our new customer retention remains very strong. Our Neighbors Club loyalty program continues to exceed our expectations with year-over-year sales growth of these members north of 20% We exited the quarter with more than 22 million Neighbors Club members. These members are spending more than -- about 3 times the rate of non-members, with Neighbors Club members now accounting for nearly 70% of our sales. This continues to be a step-up from where we've been running prior to the re-launch of the program and sequential improvement over the second quarter of this year. The number of high-value per customers in the program grew almost 30% for the quarter and we continue to experience retention rate in excess of 95% for our high-value customers. These strong results demonstrate the changes to Neighbors Club continue to gain traction with our customers. Given our robust performance through the third quarter, along with our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again raising our sales and earnings guidance for 2021. And Kurt will share more details on our improved outlook later in the call. Regarding our pending acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home, we continue to work cooperatively with the FTC as it continues to review the proposed transaction. We look forward to the benefits this transaction will offer customers with improved product offering and competitive pricing. As has been the case over the last 18 months, I'm incredibly proud of the way our entire Tractor Supply team has managed to stay focused on taking care of each other and our customers. Our long-term opportunities remain very exciting. Our goal has been to emerge from the pandemic stronger. Over the course of the last year since rolling out our Life Out Here Strategy, we have gotten stronger through this pandemic, and we believe that we're going to emerge from it even stronger and better positioned as we execute our strategy. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Hal. And hello to everyone on the call. Once again, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business and our strategic initiatives. As Hal shared, we continue to believe the underlying health of our business is very strong. Third quarter comp store sales of 13.1% representing 39.9% 2-year stack were driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 9.5% and transaction count increase of 3.6% An example of the structural advantage we have is the ongoing strength in our consumable, usable, and edible products. Our C.U.E. products represent the strength of our core business and what drives trips to the store. Once again, C.U.E. outperformed the chain average comp sales and for the fifth consecutive quarter in a row, C.U.E. had comp sales growth at or above 15%. Key subcategories such as poultry, livestock feed, and dry dog food were among the strongest categories, with broad-based strength. Our big ticket categories, which we're going against significant growth in the prior year, continue to have solid comp store sales performance in line with the chain average. This was driven by strength in trailers, recreational and utility vehicles, safes, and zero-turn mowers. Inflation contributed about 700 basis points to comparable store sales. As you've heard from the retail sector and others, the cost environment remains elevated across imports, domestic freight, commodities, and labor wages. Our merchant team has been aggressively advocating for our customers. Where necessary, we are taking price increases to pass through some of the cost pressures that we cannot offset. our merchant and supply chain teams are currently navigating this challenging and disruptive environment extremely well. As we closely monitor our customers purchasing behaviors, we're focused on product unit trends and are committed to being priced right every day. Our third quarter gross margin rate was 36%, a decrease of 41 basis points versus last year. For comparison, our gross margin rate this quarter was still about a 100 basis points above our Q3 2019 rate of 35%. Year-over-year, the gross margin drivers were principally three items. First higher product cost inflation, second, elevated freight costs inclusive of domestic and import costs and third, a more normalized product mix shift in C.U.E. All of retail is working through the drivers of inflation and freight costs. The Tractor Supply team effectively offset a significant portion through our price management program. Additionally, we continue to see favorability in the frequency and depth of promotions. This is due to our commitment to our everyday low pricing strategy and a continued strong demand for our product categories. The benefit from vendor funding for the field activity support teams for our fast initiative, which was launched in the second half of last year, was consistent with our guidance. Our third quarter SG&A expense ratio including depreciation and amortization, improved by 58 basis points versus last year to 26.1%. This improvement as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to good leverage and occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in our comparable store sales. Along with lower COVID-19 pandemic response costs and decreased incentive compensation. Partially offsetting this leverage were higher wage rates, incremental store labor hours to ensure we are providing great customer service, and investments in our Life Out Here Strategy initiative. Given the elevated volumes and current operating environment, we also encourage select discrete costs such as incremental team member benefits, pop-up DCs, and the timing of our annual sales meeting, which normally occurs in the first quarter. The offset to our fast initiative benefit in gross margin was approximately 20 basis points of incremental SG&A expense for the labor costs for the team as we are now cycling the initial investment to launch the program last year. Much like our gross margin rate, our SG&A performance compares favorably to Q3 2019. We've had about 70 basis points favorable expense ratio since then. Operating profit increased about 18% with operating profit margin of nearly 10% in the quarter. Diluted EPS was $1.95, an increase of 20.4% from the third quarter of last year. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong. At the end of the quarter, our merchandise inventories were $2.2 billion, representing an 11.7% increase year-over-year in average inventory per store. The increase principally reflects growth to support the robust sales trends along with the impact of inflation. Moving now to our updated guidance for Fiscal 2021. We continue to operate in a time of heightened uncertainty regarding the pandemic. Despite this uncertainty, including product cost inflation, and supply chain constraints, we are raising our full-year outlook. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results for the first 3 quarters of the year and the positive and structural momentum we see in our business continuing into the fourth quarter. Against the backdrop of what we know today, we're forecasting Fiscal 2021 net sales centered around $12.6 billion with comparable store sales growth of about 16%. For the year we forecast an operating margin of 10.2% to 10.3%, a step-up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $8.40 to $8.50. This compares to our previous earnings range of $7.70 to $8 per diluted share. Within this updated guidance, we are forecasting comparable store sales growth for the fourth quarter of 8% to 10%. Two modeling points to keep in mind, the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance and as you start to roll forward your models for 2022, please keep in mind that next year, we'll have 53rd week for us. This week is typically a low volume week of sales, given that it follows the Christmas holidays. We have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business. And with that, we are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide a legendary customer experience across all channels. The strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a position of strength for Tractor Supply. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2021, we remain on track for anticipated share repurchases in a range of $750 to $800 million. This year will mark a milestone with approximately $1 billion returned to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends. In summary, our results proved yet again, Tractor Supply 's unique competitive advantages. Our relentless focus on being the dependable supplier for the out here lifestyle is embedded in our purpose as a Company. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hal.\nHal Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. Now, I'd like to share with you an update on our recent ESG announcement, as well as provide updates on our Fusion and Side Lot strategic initiatives which are key parts of our Life Out Here Strategy. At the time of urgency and action on climate change in social justice, we just announced new goals that are the next step in our long-standing commitment to sustainability, stewardship, and opportunity. By 2040, we're committing to achieve net zero carbon emissions across all our operations. As part of our social commitments, we are prioritizing and accelerating our initiatives and actions for diversity, equity, and inclusion. At Tractor Supply, we are focused on cultivating an environment of inclusion where diversity of all kinds is appreciated in value. I invite you to learn more on our dedicated ESG website. Turning next to our Life Out Here Strategy. As a reminder, we've been executing against five key strategic initiatives this year as part of our overall strategy. Those initiatives are Neighbors Club, Digital, FAST, Fusion, and Side Lot. The strategy and its initiatives are designed to capitalize on the attractive opportunities we see in our nearly $110 billion total addressable market. Our project Fusion and Side Lot model transformations represent significant investments in our stores. These store-level investments are designed to grow our market share and drive the productivity of both existing and new stores as part of our Life Out Here Strategy. So let's start with our Project Fusion, store remodel program. As a quick reminder, Project Fusion is state-of-the-art space productivity program designed to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base and give customers that may not have shopped with us in the past more reasons to shop. We anticipate having about 15% of our total store base in the new Fusion layout by year-end. We've reduced the time to complete Fusion remodels by 50% since the beginning of the year, and in turn allowing us to minimize the disruption to the store operations and our customers' shopping experience. Our customers are taking note of the improved layout, the ease of shopping, and our new product offerings. Specifically in our customer intercept's survey, they call out better organization, improved merchandise selection, cleaner and brighter aisles, and easier to navigate layout. Categories seeing the strongest lift in sales include areas like apparel, campaign in animal and power tools. Given the size of our store base, this is a multi-year opportunity to continually refresh our store base and further drive comp sales through productivity. Another significant component of our space productivity efforts is the transformation of our side lot. Again, as a reminder, typically there's as much space outside of our stores in the side lot as we have on the inside of our store. And the productivity of this space is substantially below the chain average. We're in the midst of a multiyear project to transform our side lot, with an expanded product offering and an enhanced shopping experience. With this investment, the side lot space has leveraged to offer a wider product offering in the lawn and garden categories. Enter new categories with a garden center and offer greater convenience through the expansion of our buy online pickup in store capabilities for drive-through pickup. In select locations that meet sales volume thresholds, we're also adding a feed room to help deliver the bag-feed demand. And as a reminder, we are the largest seller of bag feed in the country. We also continue to see a positive halo effect from the garden center to the existing store and vice versa. The addition of product categories, increased ease of shopping and new services [Indiscernible] us with even more ways to continue to keep our existing customers engaged with Tractor Supply and attract new customers also to the brand. Our ability to drive higher sales per square foot through the transformation of our Side Lot space remains a significant opportunity. We anticipate of having about a 150 side lots complete across the chain as we exit 2021. In these early remodels, we're learning a great deal about our customers' appetite for an expanded lawn and garden assortment. And we're even more excited than we were when we embarked on the initial test pilots late last year. As with our Fusion remodels, we continue to reduce the project timeline also here by about 50% and minimizing the disruption to our customers and store teams as we implement our findings from our test and learn process. While still early on, we are very positive about the continued refinement and learning. While implementing construction project to this scope and scale has been very challenging in the current macro-environment, we're making progress in our ability to significantly reduce construction costs, the construction time, and the corresponding disruption at the store site. While the majority of the remodels have been completed more recently, we are very pleased with the early read on sales lifts. Post the disruption period, we're seeing lifts of low single-digits for Fusion remodels and mid single-digits for combo stores, which had both Fusion and Side Lot remodels. We expect continued improvements in these results as the stores normalize and are forecasting year one lift as mid single-digits for Fusion and high single-digits for combo stores, which is on track for the expectations we had as we began these projects. Over the course of the last year, the team has done a great job operating the business at elevated levels, navigating unprecedented challenges and also executing our transformational initiatives to support our Life Out Here Strategy, and to wrap up our results clearly underscore that our strategies are working. That the team is navigating the challenges effectively. And that we're emerging from the pandemic stronger than before. We're extremely optimistic about our future as we enter one of the busiest periods in retail. My thanks and sincere appreciation go out to each of the more than 45,000 Tractor Supply Team members for their dedication and commitment to our mission and values. And with that operator, we would like to open the lines for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. Thank you. You may proceed.\nOliver Wintermantel: Good morning, guys. Hal, you mentioned a lot about the structural changes within the business. And my question is regarding gross margins. I think you said it's 100 basis points higher than before the pandemic in 2019. So I was wondering if you have early indications of what you think is in gross margin structural gains versus what you have to maybe give back when promotions come back on and maybe the COO decelerates from the very strong 40% to your COO. Thank you.\nHal Lawton : Hey Oliver, good morning, thanks for joining our call. On gross margins, we're -- we're very pleased both with our short term results, kind of this past quarter on gross margin, and also very optimistic about the long-term nature of our gross margins. On the short-term, we've had significant amount of cost coming through our business, whether that's in cost of goods as it relates to raw materials and commodity-based goods, also vendors passing along costs related to labor and freight. We've also seen freight cost increase as well as well as costs related to imports. The team's done an excellent job navigating those costs, finding offsets, productivity measures really being the advocate for the customer to keep prices as low as possible. That's it. As Kurt mentioned, we did have inflation of 2% to 7% in the quarter, which helped us offset alot of those costs and delivered the gross margin results that we did in the quarter which sequentially from a GAAP to last year improved from Q2. Long term, as we talked about on several of our call s, the question is really around promotional intensity and the clearance intensity in the business. And those two remain at the same levels that they have over the last 6 quarters: very low. We remain very focused on everyday low price. We remain very focused on delivering value every single day to our customers, and we see it playing out that way for the foreseeable future. We have no plans for significant promotional intensity in Q4. And we think this will remain in a very supply constrained environment as we move into the first half of next year. And that too will continue to limit any sort of promotional intensity to market. And a couple of years in now with minimal promotional intensity, I think that bodes well for being able to maintain a low promotional structure going forward. And so as I said, again, we're very pleased with our short-term gross margin results and also very optimistic about the structural nature of our long-term gross margin.\nOliver Wintermantel: Thanks very much. Good luck.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Wintermantel. The next question is from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. You may proceed.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks very much. So based on all of those comments that you just provided Hal, the question would be on obviously the longer-term algorithm and we haven't had an update on that for a little bit but we're clearly trending well above that. So wondering if you could maybe just give a little color in how you think about long-term operating margin algorithm more broadly versus the prior 9 to 9.5, because that just obviously isn't really realistic, those lines.\nHal Lawton : Hey [Indiscernible] and good morning and thanks for joining the call. We see significant growth opportunities ahead in our business which we talked about several times, $110 billion total addressable market. Super excited about our Life Out Here Strategy in a runway ahead there. And we're investing in that strategy to ensure we capture, sustainable market share. Absolute -- to your point acknowledge that absent the write-down on Petsense that we did a t 10.1% off profit in 2020 and our guidance for 2021 here at 102 to103 that both of those exceed our long-term targets. We certainly don't want to get ahead of ourselves here in the third quarter. What we commented on is that, we're in the midst of our annual planning for 2022. It's -- at the same time, we're also just always looking at our long-term targets and it's very natural for us to be reviewing that over the next few months. And so, when we have more news on that, we'll certainly let folks know. But again, I think we're in a period where there's a significant amount of opportunity ahead, and we're very pleased with the results we put up this quarter, the outlook we have for the balance of the year, and also excited about the long-term opportunity that we still see out there in our $110 billion market as we are gaining significant share in it and the team is just executing on all cylinders right now.\nKaren Short: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. You may proceed.\nBrian Nagel: Good morning. Congrats on another great quarter. I think my question maybe a bit repetitive here sort of prior to, but the question I have is and Hal you mentioned the structural lot in your prepared comments from the demand side. Clearly, demand of tractor now over the last several quarters has been outstanding. You're still just very odd, presenting unique dynamic within the overall consumer environment. What -- I want to -- I guess the question I have is, what are you seeing in the business, how your consumers are performing that gives you greater confidence there was a structural shift in demand trends that will persist once the COVID crisis is completely behind us?\nKurt Barton: Hey, Brian. I'd point to 3 things in our business. First off, I'll talk about broad macro trends, second thing I'll talk about is the consistency of our business, and the third I'll talk about is share gains. In the broad macro trends, all the trends that we saw in Q2 of last year really have all sustained themselves, and I think there's certain retailers and other businesses that saw the benefit as it relates to COVID behavior early to mid last year and that waned. And I think that's not been the case for us, whether it's things like rural revitalization, which is a bit more of a permanence in if people move and whether it's things like pet ownership and adoption, again, permanent more so in nature. Whether it's homesteading and just kind of the self-reliance mentality, we're seeing this as more permanent behaviors and really no matter what dataset you look at, whether it's home purchases, whether it's mobility, whether it's pet ownership, any sort of qualitative data on where people are spending their money, they all reinforce the structural nature of those trends. The second thing I'd point to is the consistency, as I mentioned. Our business has been remarkably consistent. Month to month, week to week, by category, and by region. And that's been regardless of whether or not we've been in COVID surges or whether or not certain states have been more in lock down or less in lock down. And that I think just again speaks to the structural orientation. And lastly, we're gaining significant share really in almost every category in our business. And we're seeing that share gain in our core customers who have long shopped us and as they come to us now with a confidence that we're in stock with the right level of customer service and at the right price, and then also new customers who are finding the lifestyle that we serve to be what they're seeking in this time. And we're gaining share really across the board on all of our categories in that context. I'd point to those -- to those three things that give us real confidence in the structural orientation of our business. I think it's -- there's a set of COVID winners that were early on and have seen some of that wane. And then there's another set that are seeing it much more structural and sustained. And I very much put it at the top of that second camp.\nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. I appreciate it and congrats again. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Peter Keith with Piper and Sandler -- Piper Sandler and Co. You may proceed.\nPeter Keith: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Great results, everyone. Looking forward to the next couple of months with the winter here, looks like we're going to be seeing record energy prices, home heating costs. And I'm just thinking back to 10, 12 years ago with some of the heating exposure you guys have, there sometimes can be a nice benefit for Tractor. So I guess the question is on a net basis, how do you feel about this elevated heating costs that we're going to see this winter? Is it a net positive or conversely maybe elevating costs for your core consumer?\nSeth Estep: Hey Peter, this is Seth. Thanks for joining the call. Hey, when we look ahead over the next couple of months, just a little bit more broadly, other than just outside of energy costs as well, we're really excited about the opportunity that lies ahead based off a lot of the macro benefits that Hal just discussed and I'd love to just highlight a couple of things that we look to see to drive our business over this holiday season and then to maximize and capitalize on that opportunity. When we think about that, and we're really excited about how the team and the merchandising team continues to execute on our portfolio strategy, leveraging the Fast team. We're doing record number of resets throughout the year, not just call it preholiday, but continuing that reset and the new [Indiscernible] activity as we go through the quarter. And for holidays specifically, over the next couple of months, we're really excited about the momentum we're seeing in some of these new customer trends, as well as our core customers that are coming to us for categories more broadly than maybe they have in the past. Things like apparel and footwear. And we're seeing expansions like in key brands that consumers are really resonating with, with brands like Columbia and Harriet, Carhartt, even our own brand like Ridgecut, where we're expanding into the women's lineup where that shopper's now coming to us where they weren't in the past, where we can continue to drive market share in those categories. We're also seeing with that rural revitalization, consumers coming to us for outdoor activities, even here in the fall. So things like patio heaters, grills, even Wildlife and UTV s driving a demand, we're still seeing strength across the board there and then we're going to continue to focus on our C.U.E. activity where customers are coming to us for footsteps. So, with a record number of pet adoptions over the last few years, we continue to be extremely excited about the momentum that we have at our pet business holistically as well as the C.U.E. business, and we're going to be looking to drive that throughout the whole holiday season. It's a little broader than just the energy market question here as well, but also where we see it as we're coming through, we're seeing activity across our consumer base to be very consistent with what we've seen over the last few quarters. And they are really resonating with the new items, the new categories, as well as the new partnerships that we're continuing to establish.\nPeter Keith: Thank you very much, Seth.\nOperator: The next question is from Kate McShane with Golden -- Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nKate Mc Shane: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to go back to inflation for one minute. I wondered if you could talk to us about how much inflation you are expecting for the fourth quarter. And when it comes to the pricing actions that you took, was it across most of the store or in certain categories? And when do you expect or what has been the reaction from an elasticity standpoint?\nKurt Barton: [Indiscernible], hey. This is Kurt. Good morning and good morning to everybody. On the inflation side of it, as Hal mentioned on the top side, there was 700 basis points of inflation benefit on the business. We saw at that or slightly higher cost pressures in Q3, as we look ahead to Q4, we exited Q3 and into Q4 with continued levels of inflation moderating at the levels compared to like what we saw coming out of Q2 into Q3. But there continues to be some levels of inflation that's factored into our guidance. In regards to how we handle that, it really is more of a portfolio approach. We take a look at where those costs are contributing, both in transportation product costs and we look at our portfolio. Seth, and the merchant team manages the shopping patterns from the customers, as well as making sure that in key traffic driving areas, we've got great everyday low pricing. So we leverage our pricing tools really well and make sure that from the portfolio standpoint that we can balance from a retail side, as well as what we can do to leverage the strength of our mature supply chain to keep cost s as low as possible. And again, our team has just managed through this great and we are forecasting our guidance for Q4 expecting that they're able to manage that in a similar pattern.\nKate Mc Shane: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS, you may proceed.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning, thanks all for taking my question. Kurt, can you just clarify what you intended to say with the response to that last question in terms of the inflation contribution moderated relative to the 700 basis points, or the inflation contribution that you're expecting 4Q moderated relative to the 350 to 400 basis points, and hopefully I -- that wasn't my question but it was just a little confusing how that was answered. My question really is, moving forward, do you still need a 3% comp or so to leverage your expenses? In your prepared remarks, you noted that SG&A has leveraged 70 basis points relative to 2019. And given the sheer magnitude of the volume increase your stores have had, there would be some opportunity to right-size or manage your cost structures that you might be able to lever on a more moderate COO moving forward. Thank you.\nKurt Barton: Michael, I'll hit the two questions. In response to clarification on Kate's question, for Q4 the inflation pressures on the business will be fairly similar to what we described and saw on Q3: flattish to potentially slightly up in regards to Q4. In regards to our leverage point, where we're at right now with the business, the elevated levels of revenue growth, as well as our focus on our investments really makes the whole algorithm different than just saying is it a 3% comp that you leverage on. And to your point, right now, we're seeing really strong momentum in the business, and that does elevate our ability to leverage on the cost. But we're also using that to the point that Hal made and that I made in our prepared remarks that we definitely see this as a tremendous opportunity, we're investing from a position of strength, so our continued outlook of managing SG&A to flattish over time will still be our outlook in the way we are managing this business. Great opportunity to just continue to gain market share and drive traffic into the stores.\nMichael Lasser : Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Chris Horvers with JP Morgan. You may proceed.\nMary Winn Pilkington : Operator, we can just move on to the next question if Chris is out.\nChris Horvers: Hello.\nMary Winn Pilkington : Hey, there you are.\nChris Horvers: Thank you, Mary Winn.\nMary Winn Pilkington : Thanks.\nChris Horvers: Seth, with your commentary around 4Q, obviously, softline slot Asian sourcing, I'm guessing the heating business and OPE, soit sounds like you're feeling good from an in-stock level there, is that accurate? And then how are you thinking about next spring? At this point you're probably making orders for that. So will you be ordering enough for next spring?\nSeth Estep: Hey, Chris. Yes. So we always say we're not -- we always want more, but we are satisfied with where we are right now. As we've managed through the supply chain with both our supplier partners and our supply chain team and merchants to get the products where we are, we feel really good where we are heading into the holiday season as products flowing in. As we've managed through this throughout the course of the whole year, you're spot on. We've looked at every piece of our process, we're giving earlier forecast for our key supplier partners, we're working with our overseas factories to give commitments In our earlier lead time, than we have historically so that we can properly plan within, plan through the supply chain, look for alternative ways to source product or need be to make sure that we can have product hit shelf and we're taking it, we'll be able to take it when we can get it even earlier than we have in the past as well. So that we can be locked and loaded and ready for the spring business. Really feel good about the planning that's going on across the team, and across with our supplier base to make sure that we can continue to navigate this supply -- global supply chain challenge that has been out there.\nChris Horvers: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Thank you, you may proceed.\nPeter Benedict : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess back under the expense stuff, the investments you guys are making, obviously Capex has been up, so I'm curious just on D&A and how we're thinking about that, Kurt, for this year. And then next year we've seen this year is probably up 25% year-over-year, maybe it's $270 million of D&A. How do we think about that as you kind of pencil through 2022? Should we see a similar growth rate or -- how should we think about that? That's my question. Thank you.\nKurt Barton: Yeah, sure, Peter. So for this year, the depreciation growth year-over-year, throughout the quarters, mid-to-high 20% growth rate is very much in line with our expectations. The investments we've made this year, the incremental ones principally with the new distribution center build, as well as the Fusion Side Lot remodel has us right where we expected to be on depreciation. And for 2022 at this point with our plan, we would expect very much similar in the low 20% growth rate, likely and that's very much what we framed out when we launched the Life Out Here Strategy.\nPeter Benedict : Okay, got you. Thanks so much, Kurt.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Simon Gutman with Morgan Stanley, you may proceed.\nSimeon Gutman : Hey everyone. Good morning. Can I -- Hal and Kurt. Maybe I will take another stab at the longer-term margin question. I think the math would suggest that your business could be running above that level. The question is, philosophically, do you let it run above that level? And Hal, in that regard, are there things along the Out Here Strategy that you can accelerate, are there price investments that you would think about? Are there any other re-investments that the layer -- second or third layers of the plan where you could lean in and just say, hey, we don't want to run the business at a higher margin so that we can keep building on the growth [Indiscernible] think about that.\nHal Lawton : Hey, Gutman. Good to talk to you this morning and thanks for joining us. You had said -- first off, we see sizable opportunity ahead in our market. For those who followed us for a long period of time, it's a very attractive market. One, it's very fragmented. One, where we're very well-positioned with our scale and size and relationships that we have and investments we've made historically. We think that there are significant further opportunity as we look out. We continue to grow in an out-sized way and take share. And we're committed to going after that share, continuing to grow. That said, would acknowledge 2 straight years of performance above 10% off margin. It's above our long-term guidance. And as we go through our 2022 annual planning process, we'll be -- that will help us really think through our long-term guidance and the relevance of that as we look forward. For right now, it is our long-term guidance. What I would say is, as it relates to investments, we're very bullish on our investments, we're very focused on excellent capital allocation, we're seeing the results of our investments in the business. As we shared today, the Fusion stores and the Side Lot stores are performing very well. As they mature and begin to normalize, we're seeing the results right in line with what our expected business model and business plan for them were. That's it. Also our business is much -- continues to grow at an outsized rate and that gives us an opportunity to leverage and scale on our business in a way that we didn't fully anticipate last year at this time. And I think as we see how that continues to evolve into early next year, you can expect to hear more from us on that. But again, we remain very bullish on our opportunity, very pleased with our business, it's never been stronger, and we're excited about both the short-term and long-term potential inside of it.\nSimeon Gutman : Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nZach Fadem : Hey, good morning. Kurt, another expense question. As you're lapping a year of elevating COVID costs, incentive COO, and strategic spend -- so first of all, can you talk through the lingering impact of some of these items? And then as we look to 22, you mentioned an uptick in strategic spend. Is there any detail you can provide there? And then separately on the 20% D& A growth, is that with or without Orscheln?\nKurt Barton: Zach, this is Kurt and a number of things in there. Let me just try to package that in this. One, I'll hit the last one first. Orscheln is not considered in any of the numbers of the guidance that we've given in regards to the depreciation expense structure. So COVID expenses have been elevated from the level that we entered the year into, just because the pandemic with the Delta variant and others have lingered. They're at lower levels than we saw in comparable quarters last year but we continue to emphasize having a safe and clean environment for our customers and our team members. The incentive comp with the outperformance this year, while at lower levels than last year, continued to be above target. And so we should think about going forward those are items for us as in future years, those are leveraged points. And if, like in this year, while there's incentive comp above target, the performance gives leverage above and beyond the level that we're paying an incentive comp. So it's net an overall leverage this year, and next year those will be favorable items to compare again. The depreciation expense, as I mentioned earlier, the growth rate that I quoted and referring to is very much in line with what we expected in our long-range plan when we launched the Life Out Here Strategy and talked about a 3 year to 5 year plan. And so with the elevated sales, I mean, we feel very comfortable with a 20% growth rate in depreciation because that's where those investments are at, does not include Orscheln, and again, we're very comfortable with the management we've got and what we have visibility on our expenses for the fourth quarter and even the near term beyond that.\nZach Fadem : Got it.Thanks, Kurt, what about the strategic side?\nKurt Barton: The strategic initiative that we've had -- we haven't really specifically mentioned any increased spend on strategic initiatives outside of what we had planned in the Life Out Here Strategy on technology, digital that we had this year and we'll continue to execute the plan. So maybe just clarify what you're referring there.\nZach Fadem : You mentioned you were going to continue to invest in 2022 so I was just curious if there was an uptick in strategic spend that we should anticipate.\nKurt Barton: Got you, Zach. No, it's very much in line with what we said that our capital expenditures over the next few years. We anticipate those still to be in that 450 to 550 some years, could be higher because of launching of distribution centers. But the level investment in the businesses is consistent with what we expect.\nZach Fadem : Got it. Appreciate the time today.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush you may proceed.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is just a clarification around the trends you're seeing in terms of the comp lift following the Fusion and Side Lot roll out. I think you said you're seeing low single-digit for Fusion, mid single-digit for combo stores and stores that have been completed. But your plan is for a full first year list of mid single-digits for Fusion and high single-digits for combos? Is that correct?\nKurt Barton: Hey, good morning. And yes, that is what we said in our prepared remarks and it is accurate. The add that I'd make to that is just as is typical with a store remodel,\nHal Lawton : There's a little bit of disruption. There's disruption that happens during the remodel. Particularly with the current supply chain environment, there's a little disruption that's occurring still even after the remodel as some fixtures and other types of things come in some months a little late. That -- and then we start to see the lift happen as customers getting used to shopping, the new layout and find the new categories and the new brands and the new remodel. What we're seeing is what we would expect, which is every week, every month that goes by post kind of the re-grand opening of the remodel that the performance of the store continues to improve. And that's the case of both combo stores and the Fusion remodel. The other that I would make to that is as it relates to the Side Lot with the Garden Center. We have a couple of stores that went through year 2 of spring. We saw outsized gains in those which is in line again with our expectation that we would see more of a maturity curve with the Garden Center than we would with the inside of the store Fusion remodel. We think that and we expect and what we're seeing in the Fusion remodel, it's more of an immediate impact with the maturity curve being more of 3, 4, 5, 6 months maturity curve, whereas for the Garden Center, we're seeing a nice, strong immediate impact, but then we're also seeing 12, 18 months continuation of that maturity curve. But yeah, the results are very much in line, nice positive lift already, even a few months into each of the remodels. And then we see even continued lift as we complete year 1 of those remodels, whether it's Fusion or the combo.\nSeth Basham: That's helpful. Just a point for clarification. When do you start measuring lift post disruption? How many months after the completion does disruption period end?\nHal Lawton : Yeah, we start measuring lift the day of the re-grand opening. So not to get too tactical, but there's a sign off that the store manager and the project manager and the construction manager do that on the day that sign off, that's when the project is complete. The re-grand opening happens reasonably quickly after that, 1 week, 2 weeks kind of thing, and then we start measuring the lift from that re-grand opening date.\nSeth Basham: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. You may proceed.\nChuck Grom : Okay. Thank you. Good morning. Great quarter [Indiscernible] let me look at the Side Lot initiative. I'm curious to what's been the biggest areas of upside surprise for you guys or said differently. What have you learned in the class of 21 Side Lot? So, you would look to apply to future, store efforts and then any sense for where you think the productivity longer-term could be relative to your in-store productivity?\nHal Lawton : Hey, Chuck and thanks for joining the call today. I'll hit kind of three things on Side Lot and then I'll just briefly touch base on Fusion productivity. On the Side Lot, the 3 things I'll talk about is the Garden Center, I'll talk about BOPIS, and then I'll talk about our feed rooms. So first on the Garden Center. Our customers key data set is that the categories that we least address from a destination perspective, that they most engage in is live goods and garden. And so that's really what the Garden Center strategy is all about, is creating another C.U.E. destination category in our business. And -- but we're seeing that in our results. I'd say we're more excited now about the prospects for adding to our fleet the Garden sooner than we were even this time last year. And the -- just tax and the behavior we're seeing our customers exactly what you expect. It's a little less around beautification, like what you might see in a more of a home improvement store, in terms of the core product, and much more about fruits and vegetables and shrubs and trees. All those sorts of things that really speak to Life Out Here, whether it's the gardening you do in your backyard or whether it's the shrubs and the tree you're planning along your fence line and in -- along -- in your land. And we have significant convenience benefit -- kind of advantages for our customers from a location perspective. So the Garden Center s are performing very well and we're just getting started both on the build-out of those, obviously, but also with our relationships with our live goods vendors and the assortments, tailoring it by store. The second thing is on BOPIS drive-thru. We're seeing incredibly high levels of drive-thru behavior from our customers. And we're seeing in -- some of our stores that have been open for 4, 5, 6, 8 months now, we're seeing 50%, 60%, 75%. the bio line pickup in store being drive-through and just that extra convenience factor you're seeing with customers. And then that's driving repeat behavior. And so really pleased with how that's evolving and the behavior we're seeing from our customers is consistent with what the feature was when we rolled it out. And then lastly is the feed room. We are the largest seller of bag feed in the country. And if you think about our average store volumes and the growth we've seen in those store volumes combined with the outsized performance in Q, that's put a lot of stress on our stores as it relates to the receipt of bad good s, getting it out onto the store, staying in stock for our customers, and then being able to get that onto customers' trucks and out the -- towards -- get them on their way. And the feed rooms have provided valuable capacity and also allowed us to effectively, from a cost perspective, serve the customer. We're not touching the bags 2, 3, 4 times. We're able to leverage our mixing centers in a way that they're designed now. And so all 3 of those things are really coming together, we're seeing excellent performance across all 3 exactly as we designed them and built them and we're continuing to use our test and learn to tweak it along the way. As you think about our productivity, as we move forward, we're still committed to our comps outpacing overall retail and outpacing the Life Out Here market that we define as that a $110 billion market. And so you can expect continued productivity improvements on our same-store sales in an outsized way as we move forward. We even in spite of 6 consecutive quarters now with double-digit comps, we still have that expectations moving forward. One other thing, while I've got the mike here so to speak. I'd like to just step back and reference there's a bit about our long-term op margin leverage as Kurt was talking about. What I'd say is if you look at our long-term guidance through there are several questions on this topic. Our long-term guidance that we announced last year had 6% to 7% sales growth and 8% to 10% earnings per diluted share, which implies continued leverage on the business as we move forward. And we're not in a state of normalcy right now, obviously with our comps being the sixth consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, but what I would say, the spirit of the continued leverage, you are seeing in our results. And that is the expectation we have of our business, whether we're seeing outsize costs for labor and outsize cost from freight and cost of goods or whether that's in a more normal environment. And so we're holding ourselves accountable to executing in that way, regardless of the environment that we're in. And just wanted to clarify that. I think Kurt 's point around 3% comp and whether that's a point of leverage is still accurate in a normal environment, but we still, even in a kind of \"non -normal environment\" still accept that same challenge.\nMary Winn Pilkington : All right. Thanks, Hal and Operator, that will conclude our call today. I really appreciate everybody's cooperation that allowed us to get through a lot more questions, so thank you all. Looking forward to speaking to you in January on our fourth quarter earnings call and Maryanne and I will be around this afternoon for any questions, so thank you all for your cooperation. Have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn. And thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. The Tractor Supply Team delivered strong results for the third quarter with net sales of 15.8%. Comparable store sales increase of 13.1% and diluted earnings per share of 20.4%. Team is doing an outstanding job navigating a very dynamic and challenging operating environment. We continue to benefit for many market trends that we see as very structurally sound. We have strengthened our customer base. We're gaining market share across our categories. We continue to advance our Life Out Here Strategy. Our business has never been stronger. And we see tremendous opportunities for growth ahead of us. As we've consistently shared with you over the last 18 months, our strong results are a testament to our 45,000+ team members and I'd like to thank them for all their efforts in the quarter. They kept each other safe as we went through another COVID-19 wave, and navigated through broad based supply chain disruptions, cost of goods increases, and navigated and manage through a tight labor market. Through it all, they've been resilient and persevere to deliver strong customer satisfaction scores, including all-time high [Indiscernible] scores. Our team members are our greatest strategic asset, and a key competitive differentiator with our customers.. Our loyal and highly engaged team members have helped us fare better than most as far as staffing across our stores and [Indiscernible]. Back in June, we raised our minimum opening wage to $11.25 per hour. Our recent wage actions bring our average hourly wage rate at our stores to nearly $15 per hour as we exit the year, with our DC at a higher rate. The investments we have made in store labor are being recognized by our customers, by the overall customer satisfaction scores that I just mentioned. I'd also like to say thank you to our vendors and supply chain partners, as we've worked together to overcome challenges in the global supply chain network and together we've been very focused on controlling what we can control to deliver these results. Across our network, we've been nimble and been able to navigate the unprecedented supply chain environment and macro issues, including inflationary pressures, and the team has done a great job addressing issues ranging from import container shortages in port delays, driver shortages, higher freight rates, and a multitude of other supply chain constraints. To mitigate these challenges, the team has leveraged dedicated container ship, pop-up [Indiscernible], expansion of mixing centers and direct-to-store shipment. Despite these challenges, our inventory is in good shape and our in-stock rates finished above last year at the end of the quarter. Our diversified vendor base with only about 12% direct import is a strong point of differentiation for us during these supply chain times. Given our scale and sophistication, we believe that our network is a competitive advantage to being the dependable supplier for the Out Here Lifestyle. Categories in which we participate, in the Out Here Lifestyle that we serve continue to have elevated consumer spending levels well above pre -COVID levels. We fully anticipate this environment we're in is going to continue for the foreseeable future. And consequently, we think that the sales growth that we've seen is structurally sound, given the changes in consumer behavior and the lifestyle investments that are now much more ingrained in the consumer psyche. Key structural trends that continue to work in our favor include things like rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omni -channel adoption, and a self-reliant lifestyle movement, including DIY trends and investments in hobbies like gardening, backyard poultry, and of course, pet ownership. For many workers, the return to office has been pushed out until next year. And even then, we'll very likely be in a hybrid environment at most employers. And at this point, our customers will have been great for over two years as [Indiscernible] we anticipate that their behaviors are much more sustainable and structural. Provide some color on our results. Let me share a few other highlights of the third quarter. Like the second quarter, every week had positive comps. Also, like the second quarter, our growth was broad-based across regions and product categories. Our e-commerce business continues to experience strong momentum with double-digit sales increases of over 40%, and in just under a year, our mobile app already has more than 2 million downloads and now represents over 10% of our e-commerce sales. We continue to gain share across all categories. This has been a consistent trend for multiple quarters now. And the share gain has been both online and in stores. The share gain has been aided by the increase in our unaided brand awareness, which has improved by 21% points since November of 2019. This improvement combined with positive trends in our overall customer satisfaction, are a significant contributor to the share gains we're experiencing. Also consistent from previous quarters, all customer segments were strong, with notable strength in our Core Farm and Ranch, which is the largest and most important of our customer base. At the same time, our digital ad campaign to target millennials supporting a significant growth we're seeing in this important demographic. We think the relevancy of Tractor Supply to millennial customers have staying power given the structural changes in the market and our customer behaviors and we're certainly seeing that consistently quarter-after-quarter in our data as our average age of customer trend down. For the year, more customers than ever have shopped at Tractor Supply. These customers are making more trips and are spending more money per trip and our new customer retention remains very strong. Our Neighbors Club loyalty program continues to exceed our expectations with year-over-year sales growth of these members north of 20% We exited the quarter with more than 22 million Neighbors Club members. These members are spending more than -- about 3 times the rate of non-members, with Neighbors Club members now accounting for nearly 70% of our sales. This continues to be a step-up from where we've been running prior to the re-launch of the program and sequential improvement over the second quarter of this year. The number of high-value per customers in the program grew almost 30% for the quarter and we continue to experience retention rate in excess of 95% for our high-value customers. These strong results demonstrate the changes to Neighbors Club continue to gain traction with our customers. Given our robust performance through the third quarter, along with our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again raising our sales and earnings guidance for 2021. And Kurt will share more details on our improved outlook later in the call. Regarding our pending acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home, we continue to work cooperatively with the FTC as it continues to review the proposed transaction. We look forward to the benefits this transaction will offer customers with improved product offering and competitive pricing. As has been the case over the last 18 months, I'm incredibly proud of the way our entire Tractor Supply team has managed to stay focused on taking care of each other and our customers. Our long-term opportunities remain very exciting. Our goal has been to emerge from the pandemic stronger. Over the course of the last year since rolling out our Life Out Here Strategy, we have gotten stronger through this pandemic, and we believe that we're going to emerge from it even stronger and better positioned as we execute our strategy. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt. Thanks, Kurt. Now, I'd like to share with you an update on our recent ESG announcement, as well as provide updates on our Fusion and Side Lot strategic initiatives which are key parts of our Life Out Here Strategy. At the time of urgency and action on climate change in social justice, we just announced new goals that are the next step in our long-standing commitment to sustainability, stewardship, and opportunity. By 2040, we're committing to achieve net zero carbon emissions across all our operations. As part of our social commitments, we are prioritizing and accelerating our initiatives and actions for diversity, equity, and inclusion. At Tractor Supply, we are focused on cultivating an environment of inclusion where diversity of all kinds is appreciated in value. I invite you to learn more on our dedicated ESG website. Turning next to our Life Out Here Strategy. As a reminder, we've been executing against five key strategic initiatives this year as part of our overall strategy. Those initiatives are Neighbors Club, Digital, FAST, Fusion, and Side Lot. The strategy and its initiatives are designed to capitalize on the attractive opportunities we see in our nearly $110 billion total addressable market. Our project Fusion and Side Lot model transformations represent significant investments in our stores. These store-level investments are designed to grow our market share and drive the productivity of both existing and new stores as part of our Life Out Here Strategy. So let's start with our Project Fusion, store remodel program. As a quick reminder, Project Fusion is state-of-the-art space productivity program designed to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base and give customers that may not have shopped with us in the past more reasons to shop. We anticipate having about 15% of our total store base in the new Fusion layout by year-end. We've reduced the time to complete Fusion remodels by 50% since the beginning of the year, and in turn allowing us to minimize the disruption to the store operations and our customers' shopping experience. Our customers are taking note of the improved layout, the ease of shopping, and our new product offerings. Specifically in our customer intercept's survey, they call out better organization, improved merchandise selection, cleaner and brighter aisles, and easier to navigate layout. Categories seeing the strongest lift in sales include areas like apparel, campaign in animal and power tools. Given the size of our store base, this is a multi-year opportunity to continually refresh our store base and further drive comp sales through productivity. Another significant component of our space productivity efforts is the transformation of our side lot. Again, as a reminder, typically there's as much space outside of our stores in the side lot as we have on the inside of our store. And the productivity of this space is substantially below the chain average. We're in the midst of a multiyear project to transform our side lot, with an expanded product offering and an enhanced shopping experience. With this investment, the side lot space has leveraged to offer a wider product offering in the lawn and garden categories. Enter new categories with a garden center and offer greater convenience through the expansion of our buy online pickup in store capabilities for drive-through pickup. In select locations that meet sales volume thresholds, we're also adding a feed room to help deliver the bag-feed demand. And as a reminder, we are the largest seller of bag feed in the country. We also continue to see a positive halo effect from the garden center to the existing store and vice versa. The addition of product categories, increased ease of shopping and new services [Indiscernible] us with even more ways to continue to keep our existing customers engaged with Tractor Supply and attract new customers also to the brand. Our ability to drive higher sales per square foot through the transformation of our Side Lot space remains a significant opportunity. We anticipate of having about a 150 side lots complete across the chain as we exit 2021. In these early remodels, we're learning a great deal about our customers' appetite for an expanded lawn and garden assortment. And we're even more excited than we were when we embarked on the initial test pilots late last year. As with our Fusion remodels, we continue to reduce the project timeline also here by about 50% and minimizing the disruption to our customers and store teams as we implement our findings from our test and learn process. While still early on, we are very positive about the continued refinement and learning. While implementing construction project to this scope and scale has been very challenging in the current macro-environment, we're making progress in our ability to significantly reduce construction costs, the construction time, and the corresponding disruption at the store site. While the majority of the remodels have been completed more recently, we are very pleased with the early read on sales lifts. Post the disruption period, we're seeing lifts of low single-digits for Fusion remodels and mid single-digits for combo stores, which had both Fusion and Side Lot remodels. We expect continued improvements in these results as the stores normalize and are forecasting year one lift as mid single-digits for Fusion and high single-digits for combo stores, which is on track for the expectations we had as we began these projects. Over the course of the last year, the team has done a great job operating the business at elevated levels, navigating unprecedented challenges and also executing our transformational initiatives to support our Life Out Here Strategy, and to wrap up our results clearly underscore that our strategies are working. That the team is navigating the challenges effectively. And that we're emerging from the pandemic stronger than before. We're extremely optimistic about our future as we enter one of the busiest periods in retail. My thanks and sincere appreciation go out to each of the more than 45,000 Tractor Supply Team members for their dedication and commitment to our mission and values. And with that operator, we would like to open the lines for questions. Hey Oliver, good morning, thanks for joining our call. On gross margins, we're -- we're very pleased both with our short term results, kind of this past quarter on gross margin, and also very optimistic about the long-term nature of our gross margins. On the short-term, we've had significant amount of cost coming through our business, whether that's in cost of goods as it relates to raw materials and commodity-based goods, also vendors passing along costs related to labor and freight. We've also seen freight cost increase as well as well as costs related to imports. The team's done an excellent job navigating those costs, finding offsets, productivity measures really being the advocate for the customer to keep prices as low as possible. That's it. As Kurt mentioned, we did have inflation of 2% to 7% in the quarter, which helped us offset alot of those costs and delivered the gross margin results that we did in the quarter which sequentially from a GAAP to last year improved from Q2. Long term, as we talked about on several of our call s, the question is really around promotional intensity and the clearance intensity in the business. And those two remain at the same levels that they have over the last 6 quarters: very low. We remain very focused on everyday low price. We remain very focused on delivering value every single day to our customers, and we see it playing out that way for the foreseeable future. We have no plans for significant promotional intensity in Q4. And we think this will remain in a very supply constrained environment as we move into the first half of next year. And that too will continue to limit any sort of promotional intensity to market. And a couple of years in now with minimal promotional intensity, I think that bodes well for being able to maintain a low promotional structure going forward. And so as I said, again, we're very pleased with our short-term gross margin results and also very optimistic about the structural nature of our long-term gross margin. Hey [Indiscernible] and good morning and thanks for joining the call. We see significant growth opportunities ahead in our business which we talked about several times, $110 billion total addressable market. Super excited about our Life Out Here Strategy in a runway ahead there. And we're investing in that strategy to ensure we capture, sustainable market share. Absolute -- to your point acknowledge that absent the write-down on Petsense that we did a t 10.1% off profit in 2020 and our guidance for 2021 here at 102 to103 that both of those exceed our long-term targets. We certainly don't want to get ahead of ourselves here in the third quarter. What we commented on is that, we're in the midst of our annual planning for 2022. It's -- at the same time, we're also just always looking at our long-term targets and it's very natural for us to be reviewing that over the next few months. And so, when we have more news on that, we'll certainly let folks know. But again, I think we're in a period where there's a significant amount of opportunity ahead, and we're very pleased with the results we put up this quarter, the outlook we have for the balance of the year, and also excited about the long-term opportunity that we still see out there in our $110 billion market as we are gaining significant share in it and the team is just executing on all cylinders right now. Hey, Gutman. Good to talk to you this morning and thanks for joining us. You had said -- first off, we see sizable opportunity ahead in our market. For those who followed us for a long period of time, it's a very attractive market. One, it's very fragmented. One, where we're very well-positioned with our scale and size and relationships that we have and investments we've made historically. We think that there are significant further opportunity as we look out. We continue to grow in an out-sized way and take share. And we're committed to going after that share, continuing to grow. That said, would acknowledge 2 straight years of performance above 10% off margin. It's above our long-term guidance. And as we go through our 2022 annual planning process, we'll be -- that will help us really think through our long-term guidance and the relevance of that as we look forward. For right now, it is our long-term guidance. What I would say is, as it relates to investments, we're very bullish on our investments, we're very focused on excellent capital allocation, we're seeing the results of our investments in the business. As we shared today, the Fusion stores and the Side Lot stores are performing very well. As they mature and begin to normalize, we're seeing the results right in line with what our expected business model and business plan for them were. That's it. Also our business is much -- continues to grow at an outsized rate and that gives us an opportunity to leverage and scale on our business in a way that we didn't fully anticipate last year at this time. And I think as we see how that continues to evolve into early next year, you can expect to hear more from us on that. But again, we remain very bullish on our opportunity, very pleased with our business, it's never been stronger, and we're excited about both the short-term and long-term potential inside of it. There's a little bit of disruption. There's disruption that happens during the remodel. Particularly with the current supply chain environment, there's a little disruption that's occurring still even after the remodel as some fixtures and other types of things come in some months a little late. That -- and then we start to see the lift happen as customers getting used to shopping, the new layout and find the new categories and the new brands and the new remodel. What we're seeing is what we would expect, which is every week, every month that goes by post kind of the re-grand opening of the remodel that the performance of the store continues to improve. And that's the case of both combo stores and the Fusion remodel. The other that I would make to that is as it relates to the Side Lot with the Garden Center. We have a couple of stores that went through year 2 of spring. We saw outsized gains in those which is in line again with our expectation that we would see more of a maturity curve with the Garden Center than we would with the inside of the store Fusion remodel. We think that and we expect and what we're seeing in the Fusion remodel, it's more of an immediate impact with the maturity curve being more of 3, 4, 5, 6 months maturity curve, whereas for the Garden Center, we're seeing a nice, strong immediate impact, but then we're also seeing 12, 18 months continuation of that maturity curve. But yeah, the results are very much in line, nice positive lift already, even a few months into each of the remodels. And then we see even continued lift as we complete year 1 of those remodels, whether it's Fusion or the combo. Yeah, we start measuring lift the day of the re-grand opening. So not to get too tactical, but there's a sign off that the store manager and the project manager and the construction manager do that on the day that sign off, that's when the project is complete. The re-grand opening happens reasonably quickly after that, 1 week, 2 weeks kind of thing, and then we start measuring the lift from that re-grand opening date. Hey, Chuck and thanks for joining the call today. I'll hit kind of three things on Side Lot and then I'll just briefly touch base on Fusion productivity.

And we have significant convenience benefit -- kind of advantages for our customers from a location perspective. So the Garden Center s are performing very well and we're just getting started both on the build-out of those, obviously, but also with our relationships with our live goods vendors and the assortments, tailoring it by store. The second thing is on BOPIS drive-thru. We're seeing incredibly high levels of drive-thru behavior from our customers. And we're seeing in -- some of our stores that have been open for 4, 5, 6, 8 months now, we're seeing 50%, 60%, 75%. the bio line pickup in store being drive-through and just that extra convenience factor you're seeing with customers. And then that's driving repeat behavior. And so really pleased with how that's evolving and the behavior we're seeing from our customers is consistent with what the feature was when we rolled it out. And then lastly is the feed room. We are the largest seller of bag feed in the country. And if you think about our average store volumes and the growth we've seen in those store volumes combined with the outsized performance in Q, that's put a lot of stress on our stores as it relates to the receipt of bad good s, getting it out onto the store, staying in stock for our customers, and then being able to get that onto customers' trucks and out the -- towards -- get them on their way. And the feed rooms have provided valuable capacity and also allowed us to effectively, from a cost perspective, serve the customer. We're not touching the bags 2, 3, 4 times. We're able to leverage our mixing centers in a way that they're designed now. And so all 3 of those things are really coming together, we're seeing excellent performance across all 3 exactly as we designed them and built them and we're continuing to use our test and learn to tweak it along the way. As you think about our productivity, as we move forward, we're still committed to our comps outpacing overall retail and outpacing the Life Out Here market that we define as that a $110 billion market. And so you can expect continued productivity improvements on our same-store sales in an outsized way as we move forward. We even in spite of 6 consecutive quarters now with double-digit comps, we still have that expectations moving forward. One other thing, while I've got the mike here so to speak. I'd like to just step back and reference there's a bit about our long-term op margin leverage as Kurt was talking about. What I'd say is if you look at our long-term guidance through there are several questions on this topic. Our long-term guidance that we announced last year had 6% to 7% sales growth and 8% to 10% earnings per diluted share, which implies continued leverage on the business as we move forward. And we're not in a state of normalcy right now, obviously with our comps being the sixth consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, but what I would say, the spirit of the continued leverage, you are seeing in our results. And that is the expectation we have of our business, whether we're seeing outsize costs for labor and outsize cost from freight and cost of goods or whether that's in a more normal environment. And so we're holding ourselves accountable to executing in that way, regardless of the environment that we're in. And just wanted to clarify that. I think Kurt 's point around 3% comp and whether that's a point of leverage is still accurate in a normal environment, but we still, even in a kind of \"non -normal environment\" still accept that same challenge."

            "content": "Hey Peter, this is Seth. Thanks for joining the call. Hey, when we look ahead over the next couple of months, just a little bit more broadly, other than just outside of energy costs as well, we're really excited about the opportunity that lies ahead based off a lot of the macro benefits that Hal just discussed and I'd love to just highlight a couple of things that we look to see to drive our business over this holiday season and then to maximize and capitalize on that opportunity. When we think about that, and we're really excited about how the team and the merchandising team continues to execute on our portfolio strategy, leveraging the Fast team. We're doing record number of resets throughout the year, not just call it preholiday, but continuing that reset and the new [Indiscernible] activity as we go through the quarter. And for holidays specifically, over the next couple of months, we're really excited about the momentum we're seeing in some of these new customer trends, as well as our core customers that are coming to us for categories more broadly than maybe they have in the past. Things like apparel and footwear. And we're seeing expansions like in key brands that consumers are really resonating with, with brands like Columbia and Harriet, Carhartt, even our own brand like Ridgecut, where we're expanding into the women's lineup where that shopper's now coming to us where they weren't in the past, where we can continue to drive market share in those categories. We're also seeing with that rural revitalization, consumers coming to us for outdoor activities, even here in the fall. So things like patio heaters, grills, even Wildlife and UTV s driving a demand, we're still seeing strength across the board there and then we're going to continue to focus on our C.U.E. activity where customers are coming to us for footsteps. So, with a record number of pet adoptions over the last few years, we continue to be extremely excited about the momentum that we have at our pet business holistically as well as the C.U.E. business, and we're going to be looking to drive that throughout the whole holiday season. It's a little broader than just the energy market question here as well, but also where we see it as we're coming through, we're seeing activity across our consumer base to be very consistent with what we've seen over the last few quarters. And they are really resonating with the new items, the new categories, as well as the new partnerships that we're continuing to establish. Hey, Chris. Yes. So we always say we're not -- we always want more, but we are satisfied with where we are right now. As we've managed through the supply chain with both our supplier partners and our supply chain team and merchants to get the products where we are, we feel really good where we are heading into the holiday season as products flowing in. As we've managed through this throughout the course of the whole year, you're spot on. We've looked at every piece of our process, we're giving earlier forecast for our key supplier partners, we're working with our overseas factories to give commitments In our earlier lead time, than we have historically so that we can properly plan within, plan through the supply chain, look for alternative ways to source product or need be to make sure that we can have product hit shelf and we're taking it, we'll be able to take it when we can get it even earlier than we have in the past as well. So that we can be locked and loaded and ready for the spring business. Really feel good about the planning that's going on across the team, and across with our supplier base to make sure that we can continue to navigate this supply -- global supply chain challenge that has been out there."

            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal. And hello to everyone on the call. Once again, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business and our strategic initiatives. As Hal shared, we continue to believe the underlying health of our business is very strong. Third quarter comp store sales of 13.1% representing 39.9% 2-year stack were driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 9.5% and transaction count increase of 3.6% An example of the structural advantage we have is the ongoing strength in our consumable, usable, and edible products. Our C.U.E. products represent the strength of our core business and what drives trips to the store. Once again, C.U.E. outperformed the chain average comp sales and for the fifth consecutive quarter in a row, C.U.E. had comp sales growth at or above 15%. Key subcategories such as poultry, livestock feed, and dry dog food were among the strongest categories, with broad-based strength. Our big ticket categories, which we're going against significant growth in the prior year, continue to have solid comp store sales performance in line with the chain average. This was driven by strength in trailers, recreational and utility vehicles, safes, and zero-turn mowers. Inflation contributed about 700 basis points to comparable store sales. As you've heard from the retail sector and others, the cost environment remains elevated across imports, domestic freight, commodities, and labor wages. Our merchant team has been aggressively advocating for our customers. Where necessary, we are taking price increases to pass through some of the cost pressures that we cannot offset. our merchant and supply chain teams are currently navigating this challenging and disruptive environment extremely well. As we closely monitor our customers purchasing behaviors, we're focused on product unit trends and are committed to being priced right every day. Our third quarter gross margin rate was 36%, a decrease of 41 basis points versus last year. For comparison, our gross margin rate this quarter was still about a 100 basis points above our Q3 2019 rate of 35%. Year-over-year, the gross margin drivers were principally three items. First higher product cost inflation, second, elevated freight costs inclusive of domestic and import costs and third, a more normalized product mix shift in C.U.E. All of retail is working through the drivers of inflation and freight costs. The Tractor Supply team effectively offset a significant portion through our price management program. Additionally, we continue to see favorability in the frequency and depth of promotions. This is due to our commitment to our everyday low pricing strategy and a continued strong demand for our product categories. The benefit from vendor funding for the field activity support teams for our fast initiative, which was launched in the second half of last year, was consistent with our guidance. Our third quarter SG&A expense ratio including depreciation and amortization, improved by 58 basis points versus last year to 26.1%. This improvement as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to good leverage and occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in our comparable store sales. Along with lower COVID-19 pandemic response costs and decreased incentive compensation. Partially offsetting this leverage were higher wage rates, incremental store labor hours to ensure we are providing great customer service, and investments in our Life Out Here Strategy initiative. Given the elevated volumes and current operating environment, we also encourage select discrete costs such as incremental team member benefits, pop-up DCs, and the timing of our annual sales meeting, which normally occurs in the first quarter. The offset to our fast initiative benefit in gross margin was approximately 20 basis points of incremental SG&A expense for the labor costs for the team as we are now cycling the initial investment to launch the program last year. Much like our gross margin rate, our SG&A performance compares favorably to Q3 2019. We've had about 70 basis points favorable expense ratio since then. Operating profit increased about 18% with operating profit margin of nearly 10% in the quarter. Diluted EPS was $1.95, an increase of 20.4% from the third quarter of last year. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong. At the end of the quarter, our merchandise inventories were $2.2 billion, representing an 11.7% increase year-over-year in average inventory per store. The increase principally reflects growth to support the robust sales trends along with the impact of inflation. Moving now to our updated guidance for Fiscal 2021. We continue to operate in a time of heightened uncertainty regarding the pandemic. Despite this uncertainty, including product cost inflation, and supply chain constraints, we are raising our full-year outlook. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results for the first 3 quarters of the year and the positive and structural momentum we see in our business continuing into the fourth quarter. Against the backdrop of what we know today, we're forecasting Fiscal 2021 net sales centered around $12.6 billion with comparable store sales growth of about 16%. For the year we forecast an operating margin of 10.2% to 10.3%, a step-up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $8.40 to $8.50. This compares to our previous earnings range of $7.70 to $8 per diluted share. Within this updated guidance, we are forecasting comparable store sales growth for the fourth quarter of 8% to 10%. Two modeling points to keep in mind, the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance and as you start to roll forward your models for 2022, please keep in mind that next year, we'll have 53rd week for us. This week is typically a low volume week of sales, given that it follows the Christmas holidays. We have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business. And with that, we are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide a legendary customer experience across all channels. The strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a position of strength for Tractor Supply. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2021, we remain on track for anticipated share repurchases in a range of $750 to $800 million. This year will mark a milestone with approximately $1 billion returned to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends. In summary, our results proved yet again, Tractor Supply 's unique competitive advantages. Our relentless focus on being the dependable supplier for the out here lifestyle is embedded in our purpose as a Company. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hal. Hey, Brian. I'd point to 3 things in our business. First off, I'll talk about broad macro trends, second thing I'll talk about is the consistency of our business, and the third I'll talk about is share gains. In the broad macro trends, all the trends that we saw in Q2 of last year really have all sustained themselves, and I think there's certain retailers and other businesses that saw the benefit as it relates to COVID behavior early to mid last year and that waned. And I think that's not been the case for us, whether it's things like rural revitalization, which is a bit more of a permanence in if people move and whether it's things like pet ownership and adoption, again, permanent more so in nature. Whether it's homesteading and just kind of the self-reliance mentality, we're seeing this as more permanent behaviors and really no matter what dataset you look at, whether it's home purchases, whether it's mobility, whether it's pet ownership, any sort of qualitative data on where people are spending their money, they all reinforce the structural nature of those trends. The second thing I'd point to is the consistency, as I mentioned. Our business has been remarkably consistent. Month to month, week to week, by category, and by region. And that's been regardless of whether or not we've been in COVID surges or whether or not certain states have been more in lock down or less in lock down. And that I think just again speaks to the structural orientation. And lastly, we're gaining significant share really in almost every category in our business. And we're seeing that share gain in our core customers who have long shopped us and as they come to us now with a confidence that we're in stock with the right level of customer service and at the right price, and then also new customers who are finding the lifestyle that we serve to be what they're seeking in this time. And we're gaining share really across the board on all of our categories in that context. I'd point to those -- to those three things that give us real confidence in the structural orientation of our business. I think it's -- there's a set of COVID winners that were early on and have seen some of that wane. And then there's another set that are seeing it much more structural and sustained. And I very much put it at the top of that second camp. [Indiscernible], hey. This is Kurt. Good morning and good morning to everybody. On the inflation side of it, as Hal mentioned on the top side, there was 700 basis points of inflation benefit on the business. We saw at that or slightly higher cost pressures in Q3, as we look ahead to Q4, we exited Q3 and into Q4 with continued levels of inflation moderating at the levels compared to like what we saw coming out of Q2 into Q3. But there continues to be some levels of inflation that's factored into our guidance. In regards to how we handle that, it really is more of a portfolio approach. We take a look at where those costs are contributing, both in transportation product costs and we look at our portfolio. Seth, and the merchant team manages the shopping patterns from the customers, as well as making sure that in key traffic driving areas, we've got great everyday low pricing. So we leverage our pricing tools really well and make sure that from the portfolio standpoint that we can balance from a retail side, as well as what we can do to leverage the strength of our mature supply chain to keep cost s as low as possible. And again, our team has just managed through this great and we are forecasting our guidance for Q4 expecting that they're able to manage that in a similar pattern. Michael, I'll hit the two questions. In response to clarification on Kate's question, for Q4 the inflation pressures on the business will be fairly similar to what we described and saw on Q3: flattish to potentially slightly up in regards to Q4. In regards to our leverage point, where we're at right now with the business, the elevated levels of revenue growth, as well as our focus on our investments really makes the whole algorithm different than just saying is it a 3% comp that you leverage on. And to your point, right now, we're seeing really strong momentum in the business, and that does elevate our ability to leverage on the cost. But we're also using that to the point that Hal made and that I made in our prepared remarks that we definitely see this as a tremendous opportunity, we're investing from a position of strength, so our continued outlook of managing SG&A to flattish over time will still be our outlook in the way we are managing this business. Great opportunity to just continue to gain market share and drive traffic into the stores. Yeah, sure, Peter. So for this year, the depreciation growth year-over-year, throughout the quarters, mid-to-high 20% growth rate is very much in line with our expectations. The investments we've made this year, the incremental ones principally with the new distribution center build, as well as the Fusion Side Lot remodel has us right where we expected to be on depreciation. And for 2022 at this point with our plan, we would expect very much similar in the low 20% growth rate, likely and that's very much what we framed out when we launched the Life Out Here Strategy. Zach, this is Kurt and a number of things in there. Let me just try to package that in this. One, I'll hit the last one first. Orscheln is not considered in any of the numbers of the guidance that we've given in regards to the depreciation expense structure. So COVID expenses have been elevated from the level that we entered the year into, just because the pandemic with the Delta variant and others have lingered. They're at lower levels than we saw in comparable quarters last year but we continue to emphasize having a safe and clean environment for our customers and our team members. The incentive comp with the outperformance this year, while at lower levels than last year, continued to be above target. And so we should think about going forward those are items for us as in future years, those are leveraged points. And if, like in this year, while there's incentive comp above target, the performance gives leverage above and beyond the level that we're paying an incentive comp. So it's net an overall leverage this year, and next year those will be favorable items to compare again. The depreciation expense, as I mentioned earlier, the growth rate that I quoted and referring to is very much in line with what we expected in our long-range plan when we launched the Life Out Here Strategy and talked about a 3 year to 5 year plan. And so with the elevated sales, I mean, we feel very comfortable with a 20% growth rate in depreciation because that's where those investments are at, does not include Orscheln, and again, we're very comfortable with the management we've got and what we have visibility on our expenses for the fourth quarter and even the near term beyond that. The strategic initiative that we've had -- we haven't really specifically mentioned any increased spend on strategic initiatives outside of what we had planned in the Life Out Here Strategy on technology, digital that we had this year and we'll continue to execute the plan. So maybe just clarify what you're referring there. Got you, Zach. No, it's very much in line with what we said that our capital expenditures over the next few years. We anticipate those still to be in that 450 to 550 some years, could be higher because of launching of distribution centers. But the level investment in the businesses is consistent with what we expect. Hey, good morning. And yes, that is what we said in our prepared remarks and it is accurate. The add that I'd make to that is just as is typical with a store remodel,"

And now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thank you, Mary Winn, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Our thanks go out to the more than 45,000 Tractor Supply team members for their ongoing commitment to each other, our customers in the Out Here lifestyle. The team has been through a lot together over the last 15 months as an essential needs-based retailer, including necessary but cumbersome health and safety measures, surging volumes, the roll out of our Life Out Here strategy, supply chain disruptions, numerous digital investments, and more. The team has risen to each challenge to be there as the dependable supplier to our customers and the communities we call home. Thank you to the team for another great quarter. I would also like to say thank you to our vendor and supply chain partners as we work together to overcome the challenges in the global supply chain network. Together, we were able to support our customers as the dependable supplier for their Out Here lifestyle. Over the first 12 months of the pandemic, through the first quarter of 2021, our sales grew approximately 35%, or $3 billion. In the second quarter of 2021, as we are now comping the comp, we are pleased this momentum and all of the underlying trends have remained and continue to sustain. Looking at the second quarter. The Tractor Supply team delivered a very strong performance that exceeded our expectations as we achieved a 10.5% comparable store sales growth for the quarter and a 41% two-year stack. Our results prove yet again Tractor Supply's unique competitive advantages. Our relentless focus on being the dependable supplier for the Out Here lifestyle is embedded in our purpose as a company. Our Life Out Here strategy is still in the early days. We are seeing positive trends from our initiatives. We are excited by the momentum. We remain committed to investing in our team members as we believe they are a key competitive differentiator with our customers. Just last month, we increased pay for nearly 27,000 of our tenured hourly store team members and also raised our minimum wage to $11.25 per hour. Our team members continue to make Tractor Supply a special place that it is. Investing in our team members is not only the right thing to do, it is also a way to recognize their role in driving our business forward. Now, turning to our results for the second quarter of 2021. Our net sales grew approximately 13.4%. Comparable store sales grew 10.5%, driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 6% and transaction count increase of 4.5%. Diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $3.19. Importantly, the underlying foundation of our business is robust. For the quarter, every week had positive comps. Our growth was broad-based across regions and product categories. We continue to gain share across all categories, online and in stores. For instance, in Q2, we experienced comparable store growth in our consumable, usable, and edible categories that was well above our overall comparable store sales. E-commerce recorded its largest-ever quarter of sales. The work we have done over the last year to improve our e-commerce capabilities have certainly resonated with our customers. And just under a year, our mobile app already has more than 1.6 million downloads and now represents over 10% of our e-commerce sales. Given our strong performance year-to-date, coupled with our outlook for the balance of the year, we are raising our sales and earnings guidance for the year. Kurt will share more details on our revised outlook later in the call. Regarding our pending acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home that we announced in February, we are working cooperatively with the FTC on their second request. We look forward to the benefit this transaction will offer customers with improved product and competitive pricing. We have previously shared key observations of our customer behaviors based on our market data and research, and I would like to update you on that today. Overall, our customer metrics remain very healthy, with both traffic and spending increasing at a balanced rate. So let's run through some of the insights that are most relevant. First, we are seeing broad, continued strength across our customer base. More customers than ever are shopping Tractor Supply and these customers are making more trips than ever and are spending more money per trip than ever. We are seeing strong retention of customers that have shopped us over the last 12 months. Our retention rates continue to run above historical trends. The conversion of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program to a points-based rewards is resonating with our customers. Year-over-year, we've added nearly 5 million new members to the program. In our Neighbor's Club members, they are spending about 3 times the rate of non-members and they are comping at a rate well above the chain average. Neighbor's Club members accounted for about 65% of our sales and that's a step-up from where we've been running prior to the relaunch of the program. We've grown our high-value customer base in the program by about 15% year-to-date, with customers migrating upward in spending, significantly outpacing any downward spending. The retention rate of our most valuable customers is running north of 95%. New customers are joining the Neighbor's Club program at a rate of nearly 30%, significantly above the rate from last year. And the new customers we are acquiring as compared to our core customers are continuing to skew younger. We're seeing significant growth in our millennial shoppers. Our trends this quarter for the customer age cohorts of 18 years to 45 years old were in line with the first quarter. We continue to believe that the growth in this customer segment has staying power. Much like last quarter, the types of trends we're seeing can simply be described as once in a generation. We believe key aspects to our customer service such as a convenient place to shop, product assortment, legendary customer service, and in-stock levels are important to keeping these existing and new customers engaged with our brand. On the macro front, the economy remained strong and key trends continue to work in our favor, such as rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, and a self-reliant lifestyle movement, including DIY trends and hobbies like gardening, backyard poultry, and pet adoption. While the cost environment remains elevated across import, domestic freight, commodities, and labor wages, the merchant team has been aggressively advocating for our customers. Where necessary, we are taking price increases to pass through some of the cost pressures that we cannot offset. We are closely monitoring the price elasticity to ensure that we are focused on product unit trends. The team is doing an excellent job navigating this environment. Over the past few months, we have navigated unprecedented conditions. As the country opens back up, the Out Here lifestyle remains incredibly relevant. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt to review the quarter in more depth and our outlook before I come back to give insight on our Life Out Here strategy and other drivers of the second half of 2021.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call today. As Hal shared many details on the second quarter, in my time on the call today, I would like to go into some of the specifics around our financial performance and our increased outlook for the full year. We are very pleased with our performance. These results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business and our strategic initiatives. For the quarterly cadence, April and June were the strongest months of the comp store sales performance. All geographic regions and all major merchandising categories had comp store sales growth. We believe the underlying health of our business is structurally advantaged. A great example of this is the strength in our consumable, usable, and edible products. Our C.U.E. products represent the strength of our core business and what drives trips to the store. For the fifth consecutive quarter in a row, C.U.E. had comp store sales growth above 15%. Key subcategories such as poultry, livestock feed, and dry dog food were among the strongest categories with comp sales all greater than 25%. Of note, we are seeing strong retention rates of our new customers across every species of livestock and companion animal. For example, poultry, a hallmark homesteading category for Tractor Supply has the highest retention rate of the animal species for new customers and new to the category. Our big ticket categories, which were going against significant growth in the prior year, continue to have strong comp sales performance above the chain average. This was driven by strength in zero-turn mowers, safes, utility vehicles and trailers. Lastly, inflation contributed about 350 basis point to 400 basis point to comparable store sales in the quarter. Our second quarter gross margin rate was 35.8%, a decrease of 67 basis points. Year-over-year, the gross margin drivers were principally three items. First, higher freight cost that all of retail is experiencing. Second, an initial impact from the relaunch of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. And third, a more normalized C.U.E. product mix. Our price management program partially offset these factors as we look to mitigate the impact of inflation and other cost pressures. Consistent with our guidance, we received approximately 40 basis points benefit from vendor funding for the field activity support teams or FAST initiative, which was launched in the second half last year. Of note, we continue to see favorability in the frequency and depth of promotions as we are committed to being true to our everyday low pricing strategy and continue to see strong demand for our product categories. For comparison, our gross margin rate this quarter was still about 90 basis points above our Q2 2019 rate of 34.9%. Our second quarter SG&A expense ratio, including depreciation and amortization, improved by 6 basis points to 22.3%. This improvement was primarily attributable to lower COVID-19 pandemic response costs and decreased incentive compensation, as well as good leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in our comparable store sales. Partially offsetting this leverage were higher wage rates, additional store labor hours to ensure we are providing great customer service, and investments in our Life Out Here strategic initiatives. The offset to our FAST initiative benefiting gross margin was approximately 40 basis points of incremental SG&A expense with the labor costs for the team. Much like our gross margin rate, our SG&A performance compares favorably to Q2 2019 when our SG&A expense ratio was 22.7%. Operating profit increased 8.5%, with operating profit margin of 13.5% on the quarter. Net income was $370 million, an increase of 9.3%. Diluted EPS was $3.19, an increase of 10%. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong, merchandise inventories were $1.99 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing a 14% increase in average inventory per store. The increase principally reflects growth to support the robust sales trends along with the impact of inflation. Our supply chain and our vendors are executing at a very high level to meet the customers' current demands. We finished the quarter with $1.41 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $500 million revolver. Moving now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021, looking ahead, while the trends in our business provide additional confidence in the structural nature of the tailwind, we remain aware that the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccine roll out can have further impact on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results. There is still some measure of uncertainty we continue to plan for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes and we will remain nimble and adjust as necessary. Our updated guidance reflects the strong result in the half of the year and the positive momentum we see in our businesses continuing into the second half of 2021. Please note that the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. So against the backdrop of what we know today, we are updating our guidance to a net sales range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion with comparable store sales growth in the range of 11% to 13%. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.7% to 9.9% of sales, a step up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $7.70 to $8. This compares to our previous earnings range of $7.05 to $7.40 per diluted share. We have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business. We are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide legendary customer service to meet our customers' expectations. While we continue to lap challenging sales and earnings comps, we expect positive sales comp in both the third and fourth quarter with the third quarter a few points higher than the fourth quarter. Please keep in mind, we will continue to cycle strong gross margin performance of the prior year where we benefited from minimal promotional or clearance activity as well as favorable product mix where C.U.E. products represented a smaller portion of sales. Much like the results in the second quarter, we are expecting gross margin decline in the back half of the year due to higher transportation costs and continued strength in the C.U.E. products. Our guidance assumes promotional activity comparable to last year in Q3, with Q4 seeing some shift back to normalizing promotions during the holiday season. While we are dealing with significantly higher transportation costs, a mix shift to C.U.E. and cost of goods increases, we continue to see benefit from a pullback in promotions and are seeing less price elasticity from consumers as we adjust prices. We believe we are effectively navigating impacts to our gross margin. The strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a hallmark of Tractor Supply. We have raised our outlook for capital spending to now be in the range of $500 million to $600 million to reflect higher construction and raw material costs for store projects and increased technology investments for the customer experience. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchase. For 2021, we remain on track for anticipated share repurchases in a range of $700 million to $800 million. This year will mark a milestone with approximately $1 billion returned to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends. To wrap up, we are very pleased with our performance in the first half of the year and see positive momentum carrying into the second half of 2021. We continue to build relevance and market share both today and over time. We are excited about the investments ahead of us to better serve our customers from new stores, Project Fusion remodels and our side lot transformation. We are strengthening our supply chain and growing our digital commerce, all in support of our commitment to driving strong shareholder returns for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Kurt. Tractor Supply has thrived over the last 15 months. We continue to operate from a position of strength and are committed to investing in the business. Our Life Out Here strategy is designed to capitalize on the attractive opportunity that we see in our nearly $110 billion total addressable market. We are transforming our stores through our Project Fusion remodel and side lot transformation, optimizing our technology in store and online and investing in how we operate our stores. I am incredibly proud of the progress the team has made in advancing our strategic priorities, especially amid a global pandemic and running the business at an elevated rate. So, let me share with you an update on how a few of our comp initiatives are progressing. I'll start with the field activity support team. The 1,200-plus person organization is designed to improve store labor productivity. Example task of the FAST team include execution of merchandising programs like center court, end-caps, clip strips, planogram resets, seasonal programs and our sales driving initiatives. Rolled out in the third quarter of last year, this team has made great progress in improving execution of our merchandising activity, which represents the second largest body of work for our store team members. Year-to-date, the execution of task by the FAST team is running at 97% or nearly 33 points higher than our base year of 2019. The FAST team is allowing the store teams to spend more time on customer service and improve their in-store execution. We believe the FAST team will continue to contribute to comparable store sales well into the future. Turning next to our Project Fusion store remodel program, recall, our Project Fusion is our state of the art space productivity program designed to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base and give new customers that may not have shopped with us in the past more reasons to visit. We now have more than 160 stores in the new layout and the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Our customers are taking note of things like the improved shopping experience in our remodel and specifically in our customer intercept surveys, they are calling out better organization, improved merchandise selection, cleaner and brighter and easier to navigate factors. While the majority of the remodel have been completed more recently, we are very pleased with the early read of our customer response and the comp lift of the remodel is running in line with our expectations. Given the size of our store base, this is a multiyear opportunity to continually refresh our store base and further drive comp sales. Another component of our space productivity program is the transformation of our side lot. Typically, there is as much space outside of our stores in the side lot as we had inside the store. The productivity of this space is substantially below the chain average. We are in the midst of a multi-year project to transform our side lot with an expanded product offering and an enhanced shopping experience. With this investment, the side lot spaces leverage to offer a wider product offering in the lawn and garden categories, enter new categories, and offer greater convenience through the expansion of our buy online, pickup at store capabilities for drive-thru pickup. We also continue to see a positive halo effect from the garden center to the existing store and vice versa. Addition of product categories, increased user shopping, and new services provides us with even more ways to continue to keep our existing customers engaged at Tractor Supply and attract new customers to the brand. Our ability to drive higher sales per square foot through the transformation of our side lot remains a significant opportunity. We currently have about 60 side lot transformations completed and we anticipate having greater than 150 complete as we exit 2021. In these early remodels, we are learning a great deal about our customers' appetite for our expanded lawn and garden assortment and we are even more excited than we embarked on the initial test pilot. The team has done a great job laying the foundation of our Life Out Here strategy as we scale our transformational initiatives. Beyond our multi-year strategic initiative, at Tractor Supply, we are always focused on having the seasonally appropriate offerings to support our customers. Wrapping up the summer season, we're exiting the quarter with clean inventory with a seasonal changeover. We continue to focus on enhancing our product offerings for the transition to the important fall and winter season. Across all areas of the store and online, we have fall-centric merchandising and marketing plans in place to keep our customers engaged. Whether it's the launch of our Pet Appreciation Week in September to the roll out of our Deer Hunting planograms set, or our focus on heating products for the change in temperature, our customers know that they can count on Tractor Supply for the relevant products that they need to live Life Out Here. We are leveraging new items and innovation across grilling, safes, and home and decor. In addition, Ridgecut, our exclusive brand of performance workwear will be expanded across new categories and into women's workwear. These product expansions are relevant to both new and existing customers and will help retain our growing customer base. Across all parts of the store, we have exciting products for the fall and winter as we shift gears to ramp up for our customers' need to care for their land, home, animals and pets as colder weather comes. On the marketing front, we are making continued investments to drive our brand awareness. As part of our plans, we are excited to announce a new multi-year partnership to be the official Life Out Here partner for the Professional Bull Riders effective this season. The partnership includes the flagship presence on the PBR tour that host over 200 events per year, a Tractor Supply branded broadcast boost during the pre-show on CBS and in-arena broadcast activation and local customer activation. PBR will also produce and distribute custom content for our social media channels. We are very excited to support our customers' passion for this dynamic and rapidly growing sport. Again, on marketing, given the strong millennial trends we've been experiencing, we're investing in marketing to continue to attract and nurture this important demographic. Given that the millennial customer cohort may not be as familiar with our brand, we are executing marketing plans to introduce Tractor Supply to this next generation of customers. Just last month, we launched a new campaign targeting millennials' immediate channels like Pandora, YouTube and other streaming services. That campaign is called Welcome to Life Out Here and introduces this new audience to what lies ahead in our stores and the lifestyle we help support. The focus is on key categories such as pet, backyard poultry, gardening and self-reliance. With the primary goal to drive awareness, the millennial campaign has delivered significant impression since the launch. Early results show best in class performance in ad recall and awareness relative to traditional benchmarks. We believe this indicates that we are resonating with this audience and it is driving consideration for Tractor Supply. To summarize, we've delivered strong results year-to-date and made significant progress with our strategic initiatives. We have confidence that our strategy and execution will allow us to continue to build a stronger Tractor Supply. With our purposeful actions, we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger company. It's an exciting time at Tractor Supply. My appreciation goes out to each and every one of our more than 45,000 Tractor Supply team members for their dedication to our mission and value. And with that, operator, we would now like to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning. So, Hal, I wanted to focus on the Neighbor's Club relaunch. So, maybe a two-part question here. If we look at the spending tiers, right, that are sort of defined by the program. Curious if you'd provide some context around how these tiers were determined. And any sort of color, right, that you could provide to help us better understand sort of what percentage of members today would qualify, right, for the preferred for plus tiers? Any color would be appreciated there.\nHal Lawton: Steve, of our now 21 million-plus Neighbor's Club members. And like kind of all loyalty programs, we try to -- as we created in this case three tiers, we tried to kind of reasonably distribute it with kind of a decreasing proportion across each of the three buckets. And then we also tried to create tier levels that would naturally encourage upward migration and discourage downward migration. I would say a few things. As we talked about on the call, our Neighbor's Club members now account for over 65% of our sales. Our retention rate on our Neighbor's Club members is over 80%, very strong retention rate on an annualized basis. And as we said, our highest -- our third tier of spending, which is the -- the Neighbor's Club Premium Plus, the retention rates there are over 95%. So we're seeing significant upward migration. We're seeing reduced downward migration. And the final thing I'll make a mention of is that our Neighbor's Club members, they make two more trips quarter on average than our non-Neighbor\u2019s Club members. And our Neighbor's Club members had spent over $1,000 a year. We've got almost $2.5 million of those and that's increasing kind of on a daily basis. So, it's a very robust program with its 21-plus million members. We've seen over 5 million members join us in the last 12 months. We're seeing outstanding retention. We're seeing excellent migration. As we migrate them, the retentions are holding and actually improving, and we've seen a significant positive response to the roll out of the new program. As mentioned in our prepared remarks, since the roll out of the program, our Neighbor's Club members are significantly outcomping our overall chain average.\nSteven Forbes: Thanks. And just a quick follow-up. If I think about the last few quarters, you provided some context around repeating trends. I think a percentage of customers repeating within 12 months, probably on a rolling basis. I think it was 50% last month. You mentioned sort of it's running at a high. So just any context around repeat trends that we think about the growth from the customer base, the experience over the past 18 months.\nHal Lawton: Yes. So our customer repeat shopping trends continue to remain very high. New customer retention rates continue to hover in that kind of 50-ish percent similar to last quarter and the previous quarters. And our customer -- our new customer counts were only slightly below our new customer counts from Q2 2020. And so for us, there's a lot of good news on the customer side. We saw 11 million last year. We saw 2.6 million, nearly 3 million in Q1. We're seeing kind of 50%-plus retention rates on those new customers. The way -- kind of an interesting way to think about it is, on the 11 million new customers we saw last year, 6 million have shopped with us again and 3 million of those joined the Neighbor's Club program. And so that's just -- if you think about that walk just some outstanding metrics retention, conversion to the Neighbor's Club program. And then again this quarter, we are seeing new customer counts nearly the same as the second quarter of 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Steven.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey, good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. My first question is the stabilized period that you outlined at the earnings day, it hasn't really happened yet. I guess it has relative to last year, but the business is still growing. Can you talk about the factors that would argue that the business doesn't need to digest and therefore, continue to grow and then vice versa. What suggests that we are going to have a digestion period and we'll have a deeper stabilization period versus the way you expected it?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey, Simeon, how are you? I'd start out with -- at the highest level, I'd say, there still continues to be a lot of uncertainty in the United States economy and globally, whether that's on -- certainly as it relates to COVID, the delta variant, the implications that has on mobility and on customer shopping behaviors. I'd say, if you track back to our October enhanced earnings day last year, kind of implied a bit in the graphic Kurt showed with a bit more of a return to normal mentality at some point that was more abrupt in nature. And I'd say, I think as we're all watching how COVID's playing out, that's certainly not the case. And so I'd also say that our business continues to evolve. And if you think back to them, we were talking about 50-50 on structural versus transitory in terms of trends. And I think we'd lean more towards structural now in the way we view our trend. If you think about pet, if you think about the millennial customer, if you think about homesteading, kind of rural revitalization, categories like poultry as an example. So last year, as we've said several times, we sold 11 million birds, half of those were to new customers. We're seeing, as mentioned by Kurt in his prepared remarks, outstanding retention of those customers last year that shopped with us on poultry coming back again this year. In fact, our retention rate is higher than any other animal feed or pet. So, I mean, it just shows you that the trends that began last year are really resonating and resilient and that momentum that we're seeing with our customers and in our business and with the lifestyle -- the Out Here lifestyle that we appeal to is holding incredibly strong. And I think in my prepared remarks I talked about the fact that between Q2 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021, we had grown $3 billion and 34% comps. And we were kind of coming into Q2, I think like many companies with certainly us wondering how we would comp the comp and we had guided to kind of flattish at the beginning of the year for that and perhaps even a little down and finished with a plus 10.5%, certainly exceeded our expectations. And it's really all about the underlying trends, the strength in our consumer behavior, new customers and the appeal of that Out Here lifestyle. And I think there is still a lot of uncertainty in the out years and quarters, but I would say we feel more confident in the structural orientation of the trends than we did last October.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you for that. In terms of CapEx, I think Kurt had mentioned that it was relatively level in these outyears as it steps up from a couple of years ago. Does it peak in 2021? Do you spend further and accelerate into 2022, how should we think about cadence?\nKurt Barton: Simeon, this is Kurt. On the cadence over the next few years, as we pointed out, back in October when we launched our new long-term targets in the Life Out Here strategy, we said that we've got consistency in our investment, in the existing stores as we drive productivity with Fusion and side lot, but that where there may be some variation would be on the supply chain as we grow our supply chain, particularly new distribution centers. And so, as you've heard us in the last couple of quarters emphasize the importance of our investment in our supply chain, we are looking to accelerate and would see us shifting some of the supply chain investments earlier in the next few years. And so there may be higher than average in 2021, 2022, even 2023, but over the period of time, it still averages out about the five-year expectation that we gave. And the important thing is the recognition or our confidence in the structural nature of this business and therefore the importance of our timing of investments in the supply chain. So I see 2021 and 2022 pretty consistent in potential on capital as we emphasize ensuring the strength of our supply chain.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. And particularly C.U.E. It's hard to imagine that -- poultry or livestock products are growing as fast as you've been experiencing. But at some point or is this success starting your -- where you are not going to scale they're going to be more promotional, there has been no share losses. So, at what point do you see this risk holding in the next several quarters?\nHal Lawton: Hey, Michael, how are you and thanks for joining our call this morning. Yes, I'll start with the fact that we're confident. We're taking share really across every major category that we have in the business, both in stores and online. If you look at the profile between new customers, existing customers, both are showing strong comp, transaction growth, average ticket growth, and as I said in our prepared remarks, more customers are shopping trucks more than ever, they are visiting us more frequently and they are shopping -- they are spending more when they are shopping us. What I would say is, we participate in a very attractive large $110 billion market, where our share kind of based on our new guidance would be barely above 10%. There is a lot of share gain out there and also a lot of share to still be competed with. We're dominantly very focused on our customer and just making sure that the initiatives and the actions that we take are out there to create the best customer experience that we can, whether that's investments in our team members to drive that legendary customer service or investments in inventory to ensure we're in stock for our customers. I would say, as it relates to the promotional environment, we've not -- we've had very little to no promotions in Q1 and Q2 of this year and that's our expectation really for the balance of the year. And I really expect the competitive environment to remain similar for no other reason because of the supply/demand situation that's out there. And the global supply chain is disrupted as I've seen it in my 25 plus years in retail and everyone is working hard to just keep inventory in their stores. And I think that mindset would prevail over any sort of promotional share push that anyone has. I would also just comment that we don't directly compete with really any primary retailer. Being a lifestyle retailer, one of our benefits is that we play across a handful of large categories that are uniquely tailored to our customer, but typically, when we are competing with other companies, it's on a one-off category basis and we really appeal to that whole lifestyle. But I don't anticipate an increase in the promotional environment in the market or certainly for us anywhere near on the near or medium term horizon.\nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is on [indiscernible] accelerate from last quarter. Where do you expect that to go during the next few quarters?\nKurt Barton: Yes, Michael, this is Kurt. You stated the results accurate on the last quarter. Let me give quick backdrop and that will lead towards the back half, but we entered the year expecting 100 to 200 basis points of retail inflation throughout the year that quickly produced in Q1 closer to 300 basis points, principally from commodities. And then as we shifted into Q2, at the 350 to 450 basis points of retail benefit from inflation. One, it demonstrates the ability, as Hal mentioned, to be able to adjust pricing appropriately. But the increase in Q2 over Q1 was principally related to transportation costs and other non-commodity type based cost increases. We see in the back half of the year staying at elevated levels. And we would anticipate that the numbers in Q2, it would be at that level and potentially at moderately higher levels throughout the back half. And in this inflation environment, I always like to remind that our merchants in our business, we deal with inflation and deflation every year and they are managing this excellent and we feel we've got the ability right now in the consumer sentiment, the less price elasticity in their behavior to be able to manage the inflation environment very well throughout this year.\nMichael Lasser: Great, thank you so much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom: Thanks and good morning. My question is on Side Lot. Is it possible now with a few quarters under your belt to give us some update on the sales that you've this spring and any other learnings that you plan to apply to the balance of the stores you are going to open this year in the side lot format? And then as a follow-up, you talked about 60% to 70% of the fleet potentially holding side lot. I'm curious how quickly you think you're going to accomplish all that cycle?\nHal Lawton: Yes, hey Chuck, how are you? And thanks for joining the call today. I'd start out with both Fusion and side lot. We are very pleased with the results. And we've made a lot of progress over the last six to nine months on both of these efforts. We've rolled out, as we mentioned, we've got over 160 Fusions done, over 60 side lot transformations done. In addition to the work on those individual stores, we've brought the project management in-house. We're reducing our construction times and lowering costs and we see lots of opportunity to continue to do that as we move forward. Particularly on the side lot, we've iterated on kind of the plans several times and keep optimizing the format every -- as we roll it out. But we are very pleased with the results, with the progress we made in both. On the results, what I'd say is, we typically, I think, kind of historically in retail, it's the same in all my experiences. You start to really get a good feel for how the remodel lift is playing out kind of three to four months after the store kind of reopens and the remodels and complete. Most of our remodels haven't been open that long. So we're really kind of waiting over the next three to six months to start to see how that data set plays out. But what I'd say is, for the stores that have been open kind of over that period of time, they are at the levels that we anticipated in our initial business case. And we have more of those on the Fusion than we do on the side lot. But we're very pleased with the results of both projects. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the customer excitement around us becoming more of a destination in garden has been more significant than we even anticipated and we are even more bullish on that as we move forward. As it relates to the penetration of the kind of how long, we'll -- I think you can expect to hear us share more of that over time. But I'd say directionally over about a five-year time frame, you should think about kind of the Fusion stores for the most -- the vast majority of our stores having Fusion and on side lot really around that 60% to 70%. I think we're feeling more bullish around getting more of our store base done with Fusion than maybe were even six months ago, just the way that project is going, the cost that we're doing at it. They were doing it for the early read on the lift we're seeing and then the need just to continue to kind of remodel our store base.\nChuck Grom: That's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up I know this is unrelated I apologize. But given some new over the past few days about this delta variant, I'm curious, if you've seen any choppiness in some of the regions that you operate on vaccinations?\nHal Lawton: I'd start with our -- our business has over the last 15, 18 months now has remained incredibly consistent and we've said that on a number of calls, consistent across regions, consistent in category trends, consistent week to week, consistent month to month. As we said, all 13 weeks of this past quarter were positive comps, obviously all three months were positive comps. We exited June with strong momentum and even as we certainly -- as a nation, as we've seen this delta variant pickup, we've not seen any impact on our trends whether at a national level or at a regional level and that's very similar to what we observed last year and I think it's almost -- I hate to say, but I think the lack of mobility sometimes driven by these outbreaks actually plays to the benefit of Tractor Supply. I think it's demonstrated that when folks are spending more time at their homes with their families, their pets, their animals, their land, they buy and Tractor Supply to be kind of that one-stop shop resource for them to continue all those hobbies that they love and they are just spending more time doing those hobbies. And so while we certainly want and wish the country to return to normal as fast as possible, the delta variant, we don't see it as a potential threat. If anything, maybe some upside to it from our business results -- from a business results perspective.\nChuck Grom: Thank you, Hal. Good luck.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.\nChuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone. If we look at sales trends over the past two quarters and, Hal, could you tie it to the TV advertising you've been doing and did that lead into this relationship with the PDR?\nHal Lawton: We want to own Life Out Here and we think we have the credibility to do so and are viewed that way by our customers. And as I mentioned in -- we do an awareness survey of our customers twice a year. In our last earning call, I mentioned our unaided brand awareness in November of 2019 was 37% and then 18 months later, right as we're exiting Q1, it was up to 51%. So we've seen a 14 point -- sorry, a 17 point increase -- 34% to 51%, a 17 increase in our unaided brand awareness. Much of that is obviously our core customer, but a lot of it is off of the millennial customer. And as we mentioned last quarter, we saw a 4 point increase in our millennial customer penetration year-over-year. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, that trend continued in Q2. So we think the work we're doing in marketing is broadening the aperture of consumers' understanding of Tractor Supply and driving unaided and aided awareness and kind of driving footsteps into our stores. As we said, we continue to have strong comp transactions across the board and we're really excited about the partnership with PVR. We think it's a category that resonates well with our customer and one with over 200 activities a year that we can do a lot of activation across the areas of the country where our customers are. And it will be a great partnership. As I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are also -- we have launched a large marketing campaign targeted towards the millennials. And up until now, the majority of our above-the-line marketing has been TV and kind of Facebook based. And on TV, it's really been around news media. And we think that's been very successful for our core customer. Those are the major places that they engage with media. The millennial customer, as we all know, engages in different types of media. They are on Pandora, Spotify, YouTube. And so what this led us do is actually create a very different creative concept called Welcome to Life Out Here, explaining who Tractor Supply is and then talk about those first two, three hobbies that they might engage in: backyard poultry, backyard gardening, pets, things like that. They are kind of starter categories, if you will, in Life Out Here. We're very excited about that work and the initial feedback from customers is outstanding. And just hats off to the marketing team for all the work they've done to really drive awareness of our business and drive footsteps into our store.\nChuck Cerankosky: Thank you, Hal\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird.\nPeter Benedict: Hi, good morning everyone. I will ask first questions here. The first, Kurt, your second half plan implies some negative incremental margins. I know you talked about some of the investments you are making etcetera. I'm just curious kind of your view on that, how that comes about. Maybe the -- give us an idea of maybe the magnitude of the gross margin decline or visioning relative to 2Q's 65% to 70% decline. And a follow-up would be just about your P&L flexibility as we look longer term in the event that sales to slow or even turn down a bit, what levers do you have to pull in that environment? Thanks so much.\nKurt Barton: Hey, Peter, thanks for the question. And two questions, margin second half and then our ability to be nimble and some of the profitability enhancement opportunity. So, on the second half, when we look at the operating margin, here's how we view it and frame it up. Our gross margin in the pandemic was really the source of the beat in the operating margin and we view the second half really about the gross margin performance. We anticipate Q3's gross margin performance where we've got more visibility to Q3 at this point, very much similar in line with the performance of Q2. As we get further into the second half of the year, we've taken a fairly prudent approach. There is more uncertainty beyond one more quarter and we've always given a little bit more certainty on the most recent or the most nearest quarter. For the second half, we've recognized -- or the fourth quarter, we've recognized supply chain disruptions, inflation factors, as well as the holiday season and what level of competitive nature. And so we've certainly reflected some of those uncertainties in the fourth quarter and the operating margin on the back half of the year really rides on our performance with the gross margin. And as I said earlier and second quarter shows, we've really been able to manage in this environment very well. The business is structurally very sound. We have a lot of confidence in our business in our back half and if some of the uncertainties don't play out, we acknowledge there is potentially some upside to the guidance that we've given. In regards to flexibility, we always have strong profit improvement process going on and a few of the factors that we are focused on right now where we've got some ability to be able to adjust would be in the supply chain. The work that we're doing to reduce stem miles and to continue to just lever the size of this organization drive efficiency in there, as well as our ability to be nimble on variable cost. If there is any sort of shift in the momentum of the business, we're able to shift very well in regards to variable costs in both distribution and stores to be able to adjust on that. We've got a solid profit improvement initiative that is driving some of the efficiencies and these are the active offsets that we have going on to be able to help us maintain operating margins well above the 2019 ranges while we're making important investments in the business.\nPeter Benedict: Right. Thanks so much.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Operator, maybe time for one more call.\nOperator: All right and your last question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in today. So, Kurt, you suggested in the past that the 100 basis points of gross margin expansion in 2020 was largely related to muted promo, low clearance environment. And now that we're halfway through this year and you've seen the environment more or less continue, can you just talk us through the long-term state of the gross margin line and to what extent the current 35% plus margin is the right way to think about this business or are there reasons to believe that the historical 34% range is more appropriate as promos and clearance inevitably return?\nKurt Barton: As we've said throughout this pandemic, to your point, we've seen over 100 basis points of our operating margin improvement over pre-pandemic really coming from gross margin as you mentioned. We've said that we anticipate, over time, as we cycle the pandemic, we expected somewhat normalization on some of those factors, the promo, the clearance. While we do anticipate and are very disciplined in holding to it everyday low pricing and giving our customers the best price we can, our long-term guidance assume some normalization. Now, we acknowledge that if -- with our guidance shows that a second year in 2021, we'll maintain operating margins of above that long-term target range. And so as we go -- as we get further through 2021, we certainly as we manage this business see as things start to normalize, we'll address the long-term expectations on gross margin, but we're going to always continue to offer strong everyday low pricing. We're going to focus on gaining market share and focus on driving unit growth. So price is going to be very important to us in leveraging the strength of the size of our business to have an efficient and nimble supply chain. So as we get more visibility, we will certainly acknowledge the gross margin, operating margin trends compared to our long-term target. For right now, we're not reaching beyond the visibility in certainly the next couple quarters.\nZach Fadem: And a quick follow-up on that. I mean, in 2019, you had $10 billion sales day. Last year that stepped up to $10.5 billion and this year it's going to step up more to $12 billion. Could you guys talk about the scale advantages you generated and how that should translate at the gross margin and operating expense lines?\nHal Lawton: Hey, Zack, it's Hal. And again thanks for joining the call today and I'd say a few things. First off, on the scale advantage, it'd say it dominantly gives us an opportunity in the market. With our 8 distribution centers, moving towards 11, the relationships that we have with our vendors and the meaningfulness of that, with the technology investments we're able to make. As an example every single one of our team members wears a Theater headset that really creates an optimal customer service experience in the stores. We're in the process of rolling out new handheld devices for every team member inside the stores as well. Those sorts of investments are enabled by our scale and they are enabled -- and they are really focused on helping us create, gain and capture market share and drive top line sales. And as we've talked many times, our main goal is to grow at a rate faster than the market. That's what's implied in our long-term operating trends and that's how our business is performing now. And then on the operating profit rate, as you said, we've been able to - our outlook is to hold SG&A flat or down and we've been - we've done that over the last six quarters and anticipate continuing to do so. So as we've grown our sales and grown our sales base, we've been reinvesting in the business, but doing at a point where we're not deleveraging there and it's - whether it's in the capital line or in our team member line, and we view our team members as a strategic asset. We are a customer service driven retailer. We are not a retailer where you're going to walk in, pick the item you want, go to a self-checkout and never talk to someone, loading your car yourself and drive away. We are going to help you pick the item, we're going to review, we're going to check you out and we're going to help you loaded in your car. And that that's going to drive sustainable share gain for us. And then on the gross margin rate side, I think we continue to be very pleased that the promotional environment remains very little to none and our inventory position where it is, we are just requiring little to no clearance activity as well. Our hope is that the longer that sustains itself, the more structural that becomes. Right now, we are in a high-cost freight and import environment. That's reflected in our guidance. And we're very pleased with the low promotional nature. It's allowing us to offset those freight and import to allow us to give the guidance that we've given right now. And fully acknowledge, as Kurt said that if sales remain at the rates that they are in Q2 that there would be upside to the guidance that we've given, but we just thought it was prudent at this point to kind of provide the guidance that we had just given the continued level of uncertainty out there.\nZach Fadem: Makes sense. Appreciate the context.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Great. Thank you everyone. Dan, that will wrap up our call today. So thank you for joining us. Marianne and I will be around for any questions and will look forward to speaking to you at our call in October.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference all. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. Our thanks go out to the more than 45,000 Tractor Supply team members for their ongoing commitment to each other, our customers in the Out Here lifestyle. The team has been through a lot together over the last 15 months as an essential needs-based retailer, including necessary but cumbersome health and safety measures, surging volumes, the roll out of our Life Out Here strategy, supply chain disruptions, numerous digital investments, and more. The team has risen to each challenge to be there as the dependable supplier to our customers and the communities we call home. Thank you to the team for another great quarter. I would also like to say thank you to our vendor and supply chain partners as we work together to overcome the challenges in the global supply chain network. Together, we were able to support our customers as the dependable supplier for their Out Here lifestyle. Over the first 12 months of the pandemic, through the first quarter of 2021, our sales grew approximately 35%, or $3 billion. In the second quarter of 2021, as we are now comping the comp, we are pleased this momentum and all of the underlying trends have remained and continue to sustain. Looking at the second quarter. The Tractor Supply team delivered a very strong performance that exceeded our expectations as we achieved a 10.5% comparable store sales growth for the quarter and a 41% two-year stack. Our results prove yet again Tractor Supply's unique competitive advantages. Our relentless focus on being the dependable supplier for the Out Here lifestyle is embedded in our purpose as a company. Our Life Out Here strategy is still in the early days. We are seeing positive trends from our initiatives. We are excited by the momentum. We remain committed to investing in our team members as we believe they are a key competitive differentiator with our customers. Just last month, we increased pay for nearly 27,000 of our tenured hourly store team members and also raised our minimum wage to $11.25 per hour. Our team members continue to make Tractor Supply a special place that it is. Investing in our team members is not only the right thing to do, it is also a way to recognize their role in driving our business forward. Now, turning to our results for the second quarter of 2021. Our net sales grew approximately 13.4%. Comparable store sales grew 10.5%, driven by a comparable average ticket increase of 6% and transaction count increase of 4.5%. Diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $3.19. Importantly, the underlying foundation of our business is robust. For the quarter, every week had positive comps. Our growth was broad-based across regions and product categories. We continue to gain share across all categories, online and in stores. For instance, in Q2, we experienced comparable store growth in our consumable, usable, and edible categories that was well above our overall comparable store sales. E-commerce recorded its largest-ever quarter of sales. The work we have done over the last year to improve our e-commerce capabilities have certainly resonated with our customers. And just under a year, our mobile app already has more than 1.6 million downloads and now represents over 10% of our e-commerce sales. Given our strong performance year-to-date, coupled with our outlook for the balance of the year, we are raising our sales and earnings guidance for the year. Kurt will share more details on our revised outlook later in the call. Regarding our pending acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home that we announced in February, we are working cooperatively with the FTC on their second request. We look forward to the benefit this transaction will offer customers with improved product and competitive pricing. We have previously shared key observations of our customer behaviors based on our market data and research, and I would like to update you on that today. Overall, our customer metrics remain very healthy, with both traffic and spending increasing at a balanced rate. So let's run through some of the insights that are most relevant. First, we are seeing broad, continued strength across our customer base. More customers than ever are shopping Tractor Supply and these customers are making more trips than ever and are spending more money per trip than ever. We are seeing strong retention of customers that have shopped us over the last 12 months. Our retention rates continue to run above historical trends. The conversion of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program to a points-based rewards is resonating with our customers. Year-over-year, we've added nearly 5 million new members to the program. In our Neighbor's Club members, they are spending about 3 times the rate of non-members and they are comping at a rate well above the chain average. Neighbor's Club members accounted for about 65% of our sales and that's a step-up from where we've been running prior to the relaunch of the program. We've grown our high-value customer base in the program by about 15% year-to-date, with customers migrating upward in spending, significantly outpacing any downward spending. The retention rate of our most valuable customers is running north of 95%. New customers are joining the Neighbor's Club program at a rate of nearly 30%, significantly above the rate from last year. And the new customers we are acquiring as compared to our core customers are continuing to skew younger. We're seeing significant growth in our millennial shoppers. Our trends this quarter for the customer age cohorts of 18 years to 45 years old were in line with the first quarter. We continue to believe that the growth in this customer segment has staying power. Much like last quarter, the types of trends we're seeing can simply be described as once in a generation. We believe key aspects to our customer service such as a convenient place to shop, product assortment, legendary customer service, and in-stock levels are important to keeping these existing and new customers engaged with our brand. On the macro front, the economy remained strong and key trends continue to work in our favor, such as rural revitalization, trip consolidation, omnichannel adoption, and a self-reliant lifestyle movement, including DIY trends and hobbies like gardening, backyard poultry, and pet adoption. While the cost environment remains elevated across import, domestic freight, commodities, and labor wages, the merchant team has been aggressively advocating for our customers. Where necessary, we are taking price increases to pass through some of the cost pressures that we cannot offset. We are closely monitoring the price elasticity to ensure that we are focused on product unit trends. The team is doing an excellent job navigating this environment. Over the past few months, we have navigated unprecedented conditions. As the country opens back up, the Out Here lifestyle remains incredibly relevant. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt to review the quarter in more depth and our outlook before I come back to give insight on our Life Out Here strategy and other drivers of the second half of 2021. Thanks, Kurt. Tractor Supply has thrived over the last 15 months. We continue to operate from a position of strength and are committed to investing in the business. Our Life Out Here strategy is designed to capitalize on the attractive opportunity that we see in our nearly $110 billion total addressable market. We are transforming our stores through our Project Fusion remodel and side lot transformation, optimizing our technology in store and online and investing in how we operate our stores. I am incredibly proud of the progress the team has made in advancing our strategic priorities, especially amid a global pandemic and running the business at an elevated rate. So, let me share with you an update on how a few of our comp initiatives are progressing. I'll start with the field activity support team. The 1,200-plus person organization is designed to improve store labor productivity. Example task of the FAST team include execution of merchandising programs like center court, end-caps, clip strips, planogram resets, seasonal programs and our sales driving initiatives. Rolled out in the third quarter of last year, this team has made great progress in improving execution of our merchandising activity, which represents the second largest body of work for our store team members. Year-to-date, the execution of task by the FAST team is running at 97% or nearly 33 points higher than our base year of 2019. The FAST team is allowing the store teams to spend more time on customer service and improve their in-store execution. We believe the FAST team will continue to contribute to comparable store sales well into the future. Turning next to our Project Fusion store remodel program, recall, our Project Fusion is our state of the art space productivity program designed to enhance the customer experience in our mature store base and give new customers that may not have shopped with us in the past more reasons to visit. We now have more than 160 stores in the new layout and the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Our customers are taking note of things like the improved shopping experience in our remodel and specifically in our customer intercept surveys, they are calling out better organization, improved merchandise selection, cleaner and brighter and easier to navigate factors. While the majority of the remodel have been completed more recently, we are very pleased with the early read of our customer response and the comp lift of the remodel is running in line with our expectations. Given the size of our store base, this is a multiyear opportunity to continually refresh our store base and further drive comp sales. Another component of our space productivity program is the transformation of our side lot. Typically, there is as much space outside of our stores in the side lot as we had inside the store. The productivity of this space is substantially below the chain average. We are in the midst of a multi-year project to transform our side lot with an expanded product offering and an enhanced shopping experience. With this investment, the side lot spaces leverage to offer a wider product offering in the lawn and garden categories, enter new categories, and offer greater convenience through the expansion of our buy online, pickup at store capabilities for drive-thru pickup. We also continue to see a positive halo effect from the garden center to the existing store and vice versa. Addition of product categories, increased user shopping, and new services provides us with even more ways to continue to keep our existing customers engaged at Tractor Supply and attract new customers to the brand. Our ability to drive higher sales per square foot through the transformation of our side lot remains a significant opportunity. We currently have about 60 side lot transformations completed and we anticipate having greater than 150 complete as we exit 2021. In these early remodels, we are learning a great deal about our customers' appetite for our expanded lawn and garden assortment and we are even more excited than we embarked on the initial test pilot. The team has done a great job laying the foundation of our Life Out Here strategy as we scale our transformational initiatives. Beyond our multi-year strategic initiative, at Tractor Supply, we are always focused on having the seasonally appropriate offerings to support our customers. Wrapping up the summer season, we're exiting the quarter with clean inventory with a seasonal changeover. We continue to focus on enhancing our product offerings for the transition to the important fall and winter season. Across all areas of the store and online, we have fall-centric merchandising and marketing plans in place to keep our customers engaged. Whether it's the launch of our Pet Appreciation Week in September to the roll out of our Deer Hunting planograms set, or our focus on heating products for the change in temperature, our customers know that they can count on Tractor Supply for the relevant products that they need to live Life Out Here. We are leveraging new items and innovation across grilling, safes, and home and decor. In addition, Ridgecut, our exclusive brand of performance workwear will be expanded across new categories and into women's workwear. These product expansions are relevant to both new and existing customers and will help retain our growing customer base. Across all parts of the store, we have exciting products for the fall and winter as we shift gears to ramp up for our customers' need to care for their land, home, animals and pets as colder weather comes. On the marketing front, we are making continued investments to drive our brand awareness. As part of our plans, we are excited to announce a new multi-year partnership to be the official Life Out Here partner for the Professional Bull Riders effective this season. The partnership includes the flagship presence on the PBR tour that host over 200 events per year, a Tractor Supply branded broadcast boost during the pre-show on CBS and in-arena broadcast activation and local customer activation. PBR will also produce and distribute custom content for our social media channels. We are very excited to support our customers' passion for this dynamic and rapidly growing sport. Again, on marketing, given the strong millennial trends we've been experiencing, we're investing in marketing to continue to attract and nurture this important demographic. Given that the millennial customer cohort may not be as familiar with our brand, we are executing marketing plans to introduce Tractor Supply to this next generation of customers. Just last month, we launched a new campaign targeting millennials' immediate channels like Pandora, YouTube and other streaming services. That campaign is called Welcome to Life Out Here and introduces this new audience to what lies ahead in our stores and the lifestyle we help support. The focus is on key categories such as pet, backyard poultry, gardening and self-reliance. With the primary goal to drive awareness, the millennial campaign has delivered significant impression since the launch. Early results show best in class performance in ad recall and awareness relative to traditional benchmarks. We believe this indicates that we are resonating with this audience and it is driving consideration for Tractor Supply. To summarize, we've delivered strong results year-to-date and made significant progress with our strategic initiatives. We have confidence that our strategy and execution will allow us to continue to build a stronger Tractor Supply. With our purposeful actions, we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger company. It's an exciting time at Tractor Supply. My appreciation goes out to each and every one of our more than 45,000 Tractor Supply team members for their dedication to our mission and value. And with that, operator, we would now like to open the line for questions. Steve, of our now 21 million-plus Neighbor's Club members. And like kind of all loyalty programs, we try to -- as we created in this case three tiers, we tried to kind of reasonably distribute it with kind of a decreasing proportion across each of the three buckets. And then we also tried to create tier levels that would naturally encourage upward migration and discourage downward migration. I would say a few things. As we talked about on the call, our Neighbor's Club members now account for over 65% of our sales. Our retention rate on our Neighbor's Club members is over 80%, very strong retention rate on an annualized basis. And as we said, our highest -- our third tier of spending, which is the -- the Neighbor's Club Premium Plus, the retention rates there are over 95%. So we're seeing significant upward migration. We're seeing reduced downward migration. And the final thing I'll make a mention of is that our Neighbor's Club members, they make two more trips quarter on average than our non-Neighbor's Club members. And our Neighbor's Club members had spent over $1,000 a year. We've got almost $2.5 million of those and that's increasing kind of on a daily basis. So, it's a very robust program with its 21-plus million members. We've seen over 5 million members join us in the last 12 months. We're seeing outstanding retention. We're seeing excellent migration. As we migrate them, the retentions are holding and actually improving, and we've seen a significant positive response to the roll out of the new program. As mentioned in our prepared remarks, since the roll out of the program, our Neighbor's Club members are significantly outcomping our overall chain average. Yes. So our customer repeat shopping trends continue to remain very high. New customer retention rates continue to hover in that kind of 50-ish percent similar to last quarter and the previous quarters. And our customer -- our new customer counts were only slightly below our new customer counts from Q2 2020. And so for us, there's a lot of good news on the customer side. We saw 11 million last year. We saw 2.6 million, nearly 3 million in Q1. We're seeing kind of 50%-plus retention rates on those new customers. The way -- kind of an interesting way to think about it is, on the 11 million new customers we saw last year, 6 million have shopped with us again and 3 million of those joined the Neighbor's Club program. And so that's just -- if you think about that walk just some outstanding metrics retention, conversion to the Neighbor's Club program. And then again this quarter, we are seeing new customer counts nearly the same as the second quarter of 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic. Thanks, Steven. Yes. Hey, Simeon, how are you? I'd start out with -- at the highest level, I'd say, there still continues to be a lot of uncertainty in the United States economy and globally, whether that's on -- certainly as it relates to COVID, the delta variant, the implications that has on mobility and on customer shopping behaviors. I'd say, if you track back to our October enhanced earnings day last year, kind of implied a bit in the graphic Kurt showed with a bit more of a return to normal mentality at some point that was more abrupt in nature. And I'd say, I think as we're all watching how COVID's playing out, that's certainly not the case. And so I'd also say that our business continues to evolve. And if you think back to them, we were talking about 50-50 on structural versus transitory in terms of trends. And I think we'd lean more towards structural now in the way we view our trend. If you think about pet, if you think about the millennial customer, if you think about homesteading, kind of rural revitalization, categories like poultry as an example. So last year, as we've said several times, we sold 11 million birds, half of those were to new customers. We're seeing, as mentioned by Kurt in his prepared remarks, outstanding retention of those customers last year that shopped with us on poultry coming back again this year. In fact, our retention rate is higher than any other animal feed or pet. So, I mean, it just shows you that the trends that began last year are really resonating and resilient and that momentum that we're seeing with our customers and in our business and with the lifestyle -- the Out Here lifestyle that we appeal to is holding incredibly strong. And I think in my prepared remarks I talked about the fact that between Q2 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021, we had grown $3 billion and 34% comps. And we were kind of coming into Q2, I think like many companies with certainly us wondering how we would comp the comp and we had guided to kind of flattish at the beginning of the year for that and perhaps even a little down and finished with a plus 10.5%, certainly exceeded our expectations. And it's really all about the underlying trends, the strength in our consumer behavior, new customers and the appeal of that Out Here lifestyle. And I think there is still a lot of uncertainty in the out years and quarters, but I would say we feel more confident in the structural orientation of the trends than we did last October. Hey, Michael, how are you and thanks for joining our call this morning. Yes, I'll start with the fact that we're confident. We're taking share really across every major category that we have in the business, both in stores and online. If you look at the profile between new customers, existing customers, both are showing strong comp, transaction growth, average ticket growth, and as I said in our prepared remarks, more customers are shopping trucks more than ever, they are visiting us more frequently and they are shopping -- they are spending more when they are shopping us. What I would say is, we participate in a very attractive large $110 billion market, where our share kind of based on our new guidance would be barely above 10%. There is a lot of share gain out there and also a lot of share to still be competed with. We're dominantly very focused on our customer and just making sure that the initiatives and the actions that we take are out there to create the best customer experience that we can, whether that's investments in our team members to drive that legendary customer service or investments in inventory to ensure we're in stock for our customers. I would say, as it relates to the promotional environment, we've not -- we've had very little to no promotions in Q1 and Q2 of this year and that's our expectation really for the balance of the year. And I really expect the competitive environment to remain similar for no other reason because of the supply/demand situation that's out there. And the global supply chain is disrupted as I've seen it in my 25 plus years in retail and everyone is working hard to just keep inventory in their stores. And I think that mindset would prevail over any sort of promotional share push that anyone has. I would also just comment that we don't directly compete with really any primary retailer. Being a lifestyle retailer, one of our benefits is that we play across a handful of large categories that are uniquely tailored to our customer, but typically, when we are competing with other companies, it's on a one-off category basis and we really appeal to that whole lifestyle. But I don't anticipate an increase in the promotional environment in the market or certainly for us anywhere near on the near or medium term horizon. Yes, hey Chuck, how are you? And thanks for joining the call today. I'd start out with both Fusion and side lot. We are very pleased with the results. And we've made a lot of progress over the last six to nine months on both of these efforts. We've rolled out, as we mentioned, we've got over 160 Fusions done, over 60 side lot transformations done. In addition to the work on those individual stores, we've brought the project management in-house. We're reducing our construction times and lowering costs and we see lots of opportunity to continue to do that as we move forward. Particularly on the side lot, we've iterated on kind of the plans several times and keep optimizing the format every -- as we roll it out. But we are very pleased with the results, with the progress we made in both. On the results, what I'd say is, we typically, I think, kind of historically in retail, it's the same in all my experiences. You start to really get a good feel for how the remodel lift is playing out kind of three to four months after the store kind of reopens and the remodels and complete. Most of our remodels haven't been open that long. So we're really kind of waiting over the next three to six months to start to see how that data set plays out. But what I'd say is, for the stores that have been open kind of over that period of time, they are at the levels that we anticipated in our initial business case. And we have more of those on the Fusion than we do on the side lot. But we're very pleased with the results of both projects. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the customer excitement around us becoming more of a destination in garden has been more significant than we even anticipated and we are even more bullish on that as we move forward. As it relates to the penetration of the kind of how long, we'll -- I think you can expect to hear us share more of that over time. But I'd say directionally over about a five-year time frame, you should think about kind of the Fusion stores for the most -- the vast majority of our stores having Fusion and on side lot really around that 60% to 70%. I think we're feeling more bullish around getting more of our store base done with Fusion than maybe were even six months ago, just the way that project is going, the cost that we're doing at it. They were doing it for the early read on the lift we're seeing and then the need just to continue to kind of remodel our store base. I'd start with our -- our business has over the last 15, 18 months now has remained incredibly consistent and we've said that on a number of calls, consistent across regions, consistent in category trends, consistent week to week, consistent month to month. As we said, all 13 weeks of this past quarter were positive comps, obviously all three months were positive comps. We exited June with strong momentum and even as we certainly -- as a nation, as we've seen this delta variant pickup, we've not seen any impact on our trends whether at a national level or at a regional level and that's very similar to what we observed last year and I think it's almost -- I hate to say, but I think the lack of mobility sometimes driven by these outbreaks actually plays to the benefit of Tractor Supply. I think it's demonstrated that when folks are spending more time at their homes with their families, their pets, their animals, their land, they buy and Tractor Supply to be kind of that one-stop shop resource for them to continue all those hobbies that they love and they are just spending more time doing those hobbies. And so while we certainly want and wish the country to return to normal as fast as possible, the delta variant, we don't see it as a potential threat. If anything, maybe some upside to it from our business results -- from a business results perspective. We want to own Life Out Here and we think we have the credibility to do so and are viewed that way by our customers. And as I mentioned in -- we do an awareness survey of our customers twice a year. In our last earning call, I mentioned our unaided brand awareness in November of 2019 was 37% and then 18 months later, right as we're exiting Q1, it was up to 51%. So we've seen a 14 point -- sorry, a 17 point increase -- 34% to 51%, a 17 increase in our unaided brand awareness. Much of that is obviously our core customer, but a lot of it is off of the millennial customer. And as we mentioned last quarter, we saw a 4 point increase in our millennial customer penetration year-over-year. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, that trend continued in Q2. So we think the work we're doing in marketing is broadening the aperture of consumers' understanding of Tractor Supply and driving unaided and aided awareness and kind of driving footsteps into our stores. As we said, we continue to have strong comp transactions across the board and we're really excited about the partnership with PVR. We think it's a category that resonates well with our customer and one with over 200 activities a year that we can do a lot of activation across the areas of the country where our customers are. And it will be a great partnership. As I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are also -- we have launched a large marketing campaign targeted towards the millennials. And up until now, the majority of our above-the-line marketing has been TV and kind of Facebook based. And on TV, it's really been around news media. And we think that's been very successful for our core customer. Those are the major places that they engage with media. The millennial customer, as we all know, engages in different types of media. They are on Pandora, Spotify, YouTube. And so what this led us do is actually create a very different creative concept called Welcome to Life Out Here, explaining who Tractor Supply is and then talk about those first two, three hobbies that they might engage in: backyard poultry, backyard gardening, pets, things like that. They are kind of starter categories, if you will, in Life Out Here. We're very excited about that work and the initial feedback from customers is outstanding. And just hats off to the marketing team for all the work they've done to really drive awareness of our business and drive footsteps into our store. Hey, Zack, it's Hal. And again thanks for joining the call today and I'd say a few things. First off, on the scale advantage, it'd say it dominantly gives us an opportunity in the market. With our 8 distribution centers, moving towards 11, the relationships that we have with our vendors and the meaningfulness of that, with the technology investments we're able to make. As an example every single one of our team members wears a Theater headset that really creates an optimal customer service experience in the stores. We're in the process of rolling out new handheld devices for every team member inside the stores as well. Those sorts of investments are enabled by our scale and they are enabled -- and they are really focused on helping us create, gain and capture market share and drive top line sales. And as we've talked many times, our main goal is to grow at a rate faster than the market. That's what's implied in our long-term operating trends and that's how our business is performing now. And then on the operating profit rate, as you said, we've been able to - our outlook is to hold SG&A flat or down and we've been - we've done that over the last six quarters and anticipate continuing to do so. So as we've grown our sales and grown our sales base, we've been reinvesting in the business, but doing at a point where we're not deleveraging there and it's - whether it's in the capital line or in our team member line, and we view our team members as a strategic asset. We are a customer service driven retailer. We are not a retailer where you're going to walk in, pick the item you want, go to a self-checkout and never talk to someone, loading your car yourself and drive away. We are going to help you pick the item, we're going to review, we're going to check you out and we're going to help you loaded in your car. And that that's going to drive sustainable share gain for us. And then on the gross margin rate side, I think we continue to be very pleased that the promotional environment remains very little to none and our inventory position where it is, we are just requiring little to no clearance activity as well. Our hope is that the longer that sustains itself, the more structural that becomes. Right now, we are in a high-cost freight and import environment. That's reflected in our guidance. And we're very pleased with the low promotional nature. It's allowing us to offset those freight and import to allow us to give the guidance that we've given right now. And fully acknowledge, as Kurt said that if sales remain at the rates that they are in Q2 that there would be upside to the guidance that we've given, but we just thought it was prudent at this point to kind of provide the guidance that we had just given the continued level of uncertainty out there."

            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call today. As Hal shared many details on the second quarter, in my time on the call today, I would like to go into some of the specifics around our financial performance and our increased outlook for the full year. We are very pleased with our performance. These results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business and our strategic initiatives. For the quarterly cadence, April and June were the strongest months of the comp store sales performance. All geographic regions and all major merchandising categories had comp store sales growth. We believe the underlying health of our business is structurally advantaged. A great example of this is the strength in our consumable, usable, and edible products. Our C.U.E. products represent the strength of our core business and what drives trips to the store. For the fifth consecutive quarter in a row, C.U.E. had comp store sales growth above 15%. Key subcategories such as poultry, livestock feed, and dry dog food were among the strongest categories with comp sales all greater than 25%. Of note, we are seeing strong retention rates of our new customers across every species of livestock and companion animal. For example, poultry, a hallmark homesteading category for Tractor Supply has the highest retention rate of the animal species for new customers and new to the category. Our big ticket categories, which were going against significant growth in the prior year, continue to have strong comp sales performance above the chain average. This was driven by strength in zero-turn mowers, safes, utility vehicles and trailers. Lastly, inflation contributed about 350 basis point to 400 basis point to comparable store sales in the quarter. Our second quarter gross margin rate was 35.8%, a decrease of 67 basis points. Year-over-year, the gross margin drivers were principally three items. First, higher freight cost that all of retail is experiencing. Second, an initial impact from the relaunch of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. And third, a more normalized C.U.E. product mix. Our price management program partially offset these factors as we look to mitigate the impact of inflation and other cost pressures. Consistent with our guidance, we received approximately 40 basis points benefit from vendor funding for the field activity support teams or FAST initiative, which was launched in the second half last year. Of note, we continue to see favorability in the frequency and depth of promotions as we are committed to being true to our everyday low pricing strategy and continue to see strong demand for our product categories. For comparison, our gross margin rate this quarter was still about 90 basis points above our Q2 2019 rate of 34.9%. Our second quarter SG&A expense ratio, including depreciation and amortization, improved by 6 basis points to 22.3%. This improvement was primarily attributable to lower COVID-19 pandemic response costs and decreased incentive compensation, as well as good leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the increase in our comparable store sales. Partially offsetting this leverage were higher wage rates, additional store labor hours to ensure we are providing great customer service, and investments in our Life Out Here strategic initiatives. The offset to our FAST initiative benefiting gross margin was approximately 40 basis points of incremental SG&A expense with the labor costs for the team. Much like our gross margin rate, our SG&A performance compares favorably to Q2 2019 when our SG&A expense ratio was 22.7%. Operating profit increased 8.5%, with operating profit margin of 13.5% on the quarter. Net income was $370 million, an increase of 9.3%. Diluted EPS was $3.19, an increase of 10%. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong, merchandise inventories were $1.99 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing a 14% increase in average inventory per store. The increase principally reflects growth to support the robust sales trends along with the impact of inflation. Our supply chain and our vendors are executing at a very high level to meet the customers' current demands. We finished the quarter with $1.41 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings on our $500 million revolver. Moving now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021, looking ahead, while the trends in our business provide additional confidence in the structural nature of the tailwind, we remain aware that the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccine roll out can have further impact on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results. There is still some measure of uncertainty we continue to plan for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes and we will remain nimble and adjust as necessary. Our updated guidance reflects the strong result in the half of the year and the positive momentum we see in our businesses continuing into the second half of 2021. Please note that the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. So against the backdrop of what we know today, we are updating our guidance to a net sales range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion with comparable store sales growth in the range of 11% to 13%. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.7% to 9.9% of sales, a step up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $7.70 to $8. This compares to our previous earnings range of $7.05 to $7.40 per diluted share. We have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business. We are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide legendary customer service to meet our customers' expectations. While we continue to lap challenging sales and earnings comps, we expect positive sales comp in both the third and fourth quarter with the third quarter a few points higher than the fourth quarter. Please keep in mind, we will continue to cycle strong gross margin performance of the prior year where we benefited from minimal promotional or clearance activity as well as favorable product mix where C.U.E. products represented a smaller portion of sales. Much like the results in the second quarter, we are expecting gross margin decline in the back half of the year due to higher transportation costs and continued strength in the C.U.E. products. Our guidance assumes promotional activity comparable to last year in Q3, with Q4 seeing some shift back to normalizing promotions during the holiday season. While we are dealing with significantly higher transportation costs, a mix shift to C.U.E. and cost of goods increases, we continue to see benefit from a pullback in promotions and are seeing less price elasticity from consumers as we adjust prices. We believe we are effectively navigating impacts to our gross margin. The strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a hallmark of Tractor Supply. We have raised our outlook for capital spending to now be in the range of $500 million to $600 million to reflect higher construction and raw material costs for store projects and increased technology investments for the customer experience. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchase. For 2021, we remain on track for anticipated share repurchases in a range of $700 million to $800 million. This year will mark a milestone with approximately $1 billion returned to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and dividends. To wrap up, we are very pleased with our performance in the first half of the year and see positive momentum carrying into the second half of 2021. We continue to build relevance and market share both today and over time. We are excited about the investments ahead of us to better serve our customers from new stores, Project Fusion remodels and our side lot transformation. We are strengthening our supply chain and growing our digital commerce, all in support of our commitment to driving strong shareholder returns for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal. Simeon, this is Kurt. On the cadence over the next few years, as we pointed out, back in October when we launched our new long-term targets in the Life Out Here strategy, we said that we've got consistency in our investment, in the existing stores as we drive productivity with Fusion and side lot, but that where there may be some variation would be on the supply chain as we grow our supply chain, particularly new distribution centers. And so, as you've heard us in the last couple of quarters emphasize the importance of our investment in our supply chain, we are looking to accelerate and would see us shifting some of the supply chain investments earlier in the next few years. And so there may be higher than average in 2021, 2022, even 2023, but over the period of time, it still averages out about the five-year expectation that we gave. And the important thing is the recognition or our confidence in the structural nature of this business and therefore the importance of our timing of investments in the supply chain. So I see 2021 and 2022 pretty consistent in potential on capital as we emphasize ensuring the strength of our supply chain. Yes, Michael, this is Kurt. You stated the results accurate on the last quarter. Let me give quick backdrop and that will lead towards the back half, but we entered the year expecting 100 to 200 basis points of retail inflation throughout the year that quickly produced in Q1 closer to 300 basis points, principally from commodities. And then as we shifted into Q2, at the 350 to 450 basis points of retail benefit from inflation. One, it demonstrates the ability, as Hal mentioned, to be able to adjust pricing appropriately. But the increase in Q2 over Q1 was principally related to transportation costs and other non-commodity type based cost increases. We see in the back half of the year staying at elevated levels. And we would anticipate that the numbers in Q2, it would be at that level and potentially at moderately higher levels throughout the back half. And in this inflation environment, I always like to remind that our merchants in our business, we deal with inflation and deflation every year and they are managing this excellent and we feel we've got the ability right now in the consumer sentiment, the less price elasticity in their behavior to be able to manage the inflation environment very well throughout this year. Hey, Peter, thanks for the question. And two questions, margin second half and then our ability to be nimble and some of the profitability enhancement opportunity. So, on the second half, when we look at the operating margin, here's how we view it and frame it up. Our gross margin in the pandemic was really the source of the beat in the operating margin and we view the second half really about the gross margin performance. We anticipate Q3's gross margin performance where we've got more visibility to Q3 at this point, very much similar in line with the performance of Q2. As we get further into the second half of the year, we've taken a fairly prudent approach. There is more uncertainty beyond one more quarter and we've always given a little bit more certainty on the most recent or the most nearest quarter. For the second half, we've recognized -- or the fourth quarter, we've recognized supply chain disruptions, inflation factors, as well as the holiday season and what level of competitive nature. And so we've certainly reflected some of those uncertainties in the fourth quarter and the operating margin on the back half of the year really rides on our performance with the gross margin. And as I said earlier and second quarter shows, we've really been able to manage in this environment very well. The business is structurally very sound. We have a lot of confidence in our business in our back half and if some of the uncertainties don't play out, we acknowledge there is potentially some upside to the guidance that we've given. In regards to flexibility, we always have strong profit improvement process going on and a few of the factors that we are focused on right now where we've got some ability to be able to adjust would be in the supply chain. The work that we're doing to reduce stem miles and to continue to just lever the size of this organization drive efficiency in there, as well as our ability to be nimble on variable cost. If there is any sort of shift in the momentum of the business, we're able to shift very well in regards to variable costs in both distribution and stores to be able to adjust on that. We've got a solid profit improvement initiative that is driving some of the efficiencies and these are the active offsets that we have going on to be able to help us maintain operating margins well above the 2019 ranges while we're making important investments in the business. As we've said throughout this pandemic, to your point, we've seen over 100 basis points of our operating margin improvement over pre-pandemic really coming from gross margin as you mentioned. We've said that we anticipate, over time, as we cycle the pandemic, we expected somewhat normalization on some of those factors, the promo, the clearance. While we do anticipate and are very disciplined in holding to it everyday low pricing and giving our customers the best price we can, our long-term guidance assume some normalization. Now, we acknowledge that if -- with our guidance shows that a second year in 2021, we'll maintain operating margins of above that long-term target range. And so as we go -- as we get further through 2021, we certainly as we manage this business see as things start to normalize, we'll address the long-term expectations on gross margin, but we're going to always continue to offer strong everyday low pricing. We're going to focus on gaining market share and focus on driving unit growth. So price is going to be very important to us in leveraging the strength of the size of our business to have an efficient and nimble supply chain. So as we get more visibility, we will certainly acknowledge the gross margin, operating margin trends compared to our long-term target. For right now, we're not reaching beyond the visibility in certainly the next couple quarters."

And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2021 is off to a great start for Tractor Supply. I\u2019m extremely proud and appreciative of the hard work by the more than 42,000 Tractor Supply and Petsense team members. Once again, they took care of each other and tirelessly served our customers who depend on us to live the Out Here lifestyle. I also want to thank all of our supply chain and vendor partners. We\u2019ve been operating in the COVID-19 environment for over a year now, and the Tractor Supply system has more than risen to the occasion as they strive to serve our mission and values every single day. While we anticipated that we would have our strongest growth of the year in the first quarter, our results were significantly ahead of our expectations. When you couple this performance with the continuing momentum we are seeing in the second quarter, the positive macro environment and our strong customer trends, we are adjusting our comp outlook to mid to high single-digit growth in 2021. Kurt will share more details on the improved financial outlook for the year across our key financial metrics. Throughout the pandemic, our utmost priority has been the health and safety of our team members and customers. We continue to incur significant incremental expense for items like paid time-off, mask and testing. We remain committed to following the advice of the CDC and other medical professionals to protect our team and customers. As we enter the vaccination phase, we are committed to helping our team members who choose to get vaccinated to do so. We are providing a onetime payment of $50 and allowing time-off as needed for all team members who elect to receive a COVID-19 vaccines. To further alleviate the barriers to receiving a vaccine, we have partnered with a third-party provider to facilitate on-site vaccination at our eight distribution centers and store support center. During the quarter, we also announced our entry into an agreement to acquire Orscheln Farm and Home, a retailer with 167 stores across 11 states. This is an exciting step for Tractor Supply as we look to expand our footprint in the Midwest with the high-quality assets of Orscheln Farm and Home. We have always had great respect for Barry Orscheln and team for the strong connection they have with customers in the communities they serve, along with their industry knowledge and capabilities. With our shared values and passion for the Out Here lifestyle, we look forward to bringing together our highly complementary cultures and teams to realize the long-term value and benefit that we expect this acquisition to deliver over time. As we previously disclosed, we received a second request from the FTC as part of their review of the transaction and are cooperating with that confidential review. Accordingly, we are limited in the comments we can make about the transition at this time. I hope you all saw our release this week with our updated ESG tear sheet for 2020, which provides new and updated performance metrics in context related to our environmental sustainability efforts, our commitment to our team members and communities and corporate governance. This report helps us provide detailed information and progress on our ESG journey. In addition, we laid out our commitment to provide new targets in the fall this year as it relates to our greenhouse gas emission plan and our aspirational goals for diversity, equity inclusion. These initiatives make great business sense for Tractor Supply. As a purpose-driven company, setting targets for ourselves creates long-term value and our potential to have a positive impact on the world. We remain committed to constant improvement on this journey. Now, let\u2019s turn to the business review for the first quarter of 2021. We had exceptional net sales gains of 42.5%, with comparable store sales up 38.6%. We materially benefited in the quarter from transitory factors such as stimulus spending, favorable weather and inflation. Importantly, however, the underlying foundation of our business is robust, and we\u2019re gaining share across all categories, online and in stores and also with existing customers and new customers. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club membership reached 20 million members strong. This is an important milestone for our loyalty program as we know that they are customers that shop us more frequently and they spend more money with us. We saw 2.5 million new customers shop with us in the quarter. And that\u2019s an increase of over 30% over last year. Reengaged customers also exhibited strong growth, up over 12% from the first quarter of 2020. And customer retention for both our new and reengaged customers continues to run above last year. We saw strong growth across all product categories and geographic regions of the country. Comps for each month of the quarter were above 30%. And our growth was well-balanced between transactions and ticket growth. The business, like the last few quarters, continues to be a very consistent and stable. For the fourth quarter, our e-commerce saw strong triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we did last year to improve our omnichannel capabilities continues to resonate with our customers. Ongoing improvements to the customer experience for better search capabilities and enhanced personalization are being recognized by our customers. As we\u2019ve experienced in the last several quarters, we continue to see strong performance and market share gains in our consumable, usable and edible categories with growth in the mid-20% range. More specifically, we continue to be very encouraged by the trends we\u2019re seeing within our pet and poultry categories, where we\u2019re driving shopping frequency and market share gains. Over the last 15 months, our unaided brand awareness scores are up 17 percentage points. I believe these type of metrics serve as leading indicators of our brand health and future spending patterns of our customers. We continue to execute our shift away from print advertising to brand building and digital marketing. We\u2019re currently airing our national TV spring advertising campaign that highlights the strength of Tractor Supply\u2019s offering to serve the seasonal needs of our customers to take care of their land, pets and animals. Overall, the strong first quarter highlighted the unique advantages that we have at Tractor Supply. Our team members delivered exceptional results in a generation-defining moment. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kurt to discuss some of the details of the first quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. We\u2019re excited to be starting fiscal 2021 on such a positive note as we performed well ahead of our expectations. Let me share some further color on our strong first quarter results and our upward revisions to our guidance for the year. Our record first quarter earnings were driven by positive momentum in all areas of the business. Comp sales increased 38.6% as the trends we experienced over the past year continued throughout the first quarter of 2021. Traffic increased 21%, and average ticket grew 17.6%. All geographic areas reported sales gains of at least 30% positive comparison to last year. Big ticket purchases had robust growth, up strong double digits that well outpaced our average comp sales increase. Safes, fencing, utility vehicles, trailers and outdoor power equipment, such as the zero-turn mowers, were some of the notable gainers in the quarter. As Hal mentioned, we did benefit from more transitory factors like stimulus payments, favorable weather and inflation that had a positive impact on the sales in the quarter. In total, we estimate that about one-third of our comparable store sales growth in the first quarter is attributable to these transitory factors. Our best estimate is that more favorable weather for the quarter contributed about 400 basis points to comps. Both January and February were colder than last year, with February being the coldest month in 30 years, while the last few weeks of March turned to a favorable spring weather in many of our markets. We also saw retail price inflation, primarily in commodities, which contributed around 300 basis points to our comp sales performance. The impact of stimulus payments is more difficult to quantify, but we recognize that consumers had more cash to spend during the quarter, and we believe Tractor Supply benefited from this in Q1. Towards the end of the quarter, in line with the timing of stimulus payments, we saw customer spending at elevated levels, especially in big ticket items. Our best estimate is that stimulus contributed somewhere in the mid-single digits to our first quarter sales comps. Even factoring in the transitory benefits, we believe the underlying health of our business is structurally advantaged. Trends towards higher spending and consumables continued through the quarter with pet, bird and livestock feeds showing significant growth from last year. We saw growth in the quarter despite lapping last year\u2019s strong stock up buying that occurred late in the first quarter of 2020 at the start of the pandemic. As we\u2019ve said for the past few quarters, we see the growth in our CUE categories as more evidence of an enduring consumer shift to higher pet adoptions and ownership, new customer hobbies like backyard poultry and gardening, along with trip consolidation. For the first quarter, our gross margin increased by 148 basis points to 35.2% of sales, which resulted in gross profit increasing to nearly $984 million in the first quarter. This quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. Consistent with the trends since the beginning of the pandemic, this quarter\u2019s increase was primarily driven by a lower level of sales promotions and clearance activity. We also benefited from a positive product mix towards higher-margin categories. And consistent with our guidance, we received approximately 40 basis points of benefit from vendor funding for the field activity support teams, or FAST initiative. These factors were partially offset by higher transportation costs, which was a headwind for gross margin. Domestic and import freight costs have increased significantly as well as fuel costs. And we expect these trends to continue throughout 2021. SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 27%, an improvement of 103 basis points. This improvement was primarily attributable to significant leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the strong increase in our comparable store sales. This leverage was partially offset by three factors: Higher incentive compensation, given the strong sales performance; COVID-related costs; and higher operating expenses to support the elevated volumes. COVID-related costs were approximately $28 million, generally in line with prior quarters, as we continue to take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of our team members and customers. Additional overtime, temporary labor and other costs were also incurred to maintain high service levels. Operating profit dollars more than doubled compared to prior year to $231 million, an operating profit margin of 8.3%, an improvement of 251 basis points. Net income was $181 million, an increase of 117%. Diluted EPS was $1.55, representing an increase of 118% versus the first quarter of 2020. During the first quarter, we returned $314 million to shareholders through the combination of our share repurchases and dividends. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of about 2% in average inventory per store. This level of inventory is still lighter than we would like, given the momentum of the business. And we are working with our suppliers and our vendors to build stock to support this momentum. The added supply chain costs and freight expense necessary to rebuild inventory is reflected in our updated guidance we provided. Moving now to our guidance for 2021. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccine rollout will have on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results remains uncertain. We continue to plan for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes, remaining nimble and adjusting as necessary. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results from the first quarter and the positive momentum we see in our business continuing into the second quarter. While the current environment and momentum are both favorable, we recognize that COVID-19 pandemic is not completely behind us and that economic conditions can change quickly. Please keep in mind that the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. Against the backdrop of what we know today, we are updating our guidance to a net sales range of $11.4 billion to $11.7 billion, with comparable store sales growth of 5% to 8%. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.4% to 9.7% of sales, a step-up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $7.05 to $7.40. This compares to our previous earnings range of $6.50 to $6.90 per diluted share. Compared to our initial outlook for the year, our forecast does reflect higher transportation costs and product inflation. We experienced increasing pressures from these factors during the first quarter and expect them to continue to be a headwind throughout 2021. In addition, we have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business. We are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide legendary customer service to meet our customers\u2019 expectations. I want to share additional context on our outlook for the second quarter. While we begin to lap more challenging sales and earnings comps, we currently see sales momentum continue, partially fueled by stimulus payments. We expect a positive sales comp in the second quarter in the mid-single-digit range. Please keep in mind, we\u2019ll be cycling our strongest gross margin performance of the prior year in Q2, where we benefited from minimal promotional or clearance activity as well as a favorable product mix. We are expecting gross margin decline in Q2 due to higher transportation costs, a less favorable product mix and a slight return to promotional activity. We also anticipate a modest onetime headwind in the second quarter relating to the rollout of our enhanced Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program. In terms of SG&A for the second quarter, COVID-related expenses are expected to moderate from the Q1 levels, but are forecasted to be slightly higher than original expectations entering the year, along with higher labor cost to support these elevated volumes. For the second half of 2021, we anticipate tailwinds such as stimulus payments to moderate and performance to be more in line with our original guidance, expecting a modest decline in comp sales. Longer term, we continue to believe the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the halves of the year. As I\u2019ve stated before, a key component of our financial model is the strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. In January, we increased our annual dividend by 30% from $0.40 a share to $0.52. For 2021, we anticipate share repurchases in a range of $700 million to $800 million. In summary, it is an exciting time at Tractor Supply. We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and see positive momentum carrying into the second quarter. We see an opportunity to retain the loyalty of our longtime and newer customers by investing in our business to maintain everyday low prices and improve customer service, strengthen our supply chain and grow our digital commerce, all in support of our commitment to driving strong shareholder returns for the long term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thank you, Kurt. I\u2019d like to spend the next portion of the call covering some of the key customer trends we\u2019re seeing in the business, providing an update on our Life Out Here strategy and highlighting our spring programs. Our customer base is experiencing robust, broad-based shopping patterns that provide significant opportunities for growth. These types of trends can simply be described as once in a generation. We\u2019re seeing growth in all our customer segments and across all value tiers of spending with strong retention of existing and new customers. The fastest growth customer segment is our core farm and ranch. This segment is very healthy as rural economies, for the most part, were less impacted by the pandemic and are recovering at a steeper and more robust rate. Importantly, we\u2019re gaining wallet share with our core customer as our highest and medium spend customer tiers are outpacing our lower spend customer tier. As mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong new customer growth and notably, are also seeing strong customer retention. As an example, for our new customers from the first quarter of 2020 last year, more than 50% have returned to shop with Tractor Supply. This is about 300 basis points higher than the cohort from the first quarter of 2019. We are seeing significant growth in our millennial shoppers. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve seen a 400 basis-point shift in the customer age cohorts of 18 to 45 years old. This demographic has long resisted many of the traditional generational norms, things like household formation and homeownership. But, the pandemic has shocked this generation and accelerated their embracement of these types of activities. There continues to be a net migration out of urban areas, largely driven by the millennial segment. The most robust homeownership growth is in the millennial cohort, with the growth coming in suburban and rural areas. We believe the growth in this customer segment has staying power and could be a structural game changer for us. Another structural customer trend that is working to our advantage is the significant increase in pet-owning households and number of pets adopted. Compared to the overall U.S. household pet ownership of approximately two-thirds, our customers over-index in pet ownership by about 10 points. And our current survey work with our customers indicate 25% have recently acquired and adopted a new pet. New companion animal ownership acts as an annuity for our business as these puppies and kittens grow up and have growing life cycle needs. We\u2019re also uniquely positioned to offer a growing menu of services such as pet wash, vet clinics, prescriptions and televet services. Whether it is more food treats, toys, containment and more, the humanization of pet provides us with future opportunities for growth. These customer trends are an indication that we continue to benefit from the numerous tailwinds, such as pet ownership, the millennial urban exodus, backyard poultry, home standing and home as an oasis. We believe many of these consumer trends will be enduring shifts well into the future. Our brand momentum is stronger than ever and we\u2019re investing to ensure we continue to play offense in the context of these trends. We are making excellent progress on our Life Out Here strategy and initiatives. At the beginning of April, we announced the relaunch of our Neighbor\u2019s Club program to be even bigger and better. When we launched Neighbor\u2019s Club nationwide in 2017, our vision was to create a unique Out Here community for our customers and a place for them to connect with us. The Neighbor\u2019s Club has permitted us to show appreciation to our loyal customers and to accumulate actionable customer data that has allowed us to deliver to our customers more relevant and personalized communications. Over the last four years, our loyalty program has served us well to be able to thank participating customers for being loyal customers, provide rewards and special offers they value, learn more about their purchasing trends and interest and ultimately, increase customer loyalty to Tractor Supply stores. Today, our Neighbor\u2019s Club program has over 20 million members and is comprised of our most valuable customers. It is a perfect time to upgrade the program with the introduction of points and three tiers of status. Now, neighbors, can earn points on their purchases and redeem them for more rewards. They can earn their way to different levels, so that when they spend, they earn more. With the new features of Neighbor\u2019s Club, we believe we have more tools and features than ever to help facilitate upward migration and spending and mitigate downward migration of spending by our members. The changes to Neighbor\u2019s Club were specifically based on our customers\u2019 feedback. The new rewards and benefits of Neighbor\u2019s Club are relevant to the customers\u2019 lifestyle, such as trailer rentals and shipping benefits. We believe with the new Neighbor\u2019s Club benefits, we have an opportunity to support our customers in a more meaningful way. This, in turn, will provide us a platform for multiyear trajectory for growth as a clear business driver for us. More broadly, we are aggressively advancing our Life Out Here strategy. The FAST team is at scale and providing significant improvement in the execution of our merchandising initiatives. We continue to forecast about 150 to 200 Side Lot transformations to occur this year. As of today, we have over 40 stores operating and continue to refine our learnings for future build-outs, of which 35 are currently under construction. Project Fusion store remodels are also on track for completion of 150 to 200 stores this year. In addition, new stores are being built as Fusion stores with improved layout, signage, SKU expansion and adjacencies. While still early, we\u2019re very pleased with our customers\u2019 response to both the Side Lot transformation and the Project Fusion store layout. Now turning to spring. Our stores in e-commerce are well positioned to take advantage of the seasonal change to serve our customers. We remain committed to being the zero-turn headquarters with our market-leading assortment from Toro, Bad Boy and Cub Cadet. We have substantially expanded our assortment in grilling, raised bed garden and other backyard categories. And to capture share of wallet in the lawn and garden category, we have expanded our offerings on core products, like long handled tools, wheelbarrows, trailers and tillers. And Chick Days are underway with millions of customers relying on us for their poultry passions. Leveraging our localization efforts, we\u2019re expanding our tool crow to an additional 400 stores. And on the product innovation front, with Carhartt to open a new store within a store concept. This concept was created with our customer at the center of the shopping experience. And by partnering with Carhartt to double our selection, our stores have even more of what makes Tractor Supply a destination for workwear. The new store within a store concept will roll out in more than 100 Tractor Supply stores in 2021 with additional stores to be added next year. To wrap up, I couldn\u2019t be prouder of the Tractor Supply team as they\u2019ve remained agile in the face of a very challenging operating environment. My thanks and appreciation go out to each of them for helping to take care of each other and our customers, while operating in a record-setting pace. We have an incredibly strong business and foundation. We see more positive macro factors than we did at the beginning of the year. Customers are shopping with us in record numbers, and we\u2019re investing in multiple initiatives to retain them and provide more reasons to shop with us in the future. We participate in a large and attractive market that we\u2019re working to expand further with initiatives such as Side Lot that will add to our product offering. By doing the right thing for our team members and customers, we\u2019re executing our Life Out Here strategy and building a stronger company for our shareholders. Now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. All the new customer statistics are very helpful. Can you give us a sense for where you think those customers were shopping before Tractor Supply, or is it more likely they\u2019re just new to the farm and ranch retail industry, and as a result, you\u2019re grabbing a disproportionate share of those incremental new customers? And as part of that, can you give us a sense for how many of those new customers are shopping in the CUE categories, such that you think you\u2019ll be able to get those customers in the sustainable patterns of repeat purchases?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Good morning, Michael, and thanks for your question. As you mentioned, we\u2019ve seen a significant amount of new customers shopping with us over the last 12-plus months with above-average retention rates continuing to hold. And as we mentioned, over 50% of the Q1 2020 cohort has shopped us again in the last 12 months. So, very strong retention. When we look at the additional customer data, I\u2019d highlight two big drivers of the new customers. First would be in the core farm and ranch. And that very much is a market share gain, where these are customers that have land, have animals, have had -- our value proposition has appealed to them over time. And for a variety of reasons, they\u2019re choosing to now shop with Tractor Supply. And I think that has a lot to do with the investments we\u2019ve made in technology, the investments we\u2019ve made in safety and health and cleanliness in our stores and certainly, the focus we\u2019ve had on inventory and customer service. And then, the second thing I\u2019d bring up is kind of the millennial customer, which we highlighted in our prepared remarks. This segment had a very large increase as a percentage of our sales in Q1. And really, when we look at the data, it really is around the migration of people out of urban environments into suburban and rural environments. And that generation\u2019s starting to kind of take -- form households, buy homes, and as part of that, the Out Here lifestyle is part of the aspiration that they have when they moved out to the suburbia or when they moved out to rural America. And we do really feel like this is a structural trend that will continue to provide growth for us as we look out the balance of this year and beyond.\nMichael Lasser: My follow-up question is, if you unpack the math of your 5% to 8% comp guidance for the year, coupled with a mid-single-digit comp for the second quarter, it suggests that you\u2019ll run down, call it, 10% in the back half, at the midpoint of the range, which would be about 1,000 basis-point differential from where you\u2019re going to run in the second quarter on a -- at least, on a arithmetic two-year stack basis, even though the math gets all confusing at this point. Is it right to think that your -- the difference is all going to come from -- you\u2019re getting about 1,000 basis points of stimulus benefit in 2Q, and you probably won\u2019t get that in 3Q or 4Q, or is it more inflation? Weather -- how are you thinking about what\u2019s unique around the second quarter versus not necessarily in the back half?\nKurt Barton: Yes. Michael, this is Kurt. In regards to your question, I\u2019d really point to two things. We just finished first quarter. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we recognize that in this environment, there\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty. We\u2019ve got better visibility on the second quarter and still less visibility on certain factors in the second half. We don\u2019t have significantly greater visibility than we had from our original guidance. And so, that\u2019s one factor, as well as second quarter. As I mentioned, we believe that has some benefit from stimulus, and that begins to moderate in the back half. So, our guidance doesn\u2019t have significant shift from our original guidance on the back half of the year for those reasons.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimeon Gutman: My first question is on Side Lot and Fusion, and second will be a financial question. So, the first, I know it\u2019s early, and it might even be early -- of early to ask some of these questions on Fusion and Side Lot. I don\u2019t know how many real examples you have yet, but thinking about \u201822 and beyond. Any read that you can provide and how much more productive, even some of the handful of stores that you have are, how they performed, if any better, in the first quarter than the stores that haven\u2019t been touched at all?\nHal Lawton: Hey Simeon, good morning. This is Hal, and thanks for your question. I\u2019d start by just saying we are -- the Life Out Here strategy is off to an excellent start. We are -- across all of the initiatives that we have, they\u2019re all underway and getting excellent traction. As we highlighted, the two Neighbor\u2019s Club relaunched a month ago, off to an excellent start there. The FAST team, multiple months of maturation there, having a big impact. Fusion and Side Lot are early days, as we noted in our prepared remarks, we have implemented them in a large number of stores already. They\u2019ve had good customer reactions early on. And the sales performance is as we expected. And in our Q2 call and beyond, you can expect to hear more on performance of those from us as we get through the all-important spring time, and we\u2019re able to fully evaluate the results.\nSimeon Gutman: And then, the follow-up financial is on second quarter gross margins. Assuming the environment in terms of lack of markdown continues, that should still be a good source year-over-year. But Kurt, you mentioned the pressure that you expect. Is there any way you can quantify, relative -- or direction in terms of freight expense and some of the other headwinds just so we can gauge order of magnitude?\nKurt Barton: Yes. Simeon, to address gross margin, I\u2019d first point to a great basis point to look at is referring back to the drivers of Q2 last year that we\u2019re comping and then even reflecting on the Q1 drivers, and that\u2019s really a great way to reconcile to it. And the reason I\u2019d point that out is, last year, some of the drivers in Q2 that we\u2019re about to lap were with the pandemic, you saw transportation costs and certain commodity prices actually declining. And so, that was really a favorable item in there. We are now lapping that first quarter where there was really no promotional or clearance activity. In Q1, the factors that were drivers that we pointed out in Q1, such as the favorable product mix is the last quarter where before we start lapping some of that favorable product mix where the discretionary higher-margin items were a big portion of the mix. So, to give you the level of quantifying of it coming off of that basis, I\u2019d give you the four key factors, and I\u2019ll put it in the order of magnitude. Lapping those lower transportation costs with higher transportation costs right now would be the first. Lapping a favorable product mix in Q2 last year, where the discretionary higher-margin items were a much higher percent than Q would be second. The inflation impact and then followed by, as I mentioned, the onetime Neighbor\u2019s Club impact for launching the points and rewards-based program is a great way of summarizing it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nScot Ciccarelli: I have a follow-up on the new customer cohort. My question simply, can you guys quantify the comp impact that you\u2019ve been receiving from new and existing customers, whether it\u2019s this past quarter or the last couple?\nKurt Barton: Yes. Scot, this is Kurt. We started the pandemic seeing a strong growth in new customers, and we\u2019ve talked about that over the last three quarters. We continue to see a meaningful portion of our growth coming from new customers. And for the first quarter, when looking at the strength of our business, the new customers, both new customers that entered transacting with Tractor Supply in 2020 as well as new in first quarter really represent a key portion of the first quarter results in the high-single-digit range of our mix of the 38.6% comp.\nScot Ciccarelli: That\u2019s fantastic. And just wanted to clarify one other comment that you made earlier, Kurt. So, basically, you guys had much better than -- much better than expected results on 1Q. You\u2019re raising 2Q. You haven\u2019t changed back half from what your original anticipation was. Is that the right way to read it?\nKurt Barton: Scot, there\u2019s no real significant change in top line or other factors on the second half. We have certainly considered and recognized some key factors that we pointed out, such as inflation and some of the cost of doing the business. So, we\u2019ve factored that into our overall guidance, but no real meaningful shift in tailwinds or headwinds in our second half algorithm.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKate McShane: I wondered if I could switch gears a little bit and just ask about your digital business. I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about how customers are using your same-day fulfillment, the BOPIS. I know there\u2019s been a lot that\u2019s been turned on and changed during the pandemic to make it easier to fulfill. I\u2019m just wondering if there is any way to break down how the customer is getting their orders now from digital, and where do you see this going longer term. And then finally, in the same context, are you working towards pushing customers towards the same-day fulfillment and BOPIS options and away from two-day shipping?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey Kate. And good morning and thanks for your questions. We are very pleased with the performance of our online business. As we noted in our press release and in our prepared remarks, our fourth quarter now of over 100% growth in the business and its penetration rates continue to increase as an overall percent of our sales. Buy online pickup in store continues to remain approximately 75% of our digital sales, and with curbside pickup, still being about 75% of that buy online pickup in store. So, that\u2019s -- so the customer behavior, even with the growth, continues to kind of stay similar to what it has been in the past. But, what we are seeing is just a much more -- our execution, both from the customer order, all the way through to customer pickup, is just much more efficient than it was this time last year. And that\u2019s really due to all the investments that we\u2019ve made and just the outstanding execution by the team. And I\u2019ll give a brief example of that. We rolled out our first mobile app last year in the summertime. We now have over 1 million downloads of that app, and it\u2019s becoming a material portion of our digital sales. As the customer does a buy online pickup in store order in our app, they can note the type of vehicle they\u2019re driving, the model, the color and then any special pickup requirements they have, like maybe opening up the back of an SUV and putting it in there without even engaging with a customer. Then, as soon as the order is placed, we have Theatro headsets in our stores for every single team member. That tasks within moments, after the order is placed, to sit down to that store, the team member acknowledges. And well over 90% of our orders are now being picked in less than an hour. As soon as the order is completed by the team member, they then check it in with our mobile handheld, which we doubled the capacity of those in our stores last year, and then they take the order up to BOPIS lockers, which we just rolled out in November of last year. The average store has three. And then the customer gets a notification saying it\u2019s ready. On their way into our store, we have an On My Way functionality that customer can hit that. As soon as the customer enters our parking lot, the team member gets a notification saying they\u2019re ready for the order to be picked up. And then, in their Theatro headset, it will actually tell them, Kurt Barton, in a white Ford F-150 is ready for their order, and they\u2019ll walk right out, and they will drop the order in the back of the SUV, as it was indicated. We\u2019re doing well over 90% of that in minutes now. And then, they take the handheld device out there, complete the order because we\u2019ve rolled out additional Wi-Fi access points on the front and the customer drives off. And that is a big percentage of our orders, the customer scenario I just articulated. And the vast majority of the technology as well as the operational components of that are all new from last year. And so, just real kudos to the team for really just implementing a large number of technologies last year as well as operational procedures.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is open.\nPeter Benedict: Hal, I was wondering, I want to circle back to the rural revitalization theme you were talking about. And just curious if you had any more data around that. Have you guys learned more about maybe what the populations are doing in your markets? Any data that kind of speak to that? I understand you talked more generally about it, but is there anything else you can share?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey Peter. I\u2019d say, our data sets that we\u2019re looking at as it relates to kind of the urban departure into rural and suburban is really a combination of our own data, plus what we\u2019re pulling in from external data sources. And if you look at the millennial population in general, this is one that for over almost 10, 15 years now, I think all of us have been wondering if that generation will eventually conform to normal generational activities like house-holding and buying homes and such. And I do think that the pandemic really shocked that generation, and you\u2019re pulling forward now three or four years of those sorts of activities into a year. If you look at home purchases, if you look at household formations, that generation is spiking above all the other generations in those activities. And the urban home purchases that generation are declining, but rural and suburban are increasing. And we see that in our data set as well as we talked about the millennial cohort increasing by 4 percentage points as a percent of our business in the first quarter. And we\u2019re seeing it in our stores in the products that they\u2019re buying and in the way they\u2019re engaging. I think we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we sold 11 million birds last year, and half of those birds went to new customers. And it just shows you a category like poultry, which we\u2019re far and away the market share leader in and it\u2019s a category that really had a renaissance -- went through a renaissance last year and it\u2019s continuing this year in our stores. And you see a lot of new customers coming in buying coops, buying birds, and buying everything that goes along necessary for that passion. And then, they\u2019re taking it out to their new homes in the suburban and rural areas and enjoying the Out Here lifestyle.\nPeter Benedict: That\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, I guess, just on the competitive environment, we know you guys are joining up now with Orscheln. But just how are you seeing your traditional competitors beyond Orscheln kind of act and behave here and then the nontraditional competitors, anytime there\u2019s a market that gets -- seeing great growth, it will attract interest of others. So just curious what you\u2019re seeing, anything interesting evolving on the competitive front as you move here into the spring?\nHal Lawton: Yes. I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve been really, really focused on our customer over the last 12 or 15 months and with -- are trying to make sure that the competitive -- we stay out ahead of them, and we\u2019re creating a compelling kind of competitive advantage, whether that\u2019s in inventory, and really pleased, as Kurt said, we\u2019d like to have more inventory, but to finish the first quarter, 2 percentage points above last year, given our comp rates. We were relatively pleased there. We have 10,000 more team members than we had this time last year. That\u2019s really indicative of our focus on customer service. And then, if you think about the digital enhancements we made, that\u2019s really about staying ahead of the customer as well. And then, also the investment we\u2019ve made in our brand over the last year. I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t point out the 17-point increase in our unaided brand awareness, moving from 34 points unaided brand awareness to 51 points of unaided brand awareness over the last 15 months. And I think all that kind of comes together to create a really compelling reason to shop Tractor Supply. And we\u2019re certainly seeing the footsteps in our stores and on our website and just staying focused on the customer.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nSteven Forbes: I also wanted to sort of focus on customer trends, maybe more broadly. So, Hal, you mentioned 20 million or over 20 million members to date. But, can you remind us how many members transacted during 2020? And then, speak to sort of the differences in behavioral trends, right, maybe just spending trends or trip trends between those 20 million members, right, in the nonmember customer base?\nHal Lawton: Sorry. Could you repeat that second part of the question. It muffled on. I apologize.\nSteven Forbes: Sorry, Hal. Just curious if you could sort of speak to the spending trends, how they differ, right, between the members -- the Neighbor\u2019s Club members customer base over 20 million members and those customers that you have that transact with you who aren\u2019t part of the loyalty member program? Just trying to better gauge, right, what the potential tailwind could be as the new loyalty member program matures here?\nHal Lawton: Yes. So, I\u2019d start by first saying our Neighbor\u2019s Club members represent over 60% of our sales. And they shop us much more frequently than our non-Neighbor\u2019s Club members do. And we are seeing equivalent growth in our Neighbor\u2019s Club sales as we are in our non-Neighbor\u2019s Club sales. So, they continue to be very active, very vibrant group. And we\u2019re really excited about the rollout of our new loyalty program because what it does is creates three tiers and rewards our customers based -- the more they spend and the more they earn. And we\u2019re excited about lifting our -- their purchase rates from one tier to the next and kind of driving that upward migration. But they are -- it\u2019s a really strong customer group for us, and we\u2019re really pleased with the results we\u2019ve had in the last year and excited about the ongoing developments in the program.\nSteven Forbes: Yes. And maybe just a follow-up or to ask that a different way. So, over 20 million customers represent 60% of spend, how many customers account for the remaining 40%?\nMary Winn Pilkington: Yes. Steven, it\u2019s Mary Winn. We haven\u2019t given out some of that level of detail, so. But they\u2019re a highly engaged group in Neighbor\u2019s Club. Retention rates are spectacular on it as well. And just\u2026\nHal Lawton: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Suzuki: You had mentioned that inventory, in general, is a little lighter than you\u2019d like. Are there particular categories that are experiencing more acute shortages due to shipping delays or supply constraints? And could there be some pent-up demand or sales that were left on the table due to those inventory constraints?\nSeth Estep: Hey Elizabeth, this is Seth. Thanks for the question. Yes. As Kurt mentioned there, we really had strong momentum coming out of Q1 and exiting Q1. And while we would love more inventory, obviously, as we said there to continue, obviously to drive sales. So, we feel very good about our position to continue to drive these sales here in Q2. And I\u2019d really bucket the inventory position that we think about really in kind of three primary buckets. The first bucket would be kind of our CUE based product. The team has done an absolutely excellent job making sure that we can continue to stay in stock and be that dependable supplier. And we feel that we can definitely continue to make sure that we can take care of that shopper and customer that\u2019s coming in. Big ticket is really the second primary bucket, and that\u2019s where we really saw that strong demand exiting Q1. And so, I would say early in Q2, that\u2019s where we\u2019re really focused on here, replanning that product that we could bring that in to make sure that we could continue that momentum. And that product\u2019s flowing and have been flowing into stores. And then, third is more on our import side. And the import side is where we did see a little bit more delays as it relates to our inventory position. Most of that is in, call it, our drive aisle type of category. So, if you go in our stores, some of the d\u00e9cor, some of the discretionary type areas, those items have been flowing in nicely. Actually, it\u2019s really putting us in a great position as we\u2019re entering here in the peak of Q2 to make sure our center courts are going to be locked and loaded and full and ready to drive sales. And then, we also talked about the quality of inventories better than it\u2019s ever been. I mean, our clearance position is in an incredibly good spot. So, as you think about that 2% comp inventory, it\u2019s also due to healthy quality inventory to drive future sales. So, feel really good about where we are to continue to drive that momentum here in Q2.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great. And just one quick follow-up. I mean, if there are instances where your suppliers are starting to raise prices to you, are you generally able to pass-through those cost increases without much pushback from the customer?\nSeth Estep: Elizabeth, yes, I mean, we obviously have very robust pricing tool that\u2019s there. Most of our pricing inflation that we\u2019ve seen have been coming from both the grain and steel markets, if you look at what the charts are showing out there. Grain markets have been moderately rising throughout the course of the back half of last year. It\u2019s been pretty steady above, call it, the $5 mark early point this year. We\u2019ve got a very talented team that\u2019s been managing this kind of inflationary environment in the past. And feel very confident in our ability to manage appropriately to make sure we drive market share, but also be able to pass along to drive a level of margin improvement that\u2019s needed as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Your line is open.\nScott Mushkin: So, my first one is kind of a two-part question regarding the Side Lot. And I guess, going to go back to what Simeon was talking about, I guess, if you guys had more availability to do it, would you speed up, if you could?\nHal Lawton: Hey Scott. Yes. So first off, on the Side Lot, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve learned a lot over the last six months on the rollout of that program and are very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made. The team has done just an excellent job navigating through permitting, navigating through kind of COVID and construction crews, also navigating kind of access to steel fixtures and all those sorts of things that are kind of creating a very difficult operating environment. And we\u2019ve done a lot of staffing and hiring of project managers, et cetera, and really pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. The team is working full out on the rollout of them this year. We\u2019re confident and kind of reaffirmed our guidance on $150 million to $200 million by the end of this year. And we\u2019ll update you on our plans for 2022 and beyond as we get further into the year. But we still feel very good about 1,500 plus of our stores being applicable to both Fusion and Side Lot, and remain focused on that goal and executing those initiatives as quickly as possible, but also with outstanding precision of execution as well.\nScott Mushkin: Okay. So, you would speed up or you wouldn\u2019t? I just was\u2026\nHal Lawton: Yes. I mean, I think we\u2019re running at the right pace right now would be the thing. And if we can speed up as we get further into it, we will. But, I think we\u2019re running at the right pace, right now. There\u2019s -- we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re certainly not constraining ourselves kind of from a kind of capital investment perspective or resourcing perspective. I think, we\u2019re running at the rate that is appropriate for kind of our company right now.\nScott Mushkin: Okay. And then, my follow-up question, and basically, I wonder if you guys had the data of new customers buying pet that are also Neighbor\u2019s Club members?\nMary Winn Pilkington: That\u2019s cutting the data, Scott. I mean, we have all that data -- for insights, and we use it for all of our digital communications in those areas.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Scott, I\u2019d say\u2026\nScott Mushkin: You guys have the ability to cut it that way, though, or do you\u2026\nHal Lawton: I\u2019d start by saying, first, a couple -- I\u2019ll give a couple of data points on that, Scott. So, around a third of our new customers join the Neighbor\u2019s Club. And so, we are seeing good movement of those new customers into the Neighbor\u2019s Club program. And the two biggest drivers of new customers into our stores are pet and feed. And that kind of -- to my comments earlier around core farm and ranch customer and kind of the millennial customer, you kind of -- the trends are kind of applicable. The core farm and ranch customers coming in and buying feed, the millennial customers coming in and buying pet food or chicken feed to kind of fuel those passions and that habit -- those habits. And then, of those new customers, about a third are converting to our Neighbor\u2019s Club as they shop with us. And then, obviously, we would look for that to -- that pace to pick up over time. But, feel really good about our customer trends, and about pet as an attraction for those customer trends but also poultry and feed and then the conversion of those new customers into our loyal Neighbor\u2019s Club members.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nZack Fadem: You mentioned vendor funding and FAST team benefits of 40 basis points to gross margin in Q1. And as we continue to step up the FAST spend on the SG&A side, do you expect these vendor benefits to build through the year? And could these benefits be high enough to offset some of the headwinds from lower promo, freight and the mix that you\u2019ve called out in the back half?\nKurt Barton: Yes. Zach, this is Kurt. I\u2019ll start, and then I\u2019ll let Seth respond to the last part of your question in there. So, our vendors have certainly been strong supporters of us to be able to fund the cost of the FAST program as we proceed with that. And that\u2019s really our commitment. This team is there to help merchandise and help ensure the sale of that product. And it has been a strong contributor. One of the areas that has been an early win in the Life Out Here strategy. And so, our vendor funding that we anticipated that funding has really began and started to flow through the P&L, pretty consistent about 40 basis points quarter -- throughout all four quarters of the year on the gross margin side. The only thing I\u2019ll remind you is that we said in the back half of last year that we would begin to make the investments in the SG&A to build that team, and that cost actually went through the P&L unfunded. And so, the SG&A cost today for FAST is larger than the funding. And as we begin to build this program, it will eventually neutralize over the years. But for this year, there will be starting to lap in the third and fourth quarters some costs on there. But again, for the year, it will average out about 40 basis points of incremental in SG&A, with 40 basis points of benefit on vendor funding. It will differ between the quarters a bit. And then, I know Seth can go ahead and talk about the investment.\nSeth Estep: Hey Zach. Just a couple of other points there I\u2019d just roll out. As Kurt mentioned, just one of the big early wins with our Life Out Here strategy. And I\u2019d just say, the timing of the FAST program could not have been better to roll this out with the record volumes that are going through our stores today. Execution has been absolutely excellent among the store teams. Our planogram resets right now are on time, in full, north of 95%, which is a major -- it\u2019s a really good improvement from the past. And it\u2019s allowing our store teams really to focus on the cleanliness as well as to take care of our customers, which has also been a great win for our supplier partners as well. I mean, they\u2019re there to sell products, take care of them and offer that customer service. And then, finally, from a merchant perspective, we plan to have record number of planogram resets occurring throughout the course of this year. And we were able to uptick that last year. And as we\u2019ve been able to operate, and we have been operating in this record sales volume windows, our merchants in the past, we did not have a great avenue at times to go after opportunistic buys, things of that nature to really be able to fill in our drive aisles. And we\u2019ve been able to leverage the FAST team as well as our supplier partners to go after those kind of opportunistic buys, so that we can really maximize the sales trends that are out there. So, I would just say, overall, I\u2019m just incredibly pleased by the FAST program and just really big high marks to the team that\u2019s out there for standing this up and taking care of our supplier base.\nZack Fadem: Okay, perfect. And on the loyalty program updates this month, I know it\u2019s early, but any feedback or customer response to reports, thus far? And then, also just quickly on gross margin. You mentioned a slight Q2 headwind to accrue for the elevated benefits or discounts. Is this just a one quarter phenomenon, or a headwind that should persist through the year?\nHal Lawton: Yes. So, the Neighbor\u2019s Club program is off to a -- the relaunch is off to an excellent start. At this point, the customer comments are more anecdotal in nature in terms of their positive orientation around the tiers and the excitement about some of the special perks that come along with an around free same day, next-day delivery for a top-tier as well as access to trailer rentals and such. And then, I\u2019d say, we just had our first drop of points going to customers earlier this week. And so, we\u2019re just starting to see some of those redemptions and such. And we\u2019ll be able to talk a bit more about migration of customers over the next couple of quarters. And then, the gross margin impact and modest sales impact that Kurt mentioned in his prepared remarks, is really more of a Q2 phenomenon that abates as we get further into the year.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Given that we\u2019re past the top of the hour, let\u2019s go wrap up our call today. So, Denise, thank you for being our operator today. And this will conclude our call. And thank you to everyone for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you on our second quarter call in July. So, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2021 is off to a great start for Tractor Supply. I'm extremely proud and appreciative of the hard work by the more than 42,000 Tractor Supply and Petsense team members. Once again, they took care of each other and tirelessly served our customers who depend on us to live the Out Here lifestyle. I also want to thank all of our supply chain and vendor partners. We've been operating in the COVID-19 environment for over a year now, and the Tractor Supply system has more than risen to the occasion as they strive to serve our mission and values every single day. While we anticipated that we would have our strongest growth of the year in the first quarter, our results were significantly ahead of our expectations. When you couple this performance with the continuing momentum we are seeing in the second quarter, the positive macro environment and our strong customer trends, we are adjusting our comp outlook to mid to high single-digit growth in 2021. Kurt will share more details on the improved financial outlook for the year across our key financial metrics. Throughout the pandemic, our utmost priority has been the health and safety of our team members and customers. We continue to incur significant incremental expense for items like paid time-off, mask and testing. We remain committed to following the advice of the CDC and other medical professionals to protect our team and customers. As we enter the vaccination phase, we are committed to helping our team members who choose to get vaccinated to do so. We are providing a onetime payment of $50 and allowing time-off as needed for all team members who elect to receive a COVID-19 vaccines. To further alleviate the barriers to receiving a vaccine, we have partnered with a third-party provider to facilitate on-site vaccination at our eight distribution centers and store support center. During the quarter, we also announced our entry into an agreement to acquire Orscheln Farm and Home, a retailer with 167 stores across 11 states. This is an exciting step for Tractor Supply as we look to expand our footprint in the Midwest with the high-quality assets of Orscheln Farm and Home. We have always had great respect for Barry Orscheln and team for the strong connection they have with customers in the communities they serve, along with their industry knowledge and capabilities. With our shared values and passion for the Out Here lifestyle, we look forward to bringing together our highly complementary cultures and teams to realize the long-term value and benefit that we expect this acquisition to deliver over time. As we previously disclosed, we received a second request from the FTC as part of their review of the transaction and are cooperating with that confidential review. Accordingly, we are limited in the comments we can make about the transition at this time. I hope you all saw our release this week with our updated ESG tear sheet for 2020, which provides new and updated performance metrics in context related to our environmental sustainability efforts, our commitment to our team members and communities and corporate governance. This report helps us provide detailed information and progress on our ESG journey. In addition, we laid out our commitment to provide new targets in the fall this year as it relates to our greenhouse gas emission plan and our aspirational goals for diversity, equity inclusion. These initiatives make great business sense for Tractor Supply. As a purpose-driven company, setting targets for ourselves creates long-term value and our potential to have a positive impact on the world. We remain committed to constant improvement on this journey. Now, let's turn to the business review for the first quarter of 2021. We had exceptional net sales gains of 42.5%, with comparable store sales up 38.6%. We materially benefited in the quarter from transitory factors such as stimulus spending, favorable weather and inflation. Importantly, however, the underlying foundation of our business is robust, and we're gaining share across all categories, online and in stores and also with existing customers and new customers. Our Neighbor's Club membership reached 20 million members strong. This is an important milestone for our loyalty program as we know that they are customers that shop us more frequently and they spend more money with us. We saw 2.5 million new customers shop with us in the quarter. And that's an increase of over 30% over last year. Reengaged customers also exhibited strong growth, up over 12% from the first quarter of 2020. And customer retention for both our new and reengaged customers continues to run above last year. We saw strong growth across all product categories and geographic regions of the country. Comps for each month of the quarter were above 30%. And our growth was well-balanced between transactions and ticket growth. The business, like the last few quarters, continues to be a very consistent and stable. For the fourth quarter, our e-commerce saw strong triple-digit growth and increased significantly as a percentage of our overall sales. The work we did last year to improve our omnichannel capabilities continues to resonate with our customers. Ongoing improvements to the customer experience for better search capabilities and enhanced personalization are being recognized by our customers. As we've experienced in the last several quarters, we continue to see strong performance and market share gains in our consumable, usable and edible categories with growth in the mid-20% range. More specifically, we continue to be very encouraged by the trends we're seeing within our pet and poultry categories, where we're driving shopping frequency and market share gains. Over the last 15 months, our unaided brand awareness scores are up 17 percentage points. I believe these type of metrics serve as leading indicators of our brand health and future spending patterns of our customers. We continue to execute our shift away from print advertising to brand building and digital marketing. We're currently airing our national TV spring advertising campaign that highlights the strength of Tractor Supply's offering to serve the seasonal needs of our customers to take care of their land, pets and animals. Overall, the strong first quarter highlighted the unique advantages that we have at Tractor Supply. Our team members delivered exceptional results in a generation-defining moment. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kurt to discuss some of the details of the first quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Thank you, Kurt. I'd like to spend the next portion of the call covering some of the key customer trends we're seeing in the business, providing an update on our Life Out Here strategy and highlighting our spring programs. Our customer base is experiencing robust, broad-based shopping patterns that provide significant opportunities for growth. These types of trends can simply be described as once in a generation. We're seeing growth in all our customer segments and across all value tiers of spending with strong retention of existing and new customers. The fastest growth customer segment is our core farm and ranch. This segment is very healthy as rural economies, for the most part, were less impacted by the pandemic and are recovering at a steeper and more robust rate. Importantly, we're gaining wallet share with our core customer as our highest and medium spend customer tiers are outpacing our lower spend customer tier. As mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong new customer growth and notably, are also seeing strong customer retention. As an example, for our new customers from the first quarter of 2020 last year, more than 50% have returned to shop with Tractor Supply. This is about 300 basis points higher than the cohort from the first quarter of 2019. We are seeing significant growth in our millennial shoppers. Over the last 12 months, we've seen a 400 basis-point shift in the customer age cohorts of 18 to 45 years old. This demographic has long resisted many of the traditional generational norms, things like household formation and homeownership. But, the pandemic has shocked this generation and accelerated their embracement of these types of activities. There continues to be a net migration out of urban areas, largely driven by the millennial segment. The most robust homeownership growth is in the millennial cohort, with the growth coming in suburban and rural areas. We believe the growth in this customer segment has staying power and could be a structural game changer for us. Another structural customer trend that is working to our advantage is the significant increase in pet-owning households and number of pets adopted. Compared to the overall U.S. household pet ownership of approximately two-thirds, our customers over-index in pet ownership by about 10 points. And our current survey work with our customers indicate 25% have recently acquired and adopted a new pet. New companion animal ownership acts as an annuity for our business as these puppies and kittens grow up and have growing life cycle needs. We're also uniquely positioned to offer a growing menu of services such as pet wash, vet clinics, prescriptions and televet services. Whether it is more food treats, toys, containment and more, the humanization of pet provides us with future opportunities for growth. These customer trends are an indication that we continue to benefit from the numerous tailwinds, such as pet ownership, the millennial urban exodus, backyard poultry, home standing and home as an oasis. We believe many of these consumer trends will be enduring shifts well into the future. Our brand momentum is stronger than ever and we're investing to ensure we continue to play offense in the context of these trends. We are making excellent progress on our Life Out Here strategy and initiatives. At the beginning of April, we announced the relaunch of our Neighbor's Club program to be even bigger and better. When we launched Neighbor's Club nationwide in 2017, our vision was to create a unique Out Here community for our customers and a place for them to connect with us. The Neighbor's Club has permitted us to show appreciation to our loyal customers and to accumulate actionable customer data that has allowed us to deliver to our customers more relevant and personalized communications. Over the last four years, our loyalty program has served us well to be able to thank participating customers for being loyal customers, provide rewards and special offers they value, learn more about their purchasing trends and interest and ultimately, increase customer loyalty to Tractor Supply stores. Today, our Neighbor's Club program has over 20 million members and is comprised of our most valuable customers. It is a perfect time to upgrade the program with the introduction of points and three tiers of status. Now, neighbors, can earn points on their purchases and redeem them for more rewards. They can earn their way to different levels, so that when they spend, they earn more. With the new features of Neighbor's Club, we believe we have more tools and features than ever to help facilitate upward migration and spending and mitigate downward migration of spending by our members. The changes to Neighbor's Club were specifically based on our customers' feedback. The new rewards and benefits of Neighbor's Club are relevant to the customers' lifestyle, such as trailer rentals and shipping benefits. We believe with the new Neighbor's Club benefits, we have an opportunity to support our customers in a more meaningful way. This, in turn, will provide us a platform for multiyear trajectory for growth as a clear business driver for us. More broadly, we are aggressively advancing our Life Out Here strategy. The FAST team is at scale and providing significant improvement in the execution of our merchandising initiatives. We continue to forecast about 150 to 200 Side Lot transformations to occur this year. As of today, we have over 40 stores operating and continue to refine our learnings for future build-outs, of which 35 are currently under construction. Project Fusion store remodels are also on track for completion of 150 to 200 stores this year. In addition, new stores are being built as Fusion stores with improved layout, signage, SKU expansion and adjacencies. While still early, we're very pleased with our customers' response to both the Side Lot transformation and the Project Fusion store layout. Now turning to spring. Our stores in e-commerce are well positioned to take advantage of the seasonal change to serve our customers. We remain committed to being the zero-turn headquarters with our market-leading assortment from Toro, Bad Boy and Cub Cadet. We have substantially expanded our assortment in grilling, raised bed garden and other backyard categories. And to capture share of wallet in the lawn and garden category, we have expanded our offerings on core products, like long handled tools, wheelbarrows, trailers and tillers. And Chick Days are underway with millions of customers relying on us for their poultry passions. Leveraging our localization efforts, we're expanding our tool crow to an additional 400 stores. And on the product innovation front, with Carhartt to open a new store within a store concept. This concept was created with our customer at the center of the shopping experience. And by partnering with Carhartt to double our selection, our stores have even more of what makes Tractor Supply a destination for workwear. The new store within a store concept will roll out in more than 100 Tractor Supply stores in 2021 with additional stores to be added next year. To wrap up, I couldn't be prouder of the Tractor Supply team as they've remained agile in the face of a very challenging operating environment. My thanks and appreciation go out to each of them for helping to take care of each other and our customers, while operating in a record-setting pace. We have an incredibly strong business and foundation. We see more positive macro factors than we did at the beginning of the year. Customers are shopping with us in record numbers, and we're investing in multiple initiatives to retain them and provide more reasons to shop with us in the future. We participate in a large and attractive market that we're working to expand further with initiatives such as Side Lot that will add to our product offering. By doing the right thing for our team members and customers, we're executing our Life Out Here strategy and building a stronger company for our shareholders. Now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Yes. Good morning, Michael, and thanks for your question. As you mentioned, we've seen a significant amount of new customers shopping with us over the last 12-plus months with above-average retention rates continuing to hold. And as we mentioned, over 50% of the Q1 2020 cohort has shopped us again in the last 12 months. So, very strong retention. When we look at the additional customer data, I'd highlight two big drivers of the new customers. First would be in the core farm and ranch. And that very much is a market share gain, where these are customers that have land, have animals, have had -- our value proposition has appealed to them over time. And for a variety of reasons, they're choosing to now shop with Tractor Supply. And I think that has a lot to do with the investments we've made in technology, the investments we've made in safety and health and cleanliness in our stores and certainly, the focus we've had on inventory and customer service. And then, the second thing I'd bring up is kind of the millennial customer, which we highlighted in our prepared remarks. This segment had a very large increase as a percentage of our sales in Q1. And really, when we look at the data, it really is around the migration of people out of urban environments into suburban and rural environments. And that generation's starting to kind of take -- form households, buy homes, and as part of that, the Out Here lifestyle is part of the aspiration that they have when they moved out to the suburbia or when they moved out to rural America. And we do really feel like this is a structural trend that will continue to provide growth for us as we look out the balance of this year and beyond. Hey Simeon, good morning. This is Hal, and thanks for your question. I'd start by just saying we are -- the Life Out Here strategy is off to an excellent start. We are -- across all of the initiatives that we have, they're all underway and getting excellent traction. As we highlighted, the two Neighbor's Club relaunched a month ago, off to an excellent start there. The FAST team, multiple months of maturation there, having a big impact. Fusion and Side Lot are early days, as we noted in our prepared remarks, we have implemented them in a large number of stores already. They've had good customer reactions early on. And the sales performance is as we expected. And in our Q2 call and beyond, you can expect to hear more on performance of those from us as we get through the all-important spring time, and we're able to fully evaluate the results. Yes. Hey Kate. And good morning and thanks for your questions. We are very pleased with the performance of our online business. As we noted in our press release and in our prepared remarks, our fourth quarter now of over 100% growth in the business and its penetration rates continue to increase as an overall percent of our sales. Buy online pickup in store continues to remain approximately 75% of our digital sales, and with curbside pickup, still being about 75% of that buy online pickup in store. So, that's -- so the customer behavior, even with the growth, continues to kind of stay similar to what it has been in the past. But, what we are seeing is just a much more -- our execution, both from the customer order, all the way through to customer pickup, is just much more efficient than it was this time last year. And that's really due to all the investments that we've made and just the outstanding execution by the team. And I'll give a brief example of that. We rolled out our first mobile app last year in the summertime. We now have over 1 million downloads of that app, and it's becoming a material portion of our digital sales. As the customer does a buy online pickup in store order in our app, they can note the type of vehicle they're driving, the model, the color and then any special pickup requirements they have, like maybe opening up the back of an SUV and putting it in there without even engaging with a customer. Then, as soon as the order is placed, we have Theatro headsets in our stores for every single team member. That tasks within moments, after the order is placed, to sit down to that store, the team member acknowledges. And well over 90% of our orders are now being picked in less than an hour. As soon as the order is completed by the team member, they then check it in with our mobile handheld, which we doubled the capacity of those in our stores last year, and then they take the order up to BOPIS lockers, which we just rolled out in November of last year. The average store has three. And then the customer gets a notification saying it's ready. On their way into our store, we have an On My Way functionality that customer can hit that. As soon as the customer enters our parking lot, the team member gets a notification saying they're ready for the order to be picked up. And then, in their Theatro headset, it will actually tell them, Kurt Barton, in a white Ford F-150 is ready for their order, and they'll walk right out, and they will drop the order in the back of the SUV, as it was indicated. We're doing well over 90% of that in minutes now. And then, they take the handheld device out there, complete the order because we've rolled out additional Wi-Fi access points on the front and the customer drives off. And that is a big percentage of our orders, the customer scenario I just articulated. And the vast majority of the technology as well as the operational components of that are all new from last year. And so, just real kudos to the team for really just implementing a large number of technologies last year as well as operational procedures. Yes. Hey Peter. I'd say, our data sets that we're looking at as it relates to kind of the urban departure into rural and suburban is really a combination of our own data, plus what we're pulling in from external data sources. And if you look at the millennial population in general, this is one that for over almost 10, 15 years now, I think all of us have been wondering if that generation will eventually conform to normal generational activities like house-holding and buying homes and such. And I do think that the pandemic really shocked that generation, and you're pulling forward now three or four years of those sorts of activities into a year. If you look at home purchases, if you look at household formations, that generation is spiking above all the other generations in those activities. And the urban home purchases that generation are declining, but rural and suburban are increasing. And we see that in our data set as well as we talked about the millennial cohort increasing by 4 percentage points as a percent of our business in the first quarter. And we're seeing it in our stores in the products that they're buying and in the way they're engaging. I think we've mentioned in the past, we sold 11 million birds last year, and half of those birds went to new customers. And it just shows you a category like poultry, which we're far and away the market share leader in and it's a category that really had a renaissance -- went through a renaissance last year and it's continuing this year in our stores. And you see a lot of new customers coming in buying coops, buying birds, and buying everything that goes along necessary for that passion. And then, they're taking it out to their new homes in the suburban and rural areas and enjoying the Out Here lifestyle. Yes. I'd say, we've been really, really focused on our customer over the last 12 or 15 months and with -- are trying to make sure that the competitive -- we stay out ahead of them, and we're creating a compelling kind of competitive advantage, whether that's in inventory, and really pleased, as Kurt said, we'd like to have more inventory, but to finish the first quarter, 2 percentage points above last year, given our comp rates. We were relatively pleased there. We have 10,000 more team members than we had this time last year. That's really indicative of our focus on customer service. And then, if you think about the digital enhancements we made, that's really about staying ahead of the customer as well. And then, also the investment we've made in our brand over the last year. I would be remiss if I didn't point out the 17-point increase in our unaided brand awareness, moving from 34 points unaided brand awareness to 51 points of unaided brand awareness over the last 15 months. And I think all that kind of comes together to create a really compelling reason to shop Tractor Supply. And we're certainly seeing the footsteps in our stores and on our website and just staying focused on the customer. Sorry. Could you repeat that second part of the question. It muffled on. I apologize. Yes. So, I'd start by first saying our Neighbor's Club members represent over 60% of our sales. And they shop us much more frequently than our non-Neighbor's Club members do. And we are seeing equivalent growth in our Neighbor's Club sales as we are in our non-Neighbor's Club sales. So, they continue to be very active, very vibrant group. And we're really excited about the rollout of our new loyalty program because what it does is creates three tiers and rewards our customers based -- the more they spend and the more they earn. And we're excited about lifting our -- their purchase rates from one tier to the next and kind of driving that upward migration. But they are -- it's a really strong customer group for us, and we're really pleased with the results we've had in the last year and excited about the ongoing developments in the program. Yes. Hey Scott. Yes. So first off, on the Side Lot, I'd say we've learned a lot over the last six months on the rollout of that program and are very pleased with the progress we've made. The team has done just an excellent job navigating through permitting, navigating through kind of COVID and construction crews, also navigating kind of access to steel fixtures and all those sorts of things that are kind of creating a very difficult operating environment. And we've done a lot of staffing and hiring of project managers, et cetera, and really pleased with the progress we're making. The team is working full out on the rollout of them this year. We're confident and kind of reaffirmed our guidance on $150 million to $200 million by the end of this year. And we'll update you on our plans for 2022 and beyond as we get further into the year. But we still feel very good about 1,500 plus of our stores being applicable to both Fusion and Side Lot, and remain focused on that goal and executing those initiatives as quickly as possible, but also with outstanding precision of execution as well. Yes. I mean, I think we're running at the right pace right now would be the thing. And if we can speed up as we get further into it, we will. But, I think we're running at the right pace, right now. There's -- we're not -- we're certainly not constraining ourselves kind of from a kind of capital investment perspective or resourcing perspective. I think, we're running at the rate that is appropriate for kind of our company right now. Yes. Scott, I'd say... I'd start by saying, first, a couple -- I'll give a couple of data points on that, Scott. So, around a third of our new customers join the Neighbor's Club. And so, we are seeing good movement of those new customers into the Neighbor's Club program. And the two biggest drivers of new customers into our stores are pet and feed. And that kind of -- to my comments earlier around core farm and ranch customer and kind of the millennial customer, you kind of -- the trends are kind of applicable. The core farm and ranch customers coming in and buying feed, the millennial customers coming in and buying pet food or chicken feed to kind of fuel those passions and that habit -- those habits. And then, of those new customers, about a third are converting to our Neighbor's Club as they shop with us. And then, obviously, we would look for that to -- that pace to pick up over time. But, feel really good about our customer trends, and about pet as an attraction for those customer trends but also poultry and feed and then the conversion of those new customers into our loyal Neighbor's Club members. Yes. So, the Neighbor's Club program is off to a -- the relaunch is off to an excellent start. At this point, the customer comments are more anecdotal in nature in terms of their positive orientation around the tiers and the excitement about some of the special perks that come along with an around free same day, next-day delivery for a top-tier as well as access to trailer rentals and such. And then, I'd say, we just had our first drop of points going to customers earlier this week. And so, we're just starting to see some of those redemptions and such. And we'll be able to talk a bit more about migration of customers over the next couple of quarters. And then, the gross margin impact and modest sales impact that Kurt mentioned in his prepared remarks, is really more of a Q2 phenomenon that abates as we get further into the year."

            "name": "Seth Estep",
            "content": "Hey Elizabeth, this is Seth. Thanks for the question. Yes. As Kurt mentioned there, we really had strong momentum coming out of Q1 and exiting Q1. And while we would love more inventory, obviously, as we said there to continue, obviously to drive sales. So, we feel very good about our position to continue to drive these sales here in Q2. And I'd really bucket the inventory position that we think about really in kind of three primary buckets. The first bucket would be kind of our CUE based product. The team has done an absolutely excellent job making sure that we can continue to stay in stock and be that dependable supplier. And we feel that we can definitely continue to make sure that we can take care of that shopper and customer that's coming in. Big ticket is really the second primary bucket, and that's where we really saw that strong demand exiting Q1. And so, I would say early in Q2, that's where we're really focused on here, replanning that product that we could bring that in to make sure that we could continue that momentum. And that product's flowing and have been flowing into stores. And then, third is more on our import side. And the import side is where we did see a little bit more delays as it relates to our inventory position. Most of that is in, call it, our drive aisle type of category. So, if you go in our stores, some of the de\u0301cor, some of the discretionary type areas, those items have been flowing in nicely. Actually, it's really putting us in a great position as we're entering here in the peak of Q2 to make sure our center courts are going to be locked and loaded and full and ready to drive sales. And then, we also talked about the quality of inventories better than it's ever been. I mean, our clearance position is in an incredibly good spot. So, as you think about that 2% comp inventory, it's also due to healthy quality inventory to drive future sales. So, feel really good about where we are to continue to drive that momentum here in Q2. Elizabeth, yes, I mean, we obviously have very robust pricing tool that's there. Most of our pricing inflation that we've seen have been coming from both the grain and steel markets, if you look at what the charts are showing out there. Grain markets have been moderately rising throughout the course of the back half of last year. It's been pretty steady above, call it, the $5 mark early point this year. We've got a very talented team that's been managing this kind of inflationary environment in the past. And feel very confident in our ability to manage appropriately to make sure we drive market share, but also be able to pass along to drive a level of margin improvement that's needed as well. Hey Zach. Just a couple of other points there I'd just roll out. As Kurt mentioned, just one of the big early wins with our Life Out Here strategy. And I'd just say, the timing of the FAST program could not have been better to roll this out with the record volumes that are going through our stores today. Execution has been absolutely excellent among the store teams. Our planogram resets right now are on time, in full, north of 95%, which is a major -- it's a really good improvement from the past. And it's allowing our store teams really to focus on the cleanliness as well as to take care of our customers, which has also been a great win for our supplier partners as well. I mean, they're there to sell products, take care of them and offer that customer service. And then, finally, from a merchant perspective, we plan to have record number of planogram resets occurring throughout the course of this year. And we were able to uptick that last year. And as we've been able to operate, and we have been operating in this record sales volume windows, our merchants in the past, we did not have a great avenue at times to go after opportunistic buys, things of that nature to really be able to fill in our drive aisles. And we've been able to leverage the FAST team as well as our supplier partners to go after those kind of opportunistic buys, so that we can really maximize the sales trends that are out there. So, I would just say, overall, I'm just incredibly pleased by the FAST program and just really big high marks to the team that's out there for standing this up and taking care of our supplier base."

            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. We're excited to be starting fiscal 2021 on such a positive note as we performed well ahead of our expectations. Let me share some further color on our strong first quarter results and our upward revisions to our guidance for the year. Our record first quarter earnings were driven by positive momentum in all areas of the business. Comp sales increased 38.6% as the trends we experienced over the past year continued throughout the first quarter of 2021. Traffic increased 21%, and average ticket grew 17.6%. All geographic areas reported sales gains of at least 30% positive comparison to last year. Big ticket purchases had robust growth, up strong double digits that well outpaced our average comp sales increase. Safes, fencing, utility vehicles, trailers and outdoor power equipment, such as the zero-turn mowers, were some of the notable gainers in the quarter. As Hal mentioned, we did benefit from more transitory factors like stimulus payments, favorable weather and inflation that had a positive impact on the sales in the quarter. In total, we estimate that about one-third of our comparable store sales growth in the first quarter is attributable to these transitory factors. Our best estimate is that more favorable weather for the quarter contributed about 400 basis points to comps. Both January and February were colder than last year, with February being the coldest month in 30 years, while the last few weeks of March turned to a favorable spring weather in many of our markets. We also saw retail price inflation, primarily in commodities, which contributed around 300 basis points to our comp sales performance. The impact of stimulus payments is more difficult to quantify, but we recognize that consumers had more cash to spend during the quarter, and we believe Tractor Supply benefited from this in Q1. Towards the end of the quarter, in line with the timing of stimulus payments, we saw customer spending at elevated levels, especially in big ticket items. Our best estimate is that stimulus contributed somewhere in the mid-single digits to our first quarter sales comps. Even factoring in the transitory benefits, we believe the underlying health of our business is structurally advantaged. Trends towards higher spending and consumables continued through the quarter with pet, bird and livestock feeds showing significant growth from last year. We saw growth in the quarter despite lapping last year's strong stock up buying that occurred late in the first quarter of 2020 at the start of the pandemic. As we've said for the past few quarters, we see the growth in our CUE categories as more evidence of an enduring consumer shift to higher pet adoptions and ownership, new customer hobbies like backyard poultry and gardening, along with trip consolidation. For the first quarter, our gross margin increased by 148 basis points to 35.2% of sales, which resulted in gross profit increasing to nearly $984 million in the first quarter. This quarter marked the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. Consistent with the trends since the beginning of the pandemic, this quarter's increase was primarily driven by a lower level of sales promotions and clearance activity. We also benefited from a positive product mix towards higher-margin categories. And consistent with our guidance, we received approximately 40 basis points of benefit from vendor funding for the field activity support teams, or FAST initiative. These factors were partially offset by higher transportation costs, which was a headwind for gross margin. Domestic and import freight costs have increased significantly as well as fuel costs. And we expect these trends to continue throughout 2021. SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 27%, an improvement of 103 basis points. This improvement was primarily attributable to significant leverage in occupancy and other fixed costs from the strong increase in our comparable store sales. This leverage was partially offset by three factors: Higher incentive compensation, given the strong sales performance; COVID-related costs; and higher operating expenses to support the elevated volumes. COVID-related costs were approximately $28 million, generally in line with prior quarters, as we continue to take appropriate actions to ensure the safety of our team members and customers. Additional overtime, temporary labor and other costs were also incurred to maintain high service levels. Operating profit dollars more than doubled compared to prior year to $231 million, an operating profit margin of 8.3%, an improvement of 251 basis points. Net income was $181 million, an increase of 117%. Diluted EPS was $1.55, representing an increase of 118% versus the first quarter of 2020. During the first quarter, we returned $314 million to shareholders through the combination of our share repurchases and dividends. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong. Merchandise inventories were $2.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of about 2% in average inventory per store. This level of inventory is still lighter than we would like, given the momentum of the business. And we are working with our suppliers and our vendors to build stock to support this momentum. The added supply chain costs and freight expense necessary to rebuild inventory is reflected in our updated guidance we provided. Moving now to our guidance for 2021. The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic and the vaccine rollout will have on the broader economy, the consumer and our fiscal 2021 results remains uncertain. We continue to plan for fiscal 2021 based on a range of potential outcomes, remaining nimble and adjusting as necessary. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results from the first quarter and the positive momentum we see in our business continuing into the second quarter. While the current environment and momentum are both favorable, we recognize that COVID-19 pandemic is not completely behind us and that economic conditions can change quickly. Please keep in mind that the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. Against the backdrop of what we know today, we are updating our guidance to a net sales range of $11.4 billion to $11.7 billion, with comparable store sales growth of 5% to 8%. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.4% to 9.7% of sales, a step-up from our prior guidance. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $7.05 to $7.40. This compares to our previous earnings range of $6.50 to $6.90 per diluted share. Compared to our initial outlook for the year, our forecast does reflect higher transportation costs and product inflation. We experienced increasing pressures from these factors during the first quarter and expect them to continue to be a headwind throughout 2021. In addition, we have a unique opportunity with the positive customer trends and momentum in the business. We are committed to investing in store and supply chain labor as we look to provide legendary customer service to meet our customers' expectations. I want to share additional context on our outlook for the second quarter. While we begin to lap more challenging sales and earnings comps, we currently see sales momentum continue, partially fueled by stimulus payments. We expect a positive sales comp in the second quarter in the mid-single-digit range. Please keep in mind, we'll be cycling our strongest gross margin performance of the prior year in Q2, where we benefited from minimal promotional or clearance activity as well as a favorable product mix. We are expecting gross margin decline in Q2 due to higher transportation costs, a less favorable product mix and a slight return to promotional activity. We also anticipate a modest onetime headwind in the second quarter relating to the rollout of our enhanced Neighbor's Club loyalty program. In terms of SG&A for the second quarter, COVID-related expenses are expected to moderate from the Q1 levels, but are forecasted to be slightly higher than original expectations entering the year, along with higher labor cost to support these elevated volumes. For the second half of 2021, we anticipate tailwinds such as stimulus payments to moderate and performance to be more in line with our original guidance, expecting a modest decline in comp sales. Longer term, we continue to believe the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the halves of the year. As I've stated before, a key component of our financial model is the strength of our balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. In January, we increased our annual dividend by 30% from $0.40 a share to $0.52. For 2021, we anticipate share repurchases in a range of $700 million to $800 million. In summary, it is an exciting time at Tractor Supply. We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and see positive momentum carrying into the second quarter. We see an opportunity to retain the loyalty of our longtime and newer customers by investing in our business to maintain everyday low prices and improve customer service, strengthen our supply chain and grow our digital commerce, all in support of our commitment to driving strong shareholder returns for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal. Yes. Michael, this is Kurt. In regards to your question, I'd really point to two things. We just finished first quarter. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we recognize that in this environment, there's just a lot of uncertainty. We've got better visibility on the second quarter and still less visibility on certain factors in the second half. We don't have significantly greater visibility than we had from our original guidance. And so, that's one factor, as well as second quarter. As I mentioned, we believe that has some benefit from stimulus, and that begins to moderate in the back half. So, our guidance doesn't have significant shift from our original guidance on the back half of the year for those reasons. Yes. Simeon, to address gross margin, I'd first point to a great basis point to look at is referring back to the drivers of Q2 last year that we're comping and then even reflecting on the Q1 drivers, and that's really a great way to reconcile to it. And the reason I'd point that out is, last year, some of the drivers in Q2 that we're about to lap were with the pandemic, you saw transportation costs and certain commodity prices actually declining. And so, that was really a favorable item in there. We are now lapping that first quarter where there was really no promotional or clearance activity. In Q1, the factors that were drivers that we pointed out in Q1, such as the favorable product mix is the last quarter where before we start lapping some of that favorable product mix where the discretionary higher-margin items were a big portion of the mix. So, to give you the level of quantifying of it coming off of that basis, I'd give you the four key factors, and I'll put it in the order of magnitude. Lapping those lower transportation costs with higher transportation costs right now would be the first. Lapping a favorable product mix in Q2 last year, where the discretionary higher-margin items were a much higher percent than Q would be second. The inflation impact and then followed by, as I mentioned, the onetime Neighbor's Club impact for launching the points and rewards-based program is a great way of summarizing it. Yes. Scot, this is Kurt. We started the pandemic seeing a strong growth in new customers, and we've talked about that over the last three quarters. We continue to see a meaningful portion of our growth coming from new customers. And for the first quarter, when looking at the strength of our business, the new customers, both new customers that entered transacting with Tractor Supply in 2020 as well as new in first quarter really represent a key portion of the first quarter results in the high-single-digit range of our mix of the 38.6% comp. Scot, there's no real significant change in top line or other factors on the second half. We have certainly considered and recognized some key factors that we pointed out, such as inflation and some of the cost of doing the business. So, we've factored that into our overall guidance, but no real meaningful shift in tailwinds or headwinds in our second half algorithm. Yes. Zach, this is Kurt. I'll start, and then I'll let Seth respond to the last part of your question in there. So, our vendors have certainly been strong supporters of us to be able to fund the cost of the FAST program as we proceed with that. And that's really our commitment. This team is there to help merchandise and help ensure the sale of that product. And it has been a strong contributor. One of the areas that has been an early win in the Life Out Here strategy. And so, our vendor funding that we anticipated that funding has really began and started to flow through the P&L, pretty consistent about 40 basis points quarter -- throughout all four quarters of the year on the gross margin side. The only thing I'll remind you is that we said in the back half of last year that we would begin to make the investments in the SG&A to build that team, and that cost actually went through the P&L unfunded. And so, the SG&A cost today for FAST is larger than the funding. And as we begin to build this program, it will eventually neutralize over the years. But for this year, there will be starting to lap in the third and fourth quarters some costs on there. But again, for the year, it will average out about 40 basis points of incremental in SG&A, with 40 basis points of benefit on vendor funding. It will differ between the quarters a bit. And then, I know Seth can go ahead and talk about the investment."

Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call this morning. I think the opening video was a great recap of the highlights of a record year for Tractor Supply. Year-end is when we reflect on our accomplishments, and I'm pleased to share the results from the team in 2022. We had sales growth of 11.6% and diluted earnings per share growth of almost 13% and this is on top of a record performance in 2021. We had solid market share gains across all our product categories, and these gains continue to contribute materially to our sales growth. At Tractor Supply, it all starts with the team. And my sincere thanks and appreciation goes out to the more than 50,000 team members of Tractor Supply who work diligently every day to live our mission and values. Regardless of the operating challenges throughout the year and really over the last three years since we entered the pandemic, the team has delivered impressive results while also making significant progress on our Life Out Here strategy. I commend and thank the team for stepping up to every challenge that has come at us over this time period. Our team plus our business model are the reasons why we have a record of consistent and stable growth across all economic environments. With this year's results, we've now posted three consecutive years of exceptional sales growth. The highlight of this phenomenal track record continues to be the consistency of our results and the broad-based strength of our performance. Including new stores in the 53rd week, our revenue on a three-year basis has increased about 70%, with a three-year comp stack of 46.5%. Over the same period of time, we've invested nearly $1.7 billion in our stores, distribution centers, technology and other strategic initiatives as part of our Life Out Here strategy. We also have significantly improved our operating capabilities, including relaunching our Neighbor's Club program, creating our field activity support team, expanding our mobile footprint, and delivering on the increased volume of our consumable, usable and edible products. We've remained focused on introducing new capabilities, improving the shopping journey and ensuring we have scalable platforms, all with the underlying goal to be the dependable supplier that our customers count on. As a company, we hit several significant billion dollar milestones in 2022. We grew our sales to a record $14.2 billion, increased net income to over $1 billion, achieved $1 billion in private label credit card sales and returned more than $1 billion in capital to shareholders for the second consecutive year. This culminated with diluted earnings per share of $9.71. Now turning to our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 performance. Our business continues to be incredibly resilient, and the quarter unfolded much like we anticipated. Albeit, comp sales performance was stronger than forecast as the late December winter storm provided a comp sales lift of approximately two percentage points. Excluding the impact of the winter storm, importantly, our underlying results were in line with the high end of our expectations for the quarter. Now let's go through some of the highlights for the quarter and the fiscal year. For the fourth quarter, our comparable store sales growth was 8.6%, and it was driven by strong ticket growth of 6.3% and transaction count increase of plus 2.3%. And importantly, even without the winter storm benefit, our comp transactions would have been positive for the quarter. All months of the quarter comped positive. October, December were our strongest comp sales months. Both two and three-year comp stacks were relatively consistent across the quarter. On e-commerce, it achieved mid single-digit positive sales growth, and we continue to build out our ONETractor capabilities. As of year-end, the Tractor Supply app has had over 4.4 million downloads since it was launched mid-2020. For the seventh consecutive quarter, we continued to see our consumable, usable and edible products outperform our overall comp sales results. And this is the fourth consecutive quarter for C.U.E. to run at about 3x the rate of overall comp sales growth. This strong performance was driven by dry dog food as well as feed for poultry, equine and wild birds. As we've talked about many times, C.U.E. is one of our structural advantages and the products represent the strength of our core business and they're what drive trips to our stores. Our outperformance in year-round categories offset the declines in big ticket categories. And we continue to gain share across our categories, both online and in-store. Shifting now to Neighbor's Club. Our Neighbor's Club membership exceeded 28 million members and represented nearly 75% of our sales for the year. Neighbor's Club is successfully helping us migrate customers to a higher threshold of spending with us. During the quarter, we reached a new record in the number of high-value customers. Overall, our best customers are shopping with us more frequently and spending more money per transaction. On Petsense, the rebranding of Petsense, the Petsense by Tractor Supply along with our expansion of our Neighbor's Club program to Petsense by Tractor Supply is really resonating with our customers. This expansion is allowing us to deepen relationships with existing customers in our enterprise and help attract new pet customers to both brands. Our customers\u2019 response to these initiatives is very encouraging, with Neighbor\u2019s Club membership already representing nearly 50% of sales at Petsense. During the quarter, we launched Tractor Supply, Visa Credit Card. This new co-brand credit card allows our customers to earn more on their everyday purchases, both in-store and anywhere Visa is accepted. This marks exciting progress on our journey to drive sales, build loyalty and reduce tender expense through our credit offerings. And as I mentioned earlier, this past year, we crossed over $1 billion in private label credit card sales. For the fourth consecutive quarter, our overall customer satisfaction score hit a new all-time high as we continue to invest in our team to provide best-in-class customer service. Our team continued to make advancements in our supply chain through the expansion of our mixing centers to a total now of 15 as well as the grand opening of our ninth distribution center just last week. During the quarter, we also broke ground on our tenth distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas to support for the higher volumes of our existing stores, the continued build-out of our new stores as well as the acquisition of Orscheln. Our supply chain continues to be a competitive advantage for us. In 2022, we moved more than 8 billion pounds of consumable, usable and edible products through our supply chain as we are the world\u2019s largest seller of bag feed and food for livestock and companion animals. Our scale and reach provide us with the cost to serve that is lower than our competition. We continue to advance on our commitment to be stewards of Life Out Here. We\u2019re making progress on our absolute carbon reduction goals to further reduce emissions from our operations by 20% by 2025 and by 50% by 2030 from our 2020 baseline. We are committed to achieving net 0 emissions across all operations by 2040. Additionally, in 2022 of April, we announced an ambitious three-year water conservation goal to conserve 25 million gallons of water by 2025. These commitments to the climate and society reinforce our vision that a healthy environment, properly managed resources and vibrant communities are keys to a secure and prosperous future for Life Out Here. As a result, our efforts to enhance our sustainable business practices have been recognized by various third parties. We now have nearly 30% of our store base that are in our Project Fusion layout and our Garden Center build out is now active in over 300 locations. With nearly 1,800 team members, our field activity support team has made powerful contributions to our in-stock performance and execution of our sales-driving initiatives. We continue to be pleased with the strategic benefits and financial returns of these store-level investments. This was a year that we made significant progress on our Life Out Here strategy. And building on our performance for 2022, our outlook for 2023 is right in line with our long-term guidance. And Kurt will share more details on our outlook as well as more details on our performance in 2022 in just a moment. Now shifting a bit to 2023. As we planned for the year, we anticipate continuing to operate in an ever challenging and changing macro environment. Our operating assumption is that the economy in the near to medium-term will remain resilient with flat to modestly positive real growth. Wages are increasing and consumers continue to tap pent-up savings to support spending. We expect consumers will continue to be judicious in their spend, but resilient, while prioritizing needs over discretionary. We believe inflation has peaked, but will remain sticky as we move through the year. It is our view that an orderly loosening of the labor market will be a key determiner of the country\u2019s ability to return our economy to sustainable conditions in the second half and 2024. The effects of secondary markets on our consumer spending in areas such as housing, agriculture and oil markets are expected to be collectively neutral and individually modest. Whatever economic environment plays out this year or any year for that matter, we\u2019re confident that our business will remain resilient and build on our strong track record of consistent and stable growth across all economic environments. Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. We are the leader in a large, fragmented market. We\u2019re a need-based business that is tailored to the Out Here lifestyle. Our customers have a passion for the Out Here lifestyle and over-indexes homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. We live our mission and values and our culture defines our relationship with our customers. We\u2019re celebrating our 85th anniversary this year. As we begin the year, we take great pride in our path and are equally excited about our future. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kurt.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Let me build on how sentiment for 2022. As we start out the year, we anticipated that our business would continue to exhibit consistent performance as we have a proven business model that has stood the test of time. The team delivered against our goals and exceeded our expectations. The impact of the 53rd week on our performance is detailed in our press release. To recap, the 53rd week added about $225 million to our net sales in the fourth quarter representing 6.8 points of our net sales growth. On a full year basis, it represented 1.8 points of the 11.6% growth year-over-year. Diluted EPS benefited by $0.16 for the quarter and the year. For the fourth quarter, all regions of the country once again delivered positive sales comp. All months were comp positive. As for the cadence of the quarter, our comp store sales were performing at the high end of our outlook as we move into mid-December. Then as Winter Storm Elliott moved across the country, our sales accelerated given the storm\u2019s impact on our customers\u2019 needs for heat, insulated outerwear, livestock feed and forage and some load up of other C.U.E. products. As Hal shared, we estimate the storm provided about 2 percentage point benefit to our comp sales. Much like any emergency response events such as hurricanes, the profitability of these sales from winter storm events of this magnitude is lower due to the mix of products and higher incremental operating costs. Our commitment to being the dependable supplier for Life Out Here was exhibited during this historic storm. Looking back, when excluding the December winter storm comparable store sales have been remarkably consistent across all four quarters of the year. Similar to trends through the year, retail price inflation contributed about 11 points to our comparable store sales in Q4 as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. The comparable average ticket growth of 6.3% benefited from inflation, partially offset by a shift in sales mix to needs-based consumables versus the larger ticket items. Demand for C.U.E. categories was nearly 3 times the chain average, while big ticket sales performance was down mid-single digits. We did see strong performance in winter needs-based items such as heaters, snow throwers and log splitters. The performance in these big ticket categories somewhat offset the declines we saw in more discretionary categories like utility and recreational vehicles and trailers. Moving on to gross margin. For the fourth quarter, our gross margin improved by 28 basis points to an even 34% of sales. Our price management actions and other margin-driving initiatives were able to offset the pressures from year-over-year product cost inflation, higher transportation costs and product mix due to the strength of C.U.E. categories. During the quarter, we experienced a significant moderation in the rate of price increases from our vendors, but by no means are we seeing deflation. Our promotional activity was in line with the prior year and we are seeing moderation in transportation costs that we expect to flow through in 2023. Of note, it\u2019s our belief that transportation costs most likely peaked in the fourth quarter. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 25.1%. As we indicated in Q3, this increase was primarily attributable to three factors: one, the impact of transaction expenses and early integration costs associated with our acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home; two, our strategic growth initiatives, including depreciation and amortization; and three, our investments in team member compensation and benefits. These items were partially offset by a reduction in COVID-19 response costs and leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. Diluted EPS was $2.43, an increase of 25.9% from the fourth quarter of last year. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $2.7 billion, representing an 18% increase year-over-year in average inventory per store. Overall, we continue to believe that our inventory position is in good shape. Today, we believe we are better positioned to drive sustainable long-term growth than we were before the pandemic. Our structural tailwinds such as rural revitalization, home setting, self-reliance and pet ownership continue to benefit us. Our Life Out Here strategic investments have made us stronger. Adjusting for the impact of the 53rd week, our outlook for 2023 is right in line with our long-term targets as we continue to see the power of compounding from our compelling top line growth, operating margin outlook and consistent capital return to shareholders through the dividends and share repurchases. For fiscal 2023, we are forecasting net sales of $15 billion to $15.3 billion, including at least $300 million in sales from Orscheln. Our outlook marks another milestone in our performance as annual sales are forecasted to be above $15 billion. Comparable store sales growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3.5% to 5.5%. We expect gross margin expansion of about 20 to 40 basis points from supply chain benefits and a moderation in both product cost increases and the mix impact of C.U.E. We anticipate SG&A will deleverage modestly due to a few factors. Depreciation amortization is anticipated increase by 17% to 20% relating to our strategic growth initiatives. Also, we opened our ninth distribution center just this month. As a reminder, the operating cost for the new DC are reflected in SG&A, while the supply chain benefits are reflected in gross margin. We expect the incremental cost to pressure SG&A by approximately 15 to 20 basis points. The benefit in gross margin will not completely offset this pressure since it takes time for the new facility to fully ramp to maturity and realize the supply chain benefits. And lastly, the integration of Orscheln Farm and Home is expected to impact SG&A by approximately 5 basis points. These factors are partially offset by the normalization of incentive compensation and leverage occupancy and other operating costs from the increase in comparable store sales. And for the year, we forecast an operating margin of 10.1% to 10.3%. We are forecasting interest expense of approximately $55 million as we have increased borrowings to fund our capital allocation. We plan to maintain a healthy leverage ratio of 2 times or below. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.7% to 23%. We continue to expect the Orscheln acquisition to be accretive to diluted earnings per share by at least $0.10 in 2023. All in, diluted EPS is forecast in the range of $10.30 to $10.60. We continue to believe the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the half of the year. As you model 2023, I want to point out a few things that will impact comparability. And I\u2019d like to give a little color on the flow across quarters. From a sales perspective, we are planning for all four quarters to have comp sales performance generally within our guidance range. We anticipate retail price inflation to benefit comp sales by 3 to 5 points with the benefit being higher in the first half than the second half as inflation pressures begin to moderate. We are planning for positive comp transactions in 2023. As to earnings, we expect our EPS growth to be fairly balanced between first half and second half. There are a couple of discrete items that will impact operating margins in certain quarters. The first quarter will likely be our toughest comparison from an operating margin rate perspective. Start-up costs for the new distribution center will pressure the first quarter, while the supply chain benefits will not begin to be realized until the second quarter. Additionally, transportation costs are expected to continue to be higher year-over-year in Q1 and then begin to moderate through the remainder of the year with the second half expected to see favorable comparisons. As a reminder, the Orscheln stores will be added to the comp store calculation in October when we cycle the acquisition date. Also keep in mind, the discrete items that impact our earnings comparability in 2023 are the lapping of the 53rd week benefit, partially offset by the accretion from the Orscheln acquisition. And when adjusting for the 2022 benefit from the 53rd week and the 2023 accretion from the Orscheln acquisition, our outlook for 2023 is consistent with our long-term EPS guidance of 8% to 11%. Capital expenditures are forecasted to be $700 million to $775 million, with about 80% for growth initiatives. We expect to open approximately 70 new Tractor Supply stores. We continue to be on track for 10 to 15 Petsense store openings in 2023. Our new store pipeline continues to be solid and we expect to improve the cadence of openings in 2023 with more balance throughout the year. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2023, we anticipate share purchases in a range of $575 million to $675 million, which is estimated to have a benefit of a net reduction in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 2%. Our business model has to the test of time and is proven to be resilient. While we are closely monitoring consumer behavior and the impact of economic growth on consumer demand, we believe that we are well positioned for any consumer and economic environment. To wrap up, we are continuing to separate Tractor Supply from the competition. In prior cycles, we\u2019ve made investments that strengthened the company. We believe the current environment is an opportunity for us to lean into our strength and further expand our lead for years to come. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thank you, Kurt. As we celebrate our 85th anniversary this year, Tractor Supply is a business that continues to have significant opportunities for growth ahead of us. Our position in our customer spending is for stable, needs based and demand driven product categories. We are in defensive product categories for the lifestyle our customers live. At the same time, we are playing offense to capture organic growth opportunities. We have idiosyncratic growth drivers that are separating us from the competition. As a company, three words that really summarize Tractor Supply\u2019s performance are: one consistent, two, reliable, and three, sustainable. And I\u2019d like to walk through these three words and share what I see as structural tailwinds across them to support our future performance. Let\u2019s start first with consistent performance. We have a track record of delivering positive sales growth for over 30 consecutive years. 30 of the last 31 years have had positive comp sales. We\u2019ve had consistent traffic growth across economic cycles and we\u2019re planning for positive traffic growth in 2023. Our marketplace has shown consistent growth for decades and decades. Our total addressable market of $180 billion continues to benefit from numerous trends that we believe are structurally found. Additionally by all accounts, we are gaining substantial share in our market. For instance, our queue product categories are driven by livestock feed for cattle, equine and poultry and companion animal food. In addition to categories like heating fuel, wildlife feed, pest control and lubricants, we\u2019re entering new product categories through our Garden Center transformations then open up new queue categories that provide a halo to the store as new and existing customers shop our expanded lawn and garden categories. Our stores with a Fusion layout and Garden Center transformations are gaining more customers than the balance of the chain. In just over two years since we started our Life Out Here strategy, we have gained significant scale in our Fusion remodels and the transformation of our sidewalks to Garden Centers. We have a substantial runway for growth ahead of us as we still have 70% of the chain to convert to the Fusion layout and the opportunity for another 1,000 plus Garden Center transformations. The comp lift for the Fusion remodels continues to run in the mid-single digits. When we execute a combination Fusion remodel and a Garden Center transformation of our sidelight, we have a comp lift in the high single digits. These projects provide us with the opportunity to continue our track record of consistent growth. The second word I would use to describe Tractor Supply is reliable. We are a need space, demand-driven business, and these product categories differentiate Tractor Supply from the bulk of retail. Our customers count on us for the products they need to deliver Life Out Here. Since relaunching our Neighbor\u2019s Club program in April of 2021, we have increased our high value customers by nearly 50%. Additionally, our high value customers are shopping us more frequently and spending more money. Our retention rate for our high value customers is about 80% with our retention rate for our highest tier customers at over 95%. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club program is a true competitive advantage for Tractor Supply. Once our customers in the flywheel of Neighbor\u2019s Club, their spending becomes much more reliable. Sustainable is the third key word to characterize our company. We\u2019ve had tens of millions of new customers shop us the past three years. We have retained the majority of these customers and a substantial portion have become active Neighbor\u2019s Club members. We\u2019ve added over 13 million members since 2019 with more than 5 million in 2022 alone. These strong results position us for sustainable growth ahead. Another important customer cohort that supports the sustainability of our outlook are the millennial customers and they continue to have more significant spending with us and in the years ahead of them. This group will make out nearly a quarter of the U.S. population by 2032, just 10 years from now. Our sales comps for millennials have outpaced non-millennials at Tractor Supply for five consecutive years, millennials over index and sales per customer, units per customer and average ticket. We view this strength that our millennial customer, not as a pull board, but rather as a catch up, as this group delayed family formation and the pandemic really shifted their behaviors to be much like prior generations. This cohort of the population is showing accelerated rates of home ownership and household formation. Today, 50% of millennials own homes versus 30% just a decade ago. So while they may have started a little bit later, we see an inflection point in the pace of home ownership and household formation for millennials. We are focused on retaining these new millennial customers as our data shows that they are roughly double their spending at TSC in their second year of shopping. And if they continue shopping with us for five years, we experience a threefold increase in transactions and sales per customer within five years of their initial purchase. Rural revitalization also continues to be a strong structural benefit for us. Millennials are increasingly choosing to move out here. This is not just a phenomenon of the pandemic, but rather a decade long trend of net migration out of urban areas that skewed disproportionately among this younger generation. The rural lifestyle appeals to millennials and it offers greater affordability, safety, self-sufficiency of slower pace, and the ability to pursue hobbies and passions. Many of the hobbies pursued by the millennials fit with our Out Here lifestyle. Tractor Supply enables passions and hobbies pursued by millennials, whether it is a pursuit as simple as making memories with family and friends or caring for pets and animals, or getting outside to hunt fish or camp, or being more self-sufficient and sustainable. Tractor Supply serves a key resource in our local communities for millennials to come to for trusted advice and expertise. Our passion for the lifestyle connects with our customers and allows us to serve them at scale. These three words, consistent, reliable and sustainable allow us to be an earnings growth compounder on both the top line and bottom line. As I started my remarks this morning, year-end is when we reflect on our accomplishments, but more importantly, this is a key moment to look ahead and to focus on the opportunities ahead of us. With our Life Out Here strategy, we have ignited Tractor Supply\u2019s next horizon of strong and sustainable growth. 2023 is poised to be another great year for Tractor Supply. And with that operator, we now like to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Scot, your line is now open.\nJoe Civello: Hi. This is Joe Civello on for Scot. Great quarter guys. I was just wondering if we could talk about your \u2013 the transaction growth you guys are projecting for 2023. Can you talk about how the expectations are driven by weaker comps, weather driven or other things like that, or potentially incremental visits driven by Garden Centers, Fusion remodels or the things you\u2019re implementing in the store that\u2019s helping to drive growth? Thank you.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Good morning and thanks for your question. Appreciate you joining the call today. We\u2019re very pleased with the guidance we provided on our comp sales for 2023 to be between 3.5% and 5.5%, very much in line with our long-term guidance range as well. As Kurt said in his prepared remarks, we expect it\u2019ll be a blend of transacts \u2013 positive comp transactions and ticket. We do expect inflation will be stronger in the first half, but moderate in the second half. And what I\u2019d say more broadly is, our market that we participate in continues to run reasonably in line with GDP kind of flat to low single digit growth. And we are taking significant share in the marketplace. As we\u2019ve said several times over the last three years, our sales growth, half of that can be attributable to share gain. And we certainly are expecting that to continue in 2023. And the share gain is really a composition of the competitive advantages that we have as well as the investments we\u2019re making in our Life Out Here strategy and the fact that we\u2019re reaching scale on a number of those now, particularly our Fusion and Garden Centers. And they will continue to add material growth to our comps. But again, we\u2019re very positive on our outlook for 2023 and expect the momentum that we exited 2022 to continue into the year.\nJoe Civello: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Karen, your line is now open.\nKaren Short: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good to talk to you again. So just two questions if I could blend them in. So, just looking at your algorithm, obviously you\u2019re looking for sales growth just on a one year basis to be lower than EBIT growth. And I guess I would argue that\u2019s probably \u2013 sorry, sales growth to be higher than EBIT growth. And I would look at that as a good thing because you are one of the few companies that have invested and not harvested as it relates to the pandemic. So maybe just talk about that algorithm. And then the second question I just wanted to lump in there, when you look at your mix by category, obviously I kind of look at it at about 26% is discretionary. So how do you think about that going into potentially a weaker macro?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey, Liz, good morning and thanks for taking the call. I\u2019m sorry, Karen, I apologize, Karen. Karen, how are you this morning? Good morning. You all are right beside each other your name\u2019s alphabetically on my list, so my apologies. But Karen good morning and thanks for your question for joining the call. On the sales growth, as you said, we are in an investment cycle in our business and the thing that we\u2019re excited about is that we\u2019re able to grow earnings as we did last year double digits, and we\u2019re able to grow our sales as we did last year double digits even in the context of an earnings cycle. And we anticipate to continue to grow sales at a significant rate next year as well as our earnings at a significant rate next year, even inclusive of all the capital expenditure and kind of underlying DNA that comes along with that, as well as all the other investments we\u2019re making in the business. But we\u2019re very optimistic and confident in the outlook that we\u2019ve provided. On the mix by category, we\u2019ve roughly talked about discretionary being more like 15% of our business. Big ticket is kind of in the low double digits. There\u2019s a few other categories that would be plus or minus in that discretionary area as well. And I think the way we think about that business is that some categories will have - continue to be negative in their comps but there\u2019s others when it\u2019s seasonally relevant that will be positive. And an example of that is what Kurt articulated in his prepared remarks saying that, our big ticket sales were kind of mid-single digit negative comps. And it was really \u2013 there was two sets of categories in there. The kind of discretionary non-seasonal related ones were kind of negative double digits, but then you had ones that were seasonally relevant and there was a demand around those say like log splitters and snow throwers that are also big ticket and could be viewed as discretionary or in our kind of math for discretionary and those blended together to drive a negative single digit \u2013 mid single digit comp. And we think it\u2019ll play out that way much of this year. As an example, as we get into the end of Q1 and early Q2 when we had the drought last year that disproportionately affected as we commented last year, things like riders. And we expect those to come back as the drought is abetting in many areas of the country even in spite of the consumer shifting more towards needs based needs based spend. Anyway, thanks Karen, for joining the call. I appreciate the question.\nKaren Short: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes on the line of Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Liz, your line is now open.\nLiz Suzuki: Thank you. And I don\u2019t mind being confused for Karen because she dresses better than I do, so I appreciate it. Thanks for your time. Yes. So the guidance you gave for 2023 and in terms of the operating margin, I guess, it sounds like the investments in new DCs and in store transformations and side lots are probably the factors that would keep that margin towards the lower end at the long-term guidance. But what do you view as the opportunities for operating margin to get to the top end of that guidance over time?\nHal Lawton: Yes, hey Liz. And good morning, and thanks for joining the call. As we've said several times, last year and this year are two biggest peaks in investments. And as we talked about in our enhanced earnings calls a couple of years ago, the first part of this five-year cycle that we're in for our Life Out Here strategy would be towards more the bottom end of our \u2013 middle end of our range. And then as we move towards the out years, call it, 2024, 2025, 2026, we see opportunities to increment up on our op margin towards that higher end and kind of get back to a nice leverage across our P&L, let's say, 5 or 10 basis points a year. And really, the biggest determinant of the 10.1% to 10.3% this year would just be the sales range. And if we're up more towards the 5.5, we would expect to leverage more on some of our fixed costs and be more towards that 10.3%. If we're down more towards the 3.5%, we think we'll be more in that 10.1% to 10.2% range as there's a little less leverage on some of our fixed costs. We pull some other levers to kind of manage the business. But certainly, as we look out towards the back half of this five-year investment cycle, we see opportunities for our margin rate to increment up.\nLiz Suzuki: Got it. And just a follow-up, you may have mentioned this in the outlook for 2023, how many Project Fusion remodels and side lots do you have baked in?\nHal Lawton: Yes. So the mix of our remodels in 2023 will be a little different than last year because of the Orscheln acquisition. This year, as we shared in our opening remarks, it's kind of 70 to 80-ish new stores that will open this year. We'll also be integrating the 81 Orscheln stores. Those will be kind of basically a Fusion remodel. And then we'll do around 150 more Fusion remodels as well. And that's in line with what we did this year, kind of in that 200 to 250 range. It's just the fact that 80 of those will be taken up by the Orscheln integration this year. We continue to be very excited about Fusion and very excited about our side lots. Go ahead, Liz.\nLiz Suzuki: Yes, excited to see you next week. Thanks.\nHal Lawton: Yes, perfect. Look forward to seeing you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is now open.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good morning. Great quarter, congratulations. So I have two quick questions. I'll merge them into one. First off, with regard to the sort of say, the weather bump in sales late in Q4, should we think about that as incremental demand? Or does that potentially pull forward demand would have happened in Q1? And then the second question I have, Kurt, you mentioned in your script, that you're seeing, I guess, price increases moderate and that's from your suppliers. The first I have is, so then what action \u2013 that's occurring, what action is Tractor Supply taking? Are you maintaining your retail prices? Or are you actually adjusting your retail prices to account for those now modeling input costs? Thanks.\nHal Lawton: Yes, hey, Brian, I'll take the first part of it, and then Kurt will take the second part. On the weather bump, we don't see that as pull forward from Q1. And we see it \u2013 dominantly, it's just incremental in Q4. I'd go back to some of the comments we made, say, in our Q3 earnings call and our Q2 earnings call, where we said, our business has been very consistent in that 5% to 6% comp range all last year. And as Kurt said in his prepared remarks, and I think I did as well, we were trending towards the high end of our comp guidance for Q4 when the storm hit and then that put us well over. I'd equated a bit to what we said if we had gotten \u2013 if the drought hadn't occurred, we think we would have been over our guidance. If we'd had a better spring season, we think we would have been over our guidance for those quarters. I just get back to the point, our business is very consistent, very stable, very reliable right now in that kind of mid single-digits. And then if we get some good weather on top of that, that benefits us, we get that benefit. And that's what we saw in Q4. When the weather is bad, we're there for our customers. And it drives some sales. But otherwise, we continue to run very reliably and consistently in that mid single-digit comps.\nKurt Barton: Yes, Brian, good morning. And I'll just add to that. On that winter storm, we view it very much like a discrete event like the hurricane events have been. You heard my commentary on there. The exciting thing though is, with those types of events, consistent with this storm is it introduces Tractor Supply as a needs-based business to other new customers. And that's what we do as we capitalize on that, we see it as part of our opportunity in 2023 as new footsteps into the business. So great opportunity from that one event as we continue to serve our markets in a significant widespread winter storms such as that. In regards to your question about prices abating and how we manage that, one is, we will \u2013 those prices will take time to work through the system. So we do very well at managing whether that be the product cost or the transportation to be able to manage as those flow through and balance between the competitive retail price that we have, gaining market share and how much we actually take to the bottom line. Specifically, the biggest item in the gross margin benefit in 2023 is the easing of the transportation cost. And as you look back even over the last two years, on our gross margin, we've been very specific as we've been able to find offsets or pass through some of those the transportation cost has been the primary one where we've absorbed some of that. And so we will \u2013 as those prices abate and ease through, it's a key contributor to how we expect to see gross margin expansion throughout 2023.\nBrian Nagel: Thanks guys, very helpful. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon, your line is now open.\nSimeon Gutman: Good morning, everyone. Nice results. My question, it's a couple of parts, but it's one topic. It's how C.U.E. is comping 3x the company average. If you could speak to \u2013 if you can, maybe the price benefit there or what's happening with the basket and the market share seems to be staggering because I don't think some of the items in that category are growing that fast. And then I'll flip it and say then why are you not converting or is it converting to the rest of the store? Are you seeing that conversion? Because it seems like it's a pretty good halo to have on one side of the business.\nHal Lawton: Yes, hey Simeon, and thanks for joining the call. Good to speak to you this morning. On the C.U.E., I would say our AUR is in line with the rest of the market. So kind of high single-digits, generally speaking, across food and speed, but our market share is on a dollar basis, we\u2019re running 2x the market. And on a pound basis, we\u2019re running 3x the market in growth. And so it\u2019s \u2013 the majority of our growth there well over half is transactions-based, unit-based and share gain. And dog dry food is the numbers I was just mentioning right there, those were specific to that to dog dry food. But we\u2019re seeing similar type of numbers in poultry feed, in equine feed, in livestock, et cetera. And I would say it is pulling through to the rest of our business, in terms of driving positive footsteps and transactions into our store. And then also, our average ticket continues to remain very solid with very modest reduction in our UPT. In fact, this was the lowest year-over-year in our UPT decline in 2022. And when you look at the customer \u2013 underlying customer cohorts in our Neighbor\u2019s Club program, what you\u2019re seeing and as was mentioned in the prepared remarks is that the millennials have moved out to kind of rural America and kind of that Sunbelt migration, they start in poultry and pet food with us and then very quickly are migrating into four to five other categories in terms of us being their destination. And so I\u2019d say we\u2019re seeing strong growth, its market share gains in C.U.E. that we\u2019re taking. We\u2019re confident we will be able to continue to take those gains. We are the lowest cost to serve in the market, the fastest supply chain, the lowest price is the best customer service. And when they get in there, should they shop the whole lifestyle, and we\u2019re seeing that in our average ticket and also in our on customer data.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Zach, your line is now open.\nZach Fadem: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Couple of questions on the outlook. First of all, could you walk us through the quarterly comp impact from the calendar shift? And if there\u2019s anything we need to keep in mind on a flow-through or margin basis for those sales. And then second, on your gross margin outlook. To what extent are you incorporating reinvestment to drive traffic growth versus flowing those lower freight input cost to the bottom line?\nKurt Barton: Zack, hey, this is Kurt. The first question in regards to cadence throughout the quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the \u2013 all four quarters really would expect to be in line with our overall guidance. We don\u2019t expect significant variation between the quarters. I would encourage you, as you reflect back on last year, as we talked about some of the headwinds we saw in the middle parts of the year, with the late start to the spring, the drought that impacted Q2 and Q3. We talked about how in those quarters, there were some headwinds that took some of the top side off of the comps in those quarters. So we see good opportunity to be able to capitalize comping up against those quarters. We obviously had a really strong Q4. We talked about the winter storm. So those are all things that factor into our model as we plan the comps. And on the gross margin question, maybe remind me again your question on the gross margin.\nZach Fadem: Yes. Are you incorporating any reinvestment to drive traffic growth versus just flowing the lower freight to the bottom line?\nKurt Barton: Got you. Yes. Well, of course, we always prioritize market share gains competitive in pricing. We are the lowest cost to serve. We\u2019ve invested in our supply chain and distribution to be able to capitalize on this shift in the environment where transportations are coming down. So we\u2019ll be able to take advantage of our own efficiencies that we can control. As there\u2019s opportunities as prices decline, we will take some opportunity modest as we see it in our plan, opportunity to invest in the gross margin. And all of that is considered in our expectation that we could see gross margin growing 20 basis points to 40 basis points in 2023.\nZach Fadem: And Kurt, just to clarify, the calendar shift won\u2019t be as pronounced as 2016 is what it sounds like.\nKurt Barton: Exactly. Yes. Thank you. There is not a pronouncement, anything of material. And I\u2019d just point back to how consistent each of the quarters were in 2023. So there\u2019s really no meaningful shift in there.\nZach Fadem: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Chris, your line is now open.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to follow-up on the sort of discretionary question that was posed earlier by Karen. As you think about what you saw in the fourth quarter, you\u2019re hearing a lot of retailers talk about a very late Christmas season. And I recognize it\u2019s a small portion of your mix. But in some of those seasonal categories, let\u2019s say, fashion apparel and footwear and toys, did you see any sort of like deterioration? And then similarly, if you look at the data around pet inflation that\u2019s been very strong, but it does seem like there\u2019s some unit degradation and some sort of sacrifice same streets and the accessory business. So can you talk about those two buckets in terms of how that behavior has changed, I guess in the back half of the year in the fourth quarter?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey Chris, and good morning. Thanks for your question and for joining the call. First, we were very pleased with our Q4 business in general. As I said and Kurt, absent the storm, we were still at the high end of our comp expectations and we would have still had positive comp transactions for the quarter regardless of the storm. And we were also very pleased with our seasonal businesses. They performed in line with our expectations. And then in the last week of right before Christmas, for us, when we have a winter storm like that, it drives more footsteps into our stores, and they end up shopping the entire lifestyle when they\u2019re in there. So we saw excellent performance that week. And in holiday-related items, whether it\u2019s in apparel, whether it was in decor, candy, toys, tools. It was a solid, very solid close to the year for us on both, as I said, not only just on demand-driven store-related items. And then on pet, we are seeing unit growth and double-digit comps across all categories in pet, whether it\u2019s dog, whether it\u2019s cat, whether it\u2019s hard goods, whether it\u2019s consumables, whether it\u2019s food, whether it\u2019s sundries or accessories. Certainly, the food is outpacing the other categories, but all categories in our pet business are seeing very strong growth.\nChris Horvers: Very impressive. Thanks very much.\nMary Winn Pilkington: So we\u2019ve hit the top of the hour, but we\u2019ll let the call go just a few minutes longer because our prepared remarks were longer.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners. Steven, your line is now open.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning, Hal, Kurt, Mary. I wanted to focus on member cohort trends. So you mentioned, I think, during the prepared remarks, retention rates right among the high-value customers. I was curious if you could expand on retention, repeat behavior sort of in aggregate across the member cohorts as a whole and whether you\u2019re seeing a difference in behaviors right, between those members acquired over the past three years versus those members acquired 2019 earlier.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey, Steven, and good morning. This is a great new story for Tractor Supply. What I\u2019ve seen historically in my career in retail is it takes time when you have a new customer for them to ramp up through your high-spending cohorts until they become kind of a mature customer. What we\u2019ve seen is the customers, as you mentioned, I said in my prepared remarks, that we\u2019ve had tens of millions of new customers shop us in the last three years. The majority of those have continued to be active shoppers with us and a huge portion had become Neighbor\u2019s Club members. That cohort is basically shopping us, and we\u2019re seeing purchase frequency, average ticket, number of categories shop total spend in the year, very much in line with our kind of long-time core customers. So they\u2019ve ramped up very fast. And that\u2019s why when we say things like our Neighbor\u2019s Club is outperforming our overall comp, our total company comp, even at 75% penetration. And even with the growth we\u2019ve had, that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s so exceptional because historically, in my past, as you see your membership program becomes such a large portion of your sales is a tendency revert to the mean, right, revert your overall comp. And I think the data set you can see both that we\u2019re providing also an underlying data just shows you how fast those customers have ramped up and become core customers for us. And it\u2019s what gives us confidence as we head into 2023.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you. Best of luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Peter, your line is now open.\nPeter Keith: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. One thing that we\u2019re hearing in the channel right now, and it\u2019s kind of a funny dynamic for Farm and Ranch, but that the chicken category is on fire. And certainly, there\u2019s been some well-publicized discussion of price increases with eggs. So I guess I\u2019m wondering, is that a kind of an emerging trend that chickens have perhaps reaccelerated for you. And is that a category that actually could be big enough to move the needle as we look at 2023?\nSeth Estep: Hey, Peter, this is Seth. Thanks for the question. Yes, when we look ahead to this next year, we are incredibly excited about our poultry business. And just to go back to some of Hal\u2019s comments earlier, I would just say even in Q4 for us, poultry was a primary driver. We have \u2013 unlike some maybe commentary you\u2019ve heard elsewhere, we have not seen the entire year over the course of the last three years, any slowdown in our poultry business. And when we look ahead to this year, we think it could be another record year for us. Our stores are setting chick days here over the coming months. When we look out to our center court activity. We look at poultry being a predominant driver for us. And when you couple those things with our pet business, you couple those with our live goods business, all the sustainability things that customers are looking for right now is they\u2019re looking to find value, to grow those things on their own. We\u2019re looking at poultry to be just absolutely another banner year and our team is incredibly excited for that. So we definitely agree with the commentary you\u2019re hearing out there, and we think we\u2019re in a position to continue to take market share in this category.\nPeter Keith: All right. Thanks and congrats on the continued success.\nHal Lawton: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Peter, your line is now open.\nPeter Benedict: Hey guys. Thanks for sneaking me in. I just wanted to ask a question around CapEx, came in above the forecast this past year. Curious if that\u2019s just projects costing more? Or did you get through more of the projects than you thought? And then as you step back, CapEx is running around 5% of sales in the last couple of years. I think your outlook for 2023 would suggest a similar ratio. How do we think about the path of CapEx beyond 2023? Historically, you guys used to run around 3% of sales. You\u2019ve been investing aggressively for good reason. But just curious how you would think about maybe the CapEx path as we move beyond 2023. Thank you.\nKurt Barton: Hey, Peter, this is Kurt. In regards to CapEx and your two questions, the growth in CapEx in 2022 at the high end of our expectations reflected a couple of things. Certainly, there\u2019s inflation in the cost of building a distribution center, the new stores, et cetera, that was a piece of it. But also in this environment, the team has done an excellent job of ramping up and ensuring that all of the pieces that go into these fusion remodels that we\u2019ve got the fixtures and all of the equipment ready to go. So the pipeline is in good shape for what we plan to use to grow into the 200 to 250 remodeled stores next year. And there\u2019s some timing of that capital that impacted 2022. And then certainly, for 2023, we expect consistent numbers. We\u2019ve got a construction of a complete new distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas. So for both years, they absorbed the $150 million-ish cost of some of our largest distribution centers in those years. And that leads to the second question that you had going forward, we really believe that as we said, these would be the two peak years that the biggest investment over the other years is really on the supply chain side. And it\u2019s reverting back more to that over the next few years, $600 million, $650 million in capital going forward. And it\u2019s a very planned, purposeful five-year growth to convert the supply chain and the stores into the new Life Out Here strategy, look and shopping experience for our customers. So I would expect to see that number come down a bit after 2023.\nPeter Benedict: That\u2019s great. Very helpful. Thank you.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Sure thing. For that, we\u2019ll wrap up our call. Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we look forward to speaking to you on our first quarter earnings call in April. I\u2019m around. If anybody wants to reach out, please let me know and we\u2019ll get you on the calendar. Thank you all. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s TSCO fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Thank you for your presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Thanks, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call this morning. I think the opening video was a great recap of the highlights of a record year for Tractor Supply. Year-end is when we reflect on our accomplishments, and I'm pleased to share the results from the team in 2022. We had sales growth of 11.6% and diluted earnings per share growth of almost 13% and this is on top of a record performance in 2021. We had solid market share gains across all our product categories, and these gains continue to contribute materially to our sales growth. At Tractor Supply, it all starts with the team. And my sincere thanks and appreciation goes out to the more than 50,000 team members of Tractor Supply who work diligently every day to live our mission and values. Regardless of the operating challenges throughout the year and really over the last three years since we entered the pandemic, the team has delivered impressive results while also making significant progress on our Life Out Here strategy. I commend and thank the team for stepping up to every challenge that has come at us over this time period. Our team plus our business model are the reasons why we have a record of consistent and stable growth across all economic environments. With this year's results, we've now posted three consecutive years of exceptional sales growth. The highlight of this phenomenal track record continues to be the consistency of our results and the broad-based strength of our performance. Including new stores in the 53rd week, our revenue on a three-year basis has increased about 70%, with a three-year comp stack of 46.5%. Over the same period of time, we've invested nearly $1.7 billion in our stores, distribution centers, technology and other strategic initiatives as part of our Life Out Here strategy. We also have significantly improved our operating capabilities, including relaunching our Neighbor's Club program, creating our field activity support team, expanding our mobile footprint, and delivering on the increased volume of our consumable, usable and edible products. We've remained focused on introducing new capabilities, improving the shopping journey and ensuring we have scalable platforms, all with the underlying goal to be the dependable supplier that our customers count on. As a company, we hit several significant billion dollar milestones in 2022. We grew our sales to a record $14.2 billion, increased net income to over $1 billion, achieved $1 billion in private label credit card sales and returned more than $1 billion in capital to shareholders for the second consecutive year. This culminated with diluted earnings per share of $9.71. Now turning to our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 performance. Our business continues to be incredibly resilient, and the quarter unfolded much like we anticipated. Albeit, comp sales performance was stronger than forecast as the late December winter storm provided a comp sales lift of approximately two percentage points. Excluding the impact of the winter storm, importantly, our underlying results were in line with the high end of our expectations for the quarter. Now let's go through some of the highlights for the quarter and the fiscal year. For the fourth quarter, our comparable store sales growth was 8.6%, and it was driven by strong ticket growth of 6.3% and transaction count increase of plus 2.3%. And importantly, even without the winter storm benefit, our comp transactions would have been positive for the quarter. All months of the quarter comped positive. October, December were our strongest comp sales months. Both two and three-year comp stacks were relatively consistent across the quarter. On e-commerce, it achieved mid single-digit positive sales growth, and we continue to build out our ONETractor capabilities. As of year-end, the Tractor Supply app has had over 4.4 million downloads since it was launched mid-2020. For the seventh consecutive quarter, we continued to see our consumable, usable and edible products outperform our overall comp sales results. And this is the fourth consecutive quarter for C.U.E. to run at about 3x the rate of overall comp sales growth. This strong performance was driven by dry dog food as well as feed for poultry, equine and wild birds. As we've talked about many times, C.U.E. is one of our structural advantages and the products represent the strength of our core business and they're what drive trips to our stores. Our outperformance in year-round categories offset the declines in big ticket categories. And we continue to gain share across our categories, both online and in-store. Shifting now to Neighbor's Club. Our Neighbor's Club membership exceeded 28 million members and represented nearly 75% of our sales for the year. Neighbor's Club is successfully helping us migrate customers to a higher threshold of spending with us. During the quarter, we reached a new record in the number of high-value customers. Overall, our best customers are shopping with us more frequently and spending more money per transaction. On Petsense, the rebranding of Petsense, the Petsense by Tractor Supply along with our expansion of our Neighbor's Club program to Petsense by Tractor Supply is really resonating with our customers. This expansion is allowing us to deepen relationships with existing customers in our enterprise and help attract new pet customers to both brands. Our customers' response to these initiatives is very encouraging, with Neighbor's Club membership already representing nearly 50% of sales at Petsense. During the quarter, we launched Tractor Supply, Visa Credit Card. This new co-brand credit card allows our customers to earn more on their everyday purchases, both in-store and anywhere Visa is accepted. This marks exciting progress on our journey to drive sales, build loyalty and reduce tender expense through our credit offerings. And as I mentioned earlier, this past year, we crossed over $1 billion in private label credit card sales. For the fourth consecutive quarter, our overall customer satisfaction score hit a new all-time high as we continue to invest in our team to provide best-in-class customer service. Our team continued to make advancements in our supply chain through the expansion of our mixing centers to a total now of 15 as well as the grand opening of our ninth distribution center just last week. During the quarter, we also broke ground on our tenth distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas to support for the higher volumes of our existing stores, the continued build-out of our new stores as well as the acquisition of Orscheln. Our supply chain continues to be a competitive advantage for us. In 2022, we moved more than 8 billion pounds of consumable, usable and edible products through our supply chain as we are the world's largest seller of bag feed and food for livestock and companion animals. Our scale and reach provide us with the cost to serve that is lower than our competition. We continue to advance on our commitment to be stewards of Life Out Here. We're making progress on our absolute carbon reduction goals to further reduce emissions from our operations by 20% by 2025 and by 50% by 2030 from our 2020 baseline. We are committed to achieving net 0 emissions across all operations by 2040. Additionally, in 2022 of April, we announced an ambitious three-year water conservation goal to conserve 25 million gallons of water by 2025. These commitments to the climate and society reinforce our vision that a healthy environment, properly managed resources and vibrant communities are keys to a secure and prosperous future for Life Out Here. As a result, our efforts to enhance our sustainable business practices have been recognized by various third parties. We now have nearly 30% of our store base that are in our Project Fusion layout and our Garden Center build out is now active in over 300 locations. With nearly 1,800 team members, our field activity support team has made powerful contributions to our in-stock performance and execution of our sales-driving initiatives. We continue to be pleased with the strategic benefits and financial returns of these store-level investments. This was a year that we made significant progress on our Life Out Here strategy. And building on our performance for 2022, our outlook for 2023 is right in line with our long-term guidance. And Kurt will share more details on our outlook as well as more details on our performance in 2022 in just a moment. Now shifting a bit to 2023. As we planned for the year, we anticipate continuing to operate in an ever challenging and changing macro environment. Our operating assumption is that the economy in the near to medium-term will remain resilient with flat to modestly positive real growth. Wages are increasing and consumers continue to tap pent-up savings to support spending. We expect consumers will continue to be judicious in their spend, but resilient, while prioritizing needs over discretionary. We believe inflation has peaked, but will remain sticky as we move through the year. It is our view that an orderly loosening of the labor market will be a key determiner of the country's ability to return our economy to sustainable conditions in the second half and 2024. The effects of secondary markets on our consumer spending in areas such as housing, agriculture and oil markets are expected to be collectively neutral and individually modest. Whatever economic environment plays out this year or any year for that matter, we're confident that our business will remain resilient and build on our strong track record of consistent and stable growth across all economic environments. Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. We are the leader in a large, fragmented market. We're a need-based business that is tailored to the Out Here lifestyle. Our customers have a passion for the Out Here lifestyle and over-indexes homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. We live our mission and values and our culture defines our relationship with our customers. We're celebrating our 85th anniversary this year. As we begin the year, we take great pride in our path and are equally excited about our future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kurt. Thank you, Kurt. As we celebrate our 85th anniversary this year, Tractor Supply is a business that continues to have significant opportunities for growth ahead of us. Our position in our customer spending is for stable, needs based and demand driven product categories. We are in defensive product categories for the lifestyle our customers live. At the same time, we are playing offense to capture organic growth opportunities. We have idiosyncratic growth drivers that are separating us from the competition. As a company, three words that really summarize Tractor Supply's performance are: one consistent, two, reliable, and three, sustainable. And I'd like to walk through these three words and share what I see as structural tailwinds across them to support our future performance. Let's start first with consistent performance. We have a track record of delivering positive sales growth for over 30 consecutive years. 30 of the last 31 years have had positive comp sales. We've had consistent traffic growth across economic cycles and we're planning for positive traffic growth in 2023. Our marketplace has shown consistent growth for decades and decades. Our total addressable market of $180 billion continues to benefit from numerous trends that we believe are structurally found. Additionally by all accounts, we are gaining substantial share in our market. For instance, our queue product categories are driven by livestock feed for cattle, equine and poultry and companion animal food. In addition to categories like heating fuel, wildlife feed, pest control and lubricants, we're entering new product categories through our Garden Center transformations then open up new queue categories that provide a halo to the store as new and existing customers shop our expanded lawn and garden categories. Our stores with a Fusion layout and Garden Center transformations are gaining more customers than the balance of the chain. In just over two years since we started our Life Out Here strategy, we have gained significant scale in our Fusion remodels and the transformation of our sidewalks to Garden Centers. We have a substantial runway for growth ahead of us as we still have 70% of the chain to convert to the Fusion layout and the opportunity for another 1,000 plus Garden Center transformations. The comp lift for the Fusion remodels continues to run in the mid-single digits. When we execute a combination Fusion remodel and a Garden Center transformation of our sidelight, we have a comp lift in the high single digits. These projects provide us with the opportunity to continue our track record of consistent growth. The second word I would use to describe Tractor Supply is reliable. We are a need space, demand-driven business, and these product categories differentiate Tractor Supply from the bulk of retail. Our customers count on us for the products they need to deliver Life Out Here. Since relaunching our Neighbor's Club program in April of 2021, we have increased our high value customers by nearly 50%. Additionally, our high value customers are shopping us more frequently and spending more money. Our retention rate for our high value customers is about 80% with our retention rate for our highest tier customers at over 95%. Our Neighbor's Club program is a true competitive advantage for Tractor Supply. Once our customers in the flywheel of Neighbor's Club, their spending becomes much more reliable. Sustainable is the third key word to characterize our company. We've had tens of millions of new customers shop us the past three years. We have retained the majority of these customers and a substantial portion have become active Neighbor's Club members. We've added over 13 million members since 2019 with more than 5 million in 2022 alone. These strong results position us for sustainable growth ahead. Another important customer cohort that supports the sustainability of our outlook are the millennial customers and they continue to have more significant spending with us and in the years ahead of them. This group will make out nearly a quarter of the U.S. population by 2032, just 10 years from now. Our sales comps for millennials have outpaced non-millennials at Tractor Supply for five consecutive years, millennials over index and sales per customer, units per customer and average ticket. We view this strength that our millennial customer, not as a pull board, but rather as a catch up, as this group delayed family formation and the pandemic really shifted their behaviors to be much like prior generations. This cohort of the population is showing accelerated rates of home ownership and household formation. Today, 50% of millennials own homes versus 30% just a decade ago. So while they may have started a little bit later, we see an inflection point in the pace of home ownership and household formation for millennials. We are focused on retaining these new millennial customers as our data shows that they are roughly double their spending at TSC in their second year of shopping. And if they continue shopping with us for five years, we experience a threefold increase in transactions and sales per customer within five years of their initial purchase. Rural revitalization also continues to be a strong structural benefit for us. Millennials are increasingly choosing to move out here. This is not just a phenomenon of the pandemic, but rather a decade long trend of net migration out of urban areas that skewed disproportionately among this younger generation. The rural lifestyle appeals to millennials and it offers greater affordability, safety, self-sufficiency of slower pace, and the ability to pursue hobbies and passions. Many of the hobbies pursued by the millennials fit with our Out Here lifestyle. Tractor Supply enables passions and hobbies pursued by millennials, whether it is a pursuit as simple as making memories with family and friends or caring for pets and animals, or getting outside to hunt fish or camp, or being more self-sufficient and sustainable. Tractor Supply serves a key resource in our local communities for millennials to come to for trusted advice and expertise. Our passion for the lifestyle connects with our customers and allows us to serve them at scale. These three words, consistent, reliable and sustainable allow us to be an earnings growth compounder on both the top line and bottom line. As I started my remarks this morning, year-end is when we reflect on our accomplishments, but more importantly, this is a key moment to look ahead and to focus on the opportunities ahead of us. With our Life Out Here strategy, we have ignited Tractor Supply's next horizon of strong and sustainable growth. 2023 is poised to be another great year for Tractor Supply. And with that operator, we now like to open the line for questions. Yes. Good morning and thanks for your question. Appreciate you joining the call today. We're very pleased with the guidance we provided on our comp sales for 2023 to be between 3.5% and 5.5%, very much in line with our long-term guidance range as well. As Kurt said in his prepared remarks, we expect it'll be a blend of transacts \u2013 positive comp transactions and ticket. We do expect inflation will be stronger in the first half, but moderate in the second half. And what I'd say more broadly is, our market that we participate in continues to run reasonably in line with GDP kind of flat to low single digit growth. And we are taking significant share in the marketplace. As we've said several times over the last three years, our sales growth, half of that can be attributable to share gain. And we certainly are expecting that to continue in 2023. And the share gain is really a composition of the competitive advantages that we have as well as the investments we're making in our Life Out Here strategy and the fact that we're reaching scale on a number of those now, particularly our Fusion and Garden Centers. And they will continue to add material growth to our comps. But again, we're very positive on our outlook for 2023 and expect the momentum that we exited 2022 to continue into the year. Yes. Hey, Liz, good morning and thanks for taking the call. I'm sorry, Karen, I apologize, Karen. Karen, how are you this morning? Good morning. You all are right beside each other your name's alphabetically on my list, so my apologies. But Karen good morning and thanks for your question for joining the call. On the sales growth, as you said, we are in an investment cycle in our business and the thing that we're excited about is that we're able to grow earnings as we did last year double digits, and we're able to grow our sales as we did last year double digits even in the context of an earnings cycle. And we anticipate to continue to grow sales at a significant rate next year as well as our earnings at a significant rate next year, even inclusive of all the capital expenditure and kind of underlying DNA that comes along with that, as well as all the other investments we're making in the business. But we're very optimistic and confident in the outlook that we've provided. On the mix by category, we've roughly talked about discretionary being more like 15% of our business. Big ticket is kind of in the low double digits. There's a few other categories that would be plus or minus in that discretionary area as well. And I think the way we think about that business is that some categories will have - continue to be negative in their comps but there's others when it's seasonally relevant that will be positive. And an example of that is what Kurt articulated in his prepared remarks saying that, our big ticket sales were kind of mid-single digit negative comps. And it was really \u2013 there was two sets of categories in there. The kind of discretionary non-seasonal related ones were kind of negative double digits, but then you had ones that were seasonally relevant and there was a demand around those say like log splitters and snow throwers that are also big ticket and could be viewed as discretionary or in our kind of math for discretionary and those blended together to drive a negative single digit \u2013 mid single digit comp. And we think it'll play out that way much of this year. As an example, as we get into the end of Q1 and early Q2 when we had the drought last year that disproportionately affected as we commented last year, things like riders. And we expect those to come back as the drought is abetting in many areas of the country even in spite of the consumer shifting more towards needs based needs based spend. Anyway, thanks Karen, for joining the call. I appreciate the question. Yes, hey Liz. And good morning, and thanks for joining the call. As we've said several times, last year and this year are two biggest peaks in investments. And as we talked about in our enhanced earnings calls a couple of years ago, the first part of this five-year cycle that we're in for our Life Out Here strategy would be towards more the bottom end of our \u2013 middle end of our range. And then as we move towards the out years, call it, 2024, 2025, 2026, we see opportunities to increment up on our op margin towards that higher end and kind of get back to a nice leverage across our P&L, let's say, 5 or 10 basis points a year. And really, the biggest determinant of the 10.1% to 10.3% this year would just be the sales range. And if we're up more towards the 5.5, we would expect to leverage more on some of our fixed costs and be more towards that 10.3%. If we're down more towards the 3.5%, we think we'll be more in that 10.1% to 10.2% range as there's a little less leverage on some of our fixed costs. We pull some other levers to kind of manage the business. But certainly, as we look out towards the back half of this five-year investment cycle, we see opportunities for our margin rate to increment up. Yes. So the mix of our remodels in 2023 will be a little different than last year because of the Orscheln acquisition. This year, as we shared in our opening remarks, it's kind of 70 to 80-ish new stores that will open this year. We'll also be integrating the 81 Orscheln stores. Those will be kind of basically a Fusion remodel. And then we'll do around 150 more Fusion remodels as well. And that's in line with what we did this year, kind of in that 200 to 250 range. It's just the fact that 80 of those will be taken up by the Orscheln integration this year. We continue to be very excited about Fusion and very excited about our side lots. Go ahead, Liz. Yes, perfect. Look forward to seeing you. Yes, hey, Brian, I'll take the first part of it, and then Kurt will take the second part. On the weather bump, we don't see that as pull forward from Q1. And we see it \u2013 dominantly, it's just incremental in Q4. I'd go back to some of the comments we made, say, in our Q3 earnings call and our Q2 earnings call, where we said, our business has been very consistent in that 5% to 6% comp range all last year. And as Kurt said in his prepared remarks, and I think I did as well, we were trending towards the high end of our comp guidance for Q4 when the storm hit and then that put us well over. I'd equated a bit to what we said if we had gotten \u2013 if the drought hadn't occurred, we think we would have been over our guidance. If we'd had a better spring season, we think we would have been over our guidance for those quarters. I just get back to the point, our business is very consistent, very stable, very reliable right now in that kind of mid single-digits. And then if we get some good weather on top of that, that benefits us, we get that benefit. And that's what we saw in Q4. When the weather is bad, we're there for our customers. And it drives some sales. But otherwise, we continue to run very reliably and consistently in that mid single-digit comps. Yes, hey Simeon, and thanks for joining the call. Good to speak to you this morning. On the C.U.E., I would say our AUR is in line with the rest of the market. So kind of high single-digits, generally speaking, across food and speed, but our market share is on a dollar basis, we're running 2x the market. And on a pound basis, we're running 3x the market in growth. And so it's \u2013 the majority of our growth there well over half is transactions-based, unit-based and share gain. And dog dry food is the numbers I was just mentioning right there, those were specific to that to dog dry food. But we're seeing similar type of numbers in poultry feed, in equine feed, in livestock, et cetera. And I would say it is pulling through to the rest of our business, in terms of driving positive footsteps and transactions into our store. And then also, our average ticket continues to remain very solid with very modest reduction in our UPT. In fact, this was the lowest year-over-year in our UPT decline in 2022. And when you look at the customer \u2013 underlying customer cohorts in our Neighbor's Club program, what you're seeing and as was mentioned in the prepared remarks is that the millennials have moved out to kind of rural America and kind of that Sunbelt migration, they start in poultry and pet food with us and then very quickly are migrating into four to five other categories in terms of us being their destination. And so I'd say we're seeing strong growth, its market share gains in C.U.E. that we're taking. We're confident we will be able to continue to take those gains. We are the lowest cost to serve in the market, the fastest supply chain, the lowest price is the best customer service. And when they get in there, should they shop the whole lifestyle, and we're seeing that in our average ticket and also in our on customer data. Yes. Hey Chris, and good morning. Thanks for your question and for joining the call. First, we were very pleased with our Q4 business in general. As I said and Kurt, absent the storm, we were still at the high end of our comp expectations and we would have still had positive comp transactions for the quarter regardless of the storm. And we were also very pleased with our seasonal businesses. They performed in line with our expectations. And then in the last week of right before Christmas, for us, when we have a winter storm like that, it drives more footsteps into our stores, and they end up shopping the entire lifestyle when they're in there. So we saw excellent performance that week. And in holiday-related items, whether it's in apparel, whether it was in decor, candy, toys, tools. It was a solid, very solid close to the year for us on both, as I said, not only just on demand-driven store-related items. And then on pet, we are seeing unit growth and double-digit comps across all categories in pet, whether it's dog, whether it's cat, whether it's hard goods, whether it's consumables, whether it's food, whether it's sundries or accessories. Certainly, the food is outpacing the other categories, but all categories in our pet business are seeing very strong growth. Yes. Hey, Steven, and good morning. This is a great new story for Tractor Supply. What I've seen historically in my career in retail is it takes time when you have a new customer for them to ramp up through your high-spending cohorts until they become kind of a mature customer. What we've seen is the customers, as you mentioned, I said in my prepared remarks, that we've had tens of millions of new customers shop us in the last three years. The majority of those have continued to be active shoppers with us and a huge portion had become Neighbor's Club members. That cohort is basically shopping us, and we're seeing purchase frequency, average ticket, number of categories shop total spend in the year, very much in line with our kind of long-time core customers. So they've ramped up very fast. And that's why when we say things like our Neighbor's Club is outperforming our overall comp, our total company comp, even at 75% penetration. And even with the growth we've had, that's why I think it's so exceptional because historically, in my past, as you see your membership program becomes such a large portion of your sales is a tendency revert to the mean, right, revert your overall comp. And I think the data set you can see both that we're providing also an underlying data just shows you how fast those customers have ramped up and become core customers for us. And it's what gives us confidence as we head into 2023. Thank you."

And just to go back to some of Hal's comments earlier, I would just say even in Q4 for us, poultry was a primary driver. We have \u2013 unlike some maybe commentary you've heard elsewhere, we have not seen the entire year over the course of the last three years, any slowdown in our poultry business. And when we look ahead to this year, we think it could be another record year for us. Our stores are setting chick days here over the coming months. When we look out to our center court activity. We look at poultry being a predominant driver for us. And when you couple those things with our pet business, you couple those with our live goods business, all the sustainability things that customers are looking for right now is they're looking to find value, to grow those things on their own. We're looking at poultry to be just absolutely another banner year and our team is incredibly excited for that. So we definitely agree with the commentary you're hearing out there, and we think we're in a position to continue to take market share in this category."

            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Let me build on how sentiment for 2022. As we start out the year, we anticipated that our business would continue to exhibit consistent performance as we have a proven business model that has stood the test of time. The team delivered against our goals and exceeded our expectations. The impact of the 53rd week on our performance is detailed in our press release. To recap, the 53rd week added about $225 million to our net sales in the fourth quarter representing 6.8 points of our net sales growth. On a full year basis, it represented 1.8 points of the 11.6% growth year-over-year. Diluted EPS benefited by $0.16 for the quarter and the year. For the fourth quarter, all regions of the country once again delivered positive sales comp. All months were comp positive. As for the cadence of the quarter, our comp store sales were performing at the high end of our outlook as we move into mid-December. Then as Winter Storm Elliott moved across the country, our sales accelerated given the storm's impact on our customers' needs for heat, insulated outerwear, livestock feed and forage and some load up of other C.U.E. products. As Hal shared, we estimate the storm provided about 2 percentage point benefit to our comp sales. Much like any emergency response events such as hurricanes, the profitability of these sales from winter storm events of this magnitude is lower due to the mix of products and higher incremental operating costs. Our commitment to being the dependable supplier for Life Out Here was exhibited during this historic storm. Looking back, when excluding the December winter storm comparable store sales have been remarkably consistent across all four quarters of the year. Similar to trends through the year, retail price inflation contributed about 11 points to our comparable store sales in Q4 as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. The comparable average ticket growth of 6.3% benefited from inflation, partially offset by a shift in sales mix to needs-based consumables versus the larger ticket items. Demand for C.U.E. categories was nearly 3 times the chain average, while big ticket sales performance was down mid-single digits. We did see strong performance in winter needs-based items such as heaters, snow throwers and log splitters. The performance in these big ticket categories somewhat offset the declines we saw in more discretionary categories like utility and recreational vehicles and trailers. Moving on to gross margin. For the fourth quarter, our gross margin improved by 28 basis points to an even 34% of sales. Our price management actions and other margin-driving initiatives were able to offset the pressures from year-over-year product cost inflation, higher transportation costs and product mix due to the strength of C.U.E. categories. During the quarter, we experienced a significant moderation in the rate of price increases from our vendors, but by no means are we seeing deflation. Our promotional activity was in line with the prior year and we are seeing moderation in transportation costs that we expect to flow through in 2023. Of note, it's our belief that transportation costs most likely peaked in the fourth quarter. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 14 basis points year-over-year to 25.1%. As we indicated in Q3, this increase was primarily attributable to three factors: one, the impact of transaction expenses and early integration costs associated with our acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home; two, our strategic growth initiatives, including depreciation and amortization; and three, our investments in team member compensation and benefits. These items were partially offset by a reduction in COVID-19 response costs and leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. Diluted EPS was $2.43, an increase of 25.9% from the fourth quarter of last year. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $2.7 billion, representing an 18% increase year-over-year in average inventory per store. Overall, we continue to believe that our inventory position is in good shape. Today, we believe we are better positioned to drive sustainable long-term growth than we were before the pandemic. Our structural tailwinds such as rural revitalization, home setting, self-reliance and pet ownership continue to benefit us. Our Life Out Here strategic investments have made us stronger. Adjusting for the impact of the 53rd week, our outlook for 2023 is right in line with our long-term targets as we continue to see the power of compounding from our compelling top line growth, operating margin outlook and consistent capital return to shareholders through the dividends and share repurchases. For fiscal 2023, we are forecasting net sales of $15 billion to $15.3 billion, including at least $300 million in sales from Orscheln. Our outlook marks another milestone in our performance as annual sales are forecasted to be above $15 billion. Comparable store sales growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3.5% to 5.5%. We expect gross margin expansion of about 20 to 40 basis points from supply chain benefits and a moderation in both product cost increases and the mix impact of C.U.E. We anticipate SG&A will deleverage modestly due to a few factors. Depreciation amortization is anticipated increase by 17% to 20% relating to our strategic growth initiatives. Also, we opened our ninth distribution center just this month. As a reminder, the operating cost for the new DC are reflected in SG&A, while the supply chain benefits are reflected in gross margin. We expect the incremental cost to pressure SG&A by approximately 15 to 20 basis points. The benefit in gross margin will not completely offset this pressure since it takes time for the new facility to fully ramp to maturity and realize the supply chain benefits. And lastly, the integration of Orscheln Farm and Home is expected to impact SG&A by approximately 5 basis points. These factors are partially offset by the normalization of incentive compensation and leverage occupancy and other operating costs from the increase in comparable store sales. And for the year, we forecast an operating margin of 10.1% to 10.3%. We are forecasting interest expense of approximately $55 million as we have increased borrowings to fund our capital allocation. We plan to maintain a healthy leverage ratio of 2 times or below. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.7% to 23%. We continue to expect the Orscheln acquisition to be accretive to diluted earnings per share by at least $0.10 in 2023. All in, diluted EPS is forecast in the range of $10.30 to $10.60. We continue to believe the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the half of the year. As you model 2023, I want to point out a few things that will impact comparability. And I'd like to give a little color on the flow across quarters. From a sales perspective, we are planning for all four quarters to have comp sales performance generally within our guidance range. We anticipate retail price inflation to benefit comp sales by 3 to 5 points with the benefit being higher in the first half than the second half as inflation pressures begin to moderate. We are planning for positive comp transactions in 2023. As to earnings, we expect our EPS growth to be fairly balanced between first half and second half. There are a couple of discrete items that will impact operating margins in certain quarters. The first quarter will likely be our toughest comparison from an operating margin rate perspective. Start-up costs for the new distribution center will pressure the first quarter, while the supply chain benefits will not begin to be realized until the second quarter. Additionally, transportation costs are expected to continue to be higher year-over-year in Q1 and then begin to moderate through the remainder of the year with the second half expected to see favorable comparisons. As a reminder, the Orscheln stores will be added to the comp store calculation in October when we cycle the acquisition date. Also keep in mind, the discrete items that impact our earnings comparability in 2023 are the lapping of the 53rd week benefit, partially offset by the accretion from the Orscheln acquisition. And when adjusting for the 2022 benefit from the 53rd week and the 2023 accretion from the Orscheln acquisition, our outlook for 2023 is consistent with our long-term EPS guidance of 8% to 11%. Capital expenditures are forecasted to be $700 million to $775 million, with about 80% for growth initiatives. We expect to open approximately 70 new Tractor Supply stores. We continue to be on track for 10 to 15 Petsense store openings in 2023. Our new store pipeline continues to be solid and we expect to improve the cadence of openings in 2023 with more balance throughout the year. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2023, we anticipate share purchases in a range of $575 million to $675 million, which is estimated to have a benefit of a net reduction in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 2%. Our business model has to the test of time and is proven to be resilient. While we are closely monitoring consumer behavior and the impact of economic growth on consumer demand, we believe that we are well positioned for any consumer and economic environment. To wrap up, we are continuing to separate Tractor Supply from the competition. In prior cycles, we've made investments that strengthened the company. We believe the current environment is an opportunity for us to lean into our strength and further expand our lead for years to come. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal. Yes, Brian, good morning. And I'll just add to that. On that winter storm, we view it very much like a discrete event like the hurricane events have been. You heard my commentary on there. The exciting thing though is, with those types of events, consistent with this storm is it introduces Tractor Supply as a needs-based business to other new customers. And that's what we do as we capitalize on that, we see it as part of our opportunity in 2023 as new footsteps into the business. So great opportunity from that one event as we continue to serve our markets in a significant widespread winter storms such as that. In regards to your question about prices abating and how we manage that, one is, we will \u2013 those prices will take time to work through the system. So we do very well at managing whether that be the product cost or the transportation to be able to manage as those flow through and balance between the competitive retail price that we have, gaining market share and how much we actually take to the bottom line. Specifically, the biggest item in the gross margin benefit in 2023 is the easing of the transportation cost. And as you look back even over the last two years, on our gross margin, we've been very specific as we've been able to find offsets or pass through some of those the transportation cost has been the primary one where we've absorbed some of that. And so we will \u2013 as those prices abate and ease through, it's a key contributor to how we expect to see gross margin expansion throughout 2023. Zack, hey, this is Kurt. The first question in regards to cadence throughout the quarter, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the \u2013 all four quarters really would expect to be in line with our overall guidance. We don't expect significant variation between the quarters. I would encourage you, as you reflect back on last year, as we talked about some of the headwinds we saw in the middle parts of the year, with the late start to the spring, the drought that impacted Q2 and Q3. We talked about how in those quarters, there were some headwinds that took some of the top side off of the comps in those quarters. So we see good opportunity to be able to capitalize comping up against those quarters. We obviously had a really strong Q4. We talked about the winter storm. So those are all things that factor into our model as we plan the comps. And on the gross margin question, maybe remind me again your question on the gross margin. Got you. Yes. Well, of course, we always prioritize market share gains competitive in pricing. We are the lowest cost to serve. We've invested in our supply chain and distribution to be able to capitalize on this shift in the environment where transportations are coming down. So we'll be able to take advantage of our own efficiencies that we can control. As there's opportunities as prices decline, we will take some opportunity modest as we see it in our plan, opportunity to invest in the gross margin. And all of that is considered in our expectation that we could see gross margin growing 20 basis points to 40 basis points in 2023. Exactly. Yes. Thank you. There is not a pronouncement, anything of material. And I'd just point back to how consistent each of the quarters were in 2023. So there's really no meaningful shift in there. Hey, Peter, this is Kurt. In regards to CapEx and your two questions, the growth in CapEx in 2022 at the high end of our expectations reflected a couple of things. Certainly, there's inflation in the cost of building a distribution center, the new stores, et cetera, that was a piece of it. But also in this environment, the team has done an excellent job of ramping up and ensuring that all of the pieces that go into these fusion remodels that we've got the fixtures and all of the equipment ready to go. So the pipeline is in good shape for what we plan to use to grow into the 200 to 250 remodeled stores next year. And there's some timing of that capital that impacted 2022. And then certainly, for 2023, we expect consistent numbers. We've got a construction of a complete new distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas. So for both years, they absorbed the $150 million-ish cost of some of our largest distribution centers in those years. And that leads to the second question that you had going forward, we really believe that as we said, these would be the two peak years that the biggest investment over the other years is really on the supply chain side. And it's reverting back more to that over the next few years, $600 million, $650 million in capital going forward. And it's a very planned, purposeful five-year growth to convert the supply chain and the stores into the new Life Out Here strategy, look and shopping experience for our customers. So I would expect to see that number come down a bit after 2023."

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thank you, Mary Winn, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. On behalf of Tractor Supply, I'd like to extend our deepest sympathies and support to our communities and team members impacted by Hurricane Ian. Our store teams, our distribution centers and the store support center have done a tremendous job supporting our customers and communities during this tragic time. The team's dedication at times like this helps make us the dependable supplier our customers can count on. I'm thrilled to report that just over a week ago on October 12, we closed on the transaction to acquire Orscheln Farm and Home. We welcome the Orscheln team to Tractor Supply. We're very pleased with the 81 high-quality locations that will be converted to Tractor Supply over the next 15 months. While agreeing to the remedy with the FTC took longer than we anticipated, the outcome is in line with our expectations. We are committed to providing customers in the Midwest region with an expanded product assortment, a meaningful loyalty offering and enhanced digital shopping experience and so much more that Tractor Supply is able to offer. Two and a half years have passed since COVID emerged in the United States. With this quarter's results, we have now posted 10 consecutive quarters of exceptional sales growth. And from my perspective, the highlight of this impressive track record continues to be the consistency of our results and the broad-based strength of our performance. Our 3-year comp sales stack in the third quarter was approximately 46%, in line with the second quarter. And including new stores, our overall revenue growth on a 3-year basis has increased 65%. Our addressable market continues to benefit from numerous secular trends that we believe are structurally sound. Additionally, by all measures, we are gaining substantial share in our market. We've had tens of millions of new customers shop us, the past 3 years. We've retained the majority of these customers and have a substantial portion have become active members of our Neighbor's Club program. I commend the team for stepping up to every challenge that has come at us over this time period. They've done a tremendous job, maintaining their focus on the factors that we can control and all the while expanding our competitive moat through the advancement of our Life Out Here strategy. We continue to operate in an ever-changing and challenging macro environment, which convey for a new recession, but from our view real economic growth in the near to medium term will remain flattish and tepid. On the positive side, a great sign is that we're seeing moderation in supply chain bottlenecks. However, inflation remains persistent and elevated and we anticipate this to continue well into 2023 with some moderation in the back half of 2023. At the same time, the labor market continues to remain very constrained, and we expect that this will remain the case for the foreseeable future, particularly on the front line. And as we move into next year, the labor market will be a key determiner of our country's ability to return our economy to sustainable conditions. Turning to our third quarter performance. The Tractor Supply team delivered another quarter of record results. with net sales of 8.4% growth. Comparable store sales increase of 5.7% and diluted earnings per share of $2.10. Our business continues to be incredibly resilient, and the quarter unfolded much like we anticipated. Now let's go through some of the highlights for the quarter. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by strong ticket growth of 7%, partially offset by a transaction count decline of 1.3%. As we shared entering the quarter, we anticipated that the drought would take some of the upside potential off our sales performance, and that was exactly how the quarter played out. By our estimation, less favorable weather negatively impacted our comp sales by about 150 basis points. As the drought and the heat conditions abated, we exited the quarter with strong momentum. All months of the quarter comped positive. August comp sales were stronger than July and September was the strongest month of the quarter, and we had flat comp transactions in the month of September. E-commerce achieved sales growth in the high single digits, and we continue to build out our ONETractor capabilities. During the quarter, we added an app features such as My Pet and upgraded our in-store mode. And we also rolled out inventory quantity visibility at the store level across all our digital properties. For the sixth consecutive quarter, we continued to see our consumable, usable and edible products outperform our overall comp sales results. And this is the third consecutive quarter for C.U.E. to run at about 3x the rate of our overall comp sales performance. This strong performance was driven by dry dog food and feed for poultry, equine and wild birds. C.U.E. continues to be one of our structural advantages. And these products represent the strength of our core business and what drives trips and footsteps into our stores. Our outperformance in year-round categories offset the declines in our late spring-summer seasonal product and big ticket categories. We continue to gain share across all our categories, both in-store and online. Our Neighbor's Club membership this quarter exceeded 27 million members, and it represented nearly 75% of our sales for the quarter. Neighbor's Club continued to successfully help migrate customers up in their spending with us. And during the quarter, we reached an all-time high in high-value customers. In August, we rebranded Petsense to Petsense by Tractor Supply. In August, we also rolled out the Neighbor's Club program to Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. This expansion will deepen relationships with our existing customers and helped attract new pet customers to both banners. And while it's early, we are very pleased with our customers' response to these initiatives, with our Neighbor's Club membership already representing over 35% of sales at Petsense. For the third consecutive quarter, our overall customer satisfaction scores hit a new all-time high as we continue to invest in our team to provide best-in-class customer service. We ended the quarter with our inventory in great shape. As we said many times, if anything, we'd like to have more inventory. And we're now working hard to grow inventory in targeted categories to improve our in-stock position and serve as that dependable supplier for our customers. We continue to stay true to our EDLP routes, and our promotional activity in the third quarter was below the prior year's third quarter. We've made significant progress in our Life Out Here strategy. We now have over 500 stores that are in our Project Fusion layout and our Garden Center transformation is now active in over 260 locations. We continue to be pleased with the strategic benefits and financial returns of these store level investments. Given our performance through the third quarter, our acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are raising our sales and earning guidance for 2022. Kurt will share more details on our improved outlook later in the call. Stepping back, Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. Our resilient need-based business model has a proven history of growing through vary economic conditions. Our customers and team members are dedicated to the Out Here lifestyle, and they prioritize it as it is their authentic lifestyle. Our customers over-index as homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. We believe that the structural macro trends that have been benefiting us are long term and sustainable. And as the market leader, we have substantial advantages and continue to gain share. The investment in our Life Out Here strategy is reaching critical mass and furthering our competitive advantage. Simply said, Tractor Supply has never been stronger. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Our business continues to be incredibly resilient. This is a business that was built for all economic environments with stability in both revenue and earnings over multiple decades. Comparable store sales have been remarkably consistent across all 3 quarters year-to-date. All regions of the country once again delivered positive sales comps. The geographic diversification of our store base worked to our advantage this quarter. The South Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic were our best-performing regions. As expected, we did experience softer performance in select regions of the country impacted by the severe heat and drought in particular, in the Far West and Texahoma regions, which, while positive, lagged the chain average. For background, July was the second hottest in 30-plus years. And during August, about 40% of the U.S. was under extreme drought conditions. As Hal shared, we believe that the less than ideal weather weighed on our transactions as well as our big ticket sales. Much like the second quarter, retail price inflation contributed about 12 points to our comparable store sales as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. The comparable average ticket growth of 7% benefited from inflation, partially offset by declines in big ticket sales and average units per transaction. Big ticket sales performance, while positive on a 2-year stack was impacted by the severe drought and cycling 2 hurricanes in the prior year. We saw the largest impact in categories such as generators, 0 turns and trailers. Moving on to gross margin. For the third quarter, our gross margin declined by 32 basis points to 35.6% of sales. Our price management actions and our other margin-driving initiatives were able to offset the pressures from cost inflation and higher transportation costs. With the continued robust growth in our C.U.E. categories, we saw pressure on our gross margin as C.U.E. runs below chain average on gross margin rate. In regard to inflation, while moderating, we continue to see increasing costs in the commodity inputs in our product categories, as well as underlying variables like higher labor wages and transportation costs impacting both us and our vendor partners. We have remained agile and nimble to manage all the complexity of today's environment, effectively managing cost increases at the SKU level through our price management actions and other margin driving initiatives. The team has also been working to capture efficiencies in the supply chain to reduce miles continuing to limit promotions and leaning into the more efficient value provided through Neighbor's Club. SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 9% to the prior year's third quarter. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 16 basis points year-over-year to 26.3%. This increase was in line with our expectations, primarily attributable to our strategic growth initiatives, including depreciation and amortization; and hourly wage and benefit investments in both our stores and our distribution centers. These items were partially offset by a moderation of COVID-19 response costs, more normalized incentive compensation and leverage in our occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. Diluted EPS was $2.10, an increase of 7.7% from the third quarter of last year. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $2.7 billion, representing a 19.2% increase year-over-year in average inventory per store. The increase reflects growth to support the robust sales trends along with the impact of inflation. Looking at our inventory growth on a 3-year stack, it represents a 30% increase in average inventory per store compared to Q3 2019, meaningfully below our sales increase over the same period of time. There continue to be select product categories where we are still pursuing inventory, especially in C.U.E. Stepping back, we believe our inventory position is in good shape. Our strong balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a position of strength for Tractor Supply, allowing us to invest in the business for growth and return cash to shareholders. To further our financial flexibility, we just entered into a new 5-year credit agreement on September 30 that increases our senior credit facility from $700 million to $1.2 billion. We also added 2 new banks to our banking group, including a minority-owned bank. Moving now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2022. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results for the first 3 quarters of the year and the positive momentum we see in our business continuing into the fourth quarter. In addition, we are incorporating the impact of our recent acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home. We are forecasting fiscal 2022 net sales of $14.06 billion to $14.12 billion including about $75 million in sales from Orscheln. This is the first time in the history of our company that annual sales are forecast to be above $14 billion. Comparable store sales growth is anticipated to be in the range of 5.4% to 5.8%. For the year, we now forecast an operating margin of 10.1% to 10.5% in line with our prior guidance, but with modest pressure from the acquisition as the sales and earnings benefit from Orscheln Farm and Home are offset by incremental transaction expenses and early integration costs. We anticipate the impact of Orscheln to be relatively neutral to operating income, while we expect a modestly negative impact on net income due to the interest expense associated with funding the acquisition. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $9.55 to $9.63. This compares to our previous earnings range of $9.48 to $9.60 per diluted share. We entered October with momentum. With this updated guidance, we are forecasting comparable store sales growth for the fourth quarter of 5% to 7%. We now expect to open approximately 60 to 70 new Tractor Supply stores, which is modestly below our outlook as we entered the year. We continue to be on track for 10 Petsense store openings in 2022. Given the conditions of the real estate and construction industries, the cadence of store openings for Tractor Supply has shifted a number of the openings into the fourth quarter. I give the cross-functional teams a lot of credit for completing over 250 projects this year as they lay the foundation for 2023 and beyond. Our new store pipeline continues to be solid and we expect to improve the cadence of openings in 2023 with more balance throughout the year. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2022, we remain on track for anticipated share repurchases in a range of $750 million to $800 million. As is customary, we will provide our full guidance for 2023 at our fourth quarter earnings call. We are early in our planning cycle for the next year. I thought it'd be helpful to set the stage and share some preliminary insights and color into our thought process, given that there are a few moving parts between 2022 and 2023. Our business model has stood the test of time and has proven to be resilient. We have significant confidence with 2023 on the horizon. We are well positioned for any consumer and economic environment. Further, we have consistent structural trends that will continue to benefit us. We continue to invest in our Life Out Here value strategy to capture this growth. Now the discrete items that impact our earnings in 2023 are the lapping of the 53rd week benefit this year, and the accretion from Orscheln acquisition. As I've shared previously, we forecast that the 53rd week will add approximately 1.5% growth in net sales and about $0.15 to the EPS this year. As you saw our press release earlier this month, we expect the Orscheln acquisition to be accretive to diluted earnings per share by at least $0.10. When adjusting for the 2022 benefit from the 53rd week and the accretion from the Orscheln acquisition, we plan for 2023's performance to be consistent with our long-term EPS guidance of 8% to 11% with our bias at this point in planning towards the midpoint of our range. Despite what might play out with the economy, this needs-based demand-driven characteristics of our product offering support our ability to deliver on our long-term outlook. We are making great progress towards our long-term financial goals, and we look forward to sharing with you our 2023 plans in more detail at our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Now to wrap up, we are continuing to separate Tractor Supply from the competition. In prior cycles, we have made investments that strengthened the company. We believe the current environment is an opportunity for us to lean into our strengths and further expand our lead for years to come.  And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Kurt. Tractor Supply is a business with momentum. As our customers prepare for cooler temperatures and the calendar shift to the fall and winter season, our stores are ready for the change. From key categories like heating and insulated apparel, our merchants have brought newness with compelling value. In our C.U.E. categories, we have the right selection and are in stock as we continue to support our customers' lifestyles. This year, we expanded our Halloween and Harvest Decor program with a great lineup to capitalize on our customers' love of decorating their homes with seasonal indoor and outdoor decor. With more than 260 Garden Centers, we're showcasing the fall harvest season with everything from pumpkins to mums, and will be ready for the transition to the Christmas holiday season with an expanded offering of outdoor decorations. Despite the economic outlook, we are optimistic about holiday-related sales. From the calendar perspective, it's a good setup with 30 days this year between Thanksgiving and Christmas, with Christmas falling on a Sunday. We have a strong day after Thanksgiving game plan and compelling offers planned throughout the season. Given the increasing financial constraints facing American consumers, we're excited in the coming weeks to introduce the Tractor Supply Visa Credit Card. This new co-brand credit card will help our consumers earn more on their everyday purchases, both in-store and anywhere Visa is accepted. With the Tractor Supply Visa Card, customers receive access to all the perks from the private label TSC personal credit card that they have such as 5% rewards on Tractor Supply purchases or special financing on purchases at $199 and up, but they also will receive 3% in rewards on gas station, grocery and vet purchases and 1% in rewards on all other purchases. And all consumer card members with Tractor Supply received Neighbor's Club Preferred Plus benefits. This is exciting progress on our journey to driving sales, building loyalty and adding more value to our Neighbor's Club membership and reducing tender expense through our credit offerings. 2022 is shaping up to be another great year for Tractor Supply. With one quarter to go, we are on track to achieve several monumental milestones in the growth of our company, including annual revenues in excess of $14 billion, a store base of over 2,100 Tractor Supply locations and a highly engaged workforce of 50,000-plus team members. That said, we are not resting on our laurels. We have robust plans in place for 2023 to continue on our life out here strategic journey. As we enter the new year, the transformation of our business has significant momentum. Investments such as Neighbor's Club, our FAST program and our mobile app are at scale on providing dividends. Our store investments are reaching scale, and we have compelling new growth vectors such as the integration of Orscheln and many other opportunities on the list. With a healthy total addressable market of $180 billion, Tractor Supply is well positioned to continue to gain market share while fulfilling our purpose as a company. As we enter one of the busiest peers in retail, my thanks and sincere appreciation go out to each of our 50,000-plus Tractor Supply team members for their dedication to our mission and values. And with that, operator, we'd now like to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.\nElizabeth Suzuki: So you mentioned that you would have liked to have had more inventory, do you think that you left any sales on the table as a result of being out of stock?\nHal Lawton: Liz, thanks for joining the call. I think we're doing an excellent job on navigating inventory and managing it. We don't feel like we're leaving any sales on the table because of it. But I think we are, at times, incurring some higher cost to run the inventory through our supply chain than we might otherwise. And also just on the labor side, having to work the back room a little bit more frequently than normal. The team has done an excellent job on it. But if you look at kind of weeks of supply and kind of pallet low quantities, we would be looking to continue to add inventory in our core C.U.E. businesses.  As we talked about, this is the third consecutive quarter where our C.U.E. business has performed at 3x the chain average, dry dog food running well above 20% comps and other feed categories running very strong as well. And so it's just all about keeping up with the customer and then building our supply chain for the future to make sure that we can continue to move these billions and billions of pounds of food and feed that we do every year and maintain as lower cost as possible. We're very excited about our Navarre, Ohio, D.C. opening up early next year that will give us a little more streamlined supply chain and capacity to continue to serve our customers in Life Out Here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird.\nPeter Benedict: Appreciate some of the thoughts you guys gave here, at least initially around next year. Hal, I think we can appreciate how strong your business is. A lot of uncertainties on the macro front. You alluded to that early in your comments. How do you think about -- and maybe for Kurt as well here, just the company's ability to still land in that earnings algo in the event we get a tougher economic environment maybe than what your base case is, where are the levers? How do you think about managing the business in that environment? That's my question.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Thanks for joining the call today. Good to talk with you. We feel very confident in our ability to deliver 2023 and continue to deliver on our long-term targets. If you look at the consistency of our business this year with a 5.1, 5.5 ,5.7 comp, a strong outlook for Q4, very consistent in an economy this year that you would argue really is stagflation kind of flattish, real growth, high single-digit inflation.  And as we look towards next year, our expectation, it will be much of the same. What I would say -- and consequently, our business will continue to be very resilient and stable. And the other thing I would add is, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, I mean many of our investments are just now starting to reach significant scale, and we expect that they will pay substantive dividends next year. We're now at over 500 stores and our Fusion layout seeing very strong results there. Many of those will be comping for the first time next year. Same thing on Garden Centers, 260, many of those came online just at the beginning of this year. We expect they will, just like we saw in the first year class, they will have a new store kind of maturity curve like sales growth. And so we expect really strong results out of those Garden Centers as we head into next year. We've gotten much better at rolling out our remodel programs, and we've got a number of Garden Centers queued up for implementation and execution before we get to spring of next year. So we feel like the economy is stable. We -- our outlook on the economy is not much different than what it is right now. We expect our business to continue to be very resilient and allow us to deliver our long-term targets. And as I said, our Life Out Here strategic initiatives are really reaching scale now and the benefits that we've talked about are starting to kind of really add up across our store base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital.\nScott Mushkin: So I just wanted to -- you guys continue to kind of expand out your TAM and maybe I've missed it over time, but we've been coming across a lot of vet clinics in your stores. And I was just wondering what -- is that a big initiative, again, maybe I've missed it? And when do you think that can add kind of as we go forward?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Scott, it's good to talk to you today, and thanks for joining the call. The vet clinics are a core part of our fusion kind of menu. And as we go in to execute a Fusion store, we look at the existing mobile clinic activity. And if it warrants -- given the frequency of business and the customer count, if it warrants a stand-alone vet clinic, we are putting those in. And they've been very successful and are just really another value-added feature to support our pet business. As we talked about, we are gaining substantial share in pet.  For the last handful of quarters, we've run 10 to 15 points above the market growth rate in pet. And even as you're hearing others talk about the pet business starting to moderate, we aren't seeing that at all in our business, and it's because we're gaining substantial share. That share gain starts with the core basics of great customer service, in-stock, the right price, strong private label brands, but then it's certainly augmented with our other offerings, whether it's pet wash, whether it's the vet clinics and our Rx solutions, which are available online. And the pet business is a strong source of growth for us, and we expect it will continue to be as we go forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners.\nSteven Forbes: I wanted to focus on member trends. So Hal, curious if you can discuss any incremental learnings around retention or repeat behavior, specifically as it pertains to the 2020 member cohort as they approach their second anniversary. And then maybe just quickly comment on whether you view the 2021 or 2022 cohorts any differently?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Thanks for the call and the question. We continue to be very pleased with our Neighbor's Club program. And more broadly, our customer relationship management that we've had over the last 3 years that the Neighbor's Club rollout that we did nearly 2 years ago now -- 1.5 years ago now has exceeded our expectations. We've had tens of millions of new customers shoppers over the last 3 years and the majority of those customers continue to shop at Tractor Supply. And a majority of those that have continued to shop at Tractor Supply have also joined our Neighbor's Club program and been a big driver of our membership growth. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we had the highest level of high-value customers this quarter that we've ever had. And a lot of those are new customers that have grown with us over the last 2 and 3 years. And as we gain new customers also in '21 and '22, they are following that kind of continued kind of above historical average performance, both in their kind of average purchase sizes in a year, their frequency of purchase with us and also the expanding number of categories that they're shopping with us also. I think this has been a big area of success for us and it's really what's been able to create that foundation for us to have held the 65% growth in sales we've had over the last 3 quarters. I mean last 3 years. And you think about a lot of other businesses that had similar new customer growth that have given back much of that growth. And that's not been the case with us. I mean we firmly believe that the secular trends that have benefited us had are structurally sound, that the share gains we've gained are structurally sound and a lot of it has to do with our very sophisticated CRM capabilities that are far and away kind of best-in-class overall in retail and certainly in our market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JP Morgan Chase.\nChris Horvers: So can you talk a little bit more about the shape of the quarter? With September 7 comp, and as we look forward, should the inflation lift moderate along the lines of the comparisons, but then traffic turned slightly positive? Or does the persistence of wage inflation lead to acceleration in the inflation stacks over the next 3 or 4 quarters as you can see it today.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Good morning, Chris, and how are you? We had -- we exited -- as we mentioned, September was our strongest month of the quarter. Outperformed relative to the overall average, obviously, and had flat comp transactions. It has -- we have had that momentum continue and even a little bit more coming into the fourth quarter here. It's certainly been cooler weather for the first month of the quarter here. And that's driven nice heating sales and insulated outerwear sales and heating fuel sales.  As you know, some big businesses for us in the fourth quarter are propane and wood pellets. And just given the high energy costs that are out there, the cooler weather that's already begun, the angst that our consumers have around inflation, some of the concerns around how European energy prices might be back in the United States. We are very optimistic about how those categories will play out in the fourth quarter. And also optimistic around how the flat comp transactions in September will play out for the fourth quarter as well for us. And we feel like if you look back over the first 9 months of the year, there are numerous months where we had flat or positive comp transactions. And the ones where we didn't, you really can identify them through either stimulus in March and April of last year or whether it was the drought and heat-related activities or the delayed spring through Q1 and Q2. But if you look at January, February, et cetera and then you look at how we exited in Q3 and a couple of slices of month in Q2 where we had flat deposit and comp transactions, we feel very good that those sorts of trends will extrapolate into Q4. As it relates to inflation, we do anticipate that there will be some moderation towards the back half of next year. But if you look at our 2-year stacks on inflation and carry that into the first half of next year, we do anticipate that inflation will remain at elevated rates through at least the first half of next year. And I think that's reasonably consistent with the overall kind of macro U.S. outlook as well. But we do feel really good about our comp transactions now as we head into the fourth quarter and the momentum that we have going into the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist.\nScot Ciccarelli: So Hal, previously, I think you touched a little bit on this earlier, maybe on Peter's question. And historically, you guys provided some expectations regarding the impact of your fusion remodels and side lot transformations. And now with some, let's call it, significant experience under your belt, I was hoping you could potentially update us on any other stats that you're kind of seeing out of these initiatives? Maybe any other important learnings that you've been able to conclude.\nHal Lawton: Scott, and thanks for joining the call, and thanks for the question. We continue to be very pleased with our store remodel program. And on the sales side, they continue to perform at the level of results that we articulated at the beginning of this year. So that's for a combo store that has both Fusion and side lot inclusive of a garden center. They're performing in the high single-digit lifts year-over-year kind of pre post net of control. . And when you look at a store where we've only done Fusion, they're performing in that mid-single-digit lift. And as we all know, it hasn't been in retail for decades now. When you first start a store remodel program, because you're handholding it, you're going to get a nice lift. But then as you start to scale. A lot of times, those lifts will start to diminish and moderate a bit, that has not been the case with us. we're now at 500 Fusion stores and over 260 garden centers, and we continue to see that same type of lift even as we reach scale, real tribute to our team on the execution, operations and then ensuring that we've got the right programs as we roll those out. Other learnings, our customers are taking note of these remodels. We're seeing on our customer satisfaction surveys, we're seeing overall increases after the remodel. We're seeing kind of questions like the condition of the store, the appearance of the store, many of our customers qualitative will ask if we've updated the store and they notice it. And the same thing on the garden centers. We're seeing many new customers shop our business once we roll out a garden center, much higher female penetration, much higher millennial penetration. And we're seeing it be a driver of footsteps into our store to kind of starting the next kind of version of C.U.E. category in our business and that being live goods. I think the big learning force has been on cost. We continue to challenge ourselves on our rollout timing and our costs. We continue to reduce the length of time required to roll one of these out that minimizes the disruption cannibalization, and we're also continuing to bring down the cost through optimization of our fixtures, optimization of our construction plans and particularly on the garden center, our designs there. So if anything, we feel like the performance is better than it was 9 months ago, kind of equivalent, if not better, sales lift and customer reaction. And we continue to find ways to bring costs down on the program. So we're very pleased with the remodels and excited to continue to roll it out to the next set of stores next year and continue to bring into our whole store base.\nOperator: Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: I wanted to ask about strategic growth initiatives with regards to either CapEx and SG&A as it flows through the P&L. Can you give us a sense, is the business at the top of a spending cycle now with a lot of the changes that have brought in over the last few years? Or do investments in SG&A, do they step up? Do they moderate? Or do they decelerate from here?\nKurt Barton: Simeon, this is Kurt. Good morning to you and everybody on the call. In regards to our investment cycle, 2022, 2023 has really been viewed as, to your point, a peak in that investment cycle. We will be opening up Navarre, Ohio, as Hal mentioned earlier. We will be building the Maumelle, Arkansas distribution center in 2023, and we'll continue our path on this cadence for the existing store remodels under the Fusion program.  So 2023 is really a bit of that peak. But it has been planned that way with the growth and depreciation that we've seen this year, roughly mid- to high 20%. We expect to see in 2023, about a similar year-over-year growth rate moderating net growth rate over time. So our SG&A is -- we've got great visibility to it. We feel confident to the point that Hal mentioned on cost. And the pressures from the investments, we also see the offsets to that in SG&A that we've got in regards to leveraging on these -- the comp sales. I am thrilled about the maturity and the development of the culture and the organization's view on profit improvement. We've got a lot of great things in the works right now, not only on the supply chain side and how we can continue to leverage the investments there to drive improvements in gross margin, but what we can do through procurement and how this organization is focused on driving efficiencies and productivities in the stores and in our distribution centers. So to wrap that up, yes, there continues to be pressure from investments in the business very much as we expected. But we've got also in the trend rate the expectations of the offsets to it, which is how we see SG&A generally playing flattish as a percentage of sales going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore ISI.\nOliver Wintermantel: I had a question regarding trade down if you've seen any of that within categories and if you expect promotions to step up in the fourth quarter?\nSeth Estep: Hey, Oliver. This is Seth. Thanks for joining the call. When we look at trends in the category today, we're not seeing any meaningful trade down at this time. In fact, if you look at our kind of portfolio strategy, we've got a very balanced portfolio across kind of opening price point all the way up to our premium segments within our category strategies. And we continue to see strength across all 3 categories.  One of the things that's very encouraging though as well is north of our 20% store-owned exclusive brands that we have. We're really starting to see our customer base really dive into our exclusive brands. And our exclusive brand penetration in Q3 was up 130 basis points over the prior year as they're really navigating to our premium value-oriented segments or our exclusive brand and really driving loyalty. And that's something you'll see us continue to lean in on the balance of this year. But even more importantly, as we look into 2023 is how we continue to go after that loyalty factor relative to our portfolio of strategy and driving both innovation across all 3 product tiers and then really leaning into exclusive brands. On promotional cadence and activity, you'll see us very similar to last year. I mean we've got over 27 million members in our Neighbor's Club today. We're really leaning into that capability. We're really hitting our stride, diving into that data set, being very smart with our promotional activity, but also make sure that we're pulsing the market relative to Black Friday and some other things with just some great offers that we partner with some of our key suppliers on. So you see some messaging there as well, but our promotional activity should be consistent with what you've seen recently over the course of the last couple of years as we've really been focused on our EDLP approach and making sure we're gaining market share in our essential businesses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs.\nKate McShane: Just now that the transaction is closed, I wondered if you could talk any more about Orscheln and how you plan to integrate that and what you see in terms of the future for those 81 stores you are now taking on?\nHal Lawton: Kate, good morning. Thanks for joining the call. And thanks for your question on Orscheln. To start out, just reiterating my prepared remarks that we're thrilled to have Orscheln join Tractor Supply. While the transaction took longer than we anticipated, the outcome was very much in line with our original expectations on the remedy that would be necessary. We are already well underway to welcoming them into the company and starting to map out our plans for converting those stores to the Tractor Supply brand. We will be basically executing the Fusion and Garden Center remodel programs in those stores. And obviously, there'll be a little extra involved with them in terms of new signage for our nameplates and some updating of fixtures and painting of the walls and such like that. But we will -- our plan is to have all that accomplished by the end of next year. At the same time, we're excited to learn from Orscheln on a number of categories where they play differently than we do in terms of distortions. And on the same side, we think there's a lot of opportunity for us to take some of our best practices to them -- to their stores; one, in terms of -- and then driving dollars per square foot up closer to where we are because they're at about kind of 50-ish percent of where we are in dollars per square foot and because they are lesser dollars per square foot, the op margin percent on a per store basis is lower as well. So we're optimistic that we can raise that over time as well. And so there's some sales synergies over time, there'll be some op margin synergies over time. And then additionally, we'll be bringing our brand awareness to that business well over 80% unaided and aided together and things like our Neighbor's Club program, our digital capabilities. So we're really excited to have them join us. It gives us a great additional footprint in the Midwest. We're excited about transitioning those stores to the Tractor Supply brand and then bringing kind of the whole of Tractor Supply to those stores and ultimately and most importantly, to our customers there in that area of the country.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.\nChuck Grom: Most of my questions have been asked, but I was curious on supply chain, how you talked about some relief on that front. I guess I'm curious, the lag, and how long we should anticipate it? To start to see some freight relief ocean container cost start to show up in the P&L?\nKurt Barton: Chuck, this is Kurt. On transportation costs, as Hal indicated, we are seeing both domestic and to an extent, imports those costs beginning to moderate as the demand on the overall global supply is starting to ease. So we are taking advantage of that. To your question about the timing of it. Two factors. One, it's got to work its way through the pipeline. So we could start to see cost in early to mid-2023, reflecting newer improved transportation costs. And that's from 2 factors, not only selling through the cost of goods that have the peak cost in them currently today. We work off of and advantage off of longer-term contracts. And so what the team is doing and has been doing as the demand on supply -- on the supply chain and transportation eases our negotiations on those costs. So as we begin to see overall contract prices come down, those will start to go through the pipeline. And in transportation, in the long term, 2023 and beyond, we do see that as one of the areas of efficiency, one of the areas that does help us and as part of our algorithm in gross margin expansion over time as we come off some of these peak transportation costs. But do see about a 6- to 9-month process not only to get inventory through the supply chain, but to be able to be working off of new and lower contracted costs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.\nAtul Maheswari:  This is Atul Maheswari for Michael Lasser. I have a follow-up question for you on inflation. You mentioned that inflation is likely to moderate in the back half of next year. But what are the chances that there could be deflation, especially given there are signs that some costs are coming in. And if there is deflation, how would you expect your P&L to react to such backdrop? Because back in 2016 and '17, you're a few quarters of sluggish comp. Then because of some deflation, but how is the business today that will help you navigate the statuary backlog better than what you'd back at?\nHal Lawton: Yes, thanks for the question. We don't foresee a scenario of deflation in any near-term time horizon. '23 or into '24. If you look at where our retailers are now and just flow those through into the first half of the year, we're going to be at mid- to high single-digit inflation. And then fully expect that, that will moderate into the back half, both as we start to navigate reducing COGS increases but also, hopefully, as the economy PPI and CPI and other kind of inflationary indexes start to moderate as well. But I don't foresee at all a scenario of deflation in the near -- in any time horizon over the next few years. What I would say on some of those commodity-based products, we're well past just kind of core supply demand out there and the market is moving like they had 4, 5, 6 years ago in a normal environment. We're now in a market where even they've got higher input cost, whether it's fertilizer, and et cetera, that just has not come down. And even if it comes down, it's only coming down in a moderate way. They've got higher labor cost 10, 15, 20 points above a couple of years ago, and there's significant capacity constraints. I mean if you look at pet food, there are significant capacity constraints in the pet food market right now. So that's going to limit cost. That's going to limit any cost decreases that come. It's just the dynamics of the way the supply demand is shaping up right now. And then when you factor in non-U.S. markets and all the risk there, whether it's down in South America or certainly in middle -- in Eastern Europe with Ukraine and Russia and the difficulties in the war there, I just don't foresee a market at all where commodities are moderating to the point where they're driving substantive deflation in our business. That's just -- I don't see that in the cards at all.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: The question I have. Clearly, I mean clearly, Tractor Supplies are performing remarkably well here. And this is despite some macro headwinds out there. I mean the question I have as we look into '23 or whenever, if macro conditions were to worsen and start to impact somewhat the trends at Tractor, are there levers or what were the levers that you -- either you could or you would pull either from a cost standpoint or maybe a merchandising perspective to better tailor your business to that type of environment?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Brian, and thanks for the question, and thanks for the remarks on our quarter. We're very optimistic around Q3 -- I mean around 2023. As I mentioned earlier, on the revenue side, many of our initiatives are just starting to really reach kind of scale that you can kind of \u201csee from space.\u201d You think about 500 Fusion stores now, 260 Garden Centers, the continued strong lift we're seeing with those as we round into next year, we anticipate that those will continue to help fuel our business, and if there is any sort of further degradation of the economy that they can help fill in some of those cracks. I also anticipate that our core competitors, if the economy weakens further, will face increasing financial difficulties, and that will only be further opportunity for us to go gain share. So we feel very good on the top side around 2023 in our ability to gain share and grow and do that within the context of our long-term guidance. And then on the cost side, while there's a bunch that goes in and goes out, while we performed well in the last 2 years and half off to the team for managing our operating margins, there's been a lot of inefficiencies in our cost base the last couple of years, higher container cost, higher freight costs, having to open up pop-up distribution centers freight arriving -- and not on the day and time that we anticipated in the back of the stores or having inefficient labor in our stores to do tasking. As we move into 2023, we fully anticipate that our business will be the most streamlined from a supply chain perspective, all the way from the manufacturer into the stores and on our shelves that it's been in 3 years. And so we're optimistic on that from a cost perspective, being able to help drive our overall profitability and our margins. And again, just very confident as we turn into 2023 near 1 quarter to go, but a lot of momentum as we enter Q4 here now, and we expect that, that will be the case as we transition into 2023.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions. This concludes our QA session for today's call. I will now pass back to Mary Winn Pilkington for closing remarks. Thank you.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thank you, Flora, and thank you for everybody for joining our call. Marianne and I will be around today if you have any remaining questions, please feel free to reach out. And the team looks forward to speaking to you at Q4 in January. So thank you for your interest in Tractor Supply.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn, and thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. On behalf of Tractor Supply, I'd like to extend our deepest sympathies and support to our communities and team members impacted by Hurricane Ian. Our store teams, our distribution centers and the store support center have done a tremendous job supporting our customers and communities during this tragic time. The team's dedication at times like this helps make us the dependable supplier our customers can count on. I'm thrilled to report that just over a week ago on October 12, we closed on the transaction to acquire Orscheln Farm and Home. We welcome the Orscheln team to Tractor Supply. We're very pleased with the 81 high-quality locations that will be converted to Tractor Supply over the next 15 months. While agreeing to the remedy with the FTC took longer than we anticipated, the outcome is in line with our expectations. We are committed to providing customers in the Midwest region with an expanded product assortment, a meaningful loyalty offering and enhanced digital shopping experience and so much more that Tractor Supply is able to offer. Two and a half years have passed since COVID emerged in the United States. With this quarter's results, we have now posted 10 consecutive quarters of exceptional sales growth. And from my perspective, the highlight of this impressive track record continues to be the consistency of our results and the broad-based strength of our performance. Our 3-year comp sales stack in the third quarter was approximately 46%, in line with the second quarter. And including new stores, our overall revenue growth on a 3-year basis has increased 65%. Our addressable market continues to benefit from numerous secular trends that we believe are structurally sound. Additionally, by all measures, we are gaining substantial share in our market. We've had tens of millions of new customers shop us, the past 3 years. We've retained the majority of these customers and have a substantial portion have become active members of our Neighbor's Club program. I commend the team for stepping up to every challenge that has come at us over this time period. They've done a tremendous job, maintaining their focus on the factors that we can control and all the while expanding our competitive moat through the advancement of our Life Out Here strategy. We continue to operate in an ever-changing and challenging macro environment, which convey for a new recession, but from our view real economic growth in the near to medium term will remain flattish and tepid. On the positive side, a great sign is that we're seeing moderation in supply chain bottlenecks. However, inflation remains persistent and elevated and we anticipate this to continue well into 2023 with some moderation in the back half of 2023. At the same time, the labor market continues to remain very constrained, and we expect that this will remain the case for the foreseeable future, particularly on the front line. And as we move into next year, the labor market will be a key determiner of our country's ability to return our economy to sustainable conditions. Turning to our third quarter performance. The Tractor Supply team delivered another quarter of record results. with net sales of 8.4% growth. Comparable store sales increase of 5.7% and diluted earnings per share of $2.10. Our business continues to be incredibly resilient, and the quarter unfolded much like we anticipated. Now let's go through some of the highlights for the quarter. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by strong ticket growth of 7%, partially offset by a transaction count decline of 1.3%. As we shared entering the quarter, we anticipated that the drought would take some of the upside potential off our sales performance, and that was exactly how the quarter played out. By our estimation, less favorable weather negatively impacted our comp sales by about 150 basis points. As the drought and the heat conditions abated, we exited the quarter with strong momentum. All months of the quarter comped positive. August comp sales were stronger than July and September was the strongest month of the quarter, and we had flat comp transactions in the month of September. E-commerce achieved sales growth in the high single digits, and we continue to build out our ONETractor capabilities. During the quarter, we added an app features such as My Pet and upgraded our in-store mode. And we also rolled out inventory quantity visibility at the store level across all our digital properties. For the sixth consecutive quarter, we continued to see our consumable, usable and edible products outperform our overall comp sales results. And this is the third consecutive quarter for C.U.E. to run at about 3x the rate of our overall comp sales performance. This strong performance was driven by dry dog food and feed for poultry, equine and wild birds. C.U.E. continues to be one of our structural advantages. And these products represent the strength of our core business and what drives trips and footsteps into our stores. Our outperformance in year-round categories offset the declines in our late spring-summer seasonal product and big ticket categories. We continue to gain share across all our categories, both in-store and online. Our Neighbor's Club membership this quarter exceeded 27 million members, and it represented nearly 75% of our sales for the quarter. Neighbor's Club continued to successfully help migrate customers up in their spending with us. And during the quarter, we reached an all-time high in high-value customers. In August, we rebranded Petsense to Petsense by Tractor Supply. In August, we also rolled out the Neighbor's Club program to Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. This expansion will deepen relationships with our existing customers and helped attract new pet customers to both banners. And while it's early, we are very pleased with our customers' response to these initiatives, with our Neighbor's Club membership already representing over 35% of sales at Petsense. For the third consecutive quarter, our overall customer satisfaction scores hit a new all-time high as we continue to invest in our team to provide best-in-class customer service. We ended the quarter with our inventory in great shape. As we said many times, if anything, we'd like to have more inventory. And we're now working hard to grow inventory in targeted categories to improve our in-stock position and serve as that dependable supplier for our customers. We continue to stay true to our EDLP routes, and our promotional activity in the third quarter was below the prior year's third quarter. We've made significant progress in our Life Out Here strategy. We now have over 500 stores that are in our Project Fusion layout and our Garden Center transformation is now active in over 260 locations. We continue to be pleased with the strategic benefits and financial returns of these store level investments. Given our performance through the third quarter, our acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we are raising our sales and earning guidance for 2022. Kurt will share more details on our improved outlook later in the call. Stepping back, Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. Our resilient need-based business model has a proven history of growing through vary economic conditions. Our customers and team members are dedicated to the Out Here lifestyle, and they prioritize it as it is their authentic lifestyle. Our customers over-index as homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. We believe that the structural macro trends that have been benefiting us are long term and sustainable. And as the market leader, we have substantial advantages and continue to gain share. The investment in our Life Out Here strategy is reaching critical mass and furthering our competitive advantage. Simply said, Tractor Supply has never been stronger. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt. Thanks, Kurt. Tractor Supply is a business with momentum. As our customers prepare for cooler temperatures and the calendar shift to the fall and winter season, our stores are ready for the change. From key categories like heating and insulated apparel, our merchants have brought newness with compelling value. In our C.U.E. categories, we have the right selection and are in stock as we continue to support our customers' lifestyles. This year, we expanded our Halloween and Harvest Decor program with a great lineup to capitalize on our customers' love of decorating their homes with seasonal indoor and outdoor decor. With more than 260 Garden Centers, we're showcasing the fall harvest season with everything from pumpkins to mums, and will be ready for the transition to the Christmas holiday season with an expanded offering of outdoor decorations. Despite the economic outlook, we are optimistic about holiday-related sales. From the calendar perspective, it's a good setup with 30 days this year between Thanksgiving and Christmas, with Christmas falling on a Sunday. We have a strong day after Thanksgiving game plan and compelling offers planned throughout the season. Given the increasing financial constraints facing American consumers, we're excited in the coming weeks to introduce the Tractor Supply Visa Credit Card. This new co-brand credit card will help our consumers earn more on their everyday purchases, both in-store and anywhere Visa is accepted. With the Tractor Supply Visa Card, customers receive access to all the perks from the private label TSC personal credit card that they have such as 5% rewards on Tractor Supply purchases or special financing on purchases at $199 and up, but they also will receive 3% in rewards on gas station, grocery and vet purchases and 1% in rewards on all other purchases. And all consumer card members with Tractor Supply received Neighbor's Club Preferred Plus benefits. This is exciting progress on our journey to driving sales, building loyalty and adding more value to our Neighbor's Club membership and reducing tender expense through our credit offerings. 2022 is shaping up to be another great year for Tractor Supply. With one quarter to go, we are on track to achieve several monumental milestones in the growth of our company, including annual revenues in excess of $14 billion, a store base of over 2,100 Tractor Supply locations and a highly engaged workforce of 50,000-plus team members. That said, we are not resting on our laurels. We have robust plans in place for 2023 to continue on our life out here strategic journey. As we enter the new year, the transformation of our business has significant momentum. Investments such as Neighbor's Club, our FAST program and our mobile app are at scale on providing dividends. Our store investments are reaching scale, and we have compelling new growth vectors such as the integration of Orscheln and many other opportunities on the list. With a healthy total addressable market of $180 billion, Tractor Supply is well positioned to continue to gain market share while fulfilling our purpose as a company. As we enter one of the busiest peers in retail, my thanks and sincere appreciation go out to each of our 50,000-plus Tractor Supply team members for their dedication to our mission and values. And with that, operator, we'd now like to open the line for questions. Liz, thanks for joining the call. I think we're doing an excellent job on navigating inventory and managing it. We don't feel like we're leaving any sales on the table because of it. But I think we are, at times, incurring some higher cost to run the inventory through our supply chain than we might otherwise. And also just on the labor side, having to work the back room a little bit more frequently than normal. The team has done an excellent job on it. But if you look at kind of weeks of supply and kind of pallet low quantities, we would be looking to continue to add inventory in our core C.U.E. businesses.  As we talked about, this is the third consecutive quarter where our C.U.E. business has performed at 3x the chain average, dry dog food running well above 20% comps and other feed categories running very strong as well. And so it's just all about keeping up with the customer and then building our supply chain for the future to make sure that we can continue to move these billions and billions of pounds of food and feed that we do every year and maintain as lower cost as possible. We're very excited about our Navarre, Ohio, D.C. opening up early next year that will give us a little more streamlined supply chain and capacity to continue to serve our customers in Life Out Here. Yes. Thanks for joining the call today. Good to talk with you. We feel very confident in our ability to deliver 2023 and continue to deliver on our long-term targets. If you look at the consistency of our business this year with a 5.1, 5.5 ,5.7 comp, a strong outlook for Q4, very consistent in an economy this year that you would argue really is stagflation kind of flattish, real growth, high single-digit inflation.  And as we look towards next year, our expectation, it will be much of the same. What I would say -- and consequently, our business will continue to be very resilient and stable. And the other thing I would add is, as we talked about in our prepared remarks, I mean many of our investments are just now starting to reach significant scale, and we expect that they will pay substantive dividends next year. We're now at over 500 stores and our Fusion layout seeing very strong results there. Many of those will be comping for the first time next year. Same thing on Garden Centers, 260, many of those came online just at the beginning of this year. We expect they will, just like we saw in the first year class, they will have a new store kind of maturity curve like sales growth. And so we expect really strong results out of those Garden Centers as we head into next year. We've gotten much better at rolling out our remodel programs, and we've got a number of Garden Centers queued up for implementation and execution before we get to spring of next year. So we feel like the economy is stable. We -- our outlook on the economy is not much different than what it is right now. We expect our business to continue to be very resilient and allow us to deliver our long-term targets. And as I said, our Life Out Here strategic initiatives are really reaching scale now and the benefits that we've talked about are starting to kind of really add up across our store base. Yes. Scott, it's good to talk to you today, and thanks for joining the call. The vet clinics are a core part of our fusion kind of menu. And as we go in to execute a Fusion store, we look at the existing mobile clinic activity. And if it warrants -- given the frequency of business and the customer count, if it warrants a stand-alone vet clinic, we are putting those in. And they've been very successful and are just really another value-added feature to support our pet business. As we talked about, we are gaining substantial share in pet.  For the last handful of quarters, we've run 10 to 15 points above the market growth rate in pet. And even as you're hearing others talk about the pet business starting to moderate, we aren't seeing that at all in our business, and it's because we're gaining substantial share. That share gain starts with the core basics of great customer service, in-stock, the right price, strong private label brands, but then it's certainly augmented with our other offerings, whether it's pet wash, whether it's the vet clinics and our Rx solutions, which are available online. And the pet business is a strong source of growth for us, and we expect it will continue to be as we go forward. Yes. Thanks for the call and the question. We continue to be very pleased with our Neighbor's Club program. And more broadly, our customer relationship management that we've had over the last 3 years that the Neighbor's Club rollout that we did nearly 2 years ago now -- 1.5 years ago now has exceeded our expectations. We've had tens of millions of new customers shoppers over the last 3 years and the majority of those customers continue to shop at Tractor Supply. And a majority of those that have continued to shop at Tractor Supply have also joined our Neighbor's Club program and been a big driver of our membership growth. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we had the highest level of high-value customers this quarter that we've ever had. And a lot of those are new customers that have grown with us over the last 2 and 3 years. And as we gain new customers also in '21 and '22, they are following that kind of continued kind of above historical average performance, both in their kind of average purchase sizes in a year, their frequency of purchase with us and also the expanding number of categories that they're shopping with us also. I think this has been a big area of success for us and it's really what's been able to create that foundation for us to have held the 65% growth in sales we've had over the last 3 quarters. I mean last 3 years. And you think about a lot of other businesses that had similar new customer growth that have given back much of that growth. And that's not been the case with us. I mean we firmly believe that the secular trends that have benefited us had are structurally sound, that the share gains we've gained are structurally sound and a lot of it has to do with our very sophisticated CRM capabilities that are far and away kind of best-in-class overall in retail and certainly in our market. Yes. Good morning, Chris, and how are you? We had -- we exited -- as we mentioned, September was our strongest month of the quarter. Outperformed relative to the overall average, obviously, and had flat comp transactions. It has -- we have had that momentum continue and even a little bit more coming into the fourth quarter here. It's certainly been cooler weather for the first month of the quarter here. And that's driven nice heating sales and insulated outerwear sales and heating fuel sales.  As you know, some big businesses for us in the fourth quarter are propane and wood pellets. And just given the high energy costs that are out there, the cooler weather that's already begun, the angst that our consumers have around inflation, some of the concerns around how European energy prices might be back in the United States. We are very optimistic about how those categories will play out in the fourth quarter. And also optimistic around how the flat comp transactions in September will play out for the fourth quarter as well for us. And we feel like if you look back over the first 9 months of the year, there are numerous months where we had flat or positive comp transactions. And the ones where we didn't, you really can identify them through either stimulus in March and April of last year or whether it was the drought and heat-related activities or the delayed spring through Q1 and Q2. But if you look at January, February, et cetera and then you look at how we exited in Q3 and a couple of slices of month in Q2 where we had flat deposit and comp transactions, we feel very good that those sorts of trends will extrapolate into Q4. As it relates to inflation, we do anticipate that there will be some moderation towards the back half of next year. But if you look at our 2-year stacks on inflation and carry that into the first half of next year, we do anticipate that inflation will remain at elevated rates through at least the first half of next year. And I think that's reasonably consistent with the overall kind of macro U.S. outlook as well. But we do feel really good about our comp transactions now as we head into the fourth quarter and the momentum that we have going into the fourth quarter. Scott, and thanks for joining the call, and thanks for the question. We continue to be very pleased with our store remodel program. And on the sales side, they continue to perform at the level of results that we articulated at the beginning of this year. So that's for a combo store that has both Fusion and side lot inclusive of a garden center. They're performing in the high single-digit lifts year-over-year kind of pre post net of control. . And when you look at a store where we've only done Fusion, they're performing in that mid-single-digit lift. And as we all know, it hasn't been in retail for decades now. When you first start a store remodel program, because you're handholding it, you're going to get a nice lift. But then as you start to scale. A lot of times, those lifts will start to diminish and moderate a bit, that has not been the case with us. we're now at 500 Fusion stores and over 260 garden centers, and we continue to see that same type of lift even as we reach scale, real tribute to our team on the execution, operations and then ensuring that we've got the right programs as we roll those out. Other learnings, our customers are taking note of these remodels. We're seeing on our customer satisfaction surveys, we're seeing overall increases after the remodel. We're seeing kind of questions like the condition of the store, the appearance of the store, many of our customers qualitative will ask if we've updated the store and they notice it. And the same thing on the garden centers. We're seeing many new customers shop our business once we roll out a garden center, much higher female penetration, much higher millennial penetration. And we're seeing it be a driver of footsteps into our store to kind of starting the next kind of version of C.U.E. category in our business and that being live goods. I think the big learning force has been on cost. We continue to challenge ourselves on our rollout timing and our costs. We continue to reduce the length of time required to roll one of these out that minimizes the disruption cannibalization, and we're also continuing to bring down the cost through optimization of our fixtures, optimization of our construction plans and particularly on the garden center, our designs there. So if anything, we feel like the performance is better than it was 9 months ago, kind of equivalent, if not better, sales lift and customer reaction. And we continue to find ways to bring costs down on the program. So we're very pleased with the remodels and excited to continue to roll it out to the next set of stores next year and continue to bring into our whole store base. Kate, good morning. Thanks for joining the call. And thanks for your question on Orscheln. To start out, just reiterating my prepared remarks that we're thrilled to have Orscheln join Tractor Supply. While the transaction took longer than we anticipated, the outcome was very much in line with our original expectations on the remedy that would be necessary. We are already well underway to welcoming them into the company and starting to map out our plans for converting those stores to the Tractor Supply brand. We will be basically executing the Fusion and Garden Center remodel programs in those stores. And obviously, there'll be a little extra involved with them in terms of new signage for our nameplates and some updating of fixtures and painting of the walls and such like that. But we will -- our plan is to have all that accomplished by the end of next year. At the same time, we're excited to learn from Orscheln on a number of categories where they play differently than we do in terms of distortions. And on the same side, we think there's a lot of opportunity for us to take some of our best practices to them -- to their stores; one, in terms of -- and then driving dollars per square foot up closer to where we are because they're at about kind of 50-ish percent of where we are in dollars per square foot and because they are lesser dollars per square foot, the op margin percent on a per store basis is lower as well. So we're optimistic that we can raise that over time as well. And so there's some sales synergies over time, there'll be some op margin synergies over time. And then additionally, we'll be bringing our brand awareness to that business well over 80% unaided and aided together and things like our Neighbor's Club program, our digital capabilities. So we're really excited to have them join us. It gives us a great additional footprint in the Midwest. We're excited about transitioning those stores to the Tractor Supply brand and then bringing kind of the whole of Tractor Supply to those stores and ultimately and most importantly, to our customers there in that area of the country. Yes, thanks for the question. We don't foresee a scenario of deflation in any near-term time horizon. '23 or into '24. If you look at where our retailers are now and just flow those through into the first half of the year, we're going to be at mid- to high single-digit inflation. And then fully expect that, that will moderate into the back half, both as we start to navigate reducing COGS increases but also, hopefully, as the economy PPI and CPI and other kind of inflationary indexes start to moderate as well. But I don't foresee at all a scenario of deflation in the near -- in any time horizon over the next few years. What I would say on some of those commodity-based products, we're well past just kind of core supply demand out there and the market is moving like they had 4, 5, 6 years ago in a normal environment. We're now in a market where even they've got higher input cost, whether it's fertilizer, and et cetera, that just has not come down. And even if it comes down, it's only coming down in a moderate way. They've got higher labor cost 10, 15, 20 points above a couple of years ago, and there's significant capacity constraints. I mean if you look at pet food, there are significant capacity constraints in the pet food market right now. So that's going to limit cost. That's going to limit any cost decreases that come. It's just the dynamics of the way the supply demand is shaping up right now. And then when you factor in non-U.S. markets and all the risk there, whether it's down in South America or certainly in middle -- in Eastern Europe with Ukraine and Russia and the difficulties in the war there, I just don't foresee a market at all where commodities are moderating to the point where they're driving substantive deflation in our business. That's just -- I don't see that in the cards at all. Yes. Brian, and thanks for the question, and thanks for the remarks on our quarter. We're very optimistic around Q3 -- I mean around 2023. As I mentioned earlier, on the revenue side, many of our initiatives are just starting to really reach kind of scale that you can kind of \u201csee from space.\u201d You think about 500 Fusion stores now, 260 Garden Centers, the continued strong lift we're seeing with those as we round into next year, we anticipate that those will continue to help fuel our business, and if there is any sort of further degradation of the economy that they can help fill in some of those cracks. I also anticipate that our core competitors, if the economy weakens further, will face increasing financial difficulties, and that will only be further opportunity for us to go gain share. So we feel very good on the top side around 2023 in our ability to gain share and grow and do that within the context of our long-term guidance. And then on the cost side, while there's a bunch that goes in and goes out, while we performed well in the last 2 years and half off to the team for managing our operating margins, there's been a lot of inefficiencies in our cost base the last couple of years, higher container cost, higher freight costs, having to open up pop-up distribution centers freight arriving -- and not on the day and time that we anticipated in the back of the stores or having inefficient labor in our stores to do tasking. As we move into 2023, we fully anticipate that our business will be the most streamlined from a supply chain perspective, all the way from the manufacturer into the stores and on our shelves that it's been in 3 years. And so we're optimistic on that from a cost perspective, being able to help drive our overall profitability and our margins. And again, just very confident as we turn into 2023 near 1 quarter to go, but a lot of momentum as we enter Q4 here now, and we expect that, that will be the case as we transition into 2023."

            "name": "Seth Estep",
            "content": "Hey, Oliver. This is Seth. Thanks for joining the call. When we look at trends in the category today, we're not seeing any meaningful trade down at this time. In fact, if you look at our kind of portfolio strategy, we've got a very balanced portfolio across kind of opening price point all the way up to our premium segments within our category strategies. And we continue to see strength across all 3 categories.  One of the things that's very encouraging though as well is north of our 20% store-owned exclusive brands that we have. We're really starting to see our customer base really dive into our exclusive brands. And our exclusive brand penetration in Q3 was up 130 basis points over the prior year as they're really navigating to our premium value-oriented segments or our exclusive brand and really driving loyalty. And that's something you'll see us continue to lean in on the balance of this year. But even more importantly, as we look into 2023 is how we continue to go after that loyalty factor relative to our portfolio of strategy and driving both innovation across all 3 product tiers and then really leaning into exclusive brands. On promotional cadence and activity, you'll see us very similar to last year. I mean we've got over 27 million members in our Neighbor's Club today. We're really leaning into that capability. We're really hitting our stride, diving into that data set, being very smart with our promotional activity, but also make sure that we're pulsing the market relative to Black Friday and some other things with just some great offers that we partner with some of our key suppliers on. So you see some messaging there as well, but our promotional activity should be consistent with what you've seen recently over the course of the last couple of years as we've really been focused on our EDLP approach and making sure we're gaining market share in our essential businesses."

            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Our business continues to be incredibly resilient. This is a business that was built for all economic environments with stability in both revenue and earnings over multiple decades. Comparable store sales have been remarkably consistent across all 3 quarters year-to-date. All regions of the country once again delivered positive sales comps. The geographic diversification of our store base worked to our advantage this quarter. The South Atlantic and Mid-Atlantic were our best-performing regions. As expected, we did experience softer performance in select regions of the country impacted by the severe heat and drought in particular, in the Far West and Texahoma regions, which, while positive, lagged the chain average. For background, July was the second hottest in 30-plus years. And during August, about 40% of the U.S. was under extreme drought conditions. As Hal shared, we believe that the less than ideal weather weighed on our transactions as well as our big ticket sales. Much like the second quarter, retail price inflation contributed about 12 points to our comparable store sales as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. The comparable average ticket growth of 7% benefited from inflation, partially offset by declines in big ticket sales and average units per transaction. Big ticket sales performance, while positive on a 2-year stack was impacted by the severe drought and cycling 2 hurricanes in the prior year. We saw the largest impact in categories such as generators, 0 turns and trailers. Moving on to gross margin. For the third quarter, our gross margin declined by 32 basis points to 35.6% of sales. Our price management actions and our other margin-driving initiatives were able to offset the pressures from cost inflation and higher transportation costs. With the continued robust growth in our C.U.E. categories, we saw pressure on our gross margin as C.U.E. runs below chain average on gross margin rate. In regard to inflation, while moderating, we continue to see increasing costs in the commodity inputs in our product categories, as well as underlying variables like higher labor wages and transportation costs impacting both us and our vendor partners. We have remained agile and nimble to manage all the complexity of today's environment, effectively managing cost increases at the SKU level through our price management actions and other margin driving initiatives. The team has also been working to capture efficiencies in the supply chain to reduce miles continuing to limit promotions and leaning into the more efficient value provided through Neighbor's Club. SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 9% to the prior year's third quarter. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 16 basis points year-over-year to 26.3%. This increase was in line with our expectations, primarily attributable to our strategic growth initiatives, including depreciation and amortization; and hourly wage and benefit investments in both our stores and our distribution centers. These items were partially offset by a moderation of COVID-19 response costs, more normalized incentive compensation and leverage in our occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. Diluted EPS was $2.10, an increase of 7.7% from the third quarter of last year. Our balance sheet remains incredibly strong. At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories were $2.7 billion, representing a 19.2% increase year-over-year in average inventory per store. The increase reflects growth to support the robust sales trends along with the impact of inflation. Looking at our inventory growth on a 3-year stack, it represents a 30% increase in average inventory per store compared to Q3 2019, meaningfully below our sales increase over the same period of time. There continue to be select product categories where we are still pursuing inventory, especially in C.U.E. Stepping back, we believe our inventory position is in good shape. Our strong balance sheet and the consistency of our free cash flow continue to be a position of strength for Tractor Supply, allowing us to invest in the business for growth and return cash to shareholders. To further our financial flexibility, we just entered into a new 5-year credit agreement on September 30 that increases our senior credit facility from $700 million to $1.2 billion. We also added 2 new banks to our banking group, including a minority-owned bank. Moving now to our updated guidance for fiscal 2022. Our updated guidance reflects the strong results for the first 3 quarters of the year and the positive momentum we see in our business continuing into the fourth quarter. In addition, we are incorporating the impact of our recent acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home. We are forecasting fiscal 2022 net sales of $14.06 billion to $14.12 billion including about $75 million in sales from Orscheln. This is the first time in the history of our company that annual sales are forecast to be above $14 billion. Comparable store sales growth is anticipated to be in the range of 5.4% to 5.8%. For the year, we now forecast an operating margin of 10.1% to 10.5% in line with our prior guidance, but with modest pressure from the acquisition as the sales and earnings benefit from Orscheln Farm and Home are offset by incremental transaction expenses and early integration costs. We anticipate the impact of Orscheln to be relatively neutral to operating income, while we expect a modestly negative impact on net income due to the interest expense associated with funding the acquisition. Diluted EPS is now forecast in a range of $9.55 to $9.63. This compares to our previous earnings range of $9.48 to $9.60 per diluted share. We entered October with momentum. With this updated guidance, we are forecasting comparable store sales growth for the fourth quarter of 5% to 7%. We now expect to open approximately 60 to 70 new Tractor Supply stores, which is modestly below our outlook as we entered the year. We continue to be on track for 10 Petsense store openings in 2022. Given the conditions of the real estate and construction industries, the cadence of store openings for Tractor Supply has shifted a number of the openings into the fourth quarter. I give the cross-functional teams a lot of credit for completing over 250 projects this year as they lay the foundation for 2023 and beyond. Our new store pipeline continues to be solid and we expect to improve the cadence of openings in 2023 with more balance throughout the year. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2022, we remain on track for anticipated share repurchases in a range of $750 million to $800 million. As is customary, we will provide our full guidance for 2023 at our fourth quarter earnings call. We are early in our planning cycle for the next year. I thought it'd be helpful to set the stage and share some preliminary insights and color into our thought process, given that there are a few moving parts between 2022 and 2023. Our business model has stood the test of time and has proven to be resilient. We have significant confidence with 2023 on the horizon. We are well positioned for any consumer and economic environment. Further, we have consistent structural trends that will continue to benefit us. We continue to invest in our Life Out Here value strategy to capture this growth. Now the discrete items that impact our earnings in 2023 are the lapping of the 53rd week benefit this year, and the accretion from Orscheln acquisition. As I've shared previously, we forecast that the 53rd week will add approximately 1.5% growth in net sales and about $0.15 to the EPS this year. As you saw our press release earlier this month, we expect the Orscheln acquisition to be accretive to diluted earnings per share by at least $0.10. When adjusting for the 2022 benefit from the 53rd week and the accretion from the Orscheln acquisition, we plan for 2023's performance to be consistent with our long-term EPS guidance of 8% to 11% with our bias at this point in planning towards the midpoint of our range. Despite what might play out with the economy, this needs-based demand-driven characteristics of our product offering support our ability to deliver on our long-term outlook. We are making great progress towards our long-term financial goals, and we look forward to sharing with you our 2023 plans in more detail at our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Now to wrap up, we are continuing to separate Tractor Supply from the competition. In prior cycles, we have made investments that strengthened the company. We believe the current environment is an opportunity for us to lean into our strengths and further expand our lead for years to come.  And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal. Simeon, this is Kurt. Good morning to you and everybody on the call. In regards to our investment cycle, 2022, 2023 has really been viewed as, to your point, a peak in that investment cycle. We will be opening up Navarre, Ohio, as Hal mentioned earlier. We will be building the Maumelle, Arkansas distribution center in 2023, and we'll continue our path on this cadence for the existing store remodels under the Fusion program.  So 2023 is really a bit of that peak. But it has been planned that way with the growth and depreciation that we've seen this year, roughly mid- to high 20%. We expect to see in 2023, about a similar year-over-year growth rate moderating net growth rate over time. So our SG&A is -- we've got great visibility to it. We feel confident to the point that Hal mentioned on cost. And the pressures from the investments, we also see the offsets to that in SG&A that we've got in regards to leveraging on these -- the comp sales. I am thrilled about the maturity and the development of the culture and the organization's view on profit improvement. We've got a lot of great things in the works right now, not only on the supply chain side and how we can continue to leverage the investments there to drive improvements in gross margin, but what we can do through procurement and how this organization is focused on driving efficiencies and productivities in the stores and in our distribution centers. So to wrap that up, yes, there continues to be pressure from investments in the business very much as we expected. But we've got also in the trend rate the expectations of the offsets to it, which is how we see SG&A generally playing flattish as a percentage of sales going forward. Chuck, this is Kurt. On transportation costs, as Hal indicated, we are seeing both domestic and to an extent, imports those costs beginning to moderate as the demand on the overall global supply is starting to ease. So we are taking advantage of that. To your question about the timing of it. Two factors. One, it's got to work its way through the pipeline. So we could start to see cost in early to mid-2023, reflecting newer improved transportation costs. And that's from 2 factors, not only selling through the cost of goods that have the peak cost in them currently today. We work off of and advantage off of longer-term contracts. And so what the team is doing and has been doing as the demand on supply -- on the supply chain and transportation eases our negotiations on those costs. So as we begin to see overall contract prices come down, those will start to go through the pipeline. And in transportation, in the long term, 2023 and beyond, we do see that as one of the areas of efficiency, one of the areas that does help us and as part of our algorithm in gross margin expansion over time as we come off some of these peak transportation costs. But do see about a 6- to 9-month process not only to get inventory through the supply chain, but to be able to be working off of new and lower contracted costs."

Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thank you, Mary Winn and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. The second quarter was another strong quarter for Tractor Supply as we delivered record results on both sales and earnings. I would like to begin by thanking the 48,000 plus Tractor Supply team members for once again delivering impressive performance through strong execution and for their dedication to serving life out here. Our business continues to be incredibly stable and resilient. This quarter, the team did an excellent job managing inflationary impacts operating through continued supply chain disruption and navigating the evolving consumer demand. We continue to win with our customers and took substantial share in the quarter. We entered the back half of the year with our inventory on plan and excellent visibility into our expense base. We remain very confident in our growth outlook and our Life Out Here strategy. Structural tailwinds continue to benefit us, including rural revitalization, home setting, self-reliance and pet ownership. Our brand, loyalty program, digital capabilities, supply chain and 2,000 plus stores create significant enduring advantages for us and our strategic initiatives are all on track and reaching scale. Now, let\u2019s turn to a review of the business for the second quarter of 2022. In many ways, the second quarter was a mirror image of Q1. The quarter started off slow as April was pressured from cycling stimulus and the delayed start of spring. May was our strongest month. June was solid and modestly above the quarter\u2019s comp in spite of record-breaking heat, which has continued into Q3 and will limit the sales upside in the current quarter. We grew net sales by 8.4%, with comparable store sales up 5.5%. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by strong ticket growth of 7.5%, offset by a decline in transactions of 2%. We experienced positive comp sales growth for each of the last 9 weeks of the quarter. Comp transactions were positive for the months of May and June combined. Diluted EPS was $3.53, an increase of 10.7%. Year-round categories were up high single-digits, indicative of our demand-driven, needs-based business model. The impressive results in our consumable, usable and edible categories continued this quarter as the business performed more than 3x our overall sales growth rate. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of C.U.E. outperforming our overall results. Our seasonal performance was below the company average, but positive. Big ticket was flat to last year and exceeded our expectations given that we were cycling strong performance last year driven by stimulus and ideal weather for the spring and summer season. We had strength in zero-term mowers, chicken coops, battery-operated outdoor power equipment and grills, with the biggest declines coming from frontage and mowers, log splitters and walk-behind mowers. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club reached a record 26 million members in the quarter. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club members are comping at a faster rate than our overall performance. We are seeing strong growth in industry-leading retention in our high-value customers. Our team members\u2019 commitment to providing legendary service continues to differentiate the shopping experience within our stores. As a proof point, our customers\u2019 overall satisfaction scores were at the highest level ever for a second quarter. We are successfully scaling our store real estate and remodel projects. To-date, we have over 400 stores in the Project Fusion format. We have over 230 stores with garden centers, more than 100 stores with store than the store Carhartts and over 600 stores with a pet wash. These are all improvements that make Tractor Supply a more contemporary, relevant, farm and ranch-oriented retailer. These improvements are allowing us to gain share with you and existing customers. Given our strong performance in the first half of the year, we are raising our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Although the operating environment maybe different than we anticipated as we entered the year, we are pleased with how we are navigating the various circumstances and remain very confident in the significant opportunities ahead of us. Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. Our needs-based business model has a track record of growing through varying economic conditions. Our customers and team members are passionate about the Out Here Lifestyle and they prioritize it. Our customers\u2019 over-indexes, homeowners, landowners, animal owners and pet owners, we believe that the structural macro trends that I mentioned earlier are long-term and sustainable. As the market leader, we have substantial advantages. Additionally, our investments in our Life Out Here strategy are reaching critical mass and furthering our competitive advantage. Tractor Supply has never been stronger. Before I turn the call over to Kurt, I want to welcome Kimberly Gardner as our new Chief Marketing Officer. Kimberly succeeds Christi Korzekwa, who announced her retirement earlier this year. Kimberly brings an extensive background in marketing with a data-driven approach to brand development that I believe will continue the evolution of our marketing organization and continue to build on the strength of the Tractor Supply brand. Our appreciation and thanks go to Christi for her leadership and dedication over the last decade at Tractor Supply. Now, I will turn the call over to Kurt to discuss some of the details of the second quarter and our financial outlook for the rest of the year.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Hal and hello to everyone on the call. At the halfway mark for the year, the Tractor Supply team has started fiscal 2022 with strong performance that came in ahead of our expectations. We are very pleased with the consistency and the strength of our top line performance. This quarter, retail price inflation contributed about 12 points to our comparable store sales as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. We continue to see increasing costs in the commodity inputs in our product categories as well as underlying variables like higher labor wages and transportation costs impacting our vendor partners. Comp transactions declined 2.0%, which was slightly below our expectations. As. we anticipated pressure from cycling the benefits of stimulus in the prior year. We experienced incremental headwinds from the delayed start to the spring and the drought conditions in the latter part of the quarter. Complementing the commentary Hal shared on the cadence of the quarter, all regions of the country delivered positive sales comps, the geographic diversification of our store base worked to our advantage this quarter. We did experience softer performance in select regions of the country impacted by the drought. In particular, the Far West and Texhoma regions, which, while positive, lagged the chain average. The South Central and South Atlantic were our best-performing regions. Turning to our digital performance. The second quarter represented our largest e-commerce quarter in net sales ever. On the back of 39 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, our e-commerce grew approximately 7%. Excluding April, we had solid performance with double-digit sales for May and June combined. Our mobile app continues to ramp with double-digit growth and represented about 15% of total digital sales in the quarter. Petsense continues to perform well with comp sales growth above the company average. Turning now to gross margin. For the second quarter, our gross margin declined by 24 basis points to 35.5% of sales. This was primarily attributable to three factors: significant product cost inflation, higher transportation costs, and to a lesser extent, product mix given the robust growth in C.U.E. products. We continue to experience broad-based inflation. Domestic and import freight costs have increased substantially year-over-year as well as fuel costs. As we shared last quarter, we expect many of these inflationary trends to continue into the second half of 2022. I continue to give the team a lot of credit for the remarkable job they are doing. Between tracking and forecasting freight and the coordination of retail price increases at the store level, they have been nimble. The team has effectively managed these cost increases at the SKU level through our price management actions and other margin driving initiatives. The team has also been working to capture efficiencies in the supply chain to reduce miles, continuing to limit promotions and leaning into the more efficient value provided through Neighbor\u2019s Club. SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales, was 22.1%, an improvement of 19 basis points. This improvement was primarily attributable to more normalized incentive compensation and the moderation of COVID-19 response costs as well as leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. These items were partially offset by investments in store wages and our strategic growth initiatives, which includes a step up in our depreciation and amortization. Compared to the second quarter of 2021, operating profit margin was essentially flat, contracting by only 4 basis points. Net income improved 7.1% to $397 million and diluted EPS increased 10.7% to $3.53. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. During the second quarter, we returned $291 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and higher cash dividends. This brings our total cash return to shareholders through the first 6 months of the year to $691 million. Turning to our balance sheet, merchandise inventories were $2.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing an increase of about 21% in average inventory per store. Consistent with the first quarter, this increase is primarily attributable to inflation. We believe the quality and the composition of our inventory is excellent and that we are in great shape as we go into the second half of the year. If anything, we are pursuing more inventory as there are categories we are working to improve our in-stock position. To provide more clarity on this, on a 3-year basis, our units per store inventory has increased single-digits, while sales are up over 60%. Moving now to our updated guidance for 2022, which is detailed in our press release we issued this morning. We are raising our financial outlook for the year given our strong performance year-to-date, as Hal mentioned earlier. This now includes net sales in the range of $13.95 billion to $14.05 billion, with comparable store sales growth of 5.2% to 5.8%. For the year, we now forecast an operating profit margin around 10.2%. This represents the midpoint of our previous guidance of 10.1% to 10.3% of sales. While higher costs have handicapped some upside, at the same time, we believe we are able to mitigate pressures on the downside. Diluted EPS is anticipated to be in the range of $9.48 to $9.60 compared to our prior guidance of $9.20 to $9.50. Please note that our fiscal 2022 guidance includes a benefit for the 53rd week, which is estimated to be approximately 1.5 percentage points of net sales and $0.15 of diluted EPS. As you model the second half of the year, let me address two items. First, for both the third and fourth quarters, we would anticipate that our comp sales growth would be consistent with our first half of the year. As Hal mentioned earlier, the extreme heat and drought conditions are continuing into the third quarter and we forecast these conditions will limit upside to sales. Second, I want to address the cadence of operating profit. We anticipate the earnings cadence between Q3 and Q4 to be more in line with historical trends. For operating profit margin in the second half of the year, we forecast flat to slight contraction. The performance in the fourth quarter is forecast to be positive year-over-year, with the third quarter experiencing some contraction. The variation between the quarters is predominantly a function of gross margin. Specifically, the third quarter will experience greater mix pressures from the strength we are seeing in C.U.E. and higher transportation costs. Both of these factors we first experienced in the fourth quarter of last year. Store compares naturally ease in the fourth quarter. For the second half of the year, we expect inflation to be consistent at an elevated level. With as much inflation pressure we are seeing in our business, we continue to closely watch comparable average ticket and transactions. In times of rising inflation, we anticipate that the breakdown of comp sales growth will trend to higher ticket performance from inflation offset by transactions. The impact on transactions is pronounced this year, especially as we lap the prior year\u2019s benefit from stimulus. As a reminder, the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. We continue to work collaboratively with the FTC towards a positive resolution and hope to have an update soon. Accordingly, we are limited in the comments we can make about the transaction at this time. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter and our outlook for 2022. The resiliency of our business has been proven over time. We have an amazing track record of navigating the challenges of the external environment. As evidenced by our ongoing market share gains, the team is executing at a very high level. Our financial outlook for the year is delivering on the key drivers of our long-term algorithm that we shared in January, accelerated sales growth, strong earnings and increased cash return to our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Kurt. Okay. So, now let\u2019s review some of the growth drivers for Tractor Supply to capture the significant opportunity we see ahead of us. As previously mentioned, with a total addressable market of $180 billion, our Life Out Here strategy positions us well to capture the market share. First, Project Fusion and Garden Center initiatives are two key growth drivers of our strategy and they are designed to drive space productivity and sweat our existing assets. We are on track to have Project Fusion implemented in nearly 30% of our stores by year end. Our multiyear plan to renovate existing stores allows us to improve the shopping experience for our customers with a revitalized layout and expanded offerings. The changes are resonating with our customers and our team members. As of today, we have over 230 garden centers that are up and running. We continue to forecast having garden center transformations of our side lots in over 15% of our stores by the year end. Over the spring and summer selling seasons, our stores with a garden center significantly outperformed the chain average and are on track with our business case. The expanded assortment of live goods is resonating not only with existing customers, but is a key asset to attracting new customers that skew female and younger. The garden centers have allowed us to gain share and will continue to play a significant role in our merchandising plans across the seasons. As the number one seller of bag feed and a top five retailer in pet food, it is critical that we are able to deliver for our customers as the dependable supplier in these C.U.E. categories. These are destination categories for us that drive trips. Our supply chain is a critical differentiator for us to deliver on C.U.E. as we work to ensure we not only have capacity for future growth that maintains the lowest cost to serve. To support our store growth and increased demand, our ninth distribution center located in Navarra, Ohio is on track to begin shipping in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, we are targeting the top 180 most challenged stores to implement a full suite of resources, which would include things like a feed room, mixing center allocations, high-volume store racking and much more. To-date, our process improvements have been executed across about 50% of our targeted stores. While still in the early stages, we are pleased with the improved operations at these stores. With the success of our Fusion and Garden Center projects, growth in our Neighbor\u2019s Club, the increased volume, velocity and variety of C.U.E. products moving through our supply chain in stores allows us to leverage our scale and sophistication to widen our position in farm and ranch. Mobile engagement is a moat that we are creating around our business. We are well on our way to converting our 26 million Neighbor\u2019s Club members into power users of our app. We are currently ahead of our year-to-date goals for our mobile app downloads. With new offers and features like the My Pet mobile app personalization, we are able to differentiate our digital shopping experience and capture growth opportunities. Whether online or in stores, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the change from summer to fall with our customers. Innovation and newness resonate with our customers and our merchant team as exciting plans to capitalize on our customer needs. Our customers count on us for brands that have the durability to get the job done and clothing is no exception. For instance, our lineup of apparel, workwear and accessories includes leading brands like Carhartt, Wrangler and Columbia as well as our exclusive brand, Ridgecut. Ridgecut has resonated with our customers and has allowed for our assortment expansion to include footwear and women\u2019s clothing. From insulated outerwear, hoodies, long-sleeved T-shirts, boots and more, our apparel products focus on the demand-driven workwear categories. In truck tool and hardware, our annual event ultimate workshop, will be in stores in the coming weeks and will be bigger than ever. More than 700 stores now have an improved tool coral. Our lineup of relevant brands like Porter Cable exclusively at Tractor Supply, the expansion of Makita and strong brands like Bosch and DeWalt makes our ultimate workshop sales event more relevant. The event offers great value on the brands our customers need to outfit their workshop or garage. We also have a new strategic partnership with Interstate Battery that we will roll out in the fourth quarter. Interstate Battery has a proven track record and is the largest battery distribution network in the United States that will allow us to better serve our stores. Branded as traveler by Interstate Battery, we will have a great lineup that is relevant all with improved in-stocks and reliability. In our seasonal business, we anticipate that this will be a strong heating season given the elevated energy costs. As the dependable supplier in this destination category, we are investing to ensure we have strong in-stock position. In heating, we have a new collection of innovative and exclusive home heating equipment with smart home technology providing maximum efficiency and a cost-effective way for our customers to heat their homes. For the fall harvest and Christmas holiday season, we will be leveraging an expanded assortment of our garden centers to drive productivity of the space. And importantly, across our C.U.E. categories, we are committed to being in stock and priced right for our customers. Our C.U.E. categories continue to drive trips to Tractor Supply. As an example, our pet customer counts are up high single digits with trips and baskets increasing for these customers. This is a trend we\u2019re seeing across other C.U.E. categories like livestock feed and poultry. We are well positioned to continue to gain market share with a great lineup of seasonally relevant products with legendary customer service. To wrap up, the Tractor Supply team continues to thrive through the dynamic macroeconomic environment while making significant progress laying the foundation for the future. Tractor Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over many different business cycles. Our business has been incredibly resilient and stable over the last several years, whether we look at that by week, region or product category. At the same time, we believe we have visibility into our cost and are managing our inventory to customer demand. We are winning with our customers with significant growth and market share opportunities, it remains an exciting time at Tractor Supply. My thanks and appreciation go out to the team for their dedication to living our mission and values every day. And now we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Elizabeth Suzuki from Bank of America. Elizabeth, your line is open.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great. Thank you so much. So first, just regarding transportation costs, do you think we\u2019re getting past peak cost pressure? And do you have any expectations that transportation costs could become a tailwind going into next year?\nHal Lawton: Hey, Liz, how are you? This is Hal. Thanks so much for the question and for joining the call. On transportation costs, break it down into a couple of different buckets. First off, spot rates for both import products, the container spot rates as well as spot rates for domestic are trending down and starting to reach kind of averages levels for last year and in some cases, below. That said, the flip side is the vast majority of our business for both domestic and imports are done on contracts. And the contracts that we are in this year are at higher rates than they were last year. So kind of when you kind of look at it all, it all kind of blends to about the same number. So as we get in towards the back half of the year, we do expect some of the pressure to moderate. But I don\u2019t anticipate a tailwind on transportation costs for 12 to 18 months.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great. And just one quick follow-up on imports, I mean your actual import percentage is pretty small as a percent of total product, but do you expect to see any \u2013 would you expect to see any impact gross margin if tariffs on goods from China roll off?\nKurt Barton: Liz, hi, this is Kurt. Yes, we have imports at around 12% of our business just for the full group as a reminder. And back when the China tariffs were put into place, I mean, we had some product having the tariffs in there. If there were to be reverse of those tariffs, that would be a benefit to us. We managed well when putting \u2013 managing through the increase in the tariffs. And then, of course, with imports, do keep in mind that, that product has a longer lead time. Those costs have to work through the system. So similar to almost the explanation that you heard from Hal on transportation, any shift in tariffs would take 6, 9, 12 months to really see playing through the inventory and cost of goods sold. And as any changes in a tariff environment changes. Certainly, we will update our guidance. And it is generally a benefit to us as we can get some relief from those tariffs that have had to be baked into the cost over the last few years.\nElizabeth Suzuki: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is with Steven Forbes from Guggenheim. Steven, your line is open.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning, Hal and Kurt. Maybe, Hal, I wanted to focus on how Tractor is addressing the internal cultural and what agent befit needs of its team members in the current inflationary environment. And if you can maybe highlight some of your learnings from the annual sales meeting as it pertains to what your team members are asking for and what they are sort of speaking as to their customer needs.\nHal Lawton: Good morning, Steve, how are you? And thanks for joining our call. I\u2019d start with the culture at Tractor Supply is foundational for us. Our mission and values are our number one priority. And we are constantly looking for ways to make deposits in our culture and continue to build on it. And as you mentioned, our annual sales meeting, which was just last week is one big way that we do that. As it relates to kind of the investments we made in the team, we\u2019re proud of the investments we\u2019ve made in our team, in particular over the last couple of years. And they range from wage investments to bonus enhancements and improvements and to broader rollouts of benefits and not just healthcare benefits, but additional items like tuition reimbursement, paternity leave, etcetera. And those have been substantial in their monetary both at an individual level and also material in terms of investment on the overall company level. And we are committed to paying a fair day\u2019s wage for a fair day\u2019s work. That said, we look forward \u2013 we do think that the majority of that investment is behind us. We feel good about where we are from a market perspective on a relative basis. We\u2019re seeing retention rates well below 2019 levels. We\u2019re seeing excellent engagement scores with our team members. And we feel really good about our culture and our morale and our team as we head into the back half of the year. We have a track record of consistency and resiliency in all different economic environments. And that\u2019s one of the things that I do anticipate that as the economy becomes a little tougher and we start to see the labor market ease and layoffs occurring that there will be a flight to quality. And I think that will be a really good thing for Tractor Supply and allow us to further improve our retention and attract high-quality talent just given the resiliency and stability of our business and our commitment to our team members and culture.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you. I will keep it to one.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Kate, your line is open.\nKate McShane: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Kurt, I think in your commentary you mentioned that you\u2019re trying to reduce promotion, which is counter to what we\u2019re hearing across retail. So I wanted to see if there were any more details around that. And just with regards to margin and preserving margin, has there been any effort to push some of the cost back on to vendors? Or has there been any effort to push for more sharing of costs as we\u2019ve seen with other retailers?\nSeth Estep: Hi, Kate, this is Seth. Thank you for the question. First question there on kind of what Kurt talked about in the prepared remarks on promotional activity, over the course of the last 2, 2.5 years, we\u2019ve put a concerted effort on really going to our true north as an EDLP retailer. And we\u2019re committed to driving \u2013 to stay towards the course of being an EDLP retailer. Fundamentally, we are not planning adding additional promotion to our strategy. And with that, it goes to the quality, I think, of our inventory position and also the ability now for us to leverage the 26 million-plus members in our Neighbor\u2019s Club database so that we can very strategically go after our shoppers and our customers to drive those sales, market share and obviously protect margin as well there. For your second question around cost push-backs, the short answer would be yes. We are definitely working with our vendor partners and conversations proactively planning across the supply chain, cost of goods as well as building on things like our exclusive brand programs that we know that we can drive incredible value, create loyalty, drive market share. And in many ways this also typically carry higher gross margins for us as well. So at the current time, I mean, we\u2019re staying to our true north in promotion as well as definitely looking to push back on costs that are flowing through the system at the same time.\nKate McShane: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is with Scot Ciccarelli from Truist. Scot, your line is open.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. So I think in the prepared comments, Hal, you talked about evolving demand and a different operating environment than what you expected at the beginning of the year. But it doesn\u2019t sound like the business has changed a whole lot. So can you provide any more color maybe on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of recent trends that kind of made you make that comment?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Good morning. And thanks, Scot, for the question and for joining the call. I\u2019d say at the highest level, our business just continues to be incredibly resilient, stable and consistent kind of week-to-week, day-to-day. And we\u2019ve got a portfolio of geographies. So at times when certain geographies are seeing unfavorable weather, we will see favorable weather elsewhere. We\u2019re seeing some balance of that as it averages across. I\u2019d also point to the strength of our C.U.E. business and the fact that it is the fifth consecutive quarter it\u2019s performed at these elevated levels. Categories like dog, dry food, we\u2019re taking significant share. That business is running mid-double-digit unit comps well into the mid-20% on sales dollar comp. We\u2019re also seeing similar strength in poultry feed and equine feed. And those businesses are demand-driven, need based. They drive the traffic into our stores. And so with that and then the rest of the business, we\u2019ve been really good at evolving with consumer demand in a pretty quick way, leaning into categories that are going well, like grilling, moderating in certain categories where like frontage and riders where we need to. And the team has just done an excellent job navigating that kind of evolving consumer demand having the right inventory at the right place at the right time. And as Seth mentioned, the quality of our inventory, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we\u2019re ending our inventory on plan at the end of the quarter. And we just we feel really good about inventory. And if anything, we\u2019d like to have more of it in some of our C.U.E. categories. But I think that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s just the strength of Tractor Supply in our business model is the demand-driven, need-based consistency of the business. If I go back in history, 30 years plus now of positive revenue growth, 30 years of consecutive of positive comp transactions, 29 of 30 of positive sales comp dollars. And it\u2019s just the consistency of the business and the strength of the team to be able to navigate these evolving consumer demand that gives us the confidence in our \u2013 in raising our outlook for the year and also the consistency of the first half performance.\nScot Ciccarelli: So just to clarify, Hal, like so you\u2019re not seeing incremental weakness somewhere where maybe you\u2019re being surprised and that wasn\u2019t the reference to evolving demand.\nHal Lawton: Yes. I\u2019d say as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the business has continued to evolve this year as consumer demand has evolved. Certainly, as we mentioned on big ticket, it was flattish for the second quarter. Now, that\u2019s on top of 40% comps from last year, so really still elevated sales levels compared to multiple years ago. But in there, we have some categories that were very strong, grilling and safe as examples. But then we had other categories that were below expectations, but those all netted to be right in line with what we thought. And so we\u2019re not seeing a precipitous drop off anywhere, just the continued evolution as you always have in the business and maybe a little bit more faster evolving just given the market dynamics that we\u2019ve all been operating in over the last 2 or 3 years, really. But nothing of concern or material weakness or anything like that.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Chuck, your line is open.\nChuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. Nice quarter. Kurt, I think you mentioned a 21% increase in inventory per store. Could you review what time period that covered? And does that indicate perhaps that you still have some shelf price adjustments to do to catch up with that? And how much of that inventory might be to make sure you have things in stock that are hard for your supply chain to get a hold of?\nKurt Barton: Good morning, Chuck, yes, thank you for the question. In regards to our inventory position, the additional comments I can give to you in addition to the prepared remarks, our inventory as of the end of the second quarter, there is a 21% growth year-over-year compared to second quarter of last year. I\u2019ll share just a few other color commentary on it. That is a very similar year-over-year growth that we had at Q1. Our average inventory per store is actually slightly down compared to the first quarter numbers, but very similar on a year-over-year basis. A majority of our inventory growth is inflation, and that inflation has been baked into it. There is some inflation we expect to continue in the business. I think the most important point is what you\u2019ve heard from Seth and Hal and I now is that the merchant team did an excellent job recognizing that some of the demand from last year that was stimulus driven, we were wise in regards to managing the supply chain and the purchasing. The inventory is in a healthy position. There is some more on the consumables side we are working to get more of to improve our in-stock position, but we feel very good about it. And as I mentioned, unit growth over the last 3 years is single digits, while our sales have been growing at 60%. And I think that\u2019s a really important point is that we\u2019re growing the inventory modestly, and our turns are in great shape.\nChuck Cerankosky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is with Peter Keith from Piper Sandler. Peter, your line is open.\nPeter Keith: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So great results. I was hoping you could just talk about the new customers you\u2019ve acquired over the last 2 years with COVID. It does seem like the rest of the channel feels like that customer has exited their stores. So if you feel like you\u2019re retaining them, maybe you could talk about some of the strategies you\u2019ve implemented. And secondarily, is there any risk on some of these poultry customers that have come in, we\u2019ve heard that a short-lived hobby and maybe those customers could roll off a little more quickly?\nHal Lawton: Hey, Peter, how are you today? Thanks so much for the question. I\u2019d start out by saying we estimate our market was roughly flat on a dollar basis for Q2. And therefore, we took substantial share in the quarter. And our new customers that we\u2019ve acquired over the last couple of years are certainly contributing to that share growth, in addition to just share of wallet gain that we\u2019ve had with our kind of core customer. And I\u2019d point to categories \u2013 a few different categories on that. First off, I\u2019d point to dry dog food and the numbers I gave earlier on unit growth and sales dollar growth. And those are well above the market run rate right now. Similarly, on poultry, now a very large business for us with continued growth. This is the third year now of substantial growth in poultry. And each year, we\u2019re seeing the customers that engage in the category last year reengage at very high retention rates. In fact, one of the highest retention rates that we have in our C.U.E. business. And then we\u2019re also seeing significant new customers entering the category. And that category, not only is it kind of an outdoor hobby and activity, but it also has a big element of kind of self-reliance. With rising inflation and cost, you can have a meat bird in 3 months, have an egg layer in 4 months. And we\u2019re seeing people invest in their flocks currently, not only just for the notion of kind of rural revitalization, but also really in the spirit of kind of self-reliance. I\u2019d also point to live goods. We\u2019ve made a significant investment in our garden centers over the last 2 years and exiting Q2 with 230 garden centers. And over 10% of our chain now has a garden center. Live goods, has been now grown into a material business for us. And it\u2019s attracted a more female customer as well as a younger customer into our business and really helped us \u2013 and given us kind of that next kind of demand-driven need-based transaction driver in our stores. So, we feel really good about our customer retention, how we have engaged with the customers over the last 2 years and we are holding on to them. And the last thing I would point to is our Neighbor\u2019s Club now, it\u2019s 26 million members, comprising well over 70% of our sales. Retention rate is still running well above 80%. And our largest tier and one of our fastest-growing tier is retention rate above 95%. So, I feel really good about the state of our customer and start and I will close with, as I mentioned at the beginning, we took substantial share in the quarter, which has been a consistent trend over the last 2 years, 2.5 years.\nPeter Keith: Very helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question is with Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Zach, your line is open.\nZach Fadem: Hey. Good morning. Hal and Kurt, we started to see some underlying commodity prices roll over a bit. So first, could you talk to your expectations around the inflation change today relative to your last quarter outlook? And then assuming we do see some gradual moderation here, can you help me think through how slowing commodity prices could help your business and in what ways could it negatively impact your business? Thanks.\nHal Lawton: Good morning. On inflation, I would start by just saying it continues to be persistent and consistent. Certainly, seeing some moderation, if you look at a few of the metrics, fuel costs, slightly down, spot rates on containers, down a bit, commodities moderating, but still, if you look at even on a year-over-year basis and certainly on a 2-year and 3-year basis, kind of record highs. And I think there is a lot of debate in the industry right now and whether or not some of the reduced prices around corn and wheat are going to hold, or whether it\u2019s just a temporary lull that will go back up as we start to look at the crop yields and demand towards the back half of the year. I think the thing we are both watching at a very high macro level is PPI. And PPI has got to come down first, just generically speaking, across retail before CPI is going to come down. And it\u2019s going to take \u2013 because retailers got to turn through their higher cost inventory for two months, three months, four months at a minimum before you start to see any reduction on the CPI retail side. So, I think inflation is going to hold and continue to be consistent really through the CPI kind of retail level, certainly through the balance of this year.\nZach Fadem: Thanks Hal. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question is with Jonathan Matuszewski from Jefferies. Jonathan, your line is open.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the topic of tariffs, Kurt, you mentioned it would be a P&L benefit under a rollback scenario. Just to be clear, would all of these costs flow through to gross margin, or would you look to pare back pricing on some SKUs that were impacted? I think some retailers have indicated they would look to reinvest in pricing to drive market share. It seems unlikely for other retailers. So, I just wanted to be clear on where Tractor Supply would be in terms of pricing changes under that scenario. Thanks so much.\nKurt Barton: Yes. Jonathan, this is Kurt. In regards to tariffs, I will address part of it first. I will let Seth talk about pricing and how we would address that. But let me frame up the size of it and the timing of it. So, for instance, just referencing back that imports are roughly 12% of our business. Not all of those imports are subjected to tariffs. So, you are talking single-digit percentage of our business. And when tariffs were enacted, it\u2019s over \u2013 it was over a 12-month, 18-month period of time that it flowed through. And we view it and you have to manage it very much like it\u2019s another form of inflation. And as it flows through our model, we then have to address how we are going to be able to manage our margins, whether it\u2019s retail price or any other levers that we pull through that. And because it\u2019s single-digit percentage of it, do keep in mind this \u2013 we never really called it out over those periods of time as a margin headwind. And we would manage it like other levels of inflation where we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a significant headwind. We managed it as a needs-based business fairly well, not necessarily a notable margin gain either, but we believe we will manage through that as any tariff adjustments occur. Seth, I will turn it over to you to talk about pricing strategy.\nSeth Estep: Yes. Hey. Thanks Kurt. Thanks Jonathan for the question. I would just say in terms of pricing relative to tariffs, as Kurt mentioned, I mean our direct import business is about 12%. But at the same time, we utilize more of a kind of a broad-based portfolio strategy when we come to our pricing strategies. Our team has incredible tools in place, great visibility into moving average cost, a lot of forecasting together. And I would just say that we use every lever of the pricing strategy just to manage and land our total business, whether that be relative to tariffs, whether that be to total cost, whether it be promo, whether it be clearance. The team really does strategize just to make sure that we are hitting the right price on the right categories. We are positioned to take market share and just utilizing the tools that we have in place and the visibility to land where we need to land. So, it\u2019s more of a broad portfolio strategy approach when we come to pricing and it\u2019s just one of the levers that we look at and utilize to make sure that we are hitting our targets that we need.\nJonathan Matuszewski: Got it. Thanks for the color Kurt and Seth.\nKurt Barton: Yes. Thanks Jonathan.\nOperator: Our next question is with Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Chuck, your line is open.\nChuck Grom: Hi guys. Thanks a lot. Kurt, I just wanted to clarify on the guide that it sounds like July is being impacted by the drought conditions, but you still expect comps in the back half of the year to be similar to the front half, which would be sort of in that low-5% range. So, I just want to clarify there. And then just bigger picture with the garden centers, curious what the biggest learnings have been so far, both positive and negative. And I guess on the negative, what have you changed since you started that endeavor 12 months to 18 months ago?\nHal Lawton: Hi good morning. This is Hal. Thanks Chuck for the question. First, I will just say on our comps, they have been very consistent in June and into July. And I think the heat and the drought is certainly impacting the business. But as I mentioned in my remarks, it\u2019s really taken more of the upside out of Q3 more so than it impacted to the downside. And that\u2019s why Kurt was kind of mentioning in his comments, kind of in our 5.2 to 5.8 guide set for the year that we expect in Q3 and Q4 to roughly run in the middle of that. And as we mentioned, that\u2019s kind of how we \u2013 what our total Q2 was as well. So, feel very good about that. And we are navigating the drought well. But \u2013 and again, it\u2019s kind of impacted the upside potentially really more in the quarter. Yes, and then on garden centers, 230 of them as we exited the quarter here. As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing a strong attraction of it for new customers and destination trips, more younger and female While we \u2013 and I think the thing that\u2019s different about our garden centers, while we certainly sell annuals and perennials, we are seeing real strength in what you would expect in kind of rural America, which is trees, shrubs, fruits and vegetables. And our garden centers are performing at the expectations we had, continuing to deliver strong comp lifts in the stores that we roll it out. And we have been very pleased with our vendor partnership as well, and there has been a lot of interest from our vendor partners in doing business with us as we expand into other markets.\nChuck Grom: Great. Thanks Hal.\nOperator: Our next question is with Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael, your line is open.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. There has a lot \u2013 been a lot of discussion on this call around the state of the consumer, a lot of inflation. How did you factor overall economic pressures into your guidance for the second half of the year, especially when you consider that the guidance implies 2 years \u2013 3-year stacks are going to remain relatively consistent over the next couple of quarters? And as part of that, when would you expect traffic to turn back positive? Thank you very much.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hi Michael and good morning. I would start with we look at the history of the business and just the consistency of our performance and the stability of our performance over 30-plus years in all the varying economic cycles that we have been through. The second thing is we then look at kind of the foundation of the business and our C.U.E. business and the demand-driven, need-based orientation that, and the strong stability we have there and the share gain. And then we obviously have our own internal forecast that we have around the overall economy, and we get a lot of deep insights into our own customer trends, whether it\u2019s from Neighbor\u2019s Club data and others. And we \u2013 our view on the economy is that it will remain roughly as it is for the balance of the year. And as a consequence, our performance will stay kind of in the same range that it\u2019s been operating in as we move forward for the balance of the year. We all saw Q1\u2019s GDP was negative. We will know in a few weeks\u2019 time on Q2\u2019s GDP. We certainly know consumer sentiment and business sentiment is negative. I think it\u2019s more likely than not that the Q2 GDP is roughly in line with what Q1 was. And \u2013 but our expectation is that the second half is about the same. And if we are in a recession, it\u2019s a mild, modest recession, and we expect our business will continue to perform in the same way. On comp transactions, we are certainly watching that closely and have aspirations of turning those back positive. Two big impacts to comp transactions this year-to-date have been stimulus and then also the drought and the heat. In weeks where those two are not as applicable, we do see \u2013 we have seen positive transactions. As we mentioned in my prepared remarks, the months of May and June in combination had positive comp transactions. And in markets that are less affected by the heat right now, we are seeing positive comp transactions. And we certainly anticipate as we get through those pressures the return of positive comp transactions.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is with Peter Benedict from Baird. Peter, your line is open.\nPeter Benedict: Good morning guys. So, thanks for taking the questions. Just, Kurt, I wanted \u2013 maybe if you can go back and expand upon the comments you made. You talked about some levers that you have that will allow you to kind of mitigate the downward pressure on EBIT margins right now and holding kind of that 10.2 for the year. Maybe expand upon those? And then how do you think about that same dynamic in the event that inflation does start to roll, and you are getting obviously 12 points of inflation right now if that reverts to par, how do those levers work? And how do you feel about the EBIT margin in that environment? Thank you.\nKurt Barton: Yes. Peter, good morning. As we indicated in our prepared remarks and just the consistency of this business, I will start there, Peter, with just the fact that we have got good visibility on our expense structure. We have had consistency in both top line and in gross margin. So, it\u2019s really important to just start there as a needs-based, really durable business. And then from there \u2013 the other point that I would mention is that the investments in the business, when you look at SG&A and the cost, the biggest pressure is the investments of the business and the natural SG&A levers at a good low-single digit number. And we are making these purposeful investments all part of our long-term algorithm to drive a strong operating margin and return. We can do that while we are investing in the business. So, to your question about how we manage that, we certainly have the ability if needed to, to be nimble and flex on the investments because that\u2019s the area that is the greatest pressure on SG&A. And then the business just has a solid core around DNA around profit improvement, lean thinking. I mean this is something that has been built in over 10-plus years and really matured in our organization. And what we are doing today in regards to driving miles down, more inventory per truckload when you have got transportation costs. And what we are doing to just drive efficiency. Those are the different levers that we are benefiting from today, and we will continue to use that for the next few years. If there is any reason to really have to adjust from our current thesis and algorithm. So, we feel very good about our ability to drive our long-term operating margins.\nPeter Benedict: Great. Thanks so much.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thank you. So, we will take one more question, Austin, and then we will wrap it up as we are at the top of the hour.\nOperator: Okay. Our final question is from Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital. Scott, your line is open.\nScott Mushkin: Hey guys. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I am just going to put them together because I know we are at the end of the call. So, just on the near-term transaction trends, I mean how much do you want to attribute that to inflation, people trying to stock up and the drought? Maybe units per transaction are up, and those are the factors driving down your transactions. And then my second question is more longer term. Our research would suggest that maybe the second year of the garden center is maybe coming in above what maybe you we are expecting just because it gets traction. People know it\u2019s there in the market. Those are two questions.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey Scott and thanks for the question. And on the first part, the comp transaction decline is almost fully attributable to the stimulus lapping and the heat and the drought and kind of the compressed spring. As I mentioned earlier, in weeks and in geographies where those extraneous factors are not at play, we see strong positive comp transactions. Collectively across the months of May and June, we see positive comp transactions. We break our customers in a variety of different cohorts and segments. We see our lower-income customer group having some modest falloff, but we have mentioned that over the last month or two months. And \u2013 but as a reminder, that\u2019s a very small piece of our customer segment. Our customers own homes, they own land, they own animals, they own pets. And to some degree, that insulates them. And that\u2019s the consumer segment \u2013 I think being our business, but also if you just are reading all the newspaper headlines and watching all the various shows out there, those consumers are holding up well, and they continue to hold up well for us, too. And I think we can see that in a moment, and we also see it in the track record of this business over the last 10 years, 20 years, 30 years. And so our customers don\u2019t very strong, still spending and still doing well. And when you pull out the extraneous factors, we still see strong positive comp transactions and feel very good about the health of the business. And the garden centers, we feel we are very positive on our garden centers in total. Really pleased in less than 2 years of having launched the strategy to have over 15% of our chain is garden centers now. And in the stores that have had it in place for now a second garden season, they are performing very strongly. We are very pleased with how quickly our garden centers are becoming a destination in the communities, very pleased with our vendors and being able to have the great product in there and replenishing it at the right rate. We have been very pleased with our store execution and hiring garden center specialists. So, you have got a strong customer service theme in the garden centers. And then it\u2019s bridging over into the balance of the store with the transactions in there because we estimate about half of the transactions happen to garden centers are actually destination transactions that then bleed into the store or even into the side lot now. And the side lots become a much more kind of shoppable destination with the drive-through pickup. So, I am very pleased with the performance of the garden centers and just our sideline transformation. And then obviously, in combination with Project Fusion, which we haven\u2019t talked about as much today, but now over 400 stores with Project Fusion, starting to reach critical mass over 20% of our stores now, seeing the lift in the comp sales there, but also the improved customer response to the elevation in the store experience, improvements in areas like apparel and pet food, obviously, in our power tools now we have got 100 \u2013 I think it\u2019s 800 stores now \u2013 700 stores now with an updated power tools area. So, our customers \u2013 when you look at the data, you can very much see the lift in the stores that we execute Fusion in our garden centers, and it\u2019s a big driver of our market share gain that we are seeing.\nScott Mushkin: Thanks Hal. Great color there. Appreciate it.\nHal Lawton: Thanks Scott.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thanks Scott. And Austin, this will conclude our call today. We are around for questions and Mary and I are available today, so please feel free to reach out to us. So thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we look forward to speaking to you on our third quarter call in October.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.

            "name": "Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. The second quarter was another strong quarter for Tractor Supply as we delivered record results on both sales and earnings. I would like to begin by thanking the 48,000 plus Tractor Supply team members for once again delivering impressive performance through strong execution and for their dedication to serving life out here. Our business continues to be incredibly stable and resilient. This quarter, the team did an excellent job managing inflationary impacts operating through continued supply chain disruption and navigating the evolving consumer demand. We continue to win with our customers and took substantial share in the quarter. We entered the back half of the year with our inventory on plan and excellent visibility into our expense base. We remain very confident in our growth outlook and our Life Out Here strategy. Structural tailwinds continue to benefit us, including rural revitalization, home setting, self-reliance and pet ownership. Our brand, loyalty program, digital capabilities, supply chain and 2,000 plus stores create significant enduring advantages for us and our strategic initiatives are all on track and reaching scale. Now, let's turn to a review of the business for the second quarter of 2022. In many ways, the second quarter was a mirror image of Q1. The quarter started off slow as April was pressured from cycling stimulus and the delayed start of spring. May was our strongest month. June was solid and modestly above the quarter's comp in spite of record-breaking heat, which has continued into Q3 and will limit the sales upside in the current quarter. We grew net sales by 8.4%, with comparable store sales up 5.5%. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by strong ticket growth of 7.5%, offset by a decline in transactions of 2%. We experienced positive comp sales growth for each of the last 9 weeks of the quarter. Comp transactions were positive for the months of May and June combined. Diluted EPS was $3.53, an increase of 10.7%. Year-round categories were up high single-digits, indicative of our demand-driven, needs-based business model. The impressive results in our consumable, usable and edible categories continued this quarter as the business performed more than 3x our overall sales growth rate. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of C.U.E. outperforming our overall results. Our seasonal performance was below the company average, but positive. Big ticket was flat to last year and exceeded our expectations given that we were cycling strong performance last year driven by stimulus and ideal weather for the spring and summer season. We had strength in zero-term mowers, chicken coops, battery-operated outdoor power equipment and grills, with the biggest declines coming from frontage and mowers, log splitters and walk-behind mowers. Our Neighbor's Club reached a record 26 million members in the quarter. Our Neighbor's Club members are comping at a faster rate than our overall performance. We are seeing strong growth in industry-leading retention in our high-value customers. Our team members' commitment to providing legendary service continues to differentiate the shopping experience within our stores. As a proof point, our customers' overall satisfaction scores were at the highest level ever for a second quarter. We are successfully scaling our store real estate and remodel projects. To-date, we have over 400 stores in the Project Fusion format. We have over 230 stores with garden centers, more than 100 stores with store than the store Carhartts and over 600 stores with a pet wash. These are all improvements that make Tractor Supply a more contemporary, relevant, farm and ranch-oriented retailer. These improvements are allowing us to gain share with you and existing customers. Given our strong performance in the first half of the year, we are raising our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. Although the operating environment maybe different than we anticipated as we entered the year, we are pleased with how we are navigating the various circumstances and remain very confident in the significant opportunities ahead of us. Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. Our needs-based business model has a track record of growing through varying economic conditions. Our customers and team members are passionate about the Out Here Lifestyle and they prioritize it. Our customers' over-indexes, homeowners, landowners, animal owners and pet owners, we believe that the structural macro trends that I mentioned earlier are long-term and sustainable. As the market leader, we have substantial advantages. Additionally, our investments in our Life Out Here strategy are reaching critical mass and furthering our competitive advantage. Tractor Supply has never been stronger. Before I turn the call over to Kurt, I want to welcome Kimberly Gardner as our new Chief Marketing Officer. Kimberly succeeds Christi Korzekwa, who announced her retirement earlier this year. Kimberly brings an extensive background in marketing with a data-driven approach to brand development that I believe will continue the evolution of our marketing organization and continue to build on the strength of the Tractor Supply brand. Our appreciation and thanks go to Christi for her leadership and dedication over the last decade at Tractor Supply. Now, I will turn the call over to Kurt to discuss some of the details of the second quarter and our financial outlook for the rest of the year. Thanks, Kurt. Okay. So, now let's review some of the growth drivers for Tractor Supply to capture the significant opportunity we see ahead of us. As previously mentioned, with a total addressable market of $180 billion, our Life Out Here strategy positions us well to capture the market share. First, Project Fusion and Garden Center initiatives are two key growth drivers of our strategy and they are designed to drive space productivity and sweat our existing assets. We are on track to have Project Fusion implemented in nearly 30% of our stores by year end. Our multiyear plan to renovate existing stores allows us to improve the shopping experience for our customers with a revitalized layout and expanded offerings. The changes are resonating with our customers and our team members. As of today, we have over 230 garden centers that are up and running. We continue to forecast having garden center transformations of our side lots in over 15% of our stores by the year end. Over the spring and summer selling seasons, our stores with a garden center significantly outperformed the chain average and are on track with our business case. The expanded assortment of live goods is resonating not only with existing customers, but is a key asset to attracting new customers that skew female and younger. The garden centers have allowed us to gain share and will continue to play a significant role in our merchandising plans across the seasons. As the number one seller of bag feed and a top five retailer in pet food, it is critical that we are able to deliver for our customers as the dependable supplier in these C.U.E. categories. These are destination categories for us that drive trips. Our supply chain is a critical differentiator for us to deliver on C.U.E. as we work to ensure we not only have capacity for future growth that maintains the lowest cost to serve. To support our store growth and increased demand, our ninth distribution center located in Navarra, Ohio is on track to begin shipping in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, we are targeting the top 180 most challenged stores to implement a full suite of resources, which would include things like a feed room, mixing center allocations, high-volume store racking and much more. To-date, our process improvements have been executed across about 50% of our targeted stores. While still in the early stages, we are pleased with the improved operations at these stores. With the success of our Fusion and Garden Center projects, growth in our Neighbor's Club, the increased volume, velocity and variety of C.U.E. products moving through our supply chain in stores allows us to leverage our scale and sophistication to widen our position in farm and ranch. Mobile engagement is a moat that we are creating around our business. We are well on our way to converting our 26 million Neighbor's Club members into power users of our app. We are currently ahead of our year-to-date goals for our mobile app downloads. With new offers and features like the My Pet mobile app personalization, we are able to differentiate our digital shopping experience and capture growth opportunities. Whether online or in stores, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the change from summer to fall with our customers. Innovation and newness resonate with our customers and our merchant team as exciting plans to capitalize on our customer needs. Our customers count on us for brands that have the durability to get the job done and clothing is no exception. For instance, our lineup of apparel, workwear and accessories includes leading brands like Carhartt, Wrangler and Columbia as well as our exclusive brand, Ridgecut. Ridgecut has resonated with our customers and has allowed for our assortment expansion to include footwear and women's clothing. From insulated outerwear, hoodies, long-sleeved T-shirts, boots and more, our apparel products focus on the demand-driven workwear categories. In truck tool and hardware, our annual event ultimate workshop, will be in stores in the coming weeks and will be bigger than ever. More than 700 stores now have an improved tool coral. Our lineup of relevant brands like Porter Cable exclusively at Tractor Supply, the expansion of Makita and strong brands like Bosch and DeWalt makes our ultimate workshop sales event more relevant. The event offers great value on the brands our customers need to outfit their workshop or garage. We also have a new strategic partnership with Interstate Battery that we will roll out in the fourth quarter. Interstate Battery has a proven track record and is the largest battery distribution network in the United States that will allow us to better serve our stores. Branded as traveler by Interstate Battery, we will have a great lineup that is relevant all with improved in-stocks and reliability. In our seasonal business, we anticipate that this will be a strong heating season given the elevated energy costs. As the dependable supplier in this destination category, we are investing to ensure we have strong in-stock position. In heating, we have a new collection of innovative and exclusive home heating equipment with smart home technology providing maximum efficiency and a cost-effective way for our customers to heat their homes. For the fall harvest and Christmas holiday season, we will be leveraging an expanded assortment of our garden centers to drive productivity of the space. And importantly, across our C.U.E. categories, we are committed to being in stock and priced right for our customers. Our C.U.E. categories continue to drive trips to Tractor Supply. As an example, our pet customer counts are up high single digits with trips and baskets increasing for these customers. This is a trend we're seeing across other C.U.E. categories like livestock feed and poultry. We are well positioned to continue to gain market share with a great lineup of seasonally relevant products with legendary customer service. To wrap up, the Tractor Supply team continues to thrive through the dynamic macroeconomic environment while making significant progress laying the foundation for the future. Tractor Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over many different business cycles. Our business has been incredibly resilient and stable over the last several years, whether we look at that by week, region or product category. At the same time, we believe we have visibility into our cost and are managing our inventory to customer demand. We are winning with our customers with significant growth and market share opportunities, it remains an exciting time at Tractor Supply. My thanks and appreciation go out to the team for their dedication to living our mission and values every day. And now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Hey, Liz, how are you? This is Hal. Thanks so much for the question and for joining the call. On transportation costs, break it down into a couple of different buckets. First off, spot rates for both import products, the container spot rates as well as spot rates for domestic are trending down and starting to reach kind of averages levels for last year and in some cases, below. That said, the flip side is the vast majority of our business for both domestic and imports are done on contracts. And the contracts that we are in this year are at higher rates than they were last year. So kind of when you kind of look at it all, it all kind of blends to about the same number. So as we get in towards the back half of the year, we do expect some of the pressure to moderate. But I don't anticipate a tailwind on transportation costs for 12 to 18 months. Good morning, Steve, how are you? And thanks for joining our call. I'd start with the culture at Tractor Supply is foundational for us. Our mission and values are our number one priority. And we are constantly looking for ways to make deposits in our culture and continue to build on it. And as you mentioned, our annual sales meeting, which was just last week is one big way that we do that. As it relates to kind of the investments we made in the team, we're proud of the investments we've made in our team, in particular over the last couple of years. And they range from wage investments to bonus enhancements and improvements and to broader rollouts of benefits and not just healthcare benefits, but additional items like tuition reimbursement, paternity leave, etcetera. And those have been substantial in their monetary both at an individual level and also material in terms of investment on the overall company level. And we are committed to paying a fair day's wage for a fair day's work. That said, we look forward \u2013 we do think that the majority of that investment is behind us. We feel good about where we are from a market perspective on a relative basis. We're seeing retention rates well below 2019 levels. We're seeing excellent engagement scores with our team members. And we feel really good about our culture and our morale and our team as we head into the back half of the year. We have a track record of consistency and resiliency in all different economic environments. And that's one of the things that I do anticipate that as the economy becomes a little tougher and we start to see the labor market ease and layoffs occurring that there will be a flight to quality. And I think that will be a really good thing for Tractor Supply and allow us to further improve our retention and attract high-quality talent just given the resiliency and stability of our business and our commitment to our team members and culture. Yes. Good morning. And thanks, Scot, for the question and for joining the call. I'd say at the highest level, our business just continues to be incredibly resilient, stable and consistent kind of week-to-week, day-to-day. And we've got a portfolio of geographies. So at times when certain geographies are seeing unfavorable weather, we will see favorable weather elsewhere. We're seeing some balance of that as it averages across. I'd also point to the strength of our C.U.E. business and the fact that it is the fifth consecutive quarter it's performed at these elevated levels. Categories like dog, dry food, we're taking significant share. That business is running mid-double-digit unit comps well into the mid-20% on sales dollar comp. We're also seeing similar strength in poultry feed and equine feed. And those businesses are demand-driven, need based. They drive the traffic into our stores. And so with that and then the rest of the business, we've been really good at evolving with consumer demand in a pretty quick way, leaning into categories that are going well, like grilling, moderating in certain categories where like frontage and riders where we need to. And the team has just done an excellent job navigating that kind of evolving consumer demand having the right inventory at the right place at the right time. And as Seth mentioned, the quality of our inventory, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're ending our inventory on plan at the end of the quarter. And we just we feel really good about inventory. And if anything, we'd like to have more of it in some of our C.U.E. categories. But I think that's the thing that's just the strength of Tractor Supply in our business model is the demand-driven, need-based consistency of the business. If I go back in history, 30 years plus now of positive revenue growth, 30 years of consecutive of positive comp transactions, 29 of 30 of positive sales comp dollars. And it's just the consistency of the business and the strength of the team to be able to navigate these evolving consumer demand that gives us the confidence in our \u2013 in raising our outlook for the year and also the consistency of the first half performance. Yes. I'd say as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the business has continued to evolve this year as consumer demand has evolved. Certainly, as we mentioned on big ticket, it was flattish for the second quarter. Now, that's on top of 40% comps from last year, so really still elevated sales levels compared to multiple years ago. But in there, we have some categories that were very strong, grilling and safe as examples. But then we had other categories that were below expectations, but those all netted to be right in line with what we thought. And so we're not seeing a precipitous drop off anywhere, just the continued evolution as you always have in the business and maybe a little bit more faster evolving just given the market dynamics that we've all been operating in over the last 2 or 3 years, really. But nothing of concern or material weakness or anything like that. Hey, Peter, how are you today? Thanks so much for the question. I'd start out by saying we estimate our market was roughly flat on a dollar basis for Q2. And therefore, we took substantial share in the quarter. And our new customers that we've acquired over the last couple of years are certainly contributing to that share growth, in addition to just share of wallet gain that we've had with our kind of core customer. And I'd point to categories \u2013 a few different categories on that. First off, I'd point to dry dog food and the numbers I gave earlier on unit growth and sales dollar growth. And those are well above the market run rate right now. Similarly, on poultry, now a very large business for us with continued growth. This is the third year now of substantial growth in poultry. And each year, we're seeing the customers that engage in the category last year reengage at very high retention rates. In fact, one of the highest retention rates that we have in our C.U.E. business. And then we're also seeing significant new customers entering the category. And that category, not only is it kind of an outdoor hobby and activity, but it also has a big element of kind of self-reliance. With rising inflation and cost, you can have a meat bird in 3 months, have an egg layer in 4 months. And we're seeing people invest in their flocks currently, not only just for the notion of kind of rural revitalization, but also really in the spirit of kind of self-reliance. I'd also point to live goods. We've made a significant investment in our garden centers over the last 2 years and exiting Q2 with 230 garden centers. And over 10% of our chain now has a garden center. Live goods, has been now grown into a material business for us. And it's attracted a more female customer as well as a younger customer into our business and really helped us \u2013 and given us kind of that next kind of demand-driven need-based transaction driver in our stores. So, we feel really good about our customer retention, how we have engaged with the customers over the last 2 years and we are holding on to them. And the last thing I would point to is our Neighbor's Club now, it's 26 million members, comprising well over 70% of our sales. Retention rate is still running well above 80%. And our largest tier and one of our fastest-growing tier is retention rate above 95%. So, I feel really good about the state of our customer and start and I will close with, as I mentioned at the beginning, we took substantial share in the quarter, which has been a consistent trend over the last 2 years, 2.5 years. Good morning. On inflation, I would start by just saying it continues to be persistent and consistent. Certainly, seeing some moderation, if you look at a few of the metrics, fuel costs, slightly down, spot rates on containers, down a bit, commodities moderating, but still, if you look at even on a year-over-year basis and certainly on a 2-year and 3-year basis, kind of record highs. And I think there is a lot of debate in the industry right now and whether or not some of the reduced prices around corn and wheat are going to hold, or whether it's just a temporary lull that will go back up as we start to look at the crop yields and demand towards the back half of the year. I think the thing we are both watching at a very high macro level is PPI. And PPI has got to come down first, just generically speaking, across retail before CPI is going to come down. And it's going to take \u2013 because retailers got to turn through their higher cost inventory for two months, three months, four months at a minimum before you start to see any reduction on the CPI retail side. So, I think inflation is going to hold and continue to be consistent really through the CPI kind of retail level, certainly through the balance of this year. Hi good morning. This is Hal. Thanks Chuck for the question. First, I will just say on our comps, they have been very consistent in June and into July. And I think the heat and the drought is certainly impacting the business. But as I mentioned in my remarks, it's really taken more of the upside out of Q3 more so than it impacted to the downside. And that's why Kurt was kind of mentioning in his comments, kind of in our 5.2 to 5.8 guide set for the year that we expect in Q3 and Q4 to roughly run in the middle of that. And as we mentioned, that's kind of how we \u2013 what our total Q2 was as well. So, feel very good about that. And we are navigating the drought well. But \u2013 and again, it's kind of impacted the upside potentially really more in the quarter. Yes, and then on garden centers, 230 of them as we exited the quarter here. As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing a strong attraction of it for new customers and destination trips, more younger and female While we \u2013 and I think the thing that's different about our garden centers, while we certainly sell annuals and perennials, we are seeing real strength in what you would expect in kind of rural America, which is trees, shrubs, fruits and vegetables. And our garden centers are performing at the expectations we had, continuing to deliver strong comp lifts in the stores that we roll it out. And we have been very pleased with our vendor partnership as well, and there has been a lot of interest from our vendor partners in doing business with us as we expand into other markets. Yes. Hi Michael and good morning. I would start with we look at the history of the business and just the consistency of our performance and the stability of our performance over 30-plus years in all the varying economic cycles that we have been through. The second thing is we then look at kind of the foundation of the business and our C.U.E. business and the demand-driven, need-based orientation that, and the strong stability we have there and the share gain. And then we obviously have our own internal forecast that we have around the overall economy, and we get a lot of deep insights into our own customer trends, whether it's from Neighbor's Club data and others. And we \u2013 our view on the economy is that it will remain roughly as it is for the balance of the year. And as a consequence, our performance will stay kind of in the same range that it's been operating in as we move forward for the balance of the year. We all saw Q1's GDP was negative. We will know in a few weeks' time on Q2's GDP. We certainly know consumer sentiment and business sentiment is negative. I think it's more likely than not that the Q2 GDP is roughly in line with what Q1 was. And \u2013 but our expectation is that the second half is about the same. And if we are in a recession, it's a mild, modest recession, and we expect our business will continue to perform in the same way. On comp transactions, we are certainly watching that closely and have aspirations of turning those back positive. Two big impacts to comp transactions this year-to-date have been stimulus and then also the drought and the heat. In weeks where those two are not as applicable, we do see \u2013 we have seen positive transactions. As we mentioned in my prepared remarks, the months of May and June in combination had positive comp transactions. And in markets that are less affected by the heat right now, we are seeing positive comp transactions. And we certainly anticipate as we get through those pressures the return of positive comp transactions. Yes. Hey Scott and thanks for the question. And on the first part, the comp transaction decline is almost fully attributable to the stimulus lapping and the heat and the drought and kind of the compressed spring. As I mentioned earlier, in weeks and in geographies where those extraneous factors are not at play, we see strong positive comp transactions. Collectively across the months of May and June, we see positive comp transactions. We break our customers in a variety of different cohorts and segments. We see our lower-income customer group having some modest falloff, but we have mentioned that over the last month or two months. And \u2013 but as a reminder, that's a very small piece of our customer segment. Our customers own homes, they own land, they own animals, they own pets. And to some degree, that insulates them. And that's the consumer segment \u2013 I think being our business, but also if you just are reading all the newspaper headlines and watching all the various shows out there, those consumers are holding up well, and they continue to hold up well for us, too. And I think we can see that in a moment, and we also see it in the track record of this business over the last 10 years, 20 years, 30 years. And so our customers don't very strong, still spending and still doing well. And when you pull out the extraneous factors, we still see strong positive comp transactions and feel very good about the health of the business. And the garden centers, we feel we are very positive on our garden centers in total. Really pleased in less than 2 years of having launched the strategy to have over 15% of our chain is garden centers now. And in the stores that have had it in place for now a second garden season, they are performing very strongly. We are very pleased with how quickly our garden centers are becoming a destination in the communities, very pleased with our vendors and being able to have the great product in there and replenishing it at the right rate. We have been very pleased with our store execution and hiring garden center specialists. So, you have got a strong customer service theme in the garden centers. And then it's bridging over into the balance of the store with the transactions in there because we estimate about half of the transactions happen to garden centers are actually destination transactions that then bleed into the store or even into the side lot now. And the side lots become a much more kind of shoppable destination with the drive-through pickup. So, I am very pleased with the performance of the garden centers and just our sideline transformation. And then obviously, in combination with Project Fusion, which we haven't talked about as much today, but now over 400 stores with Project Fusion, starting to reach critical mass over 20% of our stores now, seeing the lift in the comp sales there, but also the improved customer response to the elevation in the store experience, improvements in areas like apparel and pet food, obviously, in our power tools now we have got 100 \u2013 I think it's 800 stores now \u2013 700 stores now with an updated power tools area. So, our customers \u2013 when you look at the data, you can very much see the lift in the stores that we execute Fusion in our garden centers, and it's a big driver of our market share gain that we are seeing. Thanks Scott."

            "name": "Seth Estep",
            "content": "Hi, Kate, this is Seth. Thank you for the question. First question there on kind of what Kurt talked about in the prepared remarks on promotional activity, over the course of the last 2, 2.5 years, we've put a concerted effort on really going to our true north as an EDLP retailer. And we're committed to driving \u2013 to stay towards the course of being an EDLP retailer. Fundamentally, we are not planning adding additional promotion to our strategy. And with that, it goes to the quality, I think, of our inventory position and also the ability now for us to leverage the 26 million-plus members in our Neighbor's Club database so that we can very strategically go after our shoppers and our customers to drive those sales, market share and obviously protect margin as well there. For your second question around cost push-backs, the short answer would be yes. We are definitely working with our vendor partners and conversations proactively planning across the supply chain, cost of goods as well as building on things like our exclusive brand programs that we know that we can drive incredible value, create loyalty, drive market share. And in many ways this also typically carry higher gross margins for us as well. So at the current time, I mean, we're staying to our true north in promotion as well as definitely looking to push back on costs that are flowing through the system at the same time. Yes. Hey. Thanks Kurt. Thanks Jonathan for the question. I would just say in terms of pricing relative to tariffs, as Kurt mentioned, I mean our direct import business is about 12%. But at the same time, we utilize more of a kind of a broad-based portfolio strategy when we come to our pricing strategies. Our team has incredible tools in place, great visibility into moving average cost, a lot of forecasting together. And I would just say that we use every lever of the pricing strategy just to manage and land our total business, whether that be relative to tariffs, whether that be to total cost, whether it be promo, whether it be clearance. The team really does strategize just to make sure that we are hitting the right price on the right categories. We are positioned to take market share and just utilizing the tools that we have in place and the visibility to land where we need to land. So, it's more of a broad portfolio strategy approach when we come to pricing and it's just one of the levers that we look at and utilize to make sure that we are hitting our targets that we need."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal and hello to everyone on the call. At the halfway mark for the year, the Tractor Supply team has started fiscal 2022 with strong performance that came in ahead of our expectations. We are very pleased with the consistency and the strength of our top line performance. This quarter, retail price inflation contributed about 12 points to our comparable store sales as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. We continue to see increasing costs in the commodity inputs in our product categories as well as underlying variables like higher labor wages and transportation costs impacting our vendor partners. Comp transactions declined 2.0%, which was slightly below our expectations. As. we anticipated pressure from cycling the benefits of stimulus in the prior year. We experienced incremental headwinds from the delayed start to the spring and the drought conditions in the latter part of the quarter. Complementing the commentary Hal shared on the cadence of the quarter, all regions of the country delivered positive sales comps, the geographic diversification of our store base worked to our advantage this quarter. We did experience softer performance in select regions of the country impacted by the drought. In particular, the Far West and Texhoma regions, which, while positive, lagged the chain average. The South Central and South Atlantic were our best-performing regions. Turning to our digital performance. The second quarter represented our largest e-commerce quarter in net sales ever. On the back of 39 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, our e-commerce grew approximately 7%. Excluding April, we had solid performance with double-digit sales for May and June combined. Our mobile app continues to ramp with double-digit growth and represented about 15% of total digital sales in the quarter. Petsense continues to perform well with comp sales growth above the company average. Turning now to gross margin. For the second quarter, our gross margin declined by 24 basis points to 35.5% of sales. This was primarily attributable to three factors: significant product cost inflation, higher transportation costs, and to a lesser extent, product mix given the robust growth in C.U.E. products. We continue to experience broad-based inflation. Domestic and import freight costs have increased substantially year-over-year as well as fuel costs. As we shared last quarter, we expect many of these inflationary trends to continue into the second half of 2022. I continue to give the team a lot of credit for the remarkable job they are doing. Between tracking and forecasting freight and the coordination of retail price increases at the store level, they have been nimble. The team has effectively managed these cost increases at the SKU level through our price management actions and other margin driving initiatives. The team has also been working to capture efficiencies in the supply chain to reduce miles, continuing to limit promotions and leaning into the more efficient value provided through Neighbor's Club. SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales, was 22.1%, an improvement of 19 basis points. This improvement was primarily attributable to more normalized incentive compensation and the moderation of COVID-19 response costs as well as leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. These items were partially offset by investments in store wages and our strategic growth initiatives, which includes a step up in our depreciation and amortization. Compared to the second quarter of 2021, operating profit margin was essentially flat, contracting by only 4 basis points. Net income improved 7.1% to $397 million and diluted EPS increased 10.7% to $3.53. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. During the second quarter, we returned $291 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and higher cash dividends. This brings our total cash return to shareholders through the first 6 months of the year to $691 million. Turning to our balance sheet, merchandise inventories were $2.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing an increase of about 21% in average inventory per store. Consistent with the first quarter, this increase is primarily attributable to inflation. We believe the quality and the composition of our inventory is excellent and that we are in great shape as we go into the second half of the year. If anything, we are pursuing more inventory as there are categories we are working to improve our in-stock position. To provide more clarity on this, on a 3-year basis, our units per store inventory has increased single-digits, while sales are up over 60%. Moving now to our updated guidance for 2022, which is detailed in our press release we issued this morning. We are raising our financial outlook for the year given our strong performance year-to-date, as Hal mentioned earlier. This now includes net sales in the range of $13.95 billion to $14.05 billion, with comparable store sales growth of 5.2% to 5.8%. For the year, we now forecast an operating profit margin around 10.2%. This represents the midpoint of our previous guidance of 10.1% to 10.3% of sales. While higher costs have handicapped some upside, at the same time, we believe we are able to mitigate pressures on the downside. Diluted EPS is anticipated to be in the range of $9.48 to $9.60 compared to our prior guidance of $9.20 to $9.50. Please note that our fiscal 2022 guidance includes a benefit for the 53rd week, which is estimated to be approximately 1.5 percentage points of net sales and $0.15 of diluted EPS. As you model the second half of the year, let me address two items. First, for both the third and fourth quarters, we would anticipate that our comp sales growth would be consistent with our first half of the year. As Hal mentioned earlier, the extreme heat and drought conditions are continuing into the third quarter and we forecast these conditions will limit upside to sales. Second, I want to address the cadence of operating profit. We anticipate the earnings cadence between Q3 and Q4 to be more in line with historical trends. For operating profit margin in the second half of the year, we forecast flat to slight contraction. The performance in the fourth quarter is forecast to be positive year-over-year, with the third quarter experiencing some contraction. The variation between the quarters is predominantly a function of gross margin. Specifically, the third quarter will experience greater mix pressures from the strength we are seeing in C.U.E. and higher transportation costs. Both of these factors we first experienced in the fourth quarter of last year. Store compares naturally ease in the fourth quarter. For the second half of the year, we expect inflation to be consistent at an elevated level. With as much inflation pressure we are seeing in our business, we continue to closely watch comparable average ticket and transactions. In times of rising inflation, we anticipate that the breakdown of comp sales growth will trend to higher ticket performance from inflation offset by transactions. The impact on transactions is pronounced this year, especially as we lap the prior year's benefit from stimulus. As a reminder, the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. We continue to work collaboratively with the FTC towards a positive resolution and hope to have an update soon. Accordingly, we are limited in the comments we can make about the transaction at this time. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter and our outlook for 2022. The resiliency of our business has been proven over time. We have an amazing track record of navigating the challenges of the external environment. As evidenced by our ongoing market share gains, the team is executing at a very high level. Our financial outlook for the year is delivering on the key drivers of our long-term algorithm that we shared in January, accelerated sales growth, strong earnings and increased cash return to our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hal. Liz, hi, this is Kurt. Yes, we have imports at around 12% of our business just for the full group as a reminder. And back when the China tariffs were put into place, I mean, we had some product having the tariffs in there. If there were to be reverse of those tariffs, that would be a benefit to us. We managed well when putting \u2013 managing through the increase in the tariffs. And then, of course, with imports, do keep in mind that, that product has a longer lead time. Those costs have to work through the system. So similar to almost the explanation that you heard from Hal on transportation, any shift in tariffs would take 6, 9, 12 months to really see playing through the inventory and cost of goods sold. And as any changes in a tariff environment changes. Certainly, we will update our guidance. And it is generally a benefit to us as we can get some relief from those tariffs that have had to be baked into the cost over the last few years. Good morning, Chuck, yes, thank you for the question. In regards to our inventory position, the additional comments I can give to you in addition to the prepared remarks, our inventory as of the end of the second quarter, there is a 21% growth year-over-year compared to second quarter of last year. I'll share just a few other color commentary on it. That is a very similar year-over-year growth that we had at Q1. Our average inventory per store is actually slightly down compared to the first quarter numbers, but very similar on a year-over-year basis. A majority of our inventory growth is inflation, and that inflation has been baked into it. There is some inflation we expect to continue in the business. I think the most important point is what you've heard from Seth and Hal and I now is that the merchant team did an excellent job recognizing that some of the demand from last year that was stimulus driven, we were wise in regards to managing the supply chain and the purchasing. The inventory is in a healthy position. There is some more on the consumables side we are working to get more of to improve our in-stock position, but we feel very good about it. And as I mentioned, unit growth over the last 3 years is single digits, while our sales have been growing at 60%. And I think that's a really important point is that we're growing the inventory modestly, and our turns are in great shape. Yes. Jonathan, this is Kurt. In regards to tariffs, I will address part of it first. I will let Seth talk about pricing and how we would address that. But let me frame up the size of it and the timing of it. So, for instance, just referencing back that imports are roughly 12% of our business. Not all of those imports are subjected to tariffs. So, you are talking single-digit percentage of our business. And when tariffs were enacted, it's over \u2013 it was over a 12-month, 18-month period of time that it flowed through. And we view it and you have to manage it very much like it's another form of inflation. And as it flows through our model, we then have to address how we are going to be able to manage our margins, whether it's retail price or any other levers that we pull through that. And because it's single-digit percentage of it, do keep in mind this \u2013 we never really called it out over those periods of time as a margin headwind. And we would manage it like other levels of inflation where we don't believe it's a significant headwind. We managed it as a needs-based business fairly well, not necessarily a notable margin gain either, but we believe we will manage through that as any tariff adjustments occur. Seth, I will turn it over to you to talk about pricing strategy. Yes. Thanks Jonathan. Yes. Peter, good morning. As we indicated in our prepared remarks and just the consistency of this business, I will start there, Peter, with just the fact that we have got good visibility on our expense structure. We have had consistency in both top line and in gross margin. So, it's really important to just start there as a needs-based, really durable business. And then from there \u2013 the other point that I would mention is that the investments in the business, when you look at SG&A and the cost, the biggest pressure is the investments of the business and the natural SG&A levers at a good low-single digit number. And we are making these purposeful investments all part of our long-term algorithm to drive a strong operating margin and return. We can do that while we are investing in the business. So, to your question about how we manage that, we certainly have the ability if needed to, to be nimble and flex on the investments because that's the area that is the greatest pressure on SG&A. And then the business just has a solid core around DNA around profit improvement, lean thinking. I mean this is something that has been built in over 10-plus years and really matured in our organization. And what we are doing today in regards to driving miles down, more inventory per truckload when you have got transportation costs. And what we are doing to just drive efficiency. Those are the different levers that we are benefiting from today, and we will continue to use that for the next few years. If there is any reason to really have to adjust from our current thesis and algorithm. So, we feel very good about our ability to drive our long-term operating margins."

Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019d like to begin by thanking the Tractor Supply team for again delivering strong results. In some ways, this quarter may have been our best relative performance over the course of the last two years. The team demonstrated grit and determination as they overcame the lapping of last year\u2019s robust performance, the impacts of the Omicron variant, particularly in January, the significant inflationary pressures and the ongoing supply chain constraints, the last two of which were both exacerbated by the tragic conflict in Ukraine. No matter what came at the team, they stepped up to the challenge to be there for our customers as a dependable supplier for the Out Here lifestyle. Our team members, our vendors and other supply chain partners have continued to rise to the occasion as we strive to live our mission and values every day. Speaking of our mission and values, in recognition of Earth Week, this week, we issued our Stewards of Life Out Here Sustainability Report. This comprehensive report provides detailed information and progress on our ESG efforts. It significantly enhances our transparency and disclosure related to our environmental sustainability actions. Of note, in the report is the establishment of a new water usage goal to reduce on an absolute level our water footprint by 25 million gallons by 2025. ESG makes great business sense for Tractor Supply. And setting targets for ourselves in these areas creates long-term value and allows us to have a positive impact on the world and the communities that we call home. As a purpose-driven company, we remain committed to constant improvement on this journey. Now, let\u2019s turn to a review of the business for the first quarter of 2022. The year started out on a strong note. We grew net sales by 8.3% with comparable store sales up 5.2%. Diluted EPS was $1.65, an increase of 6.5% year-over-year. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by strong ticket growth of 6.7%, offset by a decline in transactions of 1.4%. Given the remarkable strength in our business last year, and as a reminder, we had a 38.6% comp in Q1 last year. We are very pleased with our sales growth. Last year, we shared with you that we materially benefited in the quarter from a combination of factors, in particular stimulus spending, favorable weather and inflation. This quarter, we successfully navigated the lapping of these factors, despite the spring season getting off to a slow start. On inflation, it benefited sales in the quarter by about 10 percentage points. As we shared on our last earnings call, we thought there was more pressure to the upside on inflation as we entered the quarter and that is certainly what we saw. We continue to see increasing costs in the commodity inputs and our product categories as well as the underlying variables like higher labor wage rates and transport costs that are impacting our vendor partners. Shifting to C.U.E. We experienced impressive demand in our consumable, usable and edible categories. As a reminder, these products are need-based and demand-driven, and they\u2019re what drive trips into our stores. Our C.U.E. sales growth was almost 3 times our overall sales growth rate. Our C.U.E. customer trends have never been stronger. Kind of rounding out the business, seasonal category performance was mixed as we had solid performance in our winter season categories during a much colder January, but our spring season categories performed below average due to colder weather temperatures in the month of March. Shifting to e-commerce. E-commerce again saw double-digit growth, and this represented our 39th consecutive quarter of double-digit or better growth in e-commerce. We are making great strides in expanding our digital presence. Of note, our mobile app now represents more than 15% of our digital sales. This quarter, we crossed 3 million downloads of the Tractor Supply app. And this is a major milestone in our ONETractor strategy and our ability to offer our customers a more seamless shopping experience. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club program reached a record 24.8 million members in the quarter, an increase of 24% from last year\u2019s first quarter. It seems like much longer than a year ago, but we recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of the relaunch of Neighbor\u2019s Club to a points-based loyalty program. The relaunch has been an overwhelming success as it has measurably encouraged customers to migrate their spending upwards. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club members are comping at a faster overall rate than our overall company performance, and we\u2019re seeing strong growth and retention in our high-value customers. We are confident in our business short term and long term. Last quarter, we shared with you several structural trends from which we\u2019re benefiting, including world revitalization, increased pet ownership, home setting and the rise in self-reliance. As the market leader, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from these structural trends. Additionally, we are seeing increasing momentum from our Life Out Here strategic initiatives, enabling us to continue to gain share. As we look forward, we believe we have many vectors for growth, and our business has never been stronger. That said, we acknowledge that there is significant uncertainty in the macro environment. We have a lot of the year still ahead of us. And in keeping with our longstanding practices prior to the pandemic, we continue to believe that the best way to look at this business is on the half. On the heels of last year\u2019s record performance and a strong start to the year, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal year 2022. We continue to see significant opportunities for growth ahead of us. I\u2019ll briefly address the Orscheln acquisition. We continue to work collaboratively with the FTC towards a positive resolution and hope to have an update in the coming months. Accordingly, we are limited in the comments we can make about the transaction at this time. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kurt to discuss some of the details of the first quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. The Tractor Supply team has started fiscal 2022 with strong performance that came in ahead of our expectations. On a two-year stack, our comparable store sales were 43.8%. Looking at the cadence of the quarter, January and February were the strongest months with March positive, albeit not at the rate earlier in the quarter. We benefited from cold weather trends early in the quarter, while spring is late to break across most of the country. Please keep in mind, we were comping ideal weather conditions in the first quarter of last year with an early spring across many of our markets. This quarter, retail price inflation contributed about 10 points to our comparable store sales as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. As we shared with you last quarter, we anticipated this would be the toughest compare on transactions as we cycled the largest transaction gain since the beginning of the pandemic in Q1 of last year of 21%. To illustrate, we were experiencing positive comp transactions until we cycled the last two weeks of the quarter where we clearly saw the benefits of stimulus on transactions in the prior year. As we expected, big ticket declined given the robust performance we were cycling, driven by stimulus and the early starts of the spring selling season. Last year, as we reported, big ticket comps significantly outperformed the chain average comps. And on a two-year stack, our big ticket performance exceeded the 43.8% comp growth of the chain. We continue to see strong C.U.E. performance with strength in categories such as dry dog food, poultry, feed and heating fuel. For instance, dry dog food achieved over a 20% comp. Petsense performed above the company average, which was in line with our pet performance. Overall, we were very pleased with our top line performance. Turning now to gross margin, which outperformed our expectations. For the first quarter, our gross margin declined by 29 basis points to 34.9% of sales. The decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to three factors: significant product cost inflation; higher transportation costs; and to a lesser extent, product mix. We continue to experience broad-based inflation while also seeing a step-up during the quarter in key commodities such as grains and oil. Domestic and import freight costs have increased substantially year-over-year as well as fuel costs. We expect many of these trends in product cost and freight to continue throughout 2022. The robust growth in our C.U.E. categories, which have a lower gross profit rate did put some pressure on gross margin. The team did a remarkable job of managing these cost increases through our price management actions and other margin driving initiatives. Examples include capturing efficiencies in the supply chain to reduce miles, continuing to limit promotions and leaning into the more efficient value provided through Neighbor\u2019s Club. SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 26.9%, an improvement of 11 basis points. This improvement was primarily attributable to the normalization of incentive compensation, moderation of COVID-19 response costs and leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. These items were partially offset by investments in store wages and incremental costs related to our Life Out Here strategic investments for growth. This includes a step-up in our depreciation and amortization. Please also keep in mind, given our results last year, we were cycling strong SG&A leverage, which benefited from 38.6% comp sales in the first quarter of 2021. Net income was $187 million, and diluted EPS was $1.65 compared to $1.55 in the first quarter of 2021. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. Last quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 77% from $0.52 a share to $0.92. During the quarter, we returned $400 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong and provides us the ability to invest in our business for the long term. Merchandise inventories were $2.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of about 21% in average inventory per store. This increase is primarily attributable to inflation, along with our investment in inventory to support the growing demand. Moving now to our guidance for 2022, which is unchanged. As Hal mentioned earlier, we are reconfirming our guidance for the year. This includes net sales in the range of $13.6 billion to $13.8 billion with comparable store sales growth of 3% to 4.5%. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 10.1% to 10.3% of sales. We continue to expect diluted EPS in a range of $9.20 to $9.50. We acknowledge that we beat our own expectations for the first quarter and that ongoing inflation should benefit our top line. With the dynamic macro environment as a backdrop, we believe it\u2019s prudent to maintain our outlook for the year. Keep in mind, Q1 is our smallest quarter of the year, and it\u2019s great to start out the year ahead of our expectations. We recognize that flowing the first quarter performance through may put pressure towards the top end of our guidance ranges. For those of you who\u2019ve followed us for some time, this is not a new convention to guidance and is in line with how we provided guidance historically prior to the pandemic. We continue to believe the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the halves of the year. With as much inflation pressures we\u2019re seeing in our business, we are closely watching comparable average ticket and transactions. We anticipate that the breakdown of growth may be a bit different than our prior expectations, given the high level of inflation benefiting average ticket with transactions seeing incremental pressure. Historically, we\u2019ve experienced trip consolidation by consumers during strong inflationary times. As inflation pressures persist, it puts higher pressure on gross margin, yet provides an offsetting benefit to SG&A leverage. As such, we\u2019re maintaining our expectations on our operating margin. As a reminder, the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. In summary, -- we are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and our outlook for 2022. The team is executing at a very high level. We remain committed to investing in the business to retain the loyalty of our longtime and newer customers. Our goals are to maintain our everyday low prices and improve customer service, strengthen our supply chain and grow our digital commerce, all in support of our commitment to drive strong shareholder returns for the long term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Kurt. Last quarter at our Enhanced Earnings Event, we shared significant details on our Life Out Here strategy. We believe we have a robust idiosyncratic drivers for growth over time. Our strategy is gaining traction and the team is executing well. For the remainder of my prepared remarks, I\u2019m going to provide an update on our customer, including our Neighbor\u2019s Club, and provide some highlights of our merchandising initiatives for the spring and summer season. Our customer trends are in great shape, and we\u2019re committed to capturing wallet share through legendary customer service, our numerous digital properties, our seamless shopping experience and our Neighbor\u2019s Club loyalty program. Our customer base continues to be remarkably healthy and highly engaged with our brands. In our Q2 2020 earnings call, nearly two years ago, we discussed that our goal was to nurture and capitalize on the generational growth we were seeing in our customer base, seizing on the opportunities to retain millions of new customers and expand share of wallet with our core customers and expand the number of capital categories shopped by both customer sets. And I\u2019m pleased to share with you today that that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing in our customer base. Our active customer base is now much larger and coming into the pandemic, as we have retained the majority of the millions of new customers that shopped us the last couple of years. And our active customers are driving frequency and spending more money. On our new customers, we continue to see strong new customer acquisition with absolute run rates that are at pre-COVID levels and very stable. Continuing on a theme since 2020, our new customers continue to skew younger. We\u2019re seeing ongoing growth in our millennial shoppers as there\u2019s been a net migration out of urban areas, largely driven by millennials. Since the start of the pandemic, the most robust homeownership growth is in the millennial cohort, with the growth coming in suburban and rural areas. We believe the growth in the millennial customer supports the vibrancy and relevance of the Tractor Supply brand well into the future. Another positive contributor to our strong sales growth has been our Neighbor\u2019s Club. As I mentioned earlier, the revamp of the program in April of last year from an Infinity program to tiered points-based loyalty program has been rapidly adopted by our customers. Neighbor\u2019s Club is a significant growth platform for us. Notably, we reached our highest level of customer spending over $1,000 annually, and we also reached our highest level of customers ever spending over $2,000 annually. Transactions, total sales and spend per active Neighbor\u2019s Club member, all grew significantly in the quarter. These customer trends are an indication that we continue to benefit from the structural tailwinds I mentioned earlier, such as rural revitalization, pet ownership, home setting and self-reliance. Our brand momentum is stronger than ever, and we\u2019re investing to ensure we continue to play offence in the context of these trends. The overall health of our customer base contributes to our confidence in our outlook for the year. Let\u2019s shift to spring. Our stores and e-commerce are well-positioned to take advantage of the seasonal change to serve our customers. As of today, we have over 175 garden centers customer-ready for spring. We continue to forecast having garden center transformations of our side lots in over 15% of our stores by the end of the year. Where spring has cooperated, we are very excited about our customers\u2019 response to the expanded product offering and layout. To capture incremental share of wallet in the lawn and garden category, we\u2019ve expanded our offerings of battery-powered outdoor power equipment. Tractor Supply is the exclusive retailer of the Greenworks Pro 60-volt platform which includes more than 75 battery-operated professional-grade residential tools, including zero-turn riding and push mowers, chainsaws, trimmers, leaf blowers, snow throwers and more. Tractor Supply began offering Greenworks Pro 60-volt products online earlier this year, and we rolled them out in our stores the past few weeks. Notably, the addition of battery-operated zero-turn mower from Greenworks strengthens our position as the zero-turn headquarters with our market-leading assortment from Toro, Bad Boy and Cub Cadet. This past Saturday, we hosted a Try Before You Buy event at our stores that allowed our customers an opportunity to test drive our market-leading assortment and the various models in our stores. Chick Days are always an exciting time in store and something that our customers look forward to with the change of seasons to spring. We sell millions of birds each year. And this year, we\u2019ve expanded our breed options as well as widened our coop, feed and care assortment. This is a great example of a home setting category for our new millennial customer who\u2019s adopting the Out Here lifestyle. And importantly, our store teams have the knowledge to help a customer in the category, whether they are a novice or an expert. We have a leading lineup of top selling, highest quality tools that are relative to our customers. Last week, we announced the addition of Dremel and Bosch to our power tool lineup just in time for spring. As mentioned on several previous calls, a key component of Project Fusion is an expansion of our assortment in truck, tool and hardware. Our lineup and tools now include Makita, DeWalt, PORTER-CABLE exclusively, Bosch and Dremel. We are much more of a destination now for our customers in this category. And as an aside, we\u2019re also on track to have Project Fusion implemented in nearly 30% of our stores by year-end. To wrap up, the Tractor Supply team continues to thrive through the dynamic macroeconomic environment while making incredible progress for laying the foundation for the future. Tractor Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over numerous different types of business cycles. With significant growth and market share opportunities ahead of us, it\u2019s an exciting time to be at Tractor Supply. My thanks and appreciation go off to the team for their dedication to living our mission and values every day. And now, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scot Ciccarelli from Truist. Scot, Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. So, I guess, my question is, with the 10% impact from pricing in the comp, what kind of, if any, demand structure are you guys seeing? And kind of related to that, how should we think about the impact on the top line from inflation as we get later in the year because obviously, we\u2019re going to be cycling larger impacts as we go? Thanks.\nHal Lawton: Hey Scot. Good morning. And thanks for joining our call. I appreciate the question. I\u2019d start out just at the highest level. Consumer\u2019s very healthy. As Kurt mentioned, we exceeded our expectations in Q1, and kind of a few nuances on that. Where we -- in the business where we\u2019re lapping the stimulus from last year, notably in big ticket, we saw some follow-up there, but it was very much in line with what we expected and what we had foreshadowed at our enhanced earnings event, when we talked about some pressure from big ticket dominantly in the last part of Q1 and early part of Q2. As Kurt mentioned and I mentioned also in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve seen a little bit of a slow start to spring, but it\u2019s been in the categories you would expect, and spring always comes. We\u2019ve had it -- play out in many different ways over the last couple of decades on spring, but otherwise, really seeing no elasticity in the customer. And I\u2019d point to our C.U.E. business as an indication to that, it\u2019s comped 3 times our overall comp rate, dry dog food above 20% comps. In fact, the month of March was our highest dollar volume ever in dry dog food. If I just step back, we serve a lifestyle. It\u2019s a demand-driven need-based kind product categories for the most part and have a track record of consistency and resiliency really across all different types of economic cycles. And in addition to that track record of consistency in the demand-driven business model, two additional factors going for us now. One are the continued kind of macro tailwinds, things like world revitalization and pet adoption that I mentioned earlier, and then also our Life Out Here strategy. And with 175 garden centers, and by the end of the year, 30% of our -- nearly 30% of our stores remodel with Fusion. We just got -- we\u2019ve got a lot of tailwinds right now. And as it relates to the consumer, we\u2019ve really not seen much reaction to inflation or any other kind of economic elements. As far as the impact on inflation, to your second point of your question, I\u2019d kind of point to Kurt\u2019s comments in his prepared remarks around we did exceed our expectations in Q1. Just given the -- our historic convention of sticking to the half and also just given the macro environment, we thought it was prudent to reiterate our guidance. But certainly, if you roll through the beat in the first quarter, it would take you towards the high end of our guidance for the year. And then, if we were to exceed performance for the rest of the year, we\u2019d end up having a -- and continue to do that. We\u2019d end up having a nice year. I do think inflation continues to be persistent. And we continue to see it come through, and we continue to be able to navigate it very effectively.\nOperator: Next question is from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon, please go ahead.\nSimeon Gutman: I\u2019ll ask the two questions now in the interest of time. The first is the business\u2019s mix of needs versus wants. We used to talk about this a while ago. So, how do you -- how should we think about the percentage of the business that\u2019s discretionary if the consumer slows? And then, the second question is a little more tactical. If you look at the earnings complexion for the rest of the year, margins were down a little in the first quarter, but it looks like the incremental margins for the rest of the year look like they\u2019re higher given the per point in comp. So, what\u2019s, I guess, the bridge? Is there less investment? Is there a mapping up cost, et cetera? Thank you.\nKurt Barton: Yes. Simeon, hey, this is Kurt. I\u2019ll hit both of those questions. If I understood the question, your first question generally is around needs discretionary versus a needs-based business, which we\u2019re predominantly, and then really more of a -- how do you reconcile and how do you manage the cost, the operating margin throughout the rest of the year. Our business continues to be strong in a needs-based, demand-driven versus the discretionary. And as you\u2019ve heard from us in the past, while there is some less needs-based discretionary, the discretionary piece of our business is fairly consistently been a low percentage, roughly like 15% of our business, we\u2019d attribute to those more discretionary pieces of it. And as Hal just mentioned, some of those areas we -- as we expected and saw lifts last year with stimulus, we expected and saw some of that trade-off in the back end of Q1. In regards to our outlook for the year and how we really manage the margins, we expect our gross margin as inflation persists to have some level of pressure on the business. We\u2019re going to see pressure from those three primary categories: product inflation; the supply chain costs; and even considering the strength of C.U.E. as we continue to take market share, puts a little bit of pressure from mix. But, as we manage through this, we really see the opportunity to take both levers of gross margin and SG&A. And in each quarter could be a bit different as inflation puts pressure on gross margin. We also do see the opportunity for that to help us leverage in SG&A. And in the first half of the year, where inflation year-over-year has more of an impact and not as much stronger compares, where at the back half of the year, we\u2019re really starting to see inflation tick up. You could see as you did in Q1, stronger inflation, but we have opportunity to leverage on SG&A. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to view this business. We\u2019re going to manage this as we have the last couple of years through a number of different scenarios, and we do see a scenario where there\u2019s higher inflation. And we\u2019ve got the levers to be able to manage gross margin and SG&A, and it could differ by quarters, but that\u2019s what gives us the confidence to be able to land the target for the year of 10.1% to 10.3% on the operating margin.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Kate, you may proceed.\nKate McShane: Thank you again for the detail around the change in composition of the guide. I was just wondering how we should think about potentially the upside and downside risk to the guide. Where do you think there could be elements of where you could be being particularly conservative?\nKurt Barton: Yes, Kate. Hey. Good morning. This is Kurt. In regards to your question on the guide, let me give you a couple of perspectives really how we see the business and how we look at it going forward. First, I\u2019ll just reiterate what Hal and I\u2019ve said. We\u2019re coming off of Q1 a great start to the year where there\u2019s a strong performance hitting on all metrics. And just to point out, Q1 on a two-year stack basis, from the strength in new customers, the strength in Neighbor\u2019s Club, our transaction toward the highest two-year stack of any of the four quarters. So, the core of the business is strong and healthy. That said, as I just mentioned earlier, it is right and consistent even in the last two years, we\u2019re managing the business in multiple scenarios. So, to your point in your question, there are various scenarios. And if under one scenario, there\u2019s inflation that drives the comps outside of even the initial expectations, with that inflation, it puts pressure on margins, the leverage and SG&A. We certainly see that with inflation. It could impact some of the transactions. We\u2019ve trip consolidation. We\u2019ve seen customers begin to change in their spending patterns with the inflation. But, that\u2019s not necessarily negative for us as we benefit in ticket and that can help us leverage our SG&A. And so, the number of various scenarios that we see playing out, we feel very comfortable that in the next three quarters as we manage that, that we can still meet our expectations and our guidance and very confident in the demand of the business and the strength right now going into the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Baker of D.A. Davidson.\nMichael Baker: One question and a follow-up kind of short term and then long term. On the short term, back to --just the weather being a sub par in March, do we expect to -- so you\u2019ve lost some sales presumably. So, we should expect to gain that back in the second quarter, I assume. But, we\u2019ve seen -- how has April been in terms of the weather? And then, the longer term question. how does -- can you remind us how you think about housing and impact to your business, rate drop, housing is probably going to slow, existing home sales have been down six or seven months in a row, although prices have been up. How do you think about that longer term for your business? Thanks.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey, Michael, it\u2019s Hal. And I\u2019m going to take the first -- the second part of your question first on housing and then have Seth talk a little bit about spring. On housing, we don\u2019t have as much of a direct correlation to new home starts and existing home sales, like other segments of retail. That said, one of the trends we have been benefiting from is the notion of home setting and people investing in their homes and in their land and also rural revitalization as well as we\u2019ve had kind a shift out of urban and even sub-urban areas into ex-urban and rural. I think all the data sets still suggest that those trends are continuing. Even if you look at the existing home sales and new home sales, which have come up the last few days, while there were some year-over-year reductions, still very strong absolute numbers, and then if you look at the amount of housing stock that were short in the United States, I think you\u2019re going to continue to see very strong absolute numbers for many years -- many quarters and years to come. And I think you\u2019re going to see more of that outside of the cities, and we\u2019ll continue to benefit from that. Most of our customers own their land, own their homes, and they\u2019ve seen home and land depreciation, particularly out of rural, which has had outsized gains versus urban. They\u2019re benefiting from that. There\u2019s been a bit of a wealth effect. So, certainly feel like that home stetting trend and that rural revitalization trend are still very strong macroeconomic tailwinds for us. On spring, as Kurt mentioned, we\u2019ve had a -- spring has been slow to start, but we are very excited about our spring plans. Inventory is in a great spot, marketing and merchandising, our prime, C.U.E. is driving footsteps. And I\u2019m going to turn it over to Seth to talk a little bit about some of our spring plans in more detail.\nSeth Estep: Yes. Hey. Thanks, Hal. Thanks, Mike, for the question. Hey, first and foremost, as Hal mentioned, obviously, a little bit of delay here to the start of spring. But as we\u2019ve seen the weather starts to break off the southern most areas the last couple of weeks, we are very encouraged with seeing our game plan come to life. First and foremost, I would just say, I was in Texas last week and visited several garden centers. And I would tell you, both our customers and our team members could not be more excited about us really going deeper into live goods and gardening, which we know it has been historically the number one category. So, we were not first in top of mind for them and becoming more of that top of mind, and we are seeing very good positive results, particularly in those garden center stores and being set up for 175 plus as we enter spring here. But it\u2019s also not just about live goods, right? We believe we have the best-in-class zero-turn lineup that\u2019s out there. We spoke a little bit about big ticket at the end of Q1. But what I would tell you is where we\u2019re seeing weather break. We\u2019re seeing very strong demand across the entire zero-turn lineup, both in brands and price point. We\u2019re -- our consumer responding with that merchandising. And we\u2019ve spoken some obviously about Greenworks Pro and that exclusive partnership that we have this year. That\u2019s a new real category that we haven\u2019t been able to attack in years past that we know that we can go and take market share. A couple of other quick things we think about spring and where we\u2019re excited to drive the business. It\u2019s not just about lawn and garden at Tractor Supply, but it\u2019s also about home setting. Chick Days is off to a great start, whether be through new coops or these through new breeds, things of that nature, really, really strong demand that we\u2019re seeing our consumer respond to and then just continue to dive into our C.U.E. related businesses and introducing newness across the four walls. So, excited about spring and what we have here in front of us and the plan coming to life.\nMichael Baker: Thanks for the detailed response. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is with Steven Zaccone.\nSteven Zaccone: I guess, Hal, I was kind of curious for your sense on the broader macro backdrop. It sounds like you\u2019re comfortable that consumers are in a healthy position, but just curious your input on how you see the consumer environment shaping up over the balance of the year? It\u2019s topical with investors. And I guess if we do get to a scenario where potentially in a recession, how do you think the business performs in that environment?\nHal Lawton: Good morning, Steven, and thanks for joining our call. If we step back and just talk about the macroeconomic environment, what we\u2019re seeing is very consistent with what we\u2019re all reading in the headlines every day. I\u2019ll start with persistent inflation. We had the CPI of 8.5% in the month of March, that we\u2019ve seen 0.5 point increases a month for the last handful of months. It\u2019s tough to say if we\u2019re at peak inflation, the way I think about it is that we\u2019re seeing persistent inflation. And I think we will see, strong inflation, not only through this year, but in the next year. As it relates to the economy, so far, the consumer has shown real strength and their ability to kind of navigate the inflation. And I think you\u2019re hearing that today in our earnings call, but also hearing it in many other earnings calls that have come out over the last week, and there\u2019s a variety of reasons for that. I mean, you\u2019ve had strong wage growth across the country. You\u2019ve got $2 trillion plus of pent-up savings that people are starting to tap into now, and you can see that in savings rate. You do see a little bit of credit card usage up. But I think if you dig into that what we\u2019re seeing is people using their credit cards and then tapping into their savings to pay those down with default rates not yet moving up. I think, the consumer\u2019s navigating this very well. And I think any talk of recession at this point is premature. And stepping back, if you look at our business, we\u2019ve had 30 straight years of positive comp transactions. We\u2019ve had 30 straight years of net sales growth, 29 of the last 30, we\u2019ve had positive comp sales growth. This is a business that has been able to navigate all types of economic cycles, whether it was the recession in \u201820, the recession in 2007, \u201808, \u201809, whether it was COVID, just a couple of years ago. All those sorts of scenarios, this business has been incredibly resilient, stable and consistent through. And as I mentioned earlier, there\u2019s a number of macroeconomic tailwinds that are really benefiting us that I think even accentuate the stability of our business. And then combine that with our Life Out Here strategy, which is just an indicative of just the next leg of growth for our company. And 40 years ago, we doubled down in animal fee, 20 years ago, we doubled down in pet food. Now, we\u2019re doubling down in live goods combined with our Fusion remodel. We\u2019ve never had more customers shopping Tractor Supply. We\u2019ve never had a stronger digital business at Tractor Supply. Our business is incredibly strong right now. And we are very much excited about the business from a short-term perspective and long-term.\nOperator: Our next question is with Brian Nagel.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter. I have two short questions that I\u2019ll merge into one. The first question, I mean, I guess this is just more of a kind of a logistics, not question. But you talk about the quarter tracking above your expectations, but then also some of the weather pressures. So, I guess, my question there is, were you -- in your internal plan, were you planning for potentially more challenging weather, or -- what drove, so to say, the upside in the quarter to your tier internal plans. And then my second question, we talked a lot about of this inflation and how the consumer is managing that. Kind of flipping that over, as you look at some of your markets where maybe you\u2019re more of a benefit of -- your consumers benefit more from higher oil prices or higher commodity prices? Are you starting to see that sort of say, work its way into the health of your -- the consumer shop in your stores?\nKurt Barton: Yes, Brian. Hey, good morning. This is Kurt. So, the two questions, one in regards to some of the puts and takes in regards to our -- in comparison to our expectations on Q1; and then, the other one is some of the geo market areas such as oil industry et cetera. So, let me take both of those. In the quarter, in Q1, weather from a perspective compared to last year, flattish to slightly modestly unfavorable. The point there is, last year we pointed, we had such an early start to the spring, and March is the biggest month that we saw 400 basis points last year in Q1 for weather and we pointed that out. This year, we had early start to the quarter with good cold weather in January that we benefited from, but then we had the offset. So, weather was neutralish from a perspective. Really some of the strengths came in how well C.U.E. performed and our ability to continue to capture market share. So, weather wasn\u2019t necessarily beyond -- significantly beyond our expectations. We plan that there could be a scenario that we would not see as much early start to the spring. I hope that helps on that. In regards to some of the various micro economies, all that, the two key ones that are asked a lot about oil industry, farm economy. In summary, I\u2019d say right now, it\u2019s still too early to tell. We are not seeing any meaningful shift in those markets that indicate anything. And I\u2019ll illustrate why on some of that. First, we don\u2019t view some of the rise in commodities or oil necessarily as a negative in those industries, but yes, really more of a potential favorable tailwind in the business. Right now, the oil industry is a bit patient, lagging some of the growth and increase in the oil prices. The farm economy takes some time farmers to get product out of the ground. Farmers are faced with higher input costs right now. So, I think it\u2019s a matter of something to watch. Overall, those markets are very healthy and consistent with all other markets. We\u2019ll watch it closely, but we\u2019re certainly ready and prepared to support those industries if and when we begin to see specific lifts because of that.\nBrian Nagel: It\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is with Karen Short from Barclays.\nKaren Short: Two questions. So one, I guess, the first one is in terms of inflation for the year, what is your actual updated expectation on inflation for the year? And then, embedded within that, on traffic, your traffic was only down 1% with 10% inflation. But on a two- and three-year basis, more or less held. So, could you just clarify how you\u2019re thinking about traffic for the remainder of the year, because presumably, inflation will abate, so that should actually help the traffic overall on a one-, two- and three-year basis?\nHal Lawton: Thanks for joining our call and for the question. On inflation in our enhanced earnings, we mentioned that our assumption was around 4% for the year, but that if anything, we saw a potential for upside to that. And that\u2019s very much what we saw in the quarter. And we\u2019re not providing kind of an update on that 4% number today, but I would say that potential for upside there still remains. Kind of my comment to an earlier question around inflation being persistent, I do think it will continue through the balance of the year and run at 4% or higher. On the traffic, we were very pleased with the traffic in the quarter that we had, and it exceeded our expectations. To your point on two- and three-year stacks, it was either in line or above sequentially and with our previous quarters. And in particular, if you think about the stimulus benefits from last year, but certainly, the spring differences, the weather differences in the month of March, we were very pleased with how our comp transactions ran. And we\u2019ve never had more customers shopping Tractor Supply than we have on a rolling 12 basis. We\u2019ve done an excellent job of maintaining the tens of millions of new customers that have shopped us over the last two years. Our active customer file is incredibly strong. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club membership program, members have never been higher. The participation, active participation in the Neighbor\u2019s Club program has never been higher. So, we feel really good about our customer trajectory, our transaction trajectory within those customers and our customers kind of navigating inflation in our business kind of in a demand-driven need-based type environment.\nKaren Short: Can I just clarify? It was only in the context that I think Kurt made a comment that traffic would continue to be pressured in light of -- or would be pressured in light of inflation, but that\u2019s not [Technical Difficulty] I just want to clarify, that\u2019s not what you\u2019re seeing.\nHal Lawton: Yes. I think, to clarify, I think what we\u2019re trying to articulate there was there\u2019s a variety of scenarios that could play out for the balance of the year. And one of those could be that inflation continues to run high. And if so, that might drive some different behavior in customer shopping patterns, notably that they might consolidate trips more. And if they do that, what we might see is a higher basket size with slightly lower transactions. And we just -- we\u2019re saying, look, that\u2019s one scenario that could play out and still very much within the context of our guidance. And then, the same thing on the margin profile side, kind of the point is more around if inflation still runs high, we might see a little bit more pressure than what we had guided on gross margin rates, still excellent margin rate performance, but we see a little bit less pressure on SG&A because our fixed costs would be running on higher sales dollars and that would still deliver us the operating margin rate in the -- in line -- in the range of our guidance. And we\u2019re very pleased with our operating margin performance in the first quarter. We really, as Kurt mentioned, exceeded our expectations across all core metrics, traffic, sales and operating margin and EPS.\nOperator: Our next question is with Michael Lasser of UBS.\nMichael Lasser: There\u2019s a heightened focus on big ticket spending, given some of the indications from others out there around connected fitness equipment, grills, mattresses. Your suggestion is that overall to your big ticket trends are doing better than average, and that\u2019s inclusive of what sounds like a drop-off in the last two weeks of the quarter, which persisted into the first few weeks of this quarter. So, what is driving the strength in big ticket growth for Tractor Supply? And how much is inflation contributing to that growth? Thanks.\nHal Lawton: Good morning. And thanks for the question, Michael. I\u2019d say, probably three things on that to kind of break big ticket up a bit. There are -- we saw fall-off in big ticket sales directly attributable to stimulus, very much in line with what we expected. And those were in non-seasonal categories dominantly, things like gun safes. In the seasonal businesses, big ticket, as Seth mentioned, where we\u2019ve seen the spring weather break, we\u2019ve seen excellent results in things like riders and grills, bigger ticket items. And then, as it relates to inflation, we certainly are seeing inflation in those categories, like we\u2019re seeing across the board. But I would say that we\u2019re also pleased with our unit movement in those categories, not just sales driven by inflation. So, overall, we continue to be -- feel very confident in our business short term and long term, inclusive of big ticket. And we\u2019re excited about the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning. Hal, Seth, I wanted to start with your in-market learnings, right? As it looks like you\u2019ve both been on the road recently. So, can you take us through some of your key learnings? And what I mean by that is really the learnings from the store associates. What are they saying about their own behaviors? And did you notice anything different among the regions that you visited, maybe outside of seasonal trends?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey Steven, thanks for the question. And we have all been on the road a lot recently, making sure it\u2019s a core tenant of Tractor Supply\u2019s mission and values and our culture. And I think our team is in great shape. John Ordus and our field organization have just done a fantastic job in hiring. We\u2019re nearly 47,000 team members now, done an excellent job managing attrition. We\u2019ve -- our FAST team continues to roll out to more stores in terms of kind of dedicated FAST team members. We\u2019re rolling out new productivity programs, as John outlined in our last earnings call. If you walk our stores right now, they\u2019ve never been in better shape. They -- we\u2019ve got great service in our stores right now. Product is well-organized and on the shelves. We\u2019ve got -- they\u2019re very clean and orderly. We\u2019ve got really all of the assembly done across Grills and all across riders, and we are ready for spring, ready for the second quarter. And then, in terms of engagement, our store -- we had our engagement survey towards the end of last year. Our store team member engagement was at an all-time high. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re doing an excellent job managing attrition and -- our team members are really the glue of our company. And we pride ourselves on the customer service that we deliver inside of our stores. And I think we\u2019re only continuing to make progress on that even at an already high level. And I think it\u2019s going to be a big benefit to us as we move into -- as we are in the second quarter now.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom: Kurt, can you provide a sense for how you see the rest of the year playing out on the comp front in order to arrive at that 3% to 4.5% full year view, particularly here in the second quarter, just given the upside here that you posted for 1Q? And then, on the stores front, can you talk about your confidence levels to open up the 75 to 80 stores, given that you weren\u2019t able to open up any here in 1Q?\nKurt Barton: Yes. Thanks for the questions, two of them there. I\u2019ll just reiterate what Hal and I have talked about in regards to the comp performance and how that plays out for the year. Certainly, as we exceeded our expectation or coming off of strong Q1 performance, as you roll that through the year. And we\u2019ll continue to say as we have the last two years, we are managing this business through multiple scenarios. You could have comp sales at the high end of our guidance range. It\u2019s one quarter into the year as we see the rest of the year. We\u2019ve got good momentum in the business. And so, as you play that out, we recognize that as you flow this through, this could be towards the high end of our guidance range. And as we\u2019ve even indicated, it\u2019s early to predict on levels of inflation, but as inflation persists, it even puts upward pressure on that. And at this point, the best we can do is tell you how we view the business and how we\u2019re managing that. And then, in regards to our new store openings, I\u2019ll start by saying we are -- we have no concerns in regards to opening of new stores. We have confidence in our ability to hit our 70 to 80 stores this year. We\u2019ve got a solid track record of opening 70, 80 stores. Our process is solid. Our pipeline for new stores is really strong right now. And construction is not exempt from some of the challenges of supply chain, labor, et cetera. We put a lot of effort and to complete the 80 stores in the fourth quarter. And some of those scenarios that push stores out, we saw some in Q1 as well. And as those stores have been pushed out of Q1-- by the way, Q1 is our -- typically our smallest quarter of new stores. Those stores will open up in Q2, Q3. We still have a real strong pipeline and expect to hit our targets this year for new stores.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Austin, if we keep at the top of the hour, maybe we\u2019ll take one more question in and then wrap up our call after the next question, please.\nOperator: Of course. Our final question will be from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.\nChuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. When you look at strong level of C.U.E. sales in the first quarter, is there -- as a percent of total, is there something else going on besides stimulus spending? And how is that mix shaping up thus far into the second quarter?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey Chuck, how are you? And thank you for joining the call today. On C.U.E., I would attribute our strong growth to taking share. As we talked about in our enhanced earnings event, on a two-year stack, our total sales grew 52% relative to the market at 25%, which meant we grew -- outgrew the market by 27 points, significant share gain. And that is -- we\u2019re the market leader in animal feed. We\u2019re one of the market leaders in pet food and we are gaining significant share in both of those categories. It\u2019s attributable to our business model, our customer service, our Life Out Here strategy, and so we\u2019re -- that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re just really excited about C.U.E. and the footsteps that\u2019s driving into our stores and the setup that has for us for the balance of the year.\nMary Winn Pilkington: This completes our call today. We look forward to talking to you at our second quarter earnings call in July. Both Marianne and I are around today. So, please feel free to reach out. But thank you very much for joining our call today.\nOperator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to begin by thanking the Tractor Supply team for again delivering strong results. In some ways, this quarter may have been our best relative performance over the course of the last two years. The team demonstrated grit and determination as they overcame the lapping of last year's robust performance, the impacts of the Omicron variant, particularly in January, the significant inflationary pressures and the ongoing supply chain constraints, the last two of which were both exacerbated by the tragic conflict in Ukraine. No matter what came at the team, they stepped up to the challenge to be there for our customers as a dependable supplier for the Out Here lifestyle. Our team members, our vendors and other supply chain partners have continued to rise to the occasion as we strive to live our mission and values every day. Speaking of our mission and values, in recognition of Earth Week, this week, we issued our Stewards of Life Out Here Sustainability Report. This comprehensive report provides detailed information and progress on our ESG efforts. It significantly enhances our transparency and disclosure related to our environmental sustainability actions. Of note, in the report is the establishment of a new water usage goal to reduce on an absolute level our water footprint by 25 million gallons by 2025. ESG makes great business sense for Tractor Supply. And setting targets for ourselves in these areas creates long-term value and allows us to have a positive impact on the world and the communities that we call home. As a purpose-driven company, we remain committed to constant improvement on this journey. Now, let's turn to a review of the business for the first quarter of 2022. The year started out on a strong note. We grew net sales by 8.3% with comparable store sales up 5.2%. Diluted EPS was $1.65, an increase of 6.5% year-over-year. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by strong ticket growth of 6.7%, offset by a decline in transactions of 1.4%. Given the remarkable strength in our business last year, and as a reminder, we had a 38.6% comp in Q1 last year. We are very pleased with our sales growth. Last year, we shared with you that we materially benefited in the quarter from a combination of factors, in particular stimulus spending, favorable weather and inflation. This quarter, we successfully navigated the lapping of these factors, despite the spring season getting off to a slow start. On inflation, it benefited sales in the quarter by about 10 percentage points. As we shared on our last earnings call, we thought there was more pressure to the upside on inflation as we entered the quarter and that is certainly what we saw. We continue to see increasing costs in the commodity inputs and our product categories as well as the underlying variables like higher labor wage rates and transport costs that are impacting our vendor partners. Shifting to C.U.E. We experienced impressive demand in our consumable, usable and edible categories. As a reminder, these products are need-based and demand-driven, and they're what drive trips into our stores. Our C.U.E. sales growth was almost 3 times our overall sales growth rate. Our C.U.E. customer trends have never been stronger. Kind of rounding out the business, seasonal category performance was mixed as we had solid performance in our winter season categories during a much colder January, but our spring season categories performed below average due to colder weather temperatures in the month of March. Shifting to e-commerce. E-commerce again saw double-digit growth, and this represented our 39th consecutive quarter of double-digit or better growth in e-commerce. We are making great strides in expanding our digital presence. Of note, our mobile app now represents more than 15% of our digital sales. This quarter, we crossed 3 million downloads of the Tractor Supply app. And this is a major milestone in our ONETractor strategy and our ability to offer our customers a more seamless shopping experience. Our Neighbor's Club program reached a record 24.8 million members in the quarter, an increase of 24% from last year's first quarter. It seems like much longer than a year ago, but we recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of the relaunch of Neighbor's Club to a points-based loyalty program. The relaunch has been an overwhelming success as it has measurably encouraged customers to migrate their spending upwards. Our Neighbor's Club members are comping at a faster overall rate than our overall company performance, and we're seeing strong growth and retention in our high-value customers. We are confident in our business short term and long term. Last quarter, we shared with you several structural trends from which we're benefiting, including world revitalization, increased pet ownership, home setting and the rise in self-reliance. As the market leader, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from these structural trends. Additionally, we are seeing increasing momentum from our Life Out Here strategic initiatives, enabling us to continue to gain share. As we look forward, we believe we have many vectors for growth, and our business has never been stronger. That said, we acknowledge that there is significant uncertainty in the macro environment. We have a lot of the year still ahead of us. And in keeping with our longstanding practices prior to the pandemic, we continue to believe that the best way to look at this business is on the half. On the heels of last year's record performance and a strong start to the year, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal year 2022. We continue to see significant opportunities for growth ahead of us. I'll briefly address the Orscheln acquisition. We continue to work collaboratively with the FTC towards a positive resolution and hope to have an update in the coming months. Accordingly, we are limited in the comments we can make about the transaction at this time. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kurt to discuss some of the details of the first quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Thanks, Kurt. Last quarter at our Enhanced Earnings Event, we shared significant details on our Life Out Here strategy. We believe we have a robust idiosyncratic drivers for growth over time. Our strategy is gaining traction and the team is executing well. For the remainder of my prepared remarks, I'm going to provide an update on our customer, including our Neighbor's Club, and provide some highlights of our merchandising initiatives for the spring and summer season. Our customer trends are in great shape, and we're committed to capturing wallet share through legendary customer service, our numerous digital properties, our seamless shopping experience and our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. Our customer base continues to be remarkably healthy and highly engaged with our brands. In our Q2 2020 earnings call, nearly two years ago, we discussed that our goal was to nurture and capitalize on the generational growth we were seeing in our customer base, seizing on the opportunities to retain millions of new customers and expand share of wallet with our core customers and expand the number of capital categories shopped by both customer sets. And I'm pleased to share with you today that that's exactly what we're seeing in our customer base. Our active customer base is now much larger and coming into the pandemic, as we have retained the majority of the millions of new customers that shopped us the last couple of years. And our active customers are driving frequency and spending more money. On our new customers, we continue to see strong new customer acquisition with absolute run rates that are at pre-COVID levels and very stable. Continuing on a theme since 2020, our new customers continue to skew younger. We're seeing ongoing growth in our millennial shoppers as there's been a net migration out of urban areas, largely driven by millennials. Since the start of the pandemic, the most robust homeownership growth is in the millennial cohort, with the growth coming in suburban and rural areas. We believe the growth in the millennial customer supports the vibrancy and relevance of the Tractor Supply brand well into the future. Another positive contributor to our strong sales growth has been our Neighbor's Club. As I mentioned earlier, the revamp of the program in April of last year from an Infinity program to tiered points-based loyalty program has been rapidly adopted by our customers. Neighbor's Club is a significant growth platform for us. Notably, we reached our highest level of customer spending over $1,000 annually, and we also reached our highest level of customers ever spending over $2,000 annually. Transactions, total sales and spend per active Neighbor's Club member, all grew significantly in the quarter. These customer trends are an indication that we continue to benefit from the structural tailwinds I mentioned earlier, such as rural revitalization, pet ownership, home setting and self-reliance. Our brand momentum is stronger than ever, and we're investing to ensure we continue to play offence in the context of these trends. The overall health of our customer base contributes to our confidence in our outlook for the year. Let's shift to spring. Our stores and e-commerce are well-positioned to take advantage of the seasonal change to serve our customers. As of today, we have over 175 garden centers customer-ready for spring. We continue to forecast having garden center transformations of our side lots in over 15% of our stores by the end of the year. Where spring has cooperated, we are very excited about our customers' response to the expanded product offering and layout. To capture incremental share of wallet in the lawn and garden category, we've expanded our offerings of battery-powered outdoor power equipment. Tractor Supply is the exclusive retailer of the Greenworks Pro 60-volt platform which includes more than 75 battery-operated professional-grade residential tools, including zero-turn riding and push mowers, chainsaws, trimmers, leaf blowers, snow throwers and more. Tractor Supply began offering Greenworks Pro 60-volt products online earlier this year, and we rolled them out in our stores the past few weeks. Notably, the addition of battery-operated zero-turn mower from Greenworks strengthens our position as the zero-turn headquarters with our market-leading assortment from Toro, Bad Boy and Cub Cadet. This past Saturday, we hosted a Try Before You Buy event at our stores that allowed our customers an opportunity to test drive our market-leading assortment and the various models in our stores. Chick Days are always an exciting time in store and something that our customers look forward to with the change of seasons to spring. We sell millions of birds each year. And this year, we've expanded our breed options as well as widened our coop, feed and care assortment. This is a great example of a home setting category for our new millennial customer who's adopting the Out Here lifestyle. And importantly, our store teams have the knowledge to help a customer in the category, whether they are a novice or an expert. We have a leading lineup of top selling, highest quality tools that are relative to our customers. Last week, we announced the addition of Dremel and Bosch to our power tool lineup just in time for spring. As mentioned on several previous calls, a key component of Project Fusion is an expansion of our assortment in truck, tool and hardware. Our lineup and tools now include Makita, DeWalt, PORTER-CABLE exclusively, Bosch and Dremel. We are much more of a destination now for our customers in this category. And as an aside, we're also on track to have Project Fusion implemented in nearly 30% of our stores by year-end. To wrap up, the Tractor Supply team continues to thrive through the dynamic macroeconomic environment while making incredible progress for laying the foundation for the future. Tractor Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over numerous different types of business cycles. With significant growth and market share opportunities ahead of us, it's an exciting time to be at Tractor Supply. My thanks and appreciation go off to the team for their dedication to living our mission and values every day. And now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Hey Scot. Good morning. And thanks for joining our call. I appreciate the question. I'd start out just at the highest level. Consumer's very healthy. As Kurt mentioned, we exceeded our expectations in Q1, and kind of a few nuances on that. Where we -- in the business where we're lapping the stimulus from last year, notably in big ticket, we saw some follow-up there, but it was very much in line with what we expected and what we had foreshadowed at our enhanced earnings event, when we talked about some pressure from big ticket dominantly in the last part of Q1 and early part of Q2. As Kurt mentioned and I mentioned also in the prepared remarks, we've seen a little bit of a slow start to spring, but it's been in the categories you would expect, and spring always comes. We've had it -- play out in many different ways over the last couple of decades on spring, but otherwise, really seeing no elasticity in the customer. And I'd point to our C.U.E. business as an indication to that, it's comped 3 times our overall comp rate, dry dog food above 20% comps. In fact, the month of March was our highest dollar volume ever in dry dog food. If I just step back, we serve a lifestyle. It's a demand-driven need-based kind product categories for the most part and have a track record of consistency and resiliency really across all different types of economic cycles. And in addition to that track record of consistency in the demand-driven business model, two additional factors going for us now. One are the continued kind of macro tailwinds, things like world revitalization and pet adoption that I mentioned earlier, and then also our Life Out Here strategy. And with 175 garden centers, and by the end of the year, 30% of our -- nearly 30% of our stores remodel with Fusion. We just got -- we've got a lot of tailwinds right now. And as it relates to the consumer, we've really not seen much reaction to inflation or any other kind of economic elements. As far as the impact on inflation, to your second point of your question, I'd kind of point to Kurt's comments in his prepared remarks around we did exceed our expectations in Q1. Just given the -- our historic convention of sticking to the half and also just given the macro environment, we thought it was prudent to reiterate our guidance. But certainly, if you roll through the beat in the first quarter, it would take you towards the high end of our guidance for the year. And then, if we were to exceed performance for the rest of the year, we'd end up having a -- and continue to do that. We'd end up having a nice year. I do think inflation continues to be persistent. And we continue to see it come through, and we continue to be able to navigate it very effectively. Yes. Hey, Michael, it's Hal. And I'm going to take the first -- the second part of your question first on housing and then have Seth talk a little bit about spring. On housing, we don't have as much of a direct correlation to new home starts and existing home sales, like other segments of retail. That said, one of the trends we have been benefiting from is the notion of home setting and people investing in their homes and in their land and also rural revitalization as well as we've had kind a shift out of urban and even sub-urban areas into ex-urban and rural. I think all the data sets still suggest that those trends are continuing. Even if you look at the existing home sales and new home sales, which have come up the last few days, while there were some year-over-year reductions, still very strong absolute numbers, and then if you look at the amount of housing stock that were short in the United States, I think you're going to continue to see very strong absolute numbers for many years -- many quarters and years to come. And I think you're going to see more of that outside of the cities, and we'll continue to benefit from that. Most of our customers own their land, own their homes, and they've seen home and land depreciation, particularly out of rural, which has had outsized gains versus urban. They're benefiting from that. There's been a bit of a wealth effect. So, certainly feel like that home stetting trend and that rural revitalization trend are still very strong macroeconomic tailwinds for us. On spring, as Kurt mentioned, we've had a -- spring has been slow to start, but we are very excited about our spring plans. Inventory is in a great spot, marketing and merchandising, our prime, C.U.E. is driving footsteps. And I'm going to turn it over to Seth to talk a little bit about some of our spring plans in more detail. Good morning, Steven, and thanks for joining our call. If we step back and just talk about the macroeconomic environment, what we're seeing is very consistent with what we're all reading in the headlines every day. I'll start with persistent inflation. We had the CPI of 8.5% in the month of March, that we've seen 0.5 point increases a month for the last handful of months. It's tough to say if we're at peak inflation, the way I think about it is that we're seeing persistent inflation. And I think we will see, strong inflation, not only through this year, but in the next year. As it relates to the economy, so far, the consumer has shown real strength and their ability to kind of navigate the inflation. And I think you're hearing that today in our earnings call, but also hearing it in many other earnings calls that have come out over the last week, and there's a variety of reasons for that. I mean, you've had strong wage growth across the country. You've got $2 trillion plus of pent-up savings that people are starting to tap into now, and you can see that in savings rate. You do see a little bit of credit card usage up. But I think if you dig into that what we're seeing is people using their credit cards and then tapping into their savings to pay those down with default rates not yet moving up. I think, the consumer's navigating this very well. And I think any talk of recession at this point is premature. And stepping back, if you look at our business, we've had 30 straight years of positive comp transactions. We've had 30 straight years of net sales growth, 29 of the last 30, we've had positive comp sales growth. This is a business that has been able to navigate all types of economic cycles, whether it was the recession in \u201820, the recession in 2007, \u201808, \u201809, whether it was COVID, just a couple of years ago. All those sorts of scenarios, this business has been incredibly resilient, stable and consistent through. And as I mentioned earlier, there's a number of macroeconomic tailwinds that are really benefiting us that I think even accentuate the stability of our business. And then combine that with our Life Out Here strategy, which is just an indicative of just the next leg of growth for our company. And 40 years ago, we doubled down in animal fee, 20 years ago, we doubled down in pet food. Now, we're doubling down in live goods combined with our Fusion remodel. We've never had more customers shopping Tractor Supply. We've never had a stronger digital business at Tractor Supply. Our business is incredibly strong right now. And we are very much excited about the business from a short-term perspective and long-term. Thanks for joining our call and for the question. On inflation in our enhanced earnings, we mentioned that our assumption was around 4% for the year, but that if anything, we saw a potential for upside to that. And that's very much what we saw in the quarter. And we're not providing kind of an update on that 4% number today, but I would say that potential for upside there still remains. Kind of my comment to an earlier question around inflation being persistent, I do think it will continue through the balance of the year and run at 4% or higher. On the traffic, we were very pleased with the traffic in the quarter that we had, and it exceeded our expectations. To your point on two- and three-year stacks, it was either in line or above sequentially and with our previous quarters. And in particular, if you think about the stimulus benefits from last year, but certainly, the spring differences, the weather differences in the month of March, we were very pleased with how our comp transactions ran. And we've never had more customers shopping Tractor Supply than we have on a rolling 12 basis. We've done an excellent job of maintaining the tens of millions of new customers that have shopped us over the last two years. Our active customer file is incredibly strong. Our Neighbor's Club membership program, members have never been higher. The participation, active participation in the Neighbor's Club program has never been higher. So, we feel really good about our customer trajectory, our transaction trajectory within those customers and our customers kind of navigating inflation in our business kind of in a demand-driven need-based type environment. Yes. I think, to clarify, I think what we're trying to articulate there was there's a variety of scenarios that could play out for the balance of the year. And one of those could be that inflation continues to run high. And if so, that might drive some different behavior in customer shopping patterns, notably that they might consolidate trips more. And if they do that, what we might see is a higher basket size with slightly lower transactions. And we just -- we're saying, look, that's one scenario that could play out and still very much within the context of our guidance. And then, the same thing on the margin profile side, kind of the point is more around if inflation still runs high, we might see a little bit more pressure than what we had guided on gross margin rates, still excellent margin rate performance, but we see a little bit less pressure on SG&A because our fixed costs would be running on higher sales dollars and that would still deliver us the operating margin rate in the -- in line -- in the range of our guidance. And we're very pleased with our operating margin performance in the first quarter. We really, as Kurt mentioned, exceeded our expectations across all core metrics, traffic, sales and operating margin and EPS. Good morning. And thanks for the question, Michael. I'd say, probably three things on that to kind of break big ticket up a bit. There are -- we saw fall-off in big ticket sales directly attributable to stimulus, very much in line with what we expected. And those were in non-seasonal categories dominantly, things like gun safes. In the seasonal businesses, big ticket, as Seth mentioned, where we've seen the spring weather break, we've seen excellent results in things like riders and grills, bigger ticket items. And then, as it relates to inflation, we certainly are seeing inflation in those categories, like we're seeing across the board. But I would say that we're also pleased with our unit movement in those categories, not just sales driven by inflation. So, overall, we continue to be -- feel very confident in our business short term and long term, inclusive of big ticket. And we're excited about the rest of the year. Yes. Hey Steven, thanks for the question. And we have all been on the road a lot recently, making sure it's a core tenant of Tractor Supply's mission and values and our culture. And I think our team is in great shape. John Ordus and our field organization have just done a fantastic job in hiring. We're nearly 47,000 team members now, done an excellent job managing attrition. We've -- our FAST team continues to roll out to more stores in terms of kind of dedicated FAST team members. We're rolling out new productivity programs, as John outlined in our last earnings call. If you walk our stores right now, they've never been in better shape. They -- we've got great service in our stores right now. Product is well-organized and on the shelves. We've got -- they're very clean and orderly. We've got really all of the assembly done across Grills and all across riders, and we are ready for spring, ready for the second quarter. And then, in terms of engagement, our store -- we had our engagement survey towards the end of last year. Our store team member engagement was at an all-time high. As I mentioned earlier, we're doing an excellent job managing attrition and -- our team members are really the glue of our company. And we pride ourselves on the customer service that we deliver inside of our stores. And I think we're only continuing to make progress on that even at an already high level. And I think it's going to be a big benefit to us as we move into -- as we are in the second quarter now. Yes. Hey Chuck, how are you? And thank you for joining the call today. On C.U.E., I would attribute our strong growth to taking share. As we talked about in our enhanced earnings event, on a two-year stack, our total sales grew 52% relative to the market at 25%, which meant we grew -- outgrew the market by 27 points, significant share gain. And that is -- we're the market leader in animal feed. We're one of the market leaders in pet food and we are gaining significant share in both of those categories. It's attributable to our business model, our customer service, our Life Out Here strategy, and so we're -- that's one of the reasons we're just really excited about C.U.E. and the footsteps that's driving into our stores and the setup that has for us for the balance of the year."

            "name": "Seth Estep",
            "content": "Yes. Hey. Thanks, Hal. Thanks, Mike, for the question. Hey, first and foremost, as Hal mentioned, obviously, a little bit of delay here to the start of spring. But as we've seen the weather starts to break off the southern most areas the last couple of weeks, we are very encouraged with seeing our game plan come to life. First and foremost, I would just say, I was in Texas last week and visited several garden centers. And I would tell you, both our customers and our team members could not be more excited about us really going deeper into live goods and gardening, which we know it has been historically the number one category. So, we were not first in top of mind for them and becoming more of that top of mind, and we are seeing very good positive results, particularly in those garden center stores and being set up for 175 plus as we enter spring here. But it's also not just about live goods, right? We believe we have the best-in-class zero-turn lineup that's out there. We spoke a little bit about big ticket at the end of Q1. But what I would tell you is where we're seeing weather break. We're seeing very strong demand across the entire zero-turn lineup, both in brands and price point. We're -- our consumer responding with that merchandising. And we've spoken some obviously about Greenworks Pro and that exclusive partnership that we have this year. That's a new real category that we haven't been able to attack in years past that we know that we can go and take market share. A couple of other quick things we think about spring and where we're excited to drive the business. It's not just about lawn and garden at Tractor Supply, but it's also about home setting. Chick Days is off to a great start, whether be through new coops or these through new breeds, things of that nature, really, really strong demand that we're seeing our consumer respond to and then just continue to dive into our C.U.E. related businesses and introducing newness across the four walls. So, excited about spring and what we have here in front of us and the plan coming to life."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. The Tractor Supply team has started fiscal 2022 with strong performance that came in ahead of our expectations. On a two-year stack, our comparable store sales were 43.8%. Looking at the cadence of the quarter, January and February were the strongest months with March positive, albeit not at the rate earlier in the quarter. We benefited from cold weather trends early in the quarter, while spring is late to break across most of the country. Please keep in mind, we were comping ideal weather conditions in the first quarter of last year with an early spring across many of our markets. This quarter, retail price inflation contributed about 10 points to our comparable store sales as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. As we shared with you last quarter, we anticipated this would be the toughest compare on transactions as we cycled the largest transaction gain since the beginning of the pandemic in Q1 of last year of 21%. To illustrate, we were experiencing positive comp transactions until we cycled the last two weeks of the quarter where we clearly saw the benefits of stimulus on transactions in the prior year. As we expected, big ticket declined given the robust performance we were cycling, driven by stimulus and the early starts of the spring selling season. Last year, as we reported, big ticket comps significantly outperformed the chain average comps. And on a two-year stack, our big ticket performance exceeded the 43.8% comp growth of the chain. We continue to see strong C.U.E. performance with strength in categories such as dry dog food, poultry, feed and heating fuel. For instance, dry dog food achieved over a 20% comp. Petsense performed above the company average, which was in line with our pet performance. Overall, we were very pleased with our top line performance. Turning now to gross margin, which outperformed our expectations. For the first quarter, our gross margin declined by 29 basis points to 34.9% of sales. The decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to three factors: significant product cost inflation; higher transportation costs; and to a lesser extent, product mix. We continue to experience broad-based inflation while also seeing a step-up during the quarter in key commodities such as grains and oil. Domestic and import freight costs have increased substantially year-over-year as well as fuel costs. We expect many of these trends in product cost and freight to continue throughout 2022. The robust growth in our C.U.E. categories, which have a lower gross profit rate did put some pressure on gross margin. The team did a remarkable job of managing these cost increases through our price management actions and other margin driving initiatives. Examples include capturing efficiencies in the supply chain to reduce miles, continuing to limit promotions and leaning into the more efficient value provided through Neighbor's Club. SG&A, including depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was 26.9%, an improvement of 11 basis points. This improvement was primarily attributable to the normalization of incentive compensation, moderation of COVID-19 response costs and leverage in occupancy and other costs from the increase in comparable store sales. These items were partially offset by investments in store wages and incremental costs related to our Life Out Here strategic investments for growth. This includes a step-up in our depreciation and amortization. Please also keep in mind, given our results last year, we were cycling strong SG&A leverage, which benefited from 38.6% comp sales in the first quarter of 2021. Net income was $187 million, and diluted EPS was $1.65 compared to $1.55 in the first quarter of 2021. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. Last quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 77% from $0.52 a share to $0.92. During the quarter, we returned $400 million to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. Turning now to our balance sheet, which remains strong and provides us the ability to invest in our business for the long term. Merchandise inventories were $2.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of about 21% in average inventory per store. This increase is primarily attributable to inflation, along with our investment in inventory to support the growing demand. Moving now to our guidance for 2022, which is unchanged. As Hal mentioned earlier, we are reconfirming our guidance for the year. This includes net sales in the range of $13.6 billion to $13.8 billion with comparable store sales growth of 3% to 4.5%. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 10.1% to 10.3% of sales. We continue to expect diluted EPS in a range of $9.20 to $9.50. We acknowledge that we beat our own expectations for the first quarter and that ongoing inflation should benefit our top line. With the dynamic macro environment as a backdrop, we believe it's prudent to maintain our outlook for the year. Keep in mind, Q1 is our smallest quarter of the year, and it's great to start out the year ahead of our expectations. We recognize that flowing the first quarter performance through may put pressure towards the top end of our guidance ranges. For those of you who've followed us for some time, this is not a new convention to guidance and is in line with how we provided guidance historically prior to the pandemic. We continue to believe the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the halves of the year. With as much inflation pressures we're seeing in our business, we are closely watching comparable average ticket and transactions. We anticipate that the breakdown of growth may be a bit different than our prior expectations, given the high level of inflation benefiting average ticket with transactions seeing incremental pressure. Historically, we've experienced trip consolidation by consumers during strong inflationary times. As inflation pressures persist, it puts higher pressure on gross margin, yet provides an offsetting benefit to SG&A leverage. As such, we're maintaining our expectations on our operating margin. As a reminder, the prospective acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home is not included in our guidance. In summary, -- we are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and our outlook for 2022. The team is executing at a very high level. We remain committed to investing in the business to retain the loyalty of our longtime and newer customers. Our goals are to maintain our everyday low prices and improve customer service, strengthen our supply chain and grow our digital commerce, all in support of our commitment to drive strong shareholder returns for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Hal. Yes. Simeon, hey, this is Kurt. I'll hit both of those questions. If I understood the question, your first question generally is around needs discretionary versus a needs-based business, which we're predominantly, and then really more of a -- how do you reconcile and how do you manage the cost, the operating margin throughout the rest of the year. Our business continues to be strong in a needs-based, demand-driven versus the discretionary. And as you've heard from us in the past, while there is some less needs-based discretionary, the discretionary piece of our business is fairly consistently been a low percentage, roughly like 15% of our business, we'd attribute to those more discretionary pieces of it. And as Hal just mentioned, some of those areas we -- as we expected and saw lifts last year with stimulus, we expected and saw some of that trade-off in the back end of Q1. In regards to our outlook for the year and how we really manage the margins, we expect our gross margin as inflation persists to have some level of pressure on the business. We're going to see pressure from those three primary categories: product inflation; the supply chain costs; and even considering the strength of C.U.E. as we continue to take market share, puts a little bit of pressure from mix. But, as we manage through this, we really see the opportunity to take both levers of gross margin and SG&A. And in each quarter could be a bit different as inflation puts pressure on gross margin. We also do see the opportunity for that to help us leverage in SG&A. And in the first half of the year, where inflation year-over-year has more of an impact and not as much stronger compares, where at the back half of the year, we're really starting to see inflation tick up. You could see as you did in Q1, stronger inflation, but we have opportunity to leverage on SG&A. And that's how we're going to view this business. We're going to manage this as we have the last couple of years through a number of different scenarios, and we do see a scenario where there's higher inflation. And we've got the levers to be able to manage gross margin and SG&A, and it could differ by quarters, but that's what gives us the confidence to be able to land the target for the year of 10.1% to 10.3% on the operating margin. Yes, Kate. Hey. Good morning. This is Kurt. In regards to your question on the guide, let me give you a couple of perspectives really how we see the business and how we look at it going forward. First, I'll just reiterate what Hal and I've said. We're coming off of Q1 a great start to the year where there's a strong performance hitting on all metrics. And just to point out, Q1 on a two-year stack basis, from the strength in new customers, the strength in Neighbor's Club, our transaction toward the highest two-year stack of any of the four quarters. So, the core of the business is strong and healthy. That said, as I just mentioned earlier, it is right and consistent even in the last two years, we're managing the business in multiple scenarios. So, to your point in your question, there are various scenarios. And if under one scenario, there's inflation that drives the comps outside of even the initial expectations, with that inflation, it puts pressure on margins, the leverage and SG&A. We certainly see that with inflation. It could impact some of the transactions. We've trip consolidation. We've seen customers begin to change in their spending patterns with the inflation. But, that's not necessarily negative for us as we benefit in ticket and that can help us leverage our SG&A. And so, the number of various scenarios that we see playing out, we feel very comfortable that in the next three quarters as we manage that, that we can still meet our expectations and our guidance and very confident in the demand of the business and the strength right now going into the rest of the year. Yes, Brian. Hey, good morning. This is Kurt. So, the two questions, one in regards to some of the puts and takes in regards to our -- in comparison to our expectations on Q1; and then, the other one is some of the geo market areas such as oil industry et cetera. So, let me take both of those. In the quarter, in Q1, weather from a perspective compared to last year, flattish to slightly modestly unfavorable. The point there is, last year we pointed, we had such an early start to the spring, and March is the biggest month that we saw 400 basis points last year in Q1 for weather and we pointed that out. This year, we had early start to the quarter with good cold weather in January that we benefited from, but then we had the offset. So, weather was neutralish from a perspective. Really some of the strengths came in how well C.U.E. performed and our ability to continue to capture market share. So, weather wasn't necessarily beyond -- significantly beyond our expectations. We plan that there could be a scenario that we would not see as much early start to the spring. I hope that helps on that. In regards to some of the various micro economies, all that, the two key ones that are asked a lot about oil industry, farm economy. In summary, I'd say right now, it's still too early to tell. We are not seeing any meaningful shift in those markets that indicate anything. And I'll illustrate why on some of that. First, we don't view some of the rise in commodities or oil necessarily as a negative in those industries, but yes, really more of a potential favorable tailwind in the business. Right now, the oil industry is a bit patient, lagging some of the growth and increase in the oil prices. The farm economy takes some time farmers to get product out of the ground. Farmers are faced with higher input costs right now. So, I think it's a matter of something to watch. Overall, those markets are very healthy and consistent with all other markets. We'll watch it closely, but we're certainly ready and prepared to support those industries if and when we begin to see specific lifts because of that. Yes. Thanks for the questions, two of them there. I'll just reiterate what Hal and I have talked about in regards to the comp performance and how that plays out for the year. Certainly, as we exceeded our expectation or coming off of strong Q1 performance, as you roll that through the year. And we'll continue to say as we have the last two years, we are managing this business through multiple scenarios. You could have comp sales at the high end of our guidance range. It's one quarter into the year as we see the rest of the year. We've got good momentum in the business. And so, as you play that out, we recognize that as you flow this through, this could be towards the high end of our guidance range. And as we've even indicated, it's early to predict on levels of inflation, but as inflation persists, it even puts upward pressure on that. And at this point, the best we can do is tell you how we view the business and how we're managing that. And then, in regards to our new store openings, I'll start by saying we are -- we have no concerns in regards to opening of new stores. We have confidence in our ability to hit our 70 to 80 stores this year. We've got a solid track record of opening 70, 80 stores. Our process is solid. Our pipeline for new stores is really strong right now. And construction is not exempt from some of the challenges of supply chain, labor, et cetera. We put a lot of effort and to complete the 80 stores in the fourth quarter. And some of those scenarios that push stores out, we saw some in Q1 as well. And as those stores have been pushed out of Q1-- by the way, Q1 is our -- typically our smallest quarter of new stores. Those stores will open up in Q2, Q3. We still have a real strong pipeline and expect to hit our targets this year for new stores."

In 2023, Tractor Supply celebrated our milestone 85th anniversary. Over 85 years, Tractor Supply has been a growth company with a clear purpose to help our customers live Life Out Here. Since 1938, we've operated in all types of economic conditions, embraced innovation and adapted to changing times. We've elevated the farm and ranch channel, bringing the sophistication of other retail categories to improve the shopping journey and ensure we have scalable platforms. Tractor Supply's needs-based, demand-driven business model has stood the test of time. No doubt this past year has proved challenging, more top feature than we expected with the beginning of the year with unfavorable weather, rising interest rates and inflation impacting consumer spending habits, but we believe these headwinds are temporary. We continue to invest for growth in 2023, and gain market share along the way, especially in companion animal and livestock feed. I think the opening video was a great recap of the highlights of the team's significant accomplishments across Tractor Supply in the year and over the last few years. As I reflect on 2023, our Tractor Supply team has navigated so much together, working with commitment and resilience to serve our customers and our communities, and our team has proven their ability to be unrelenting and executing against the macro and other headwinds, while also building our future. I sincerely thank them for living our mission and values. In 2023, we faced the well-documented macro headwinds that weighed on consumer goods spending, particularly discretionary goods, as well as unfavorable weather impacts every quarter on our business. While we've made progress over the years to deseasonalize our business, we will always be the reliable supplier for our customers for their seasonal needs like heating fuel and fertilizer. We estimate that adverse weather conditions negatively impacted our comp sales by approximately 200 basis points for the full year, including the lapping of the late December winter storm in 2022. Personal consumption expenditures saw strong mid single-digit growth in 2023. That said, spending on goods as a percent of PCE declined nearly a point as consumers continue to shift spending on services back to pre-COVID levels. In particular, this affected our big ticket business, which represents a little over 10% of our sales and had a negative 6% comp for the year. Despite the headwinds we faced, we remain committed to our journey of transforming Tractor Supply. Since introducing our Life Out Here strategy in October of 2020, we have dramatically transformed Tractor Supply. Over this time, we've invested nearly $2.5 billion in capital spending with about 80% of that spend targeted for growth initiatives as part of our Life Out Here strategy. This includes new and remodeled stores new distribution centers, upgrading our technology infrastructure and several other strategic investments. We've also significantly improved our operating capabilities, including relaunching our Neighbor's Club program, creating our field activity support team, expanding our mobile footprint and delivering on the increased volume of consumable, usable and edible products. Additionally, our average store volume continues to far exceed pre-pandemic levels, going from $4.5 million to $6.5 million annually per store. Approximately 40% of our stores are in the Project Fusion layout, allowing us to drive improved space productivity. We continue to see a mid single-digit comp lift benefit in the first year from our Fusion remodel. We will enter the spring of 2024 with more than 450 garden centers that are also driving space productivity, while allowing us to enter into new categories that resonate with our customers' hobbies for gardening and their needs for outdoor products. Stores with our garden centers are attracting new customers at a faster pace than the rest of the chain. Additionally, our garden center stores are providing a multiyear comp benefit. Our distribution centers achieved a record year of productivity. The opening of our Novar [ph], Ohio DC in January 2023 allowed us to unlock savings across our network with the largest rebalancing of our stores ever. This provided us with substantial stem mile savings, while also allowing for significantly improved service to our stores. Also importantly, our supply chain team member attrition reduced materially as we implemented a new progressive wage scale. And no doubt, these investments are resonating with our customers, as we have achieved record high customer satisfaction scores throughout the year. As always, our store managers were critical to the success and importantly, we achieved a near all-time low of 12% attrition in this group. Overall, our customer base remains healthy and highly engaged. Now let's go through some of the specific highlights to the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. For the year, we achieved record sales of $14.6 billion. Our comp store sales were even with the prior year and diluted earnings per share were $10.09. This comes on top of record performance over the last three years. We continue to have solid market share gains across our major product categories. And our digital business reached another year of record sales, topping over $1 billion annually for the first time. Since launch, we have had over 7 million downloads of our mobile app and over 2 million in the year. For the fourth quarter, our comparable store sales declined 4.2%. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS was $2.28 with operating profit margin expansion of 16 basis points. For the second consecutive year, we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. Strategically, the transformation of our real estate model enabled by a number of new capabilities that are designed to deliver material benefit to both revenue growth and operating margin reinforces our long-term guidance. In 2023, we raised our new store growth target. We now believe there's a 3,000 store opportunity domestically for Tractor Supply. This is supported by our total addressable market of more than $180 billion, our robust growth and our ongoing market share gains. Our new target represents an increase of 200 stores from our previous target of 2,800. We also implemented new capabilities to enable own development of new store builds. This capability is expected to generate significant construction cost savings and allow for lower rents in these applicable stores once we sell them post construction. Our real estate capabilities are a compelling addition to our Life Out Here strategy that will further solidify our growth for many years to come. In 2023, the cadence of new store openings returned to a more normalized rate. We opened 70 new Tractor Supply stores in 13 Petsense stores in 2023. The team has done a great job opening highly productive new stores as this remains a core strength and competency for Tractor Supply. During the year, we successfully converted the 81 Orscheln stores acquired in 2022 to the Tractor Supply brand, representing essentially a year's worth of new store growth. We're very pleased with the opportunity to drive both top line and bottom line performance of these locations closer to our standard run rates over time. Total customer count increased 1%. As we had positive growth in active customers and new reactivated customers. Neighbor's Club added more than 4 million new customers and represented 77% of our sales for the year, our highest mark to date. Neighbor's Club is successfully helping us migrate customers to a higher threshold of spending with us. During the year, we reached a new record for the number of high-value customers. Overall, our best customers are shopping us more frequently, and spending more money per transaction. Last year's re-branding a Petsense to Petsense by Tractor Supply, along with our expansion of our Neighbor's Club program to Petsense, is also resonating with our customers. This expansion is allowing us to deepen relationships with existing customers and help attract new Out Here pet customers to both banners. Our customers' response to these initiatives is very encouraging with Neighbor's Club membership already representing nearly 70% of sales at Petsense with continued momentum. The Petsense shopper is also cross shopping at Tractor Supply at an impressive rate of 47%. Petsense is also helping us gain share across pet specialty as we approach $225 million in sales and our 200 store milestone in the Petsense brand. For the year, our financial services offering of our private label credit card, together with our co-branded credit card outpaced our overall sales with strong growth. Our penetration increased from last year's record level and is now in the high single digits in overall sales. Our supply chain continues to be a competitive advantage for us. During the year, we opened up our ninth distribution center in Novar, Ohio and broke ground on our tenth distribution center in Mall mill, Arkansas. These were investments were to enable the higher volumes of our existing stores, the continued build-out of our new stores as well as the acquisition of Orscheln. These investments in our DC network are complemented by our 15 mixing centers that are there for high-velocity replenishment items. In 2023, we moved nearly \u00a38.5 billion of consumable, usable and edible products through our supply chain as we are the largest seller of packed feeding food for livestock and companion animals in the United States. Our scale and reach provides us with the cost to serve that is lower than our farm and ranch competition and any other competitor in these markets. As we executed the third year of our Life Out Here long-term strategy, 2023 was a year that we made significant progress. We plan to continue building on that progress in 2024. Most of what you'll hear from us today, we'll sell all that different from the playbook we've used for the last two to three years but that's intentional as we continue to be pleased with the benefits and financial returns of our strategic investments. As I've shared many times, our biggest challenge is prioritizing the plethora of growth opportunities we have ahead of us. And we anticipate 2024 to be a continued story of ongoing share gains offset by macro headwinds. With this in mind, we've taken a cautious approach to our 2024 financial outlook with it being below our long-term target. We remain confident in our long-term targets and expect to return to them when macro conditions return to neutral. Our underlying assumptions start with consumers continuing to be judicious and they're spending on good. Additionally, we anticipate average ticket to be pressured as we lap inflation. We're assuming market share gains that are supported by our strategic initiatives will continue. Housing, oil, agriculture and weather are anticipated to be neutral factors in our guidance. Collectively, all these factors are considered to help us provide the guidance range that Kurt will share with you more later on. Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. We are the leader in a large, fragmented market. We're a needs-based business that is tailored to our Out Here lifestyle. Our customers have a passion for the Out Here lifestyle and over-index as homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. We live our mission and values and our culture defines our relationship with our customers. As we begin the year, we take great pride in our path and are equally excited about our future. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. I want to start by reiterating Hal's comments on 2023 and our confidence in the long-term opportunities for Tractor Supply. Over my 2.5 decades in this business, I've never seen a year where we've had many transitory headwinds as we did in 2023 that did not break positively at some point during the year. Before I get into my review of the quarter, I wanted to address two items. First, for comparability purposes, please keep in mind, 2022 had a 53rd fiscal week that provided a net sales benefit of $225 million to the prior year fourth quarter, representing about 5.6 percentage points of our net sales decline this quarter. On a full year basis, it negatively impacted net sales by 1.6 percentage points. In addition, diluted EPS in 2022 benefited by $0.16 for the quarter and the year from the 53rd week. Second, overall, the unseasonably warm winter weighed on our results in the fourth quarter. We estimate the impact to be approximately 400 basis points of pressure on our comp sales performance. We knew this was going to be the most challenging quarter of the year, given our strong comp performance of 8.6% in the prior year as we were cycling the late December 2022 winter storm that provided a 200 basis point comp benefit to the fourth quarter of last year. The majority of the pressure was in transactions, given the needs-based nature of our business and it impacted our seasonal categories across Q and other winter goods. Our Q business in the fourth quarter has a higher mix of cold weather seasonal products such as wood pellets, bulk propane, bird feed and pine savings for bedding. From the cadence of the quarter to our product categories, seasonal impacts always play into our performance. Coming into the fourth quarter, we anticipated it would work against us and the quarter played out much like we expected. Factoring in the seasonal impact from the weather, our fourth quarter performance was very much in line with our run rate from last quarter. Most of my remaining commentary of our comp sales performance is on a normalized basis, adjusting for the impact of weather. October and November were very similar in comp sales performance, with December seeing the biggest comp sales decline as we were lapping the winter storm from last year. On a normalized basis, all months performed relatively consistent with a slight decline in comp sales. Turning to our product categories. We continue to see solid performance in Q with above chain average comps, essentially flat for the quarter. On a normalized basis, Q had a positive comparable sales as we continue to gain share. Discretionary categories performed in line with our expectations with a mid single-digit comp sales decline. Big ticket performance showed a continued improvement over the trends of the previous five quarters. Comparable big ticket sales ran slightly negative for the quarter and were positive in the low single digits on a normalized basis. Although our business is not primarily driven by holiday sales in Q4, we were encouraged by our performance during the holiday season, including recording our highest sales day of all time on the day after Thanksgiving and strong performance in the week leading up to Christmas. As we have experienced all year, we saw a continued slowdown in retail price inflation throughout the year, with Q4 experiencing a slight net deflation. We have successfully managed through deflation in various commodities throughout 2023, and believe we are nearing the trough now. In 2023, raw material inputs rolled over as evidenced by the 35% decline in corn from its most recent high in 2022 and currently running about 15% above the historical average. As we exit 2023, these types of feedstock declines are already reflected in our retail prices. Structural inflationary factors such as higher wage rates, transportation costs and other overhead items are all still supporting higher product costs. Moving on to gross margin. For the fourth quarter, our trend of strong gross margin performance continued with a year-over-year improvement of 129 basis points to 35.3% of sales. Our gross margin expansion was led by improvements in the supply chain from lower transportation rates and efficiencies in our network, including opening a new DC. We continue to benefit from our commitment to everyday low prices, and disciplined product cost management. While our promotional activity was modestly greater than the prior year, we were able to strategically provide great value for our customers while maintaining our gross margin. These favorable drivers were partially offset by an unfavorable product mix shift due to a higher mix of Q and a lower mix of high-margin seasonal categories. As a percent of that sales, SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 113 basis points year-over-year to 26.2%. This increase was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of our new DC, along with some lost fixed cost leverage due to the decline in comparable store sales. Additionally, higher medical claims also contributed to the increase in SG&A, although to a lesser extent than last quarter. The SG&A deleverage was partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation and the benefits of the sale-leaseback program initiated last quarter. In Q4, we sold five Tractor Supply stores, which contributed a 40 basis point benefit to SG&A. Operating margin improved 16 basis points for the quarter to 9.1%. Excluding the cycling of the 53rd week, diluted EPS of $2.28 was essentially flat with the prior year. Our new store pipeline continues to be strong. Our new store sales and profitability numbers continue to outperform historical averages. Given the addition of the Orscheln stores to our non-comp sales numbers, the new store productivity metric for the organic new Tractor Supply stores is cloudy in our external reporting. By our calculations, TSC new store productivity in 2023 was about 67% of our mature store average. Average sales in year one of a new store have increased more than 40% compared to 2019, in line with the performance of the chain. Our stores continue to be profitable in year one, cash flow positive at about the same point and have a payback in two to three years. Our new store economics unlock sustainable growth and solidify our lead in the channel. Strong new store economics are a hallmark of Tractor Supply. As I reflect back on 2023, I continue to be encouraged by the resiliency of our business and the structural nature of it. Now let's move to our outlook for 2024. Hal shared how we are thinking about the macro backdrop for the coming year. We are anticipating a gradual slowdown with the lingering question of do we have a soft landing or if the risk of a harder recession remains. With this in mind, we have taken a cautious approach to our 2024 financial outlook and have forecasted our comparable sales performance below our long-term algorithm. Navigating economic cycles is in our DNA. We have successfully managed through diverse market conditions, including periods of inflation to disinflation and even deflation. Our deep understanding of these dynamics allows us to proactively adapt to the market conditions. We expect average unit retails to be neutral to a modest headwind for the near term, as we anticipate stickiness to input costs such as labor wage rates and other items to mitigate any further reversion in commodity pricing. For fiscal 2024, we are forecasting net sales of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion. Comparable store sales are anticipated to be in the range of down a modest 1% to an increase of 1.5%. We are cautiously optimistic that big ticket trends will revert to positive for the full year as we are cycling 18 months of declines. We expect gross margin expansion of about 40 to 60 basis points from continued supply chain efficiencies, benefits from effective cost management and a moderation of the mix impact of Q. We anticipate the gross margin expansion to be offset by SG&A deleverage due to a couple of primary factors. First, depreciation and amortization is anticipated to increase in the mid-teens. While this is an improvement from recent underlying growth as our investments in our strategic growth initiatives moderate, we will deleverage as D&A grows faster than sales. Second, we plan to open our tenth distribution center in the second quarter. As a reminder, the operating cost for the new DC are reflected in SG&A, while the supply chain benefits are reflected in gross margin. Our DC network is expected to pressure SG&A by approximately 10 to 15 basis points. The benefit in gross margin will not completely offset this pressure since it takes time for the new facility to fully ramp to maturity and realize the supply chain benefits. As a result, we expect modest pressure on our operating margin from the opening of this new DC. These two primary factors are partially offset by the lapping of some higher-than-normal medical benefits in 2023. We do not expect those to reoccur due to our proactive changes to our benefit programs. In 2024, we will continue our planned strategic sale-leaseback program to sell some of our existing owned stores. We anticipate these sales will occur in the second half of the year on a similar cadence to 2023 and with a similar EPS contribution. We continue to forecast these strategic sale leasebacks to be ongoing for the next 7 to 10 years. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.7% to 10.1%. We are forecasting interest expense of approximately $50 million to $55 million. We plan to maintain a healthy leverage ratio of approximately two times, and we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.7% to 23.0%. Diluted EPS is forecast in a range of $9.85 to $10.50. Net capital expenditures are forecast to be $625 million to $700 million or about 4% to 4.5% of sales. This net amount reflects the anticipated proceeds for the sale of existing and newly developed Tractor Supply stores. Gross capital expenditures are forecast to be in the range of $850 million to $925 million. Our capital plans reflect a ramp in our new store openings to approximately 80 Tractor Supply stores. We anticipate opening 10 to 15 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in 2024. Our new store pipeline continues to be solid, and we expect store opening cadence B in line with 2024. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2024, we anticipate share repurchases in a range of $575 million to $625 million which is estimated to have a benefit of a net reduction in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 2%. Now I'd like to walk through a few items to consider for the calendarization of our expectations. As always, we believe the best way to look at our business is in halves and not quarters due to the nature of our business. We expect comp sales for each of the quarters to be in a relatively tight range, consistent with our overall 2024 guidance. We are planning for positive comp transactions for the year. As to earnings, we expect our EPS growth to be slightly more favorable in the first half as opposed to the second half. There are a few factors that will impact operating margins in certain quarters. We anticipate the tailwinds of lower transportation costs to benefit our results through the second quarter and begin to flatten year-over-year starting in Q3. As a result, gross margin expansion for the first half of the year is anticipated to be near the high end of our annual guidance range, while the second half may be near the low end of the range. In regards to SG&A, the second and third quarters will be pressured from the start-up costs for the new distribution center, while the supply chain benefits will not begin to be realized in gross margin until late in the third quarter. Please keep in mind, we will be lapping an $0.08 per share benefit from the depreciation change in the third quarter of last year. Considering each of these factors, the third quarter will be our toughest earnings comparison as we anticipate a decline in operating margin and EPS due to the combination of these factors. As a reminder, the Orscheln stores will be added to the comp store calculation beginning in the second quarter with a tiered approach as we cycle the timing of moving these stores to our point-of-sale systems and rebranding of stores to Tractor Supply. Specific to the first quarter, we had a challenging first quarter last year as it was abnormally warm in January and February and relatively cold March. We were also benefiting from retail price inflation in the high single-digits. Given the recent Arctic cold temperatures across most of the regions, we are seeing good momentum as we start the first quarter. Overall, we are anticipating positive comp sales for the first quarter. To wrap up, we have clearly defined strategic priorities and are investing to capture the long-term opportunities in our market. We are committed to driving productivity and making appropriate trade-offs to fuel our investments while we protect our operating profit margins and earnings. We intend to maintain this focused approach through 2024. We are committed to continuously striving for stronger results. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thank you, Kurt. Now I'd like to update you on our progress on our Life Out Here strategy and share more about the exciting plans we have in place for the spring season. Tractor Supply continues to build on our competitive advantages. And arguably, the company is as strong as it's ever been. This is backed up by several proof points. We continue to gain market share across our major product categories and our customer metrics remain incredibly healthy with strong spending and retention with our best customers. Our strategic priorities are clearly resonating with our customers. We continue to see strength in our brand equity metrics, continue to grow our brand consideration and our unaided awareness. These strong customer trends are attributed to the team. The team is executing at a high level and is extremely engaged. In 2023, our turnover improved at every level across the company as we're committed to being an employer of choice in rural America. With customer satisfaction scores at an all-time high, the team is passionate about their work, and we're energized to capitalize on our growth investments to provide our customers with legendary service. Our strong culture has always been a part of our secret sauce. The team has dialed in and determined to build on our long track record of success. Our Life Out Here strategy is on point. Our strategic initiatives in Project Fusion, Garden Centers, Neighbor's Club and Digital are working and they are driving results. In 2024, we anticipate that our Project Fusion layout will be in about 50% of our store base by year-end. This layout is clearly driving improved comp sales force as we're leveraging category insights to determine space allocation and drive productivity. For instance, in the companion animal categories, we're seeing that the Fusion layouts are contributing to strong growth. We're able to have an expanded SKU offering and larger stack out. This layout is also seeing the highest quartile of customer satisfaction scores and attracting new customers at a faster rate. 2024 will be the year of the Garden Center for us. We will leverage the change of seasons across the storefront as the year shifts to spring. We will continue to build out about 150 garden centers across both new stores and sidelight transformations this year. As we look to leverage our learnings from our garden centers, we will implement a new live goods center prototype in many of these locations. This new prototype requires about half of the capital investment of a traditional garden center that we've been building over the last few years and allows us to maximize the value creation of a sideline in lower volume stores and in markets where the season is less extensive and thus allowing us to achieve the ROIs that we target. Additionally, the new prototype in many ways, makes it easier for our stores to operate from a staffing standpoint and the maintenance costs are lower. With more broadly than ever and a grower network to support our garden centers, we're excited about the benefit of these initiatives in 2024 and the continued opportunity to serve our customers. Now turning to our Neighbor's Club. We have significant plans in place to capitalize on this strategic asset. Our loyalty program has the scale and scope to continue to drive meaningful results. As we enter the third year since the move to a point-based rewards program, our members can expect more personalized offers, new tiers and more meaningful rewards. These compelling enhancements are designed to drive transactions and engagement, all while migrating customers upwards. Moving on to our digital business. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to accelerate our growth, between our website and our mobile app, we have more visitors online now than we do in our stores. These digital assets are essentially the front door to Tractor Supply. We'll be focused this year on improving our digital customer experience and capability as we look to accelerate conversion rate. Just as the trip to a Tractor Supply store is highly differentiated, we'll be doubling down to ensure the shopping experience on our website and our mobile app has that same level of differentiation as we shop across our destination categories. We are looking to mirror our in-store legendary service and the digital experience through personalized and conversational commerce. We will leverage AI technologies to improve search, redesign our checkout, introduce a new refreshed homepage focusing on personalization that leverages our robust Neighbor's Club data. As our customer base continues to skew younger, these improvements will be key to unlocking future growth. Our strategic priorities are resonating with our customers and driving strong returns. As the calendar shifts now and we start to turn to spring, it's an exciting time to be in our stores and online. In 2024, our merchant teams will be as diligent as ever to be our customers' purchasing agent with a sharp focus on value and innovation. We're committed to everyday low price, and we simply will not be beyond value. Our customers can trust Tractor Supply to be the dependable supplier for their lifestyle. Our merchandising strategies are focused to drive profitable sales and market share. Across product categories, we will have more innovation this year that I believe we will have seen collectively over the last three years. We have a number of new and exclusive product launches, including the introduction of the Toro HAVOC Zero-Turn Mower, the expansion of YETI and Solo Stove to more stores, and a test of Martha Stewart and Eddie Bauer, a limited rollout of Priefert cattle fencing, and a limited rollout of Weber Grill, a relaunch of MuttNation from Miranda Lambert, and the addition of Triumph Equine Feed, and that's just to name a few of the new innovations that we're bringing to our customers, and they'll be able to find in-store and online. Let me share a few more highlights that you can see in our stores as you get out there. Tractor Supply has long been a destination for zero-turn mowers with a Cub Kid ad and Bad Boy brand. The Toro Havoc addition will continue to reinforce that positioning. Outside of Toro's dealer network Toro HAVOC is exclusive to Tractor Supply with a sharp price point. This is a unique and differentiated platform in just in time for the spring season. In big ticket, our entire trail assortment over the $1,000 price point is unique and exclusive to Tractor Supply. Across specifications and features, our trailer offerings are designed to support our customers' lifestyle. Across our categories, we have a long history of test and learn, and we're excited about the expansion of several recent programs. After a very successful rollout to our Project Fusion stores, YETI will be expanded to nearly half of the chain by Q2 and rolled out to the balance of the chain by year-end. Another great example is Solo Stove, a high-quality outdoor wood burning fire pit that is a perfect fit for the outdoor enthusiasts in our customers. Given our customers' response to this product, we'll be expanding the top-selling SKUs of Solo Stove to more than 1,500 stores with the complete offering available online. Weber Grills is another leading brand that we're excited to pilot in 2024 after growing significantly our grills business over the last three years. The introduction of Weber positions us to expand our Grill lineup and continue to grow our market share in this rapidly growing category. Weber has long been one of America's leading barbecue grill brands and their products are highly complementary to our existing offering of Pit Box, Even Ambers and Blackstone Griddle. We're also excited about the newness being introduced in companion animal in the first quarter. First up is the relaunch of our MuttNation partnership with Miranda Lambert. Tractor Supply is the pet wellness destination out here, and we're introducing market-leading new brands like Native Pet and expanding our 4health exclusive brand supplement assortment, and our continued pursuit of taking market share, we're introducing new national brands also across cat food. We have new brands like Triumph, Equine feed and a continued focus on organic feeds across our large animal and poultry categories. And we're also expanding our deer wildlife sets to support our customers' hobby of cultivating feeding and watching their deer. We will continue to leverage our strong portfolio of exclusive brands to grow market share and offer great value. For instance, we're launching Groundwork's Bag Garden and Potting Soil at compelling price points to the leading national brands, and we'll be introducing Blue Mountain Tech with performance fabrication to appeal to our millennial customers. These are just two examples of the strong pipeline we have for newness in our exclusive brands, which represent nearly 30% of our sales. And finally, it wouldn't be spring at Tractor Supply without the launch of our annual Chick Days. The arrival of Chicks at our stores is a sure sign of spring and creates strong retail theater in our stores. Our Chick Days event is shaping up to be the largest ever for. Poultry now rivals livestock and equine in size of our business. Recent trends have supported growth from existing customers, coupled with robust growth from new customers in the category and this is driving both trips and ticket to our stores. One exciting aspect of the new customers of the poultry category is that they're gravitating to our new unique offering of premium breeds and organic feed products for their chicks. We're introducing impeccable a new exclusive brand at Chick Day with a poultry starter kit, poultry treats and even chick toys. Chick Days is a great gateway for our new customers to explore Tractor Supply and we use this as a resource for all things related to home setting beyond poultry to expand them to categories like gardening. I hope you get a chance to experience the event in our stores. To wrap up, our customers continue to trust us for everything they need to care for their pets and animals, tend to their homes, farms and land, enjoy the great outdoors and generally just the live life out here. That purpose serving those who live life out here, drive meaning in what we do each day. Our future remains as bright as it ever has been. Thank you to our team members for your dedication at Tractor Supply and passion for serving our customers and to our customers for trusting us as your go-to supplier for life out here and to our 2,400 communities across Tractor Supply and Petsense for embracing us as part of the fabric of the communities we call home. Over time and over various cycles, I stand by the best three words to describe Tractor Supply are consistent, reliable and sustainable. These attributes allow us to be an earnings growth compounder on both the top line and bottom line. Here's to the next 85 years of serving life out here. And with that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. Starting with Q4, it sounds like October, November trends were a touch better than that down 4% comp. But December stepped down and January step back up. So just considering all the variability over the past couple of months, can you help us understand just the underlying run rate for the business, where you think it is today and what you think the path is back to the long-term growth algo. And then specifically, how are you thinking about the contribution of the internal drivers like lawn and garden and Neighbor's Club in 2024?\nKurt Barton: Hey, Zach, this is Kurt. Good morning. In regards to the comp sales performance, I'll point back to some of the things I mentioned on our prepared remarks. For the fourth quarter, the best way to look at it is start with the backdrop that when we look at the seasonal performance, the challenge is about an extremely mild fourth quarter going up against an Arctic storm of last year, there's 400 basis points of pressure. October and November were unseasonably warm as well. So you've got negative low single-digits generally consistent when you normalize for the December storm across all of the months. And all of that principally in the weather-related categories that I pointed out on the call. So as I mentioned, the fourth quarter ran consistently with the trend rates of the third quarter. Our consumable or needs-based business continues to be running solid, especially the year-round non-seasonal-related categories, the strength in all of our feed and food, the confidence that we have comes from examples such as livestock feed, equine feed, poultry feed, wildlife supplies, cat and dog running unit positive comps in the fourth quarter. Some of that up against the last year pantry filling that happens in the last week of the year against that storm. So you could see the traffic that we get from the consumables, the stability of the core of our business running really strong. So we still have that and care that confidence that our customers are shopping us just as consistent as they were before. We have growth in active customers, Neighbor's Club contributing more. All of those are the drivers of the consistency of the business.\nZach Fadem: Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nChris Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. So I guess a two-parter. So first, as you think about not putting weather into 2024 is a potential benefit, can you talk through that? Is that because you look at it, the headwind in 2023 as more of a lap? Or is it just -- you're just trying to be prudent in your outlook? And a second follow-up is we get a lot of questions about the competitive encroachment from the big box guys. So could you talk about what you're seeing in terms of where those competitors have rolled out and expanded farm and ranch assortment? Thank you.\nHal Lawton: Hey, Chris, thanks for joining the call this morning. Yeah, on weather, I think as we reflect on last year, we had a lot of discussion on weather times felt like we're playing meteorologists. And I think we just decided to be prudent as we look at this year, not look at whether it's potential upside or downside as we called out, there's a number of other factors that could also influence our sales as the year progresses whether that be the agriculture market, oil, housing, et cetera. And instead, we just chose to focus on for the purposes of our guidance and range of outcomes this year, really the factors that we think are going to have the most influence on our sales as we can see it right now, which are our continued market share gains, offsetting the shift still in consumer spending from goods to services, as well as disinflation, which is dominantly a first half issue. And then as it relates to competitive encouragement, I'd say we really haven't seen anything different in competitive activity for the foreseeable past. So it's been really, for the last -- since COVID, the competitive activity has been pretty stable, pretty rational. Our share gains continue to -- we continue to take share in the market, and really haven't seen anything out of the ordinary from a competitive perspective, whether that be in our farm and ranch -- core farm and ranch competitors or the multitude of other national retailers that we compete against as well.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nKate McShane: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Our question centered around SG&A. We just wondered if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about wage growth in 2024, and how does incentive comp come into play in 2024? What happened regarding incentive comp in 2023, given the flat comp for the year? And how should we think about that.\nKurt Barton: Yeah. Hey, Kate, this is Kurt. I'll take those. On wage rate growth, we are anticipating wage rate growth, slightly above the historical average is pre-pandemic. It varies across different areas of the business. But I'd center around a 3% to 4% range wage rate growth. We continue to see strong, solid workforce, unemployment continues to be low. Our culture, our teams continue to have all the success with hiring, but it's appropriate to anticipate that you'd be at that level of wage rate growth. In regards to incentive compensation, we're incentivized at all levels of the organization. In 2023, our performance from top and bottom line did underperform our original expectations. And so there was some modest leverage in 2023. So if you look at 2024, what's factored into our guidance into our SG&A is some normalization of incentive comp gives a modest 10 or 15 basis point deleverage, but that's all considered in the guidance that I gave.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJason Haas: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I'm curious, if you could comment on your expectation for new store productivity in 2024. And based on the math that we could do it, it looks like it's maybe going to be like around 60% or so. I know sometimes the math can be fuzzy from our perspective. So can you just talk about what's expected there? And if there's any reason why the initial productivity would be lower in 2024? Thanks.\nKurt Barton: Yeah, Jason, this is Kurt. I'll answer that question. On my prepared remarks, I was very specific on that on what is really driving our new store productivity. So I want to point everyone back to that. We continue to see the Tractor Supply consistent, strong new store productivity. 2023 ran at 67% new store productivity. The 80 stores that we plan for 2024 are expected to be coming out the gates very consistent in the same way and our new store maturation process of a four to five year 65% to 70% new store productivity is where we target and we expect 2024 with the strong pipeline that we've got, we believe an excited -- just as we have in 2023 about what these new stores will produce.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is now open.\nPeter Benedict: Hi, guys. Good morning. I guess, Kurt, maybe a question for you. As we think about the EBIT margin and how it toggles within your guidance range, roughly speaking, about 15 basis points up or down per point of comp move. If you guys -- if you think we see a scenario where your comps are either below the low end of your guide range or they come in above the high end of the range, any sense for how the incrementals or decrementals would look. Anything we should think about there is 15 basis points a good benchmark? Or just curious kind of your thoughts on that. Thank you.\nKurt Barton: Yes. I'll give you a couple of points, Peter, on that. First, we've considered the micro strategic drivers, the macro favorable or unfavorable pressures for this year. We've given a guidance range, albeit slightly larger on the top and bottom line than we historically have that recognizes we're in a time of uncertainty. And so we believe all of those scenarios, any plausible, reasonable scenarios have been factored into our guidance. So we don't see likelihood outside of the downside of the guidance that we've given. That said, inside the guidance range, even outside of the guidance range, I'd point that the EBIT margin movement within sales range is not linear. And there's a number of factors, certainly with the level of gross margin or what might be a factor that's driving the low end of the range. A deflationary environment, for example, gives us upside on margin rate. So I would not point to any linear and even outside of the range when you start considering incentive comp and other things, it's not linear as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is now open.\nScot Ciccarelli: Hi, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Can you help quantify the comp lift that you're baking into your model from your Garden Centers this year? I think you mentioned you have about 40% penetration now, and we know that the spring selling season was largely wiped out in 2023 and probably even 2022. And maybe any other color on the performance of the Garden Centers as that program matures? Thanks.\nKurt Barton: Yes, sure. Why don't I start with that, Scot, on the comp, and then I'll toss it to set a little bit on the performance of Garden Centers, some of the 2024 drivers, et cetera. Our expectation and how we've modeled in our long-term targets is still the same as our expectations for 2024. As we continue to add Garden Centers roughly 150 to 200 of those a year. And you get from Fusion and Garden Center mid-single-digit to high single-digit on combo lift as those mature in year one and then a lower benefit in like year two, but still a benefit over the chain, that roughly plays into our algorithm, and we would anticipate for this year to play similar to that the Fusion Garden Center initiative is driving -- give or take some roughly one point of comp in our guidance range. And Neighbor's Club is another initiative that's driving consumers to spend up the tiers, more transactions, getting more of their share of wallet is another driver. So just kind of pointing out the two biggest strategic initiative drivers, and then I'll toss it over to Seth, maybe to talk a little bit about what's driving the garden centers.\nSeth Estep: Yes. Thanks, Kurt. Thanks, Scot, for the question. Scot, first, I'll just start with as we think about our garden center initiative, just the size of the addressable market there is over $20 billion. And as we know, it's a place where our customers participated, where they didn't necessarily look at us as their first and primary destination for those categories, and we believe we have significant share opportunities as we look at the lawn and garden segment. Over the course of the last three years, as Kurt has mentioned, we have really been focused on driving scale to build out our grower base and then build to the 450-plus garden centers where we'll be entering spring, which we really believe this is the year that the team is really going to be able to drive some sales. As we go into spring with those 450, I mean, obviously, we're focused on winning those spring categories as well as building out both fall and our winter seasonal related areas to make sure that we can leverage and maximize that footprint. Not just in the spring season, but also in the 12 months of the year. So, very excited about the work that the team has been doing, very excited about the size of the prize there, and I think this is the year which really all going to come together. We built scale and how those programs are going to be hitting stores.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. Your line is now open.\nChuck Grom: Hey thanks very much. Happy New Year guys. Now that you've completed the Orscheln conversions, I guess I'm curious your outlook on sales productivity and margins of these locations. And I guess now that they're in the set, how does that compare to the legacy Tractor Supply stores? And when we look at 2024 and '25, how do we think about the sales maturation curve and the benefit to comps from those stores? Thanks.\nKurt Barton: Yes, Chuck, this is Kurt. The Orscheln conversion went very well. All stores converted, as we mentioned, to the Tractor Supply brand. The first six to nine months of -- since the acquisition was a transition, a lot of noise through that. We now have them all branded Tractor Supply. The team is engaged. We've got the Tractor Supply products and services, our Tractor Supply, feed and food brands. And when we begin to cycle that in second quarter where we converted all over we do anticipate to see much like a new store maturation, perhaps we'll learn it in a similar type maturation curve, but we anticipate and have baked into our guidance some new store maturation type comp benefit from those 81 stores as well. And how it compares? We anticipate these markets from our real estate study that there is upside to the historical performance in those stores to be able to run in line with Tractor Supply averages. Albeit we've said it's very much in line with like a Midwest tractor supply average, which is a bit below the overall tractor supply average store level. So there's room to have these grow over time. And we're excited about our ability to capture new customers, bring them into Tractor Supply in these stores. And so overall, for 2024, even into 2025, we believe much like a new store, there's a benefit from the maturation.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open.\nMichael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. What if you assumed for input cost relief in 2024, especially key variables like transportation costs and commodity costs? And then how does that inform your view of the gross margin outlook for this year? Because it seems like the gross margin has been expanding significantly in part because of this relief? And is there a risk that at some point, Tractor Supply could invite more competition as its gross margin is about 150 basis points higher than it was in 2019? Thank you so much.\nHal Lawton: Hey, Michael, good morning. Two things I'll hit on this. First is the long-term structural nature of our gross margin, and then I'll speak to the assumptions implied in 2024. On the long-term structural nature, there's two big shifts that I want to remind folks about that really have transferred rate out of gross margin and expense out of gross margin and into SG&A. The first one of those is our field activity support team. As we've mentioned, it's nearly a 1,800-person team that where the expense falls in our SG&A, but the offsetting support provided by our vendors falls in gross margin. As we've talked about that several times in the past, that's roughly in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 basis points of shift. Secondly, I would call out the continued transformation of our supply chain. From 2018 to 2023, our stem miles have reduced by 20%. And that basically means a truck going from a DC to a store. And so the impact of that is reduced freight cost on a like-for-like volume and rate basis versus, say, 2018, but there's obviously operating costs embedded in our G&A to run the two DCs we've opened since then and the 11 mixing centers that we've opened since then. That is a benefit of roughly 60 to 70 basis points of the delta there. So when you add the fast difference and you add the supply chain difference kind of, call it, 75% of the gross margin difference that you quoted that 150 basis points is structural in nature and really a shift from SG&A to gross margin rate. Now looking forward, I would say the balance that you see there in gross margin rate, I would attribute to our scale. As we talked about, we're almost double the size of the business that we were in 2018 when I quoted those stem miles. And that's accorded us the ability to obviously manage and run the business more productively, whether that's in freight and our negotiations with our freight providers or whether that's getting credit for our scale with our primary COGS vendors. As it relates to this year, we do see continued benefit in the freight market, particularly in the first half of the year, and we've talked about that, particularly in the back half of last year and also in the first and second quarter some, but we do see continued freight benefit. Also, as we've talked about in Q3 and Q4, and we also mentioned in our prepared remarks, we have been working very closely with our vendors on cost and have been rolling that cost where we've seen commodity prices come down and other cost impacts moderate or reduce. We started that work, as we mentioned in past earnings calls, really in the summer time and the impact of those cost reductions are forecasted in our margin rate assumptions that Kurt laid out in his prepared remarks. The last thing I'll mention is just on competition. We are as priced strongly in the market right now as we've been ever. And we have a number of initiatives that we have in place to really make sure we stand for value in the marketplace on our key, kind of, value indicating SKUs out there and feel really good about our price position and don't see any encroachment from competition just the same competitive intensity that we've seen over the last few years.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. Your line is now open.\nSeth Basham: Good morning. My question is on the companion animal category. And if you could comment on the performance of that category in the fourth quarter were comps up or down. And then specific to cat and dog food, you mentioned positive unit comps. What about sales comps? And how are you seeing the consumer respond to inflation broadly in that category?\nSeth Estep: Hi, Seth, this is Seth. Relative to our companion animal business, we remain very excited about the opportunity that we have in companion animal and we've continued over the years to manage through multiple cycles and have a track record of this. What I'd say like relative to comp, companion animal continues to be a comp driver for us in both units as well as top line. When you look at trends in the industry, approximately for our customers, approximately 75% of our customers own a pet, and about half of those that own more than one pet. And so just structural to our customer base in general, it's an area that we are highly committed to. We believe you think about like our convenient locations, our team members, our omnichannel capabilities, our robust and differentiated assortments. We see those as all competitive advantages in the pet space, and we continue to take market share there. And we believe we have substantial market share opportunities ahead, both in 2024 and beyond with our existing customer base, as well as the new customers that are out there. So companion animal in general for us, it remains a healthy business, and it's something that we were confident in taking share in the years to come.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nPeter Keith: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just to touch base on deflation, Kurt, you said modest deflation. I'm wondering if you could actually just quantify that if we think if it's like down 1% as comp headwind, and then bigger picture, there are some concerns that deflation will take you guys back to the back half of like 2015 to 2017 where comps were sluggish for a longer period of time. Do you see any key differences from the economic backdrop today versus several years ago when we last saw deflation?\nKurt Barton: Yeah. Peter, I'll start with your first part of your question in regards to what our assumption is on a neutral deflation. Roughly neutral deflation for the year overall is what we see, give or take, I mean, give or take in our ranges, plus or minus one impact on retail AURs. As Hal mentioned, I think, in one of the other questions earlier, as we've rolled back off the peaks of 2022 throughout 2023 on a lot of the commodity deflation. A vast majority of that occurred throughout 2023 during these cycles. And these are fast turning SKUs in feed and food. So these -- these prices are already in our retail prices. First half of the year may have some exposure as a year-over-year lap on that. As we had slight net deflation in Q4, there could be and assumed in our guidance, some slight in the first half of the year. The second half of the year could be neutral or actually slightly positive. So we've considered each of those scenarios, but we really don't see a wide range in there. And I demonstrated that in regards to like corn, where it's 35% below the highs of 2022, and that happened throughout 2023. There's 10 or 15 points of difference between the pre-pandemic levels. And so there's really not much movement left in a commodity, and that commodity is a small percent ingredient in a small or a portion of our products that we offer. In comparison to 2015, it's all about what's structural. In 2015, we were coming off of years where oil prices, steel prices, grains were coming off of highs, and they completely flipped. In this case, the commodities hit the early peaks in 2021 and 2022 and all the structural nature, which is a bigger portion, such as wage rates, operating cost, et cetera, are really begin to get embedded in 2022 and 2023. And this structural. So I think it's a very different scenario. And there's limited risk that we see, if anything, it's a small level, and we believe adequately considered in our guidance.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisor Group. Your line is now open.\nJoe Feldman: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on something you said about big ticket. And you talked about you think big ticket should be positive in 2024. I was just curious, is that lapping in just the easier comparisons? Or is it more to do with your view that discretionary spending will pick up, consumer behavior will kind of shift towards that discretion bigger ticket category. Like what's driving, I guess, that confidence in having said that. Thanks.\nKurt Barton: Joe, this is Kurt. I'll quickly just affirm what our -- was assumed in our guidance and then let Seth give you the answer about why we're assuming that for 2024. But we do believe that big ticket should be in line with our overall guidance range for the year. That's as you see that, that's relatively flattish at the midpoint to slightly favorable. And we're going up against two consecutive years of negative big ticket comps. So it has a lot to do about the compares. And in 2022, we were coming off of all of the stimulus spending in 2023. There's a bit of a swing off of durable goods into services and some of the weather-related pressures. And in 2024, we're cycling that and we've got some great offers, some new innovations that I know Seth can speak to.\nSeth Estep: Yeah. Thanks, Kurt. Yeah, so as Hal mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've got a lot of newness and innovation coming, particularly in our big ticket categories, also as we lap some of the easier compares that Kurt just mentioned, whether it be the Toro havoc that's going to be exclusive to us that Hal mentioned, a whole new grill lineup that we continue to expand basically an exclusive lineup of trailers to Tractor Supply, where we are definitely a destination, safe. As we look ahead, we believe can be a driver for us and then finally, I'd just say as the team and as we mentioned in prepared remarks, our private label credit card that we've been able to lean into to drive some volume as it comes to big ticket has also been strong.\nHal Lawton: Broad-based, I'd just say, retail, in general, is rebounding some of the big ticket, and we could definitely see that as we approach kind of November and December.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Allisa, we'll take one more question. Time limit.\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Thanks. Can you guys hear me?\nKurt Barton: Yes.\nMichael Baker: Hello?\nKurt Barton: Yes, Michael.\nMichael Baker: I hate to ask the last question on a real short-term thing. But I am curious about the first quarter. You said, you expect all quarters to be within your range or consistent with the range or something along those lines. So that would mean at the high-end. And you said positive for 1Q, but that would mean about 1%. Is that reflective of what you're seeing in January? Or how much does that consider? I think the comparison gets a little bit harder in February, although I don't think March was very good last year either. So with all the weather we're all seeing in the country, I think a lot of people are assuming that January is a pretty strong month. I guess I'm just trying to gauge how strong relative to the implied guidance of maybe up 1%? Thanks.\nHal Lawton: Hey, Michael, it's Hal. Thanks for the question. I'd just say it's certainly, we saw some benefit from the weather in the first three weeks of January, really the second and third week, but January is our smallest month of the year, smallest month of the quarter. And the thing that the month that's really going to determine our comps for Q1 is going to be March. We are, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, very excited about our spring setup this year. We've got our most innovation in the last three or four years now that kind of the supply chain disruptions and all those things have been worked through. Our vendors have been able to really spend the last year getting their innovation pipeline restarted. Our in-stock rates and our spring sets are back to the expected 95% plus that we historically have set at, and we feel great about spring. We're optimistic about Q1, as Kurt said, we're certainly expecting a positive comp. We're off to a good start with the month of January behind us. But really, the most important thing that we're focused on is having a win in March.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Great. Well, Alissa, thank you. That will conclude our Q&A session. And I'm the Randall Day [ph], for anybody, please reach out for follow-up, and we look forward to talking to you on our Q1 earnings call at the end of April. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn, and thank you to everyone for joining our call this morning. In 2023, Tractor Supply celebrated our milestone 85th anniversary. Over 85 years, Tractor Supply has been a growth company with a clear purpose to help our customers live Life Out Here. Since 1938, we've operated in all types of economic conditions, embraced innovation and adapted to changing times. We've elevated the farm and ranch channel, bringing the sophistication of other retail categories to improve the shopping journey and ensure we have scalable platforms. Tractor Supply's needs-based, demand-driven business model has stood the test of time. No doubt this past year has proved challenging, more top feature than we expected with the beginning of the year with unfavorable weather, rising interest rates and inflation impacting consumer spending habits, but we believe these headwinds are temporary. We continue to invest for growth in 2023, and gain market share along the way, especially in companion animal and livestock feed. I think the opening video was a great recap of the highlights of the team's significant accomplishments across Tractor Supply in the year and over the last few years. As I reflect on 2023, our Tractor Supply team has navigated so much together, working with commitment and resilience to serve our customers and our communities, and our team has proven their ability to be unrelenting and executing against the macro and other headwinds, while also building our future. I sincerely thank them for living our mission and values. In 2023, we faced the well-documented macro headwinds that weighed on consumer goods spending, particularly discretionary goods, as well as unfavorable weather impacts every quarter on our business. While we've made progress over the years to deseasonalize our business, we will always be the reliable supplier for our customers for their seasonal needs like heating fuel and fertilizer. We estimate that adverse weather conditions negatively impacted our comp sales by approximately 200 basis points for the full year, including the lapping of the late December winter storm in 2022. Personal consumption expenditures saw strong mid single-digit growth in 2023. That said, spending on goods as a percent of PCE declined nearly a point as consumers continue to shift spending on services back to pre-COVID levels. In particular, this affected our big ticket business, which represents a little over 10% of our sales and had a negative 6% comp for the year. Despite the headwinds we faced, we remain committed to our journey of transforming Tractor Supply. Since introducing our Life Out Here strategy in October of 2020, we have dramatically transformed Tractor Supply. Over this time, we've invested nearly $2.5 billion in capital spending with about 80% of that spend targeted for growth initiatives as part of our Life Out Here strategy. This includes new and remodeled stores new distribution centers, upgrading our technology infrastructure and several other strategic investments. We've also significantly improved our operating capabilities, including relaunching our Neighbor's Club program, creating our field activity support team, expanding our mobile footprint and delivering on the increased volume of consumable, usable and edible products. Additionally, our average store volume continues to far exceed pre-pandemic levels, going from $4.5 million to $6.5 million annually per store. Approximately 40% of our stores are in the Project Fusion layout, allowing us to drive improved space productivity. We continue to see a mid single-digit comp lift benefit in the first year from our Fusion remodel. We will enter the spring of 2024 with more than 450 garden centers that are also driving space productivity, while allowing us to enter into new categories that resonate with our customers' hobbies for gardening and their needs for outdoor products. Stores with our garden centers are attracting new customers at a faster pace than the rest of the chain. Additionally, our garden center stores are providing a multiyear comp benefit. Our distribution centers achieved a record year of productivity. The opening of our Novar [ph], Ohio DC in January 2023 allowed us to unlock savings across our network with the largest rebalancing of our stores ever. This provided us with substantial stem mile savings, while also allowing for significantly improved service to our stores. Also importantly, our supply chain team member attrition reduced materially as we implemented a new progressive wage scale. And no doubt, these investments are resonating with our customers, as we have achieved record high customer satisfaction scores throughout the year. As always, our store managers were critical to the success and importantly, we achieved a near all-time low of 12% attrition in this group. Overall, our customer base remains healthy and highly engaged. Now let's go through some of the specific highlights to the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. For the year, we achieved record sales of $14.6 billion. Our comp store sales were even with the prior year and diluted earnings per share were $10.09. This comes on top of record performance over the last three years. We continue to have solid market share gains across our major product categories. And our digital business reached another year of record sales, topping over $1 billion annually for the first time. Since launch, we have had over 7 million downloads of our mobile app and over 2 million in the year. For the fourth quarter, our comparable store sales declined 4.2%. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS was $2.28 with operating profit margin expansion of 16 basis points. For the second consecutive year, we returned over $1 billion to our shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. Strategically, the transformation of our real estate model enabled by a number of new capabilities that are designed to deliver material benefit to both revenue growth and operating margin reinforces our long-term guidance. In 2023, we raised our new store growth target. We now believe there's a 3,000 store opportunity domestically for Tractor Supply. This is supported by our total addressable market of more than $180 billion, our robust growth and our ongoing market share gains. Our new target represents an increase of 200 stores from our previous target of 2,800. We also implemented new capabilities to enable own development of new store builds. This capability is expected to generate significant construction cost savings and allow for lower rents in these applicable stores once we sell them post construction. Our real estate capabilities are a compelling addition to our Life Out Here strategy that will further solidify our growth for many years to come. In 2023, the cadence of new store openings returned to a more normalized rate. We opened 70 new Tractor Supply stores in 13 Petsense stores in 2023. The team has done a great job opening highly productive new stores as this remains a core strength and competency for Tractor Supply. During the year, we successfully converted the 81 Orscheln stores acquired in 2022 to the Tractor Supply brand, representing essentially a year's worth of new store growth. We're very pleased with the opportunity to drive both top line and bottom line performance of these locations closer to our standard run rates over time. Total customer count increased 1%. As we had positive growth in active customers and new reactivated customers. Neighbor's Club added more than 4 million new customers and represented 77% of our sales for the year, our highest mark to date. Neighbor's Club is successfully helping us migrate customers to a higher threshold of spending with us. During the year, we reached a new record for the number of high-value customers. Overall, our best customers are shopping us more frequently, and spending more money per transaction. Last year's re-branding a Petsense to Petsense by Tractor Supply, along with our expansion of our Neighbor's Club program to Petsense, is also resonating with our customers. This expansion is allowing us to deepen relationships with existing customers and help attract new Out Here pet customers to both banners. Our customers' response to these initiatives is very encouraging with Neighbor's Club membership already representing nearly 70% of sales at Petsense with continued momentum. The Petsense shopper is also cross shopping at Tractor Supply at an impressive rate of 47%. Petsense is also helping us gain share across pet specialty as we approach $225 million in sales and our 200 store milestone in the Petsense brand. For the year, our financial services offering of our private label credit card, together with our co-branded credit card outpaced our overall sales with strong growth. Our penetration increased from last year's record level and is now in the high single digits in overall sales. Our supply chain continues to be a competitive advantage for us. During the year, we opened up our ninth distribution center in Novar, Ohio and broke ground on our tenth distribution center in Mall mill, Arkansas. These were investments were to enable the higher volumes of our existing stores, the continued build-out of our new stores as well as the acquisition of Orscheln. These investments in our DC network are complemented by our 15 mixing centers that are there for high-velocity replenishment items. In 2023, we moved nearly \u00a38.5 billion of consumable, usable and edible products through our supply chain as we are the largest seller of packed feeding food for livestock and companion animals in the United States. Our scale and reach provides us with the cost to serve that is lower than our farm and ranch competition and any other competitor in these markets. As we executed the third year of our Life Out Here long-term strategy, 2023 was a year that we made significant progress. We plan to continue building on that progress in 2024. Most of what you'll hear from us today, we'll sell all that different from the playbook we've used for the last two to three years but that's intentional as we continue to be pleased with the benefits and financial returns of our strategic investments. As I've shared many times, our biggest challenge is prioritizing the plethora of growth opportunities we have ahead of us. And we anticipate 2024 to be a continued story of ongoing share gains offset by macro headwinds. With this in mind, we've taken a cautious approach to our 2024 financial outlook with it being below our long-term target. We remain confident in our long-term targets and expect to return to them when macro conditions return to neutral. Our underlying assumptions start with consumers continuing to be judicious and they're spending on good. Additionally, we anticipate average ticket to be pressured as we lap inflation. We're assuming market share gains that are supported by our strategic initiatives will continue. Housing, oil, agriculture and weather are anticipated to be neutral factors in our guidance. Collectively, all these factors are considered to help us provide the guidance range that Kurt will share with you more later on. Tractor Supply is a unique, highly differentiated retailer. We are the leader in a large, fragmented market. We're a needs-based business that is tailored to our Out Here lifestyle. Our customers have a passion for the Out Here lifestyle and over-index as homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners. We live our mission and values and our culture defines our relationship with our customers. As we begin the year, we take great pride in our path and are equally excited about our future. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt. Thank you, Kurt. Now I'd like to update you on our progress on our Life Out Here strategy and share more about the exciting plans we have in place for the spring season. Tractor Supply continues to build on our competitive advantages. And arguably, the company is as strong as it's ever been. This is backed up by several proof points. We continue to gain market share across our major product categories and our customer metrics remain incredibly healthy with strong spending and retention with our best customers. Our strategic priorities are clearly resonating with our customers. We continue to see strength in our brand equity metrics, continue to grow our brand consideration and our unaided awareness. These strong customer trends are attributed to the team. The team is executing at a high level and is extremely engaged. In 2023, our turnover improved at every level across the company as we're committed to being an employer of choice in rural America. With customer satisfaction scores at an all-time high, the team is passionate about their work, and we're energized to capitalize on our growth investments to provide our customers with legendary service. Our strong culture has always been a part of our secret sauce. The team has dialed in and determined to build on our long track record of success. Our Life Out Here strategy is on point. Our strategic initiatives in Project Fusion, Garden Centers, Neighbor's Club and Digital are working and they are driving results. In 2024, we anticipate that our Project Fusion layout will be in about 50% of our store base by year-end. This layout is clearly driving improved comp sales force as we're leveraging category insights to determine space allocation and drive productivity. For instance, in the companion animal categories, we're seeing that the Fusion layouts are contributing to strong growth. We're able to have an expanded SKU offering and larger stack out. This layout is also seeing the highest quartile of customer satisfaction scores and attracting new customers at a faster rate. 2024 will be the year of the Garden Center for us. We will leverage the change of seasons across the storefront as the year shifts to spring. We will continue to build out about 150 garden centers across both new stores and sidelight transformations this year. As we look to leverage our learnings from our garden centers, we will implement a new live goods center prototype in many of these locations. This new prototype requires about half of the capital investment of a traditional garden center that we've been building over the last few years and allows us to maximize the value creation of a sideline in lower volume stores and in markets where the season is less extensive and thus allowing us to achieve the ROIs that we target. Additionally, the new prototype in many ways, makes it easier for our stores to operate from a staffing standpoint and the maintenance costs are lower. With more broadly than ever and a grower network to support our garden centers, we're excited about the benefit of these initiatives in 2024 and the continued opportunity to serve our customers. Now turning to our Neighbor's Club. We have significant plans in place to capitalize on this strategic asset. Our loyalty program has the scale and scope to continue to drive meaningful results. As we enter the third year since the move to a point-based rewards program, our members can expect more personalized offers, new tiers and more meaningful rewards. These compelling enhancements are designed to drive transactions and engagement, all while migrating customers upwards. Moving on to our digital business. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to accelerate our growth, between our website and our mobile app, we have more visitors online now than we do in our stores. These digital assets are essentially the front door to Tractor Supply. We'll be focused this year on improving our digital customer experience and capability as we look to accelerate conversion rate. Just as the trip to a Tractor Supply store is highly differentiated, we'll be doubling down to ensure the shopping experience on our website and our mobile app has that same level of differentiation as we shop across our destination categories. We are looking to mirror our in-store legendary service and the digital experience through personalized and conversational commerce. We will leverage AI technologies to improve search, redesign our checkout, introduce a new refreshed homepage focusing on personalization that leverages our robust Neighbor's Club data. As our customer base continues to skew younger, these improvements will be key to unlocking future growth. Our strategic priorities are resonating with our customers and driving strong returns. As the calendar shifts now and we start to turn to spring, it's an exciting time to be in our stores and online. In 2024, our merchant teams will be as diligent as ever to be our customers' purchasing agent with a sharp focus on value and innovation. We're committed to everyday low price, and we simply will not be beyond value. Our customers can trust Tractor Supply to be the dependable supplier for their lifestyle. Our merchandising strategies are focused to drive profitable sales and market share. Across product categories, we will have more innovation this year that I believe we will have seen collectively over the last three years. We have a number of new and exclusive product launches, including the introduction of the Toro HAVOC Zero-Turn Mower, the expansion of YETI and Solo Stove to more stores, and a test of Martha Stewart and Eddie Bauer, a limited rollout of Priefert cattle fencing, and a limited rollout of Weber Grill, a relaunch of MuttNation from Miranda Lambert, and the addition of Triumph Equine Feed, and that's just to name a few of the new innovations that we're bringing to our customers, and they'll be able to find in-store and online. Let me share a few more highlights that you can see in our stores as you get out there. Tractor Supply has long been a destination for zero-turn mowers with a Cub Kid ad and Bad Boy brand. The Toro Havoc addition will continue to reinforce that positioning. Outside of Toro's dealer network Toro HAVOC is exclusive to Tractor Supply with a sharp price point. This is a unique and differentiated platform in just in time for the spring season. In big ticket, our entire trail assortment over the $1,000 price point is unique and exclusive to Tractor Supply. Across specifications and features, our trailer offerings are designed to support our customers' lifestyle. Across our categories, we have a long history of test and learn, and we're excited about the expansion of several recent programs. After a very successful rollout to our Project Fusion stores, YETI will be expanded to nearly half of the chain by Q2 and rolled out to the balance of the chain by year-end. Another great example is Solo Stove, a high-quality outdoor wood burning fire pit that is a perfect fit for the outdoor enthusiasts in our customers. Given our customers' response to this product, we'll be expanding the top-selling SKUs of Solo Stove to more than 1,500 stores with the complete offering available online. Weber Grills is another leading brand that we're excited to pilot in 2024 after growing significantly our grills business over the last three years. The introduction of Weber positions us to expand our Grill lineup and continue to grow our market share in this rapidly growing category. Weber has long been one of America's leading barbecue grill brands and their products are highly complementary to our existing offering of Pit Box, Even Ambers and Blackstone Griddle. We're also excited about the newness being introduced in companion animal in the first quarter. First up is the relaunch of our MuttNation partnership with Miranda Lambert. Tractor Supply is the pet wellness destination out here, and we're introducing market-leading new brands like Native Pet and expanding our 4health exclusive brand supplement assortment, and our continued pursuit of taking market share, we're introducing new national brands also across cat food. We have new brands like Triumph, Equine feed and a continued focus on organic feeds across our large animal and poultry categories. And we're also expanding our deer wildlife sets to support our customers' hobby of cultivating feeding and watching their deer. We will continue to leverage our strong portfolio of exclusive brands to grow market share and offer great value. For instance, we're launching Groundwork's Bag Garden and Potting Soil at compelling price points to the leading national brands, and we'll be introducing Blue Mountain Tech with performance fabrication to appeal to our millennial customers. These are just two examples of the strong pipeline we have for newness in our exclusive brands, which represent nearly 30% of our sales. And finally, it wouldn't be spring at Tractor Supply without the launch of our annual Chick Days. The arrival of Chicks at our stores is a sure sign of spring and creates strong retail theater in our stores. Our Chick Days event is shaping up to be the largest ever for. Poultry now rivals livestock and equine in size of our business. Recent trends have supported growth from existing customers, coupled with robust growth from new customers in the category and this is driving both trips and ticket to our stores. One exciting aspect of the new customers of the poultry category is that they're gravitating to our new unique offering of premium breeds and organic feed products for their chicks. We're introducing impeccable a new exclusive brand at Chick Day with a poultry starter kit, poultry treats and even chick toys. Chick Days is a great gateway for our new customers to explore Tractor Supply and we use this as a resource for all things related to home setting beyond poultry to expand them to categories like gardening. I hope you get a chance to experience the event in our stores. To wrap up, our customers continue to trust us for everything they need to care for their pets and animals, tend to their homes, farms and land, enjoy the great outdoors and generally just the live life out here. That purpose serving those who live life out here, drive meaning in what we do each day. Our future remains as bright as it ever has been. Thank you to our team members for your dedication at Tractor Supply and passion for serving our customers and to our customers for trusting us as your go-to supplier for life out here and to our 2,400 communities across Tractor Supply and Petsense for embracing us as part of the fabric of the communities we call home. Over time and over various cycles, I stand by the best three words to describe Tractor Supply are consistent, reliable and sustainable. These attributes allow us to be an earnings growth compounder on both the top line and bottom line. Here's to the next 85 years of serving life out here. And with that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Hey, Chris, thanks for joining the call this morning. Yeah, on weather, I think as we reflect on last year, we had a lot of discussion on weather times felt like we're playing meteorologists. And I think we just decided to be prudent as we look at this year, not look at whether it's potential upside or downside as we called out, there's a number of other factors that could also influence our sales as the year progresses whether that be the agriculture market, oil, housing, et cetera. And instead, we just chose to focus on for the purposes of our guidance and range of outcomes this year, really the factors that we think are going to have the most influence on our sales as we can see it right now, which are our continued market share gains, offsetting the shift still in consumer spending from goods to services, as well as disinflation, which is dominantly a first half issue. And then as it relates to competitive encouragement, I'd say we really haven't seen anything different in competitive activity for the foreseeable past. So it's been really, for the last -- since COVID, the competitive activity has been pretty stable, pretty rational. Our share gains continue to -- we continue to take share in the market, and really haven't seen anything out of the ordinary from a competitive perspective, whether that be in our farm and ranch -- core farm and ranch competitors or the multitude of other national retailers that we compete against as well. Hey, Michael, good morning. Two things I'll hit on this. First is the long-term structural nature of our gross margin, and then I'll speak to the assumptions implied in 2024. On the long-term structural nature, there's two big shifts that I want to remind folks about that really have transferred rate out of gross margin and expense out of gross margin and into SG&A. The first one of those is our field activity support team. As we've mentioned, it's nearly a 1,800-person team that where the expense falls in our SG&A, but the offsetting support provided by our vendors falls in gross margin. As we've talked about that several times in the past, that's roughly in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 basis points of shift. Secondly, I would call out the continued transformation of our supply chain. From 2018 to 2023, our stem miles have reduced by 20%. And that basically means a truck going from a DC to a store. And so the impact of that is reduced freight cost on a like-for-like volume and rate basis versus, say, 2018, but there's obviously operating costs embedded in our G&A to run the two DCs we've opened since then and the 11 mixing centers that we've opened since then. That is a benefit of roughly 60 to 70 basis points of the delta there. So when you add the fast difference and you add the supply chain difference kind of, call it, 75% of the gross margin difference that you quoted that 150 basis points is structural in nature and really a shift from SG&A to gross margin rate. Now looking forward, I would say the balance that you see there in gross margin rate, I would attribute to our scale. As we talked about, we're almost double the size of the business that we were in 2018 when I quoted those stem miles. And that's accorded us the ability to obviously manage and run the business more productively, whether that's in freight and our negotiations with our freight providers or whether that's getting credit for our scale with our primary COGS vendors. As it relates to this year, we do see continued benefit in the freight market, particularly in the first half of the year, and we've talked about that, particularly in the back half of last year and also in the first and second quarter some, but we do see continued freight benefit. Also, as we've talked about in Q3 and Q4, and we also mentioned in our prepared remarks, we have been working very closely with our vendors on cost and have been rolling that cost where we've seen commodity prices come down and other cost impacts moderate or reduce. We started that work, as we mentioned in past earnings calls, really in the summer time and the impact of those cost reductions are forecasted in our margin rate assumptions that Kurt laid out in his prepared remarks. The last thing I'll mention is just on competition. We are as priced strongly in the market right now as we've been ever. And we have a number of initiatives that we have in place to really make sure we stand for value in the marketplace on our key, kind of, value indicating SKUs out there and feel really good about our price position and don't see any encroachment from competition just the same competitive intensity that we've seen over the last few years. Broad-based, I'd just say, retail, in general, is rebounding some of the big ticket, and we could definitely see that as we approach kind of November and December. Hey, Michael, it's Hal. Thanks for the question. I'd just say it's certainly, we saw some benefit from the weather in the first three weeks of January, really the second and third week, but January is our smallest month of the year, smallest month of the quarter. And the thing that the month that's really going to determine our comps for Q1 is going to be March. We are, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, very excited about our spring setup this year. We've got our most innovation in the last three or four years now that kind of the supply chain disruptions and all those things have been worked through. Our vendors have been able to really spend the last year getting their innovation pipeline restarted. Our in-stock rates and our spring sets are back to the expected 95% plus that we historically have set at, and we feel great about spring. We're optimistic about Q1, as Kurt said, we're certainly expecting a positive comp. We're off to a good start with the month of January behind us. But really, the most important thing that we're focused on is having a win in March."

            "name": "Seth Estep",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Kurt. Thanks, Scot, for the question. Scot, first, I'll just start with as we think about our garden center initiative, just the size of the addressable market there is over $20 billion. And as we know, it's a place where our customers participated, where they didn't necessarily look at us as their first and primary destination for those categories, and we believe we have significant share opportunities as we look at the lawn and garden segment. Over the course of the last three years, as Kurt has mentioned, we have really been focused on driving scale to build out our grower base and then build to the 450-plus garden centers where we'll be entering spring, which we really believe this is the year that the team is really going to be able to drive some sales. As we go into spring with those 450, I mean, obviously, we're focused on winning those spring categories as well as building out both fall and our winter seasonal related areas to make sure that we can leverage and maximize that footprint. Not just in the spring season, but also in the 12 months of the year. So, very excited about the work that the team has been doing, very excited about the size of the prize there, and I think this is the year which really all going to come together. We built scale and how those programs are going to be hitting stores. Hi, Seth, this is Seth. Relative to our companion animal business, we remain very excited about the opportunity that we have in companion animal and we've continued over the years to manage through multiple cycles and have a track record of this. What I'd say like relative to comp, companion animal continues to be a comp driver for us in both units as well as top line. When you look at trends in the industry, approximately for our customers, approximately 75% of our customers own a pet, and about half of those that own more than one pet. And so just structural to our customer base in general, it's an area that we are highly committed to. We believe you think about like our convenient locations, our team members, our omnichannel capabilities, our robust and differentiated assortments. We see those as all competitive advantages in the pet space, and we continue to take market share there. And we believe we have substantial market share opportunities ahead, both in 2024 and beyond with our existing customer base, as well as the new customers that are out there. So companion animal in general for us, it remains a healthy business, and it's something that we were confident in taking share in the years to come. Yeah. Thanks, Kurt. Yeah, so as Hal mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've got a lot of newness and innovation coming, particularly in our big ticket categories, also as we lap some of the easier compares that Kurt just mentioned, whether it be the Toro havoc that's going to be exclusive to us that Hal mentioned, a whole new grill lineup that we continue to expand basically an exclusive lineup of trailers to Tractor Supply, where we are definitely a destination, safe. As we look ahead, we believe can be a driver for us and then finally, I'd just say as the team and as we mentioned in prepared remarks, our private label credit card that we've been able to lean into to drive some volume as it comes to big ticket has also been strong."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. I want to start by reiterating Hal's comments on 2023 and our confidence in the long-term opportunities for Tractor Supply. Over my 2.5 decades in this business, I've never seen a year where we've had many transitory headwinds as we did in 2023 that did not break positively at some point during the year. Before I get into my review of the quarter, I wanted to address two items. First, for comparability purposes, please keep in mind, 2022 had a 53rd fiscal week that provided a net sales benefit of $225 million to the prior year fourth quarter, representing about 5.6 percentage points of our net sales decline this quarter. On a full year basis, it negatively impacted net sales by 1.6 percentage points. In addition, diluted EPS in 2022 benefited by $0.16 for the quarter and the year from the 53rd week. Second, overall, the unseasonably warm winter weighed on our results in the fourth quarter. We estimate the impact to be approximately 400 basis points of pressure on our comp sales performance. We knew this was going to be the most challenging quarter of the year, given our strong comp performance of 8.6% in the prior year as we were cycling the late December 2022 winter storm that provided a 200 basis point comp benefit to the fourth quarter of last year. The majority of the pressure was in transactions, given the needs-based nature of our business and it impacted our seasonal categories across Q and other winter goods. Our Q business in the fourth quarter has a higher mix of cold weather seasonal products such as wood pellets, bulk propane, bird feed and pine savings for bedding. From the cadence of the quarter to our product categories, seasonal impacts always play into our performance. Coming into the fourth quarter, we anticipated it would work against us and the quarter played out much like we expected. Factoring in the seasonal impact from the weather, our fourth quarter performance was very much in line with our run rate from last quarter. Most of my remaining commentary of our comp sales performance is on a normalized basis, adjusting for the impact of weather. October and November were very similar in comp sales performance, with December seeing the biggest comp sales decline as we were lapping the winter storm from last year. On a normalized basis, all months performed relatively consistent with a slight decline in comp sales. Turning to our product categories. We continue to see solid performance in Q with above chain average comps, essentially flat for the quarter. On a normalized basis, Q had a positive comparable sales as we continue to gain share. Discretionary categories performed in line with our expectations with a mid single-digit comp sales decline. Big ticket performance showed a continued improvement over the trends of the previous five quarters. Comparable big ticket sales ran slightly negative for the quarter and were positive in the low single digits on a normalized basis. Although our business is not primarily driven by holiday sales in Q4, we were encouraged by our performance during the holiday season, including recording our highest sales day of all time on the day after Thanksgiving and strong performance in the week leading up to Christmas. As we have experienced all year, we saw a continued slowdown in retail price inflation throughout the year, with Q4 experiencing a slight net deflation. We have successfully managed through deflation in various commodities throughout 2023, and believe we are nearing the trough now. In 2023, raw material inputs rolled over as evidenced by the 35% decline in corn from its most recent high in 2022 and currently running about 15% above the historical average. As we exit 2023, these types of feedstock declines are already reflected in our retail prices. Structural inflationary factors such as higher wage rates, transportation costs and other overhead items are all still supporting higher product costs. Moving on to gross margin. For the fourth quarter, our trend of strong gross margin performance continued with a year-over-year improvement of 129 basis points to 35.3% of sales. Our gross margin expansion was led by improvements in the supply chain from lower transportation rates and efficiencies in our network, including opening a new DC. We continue to benefit from our commitment to everyday low prices, and disciplined product cost management. While our promotional activity was modestly greater than the prior year, we were able to strategically provide great value for our customers while maintaining our gross margin. These favorable drivers were partially offset by an unfavorable product mix shift due to a higher mix of Q and a lower mix of high-margin seasonal categories. As a percent of that sales, SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 113 basis points year-over-year to 26.2%. This increase was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of our new DC, along with some lost fixed cost leverage due to the decline in comparable store sales. Additionally, higher medical claims also contributed to the increase in SG&A, although to a lesser extent than last quarter. The SG&A deleverage was partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation and the benefits of the sale-leaseback program initiated last quarter. In Q4, we sold five Tractor Supply stores, which contributed a 40 basis point benefit to SG&A. Operating margin improved 16 basis points for the quarter to 9.1%. Excluding the cycling of the 53rd week, diluted EPS of $2.28 was essentially flat with the prior year. Our new store pipeline continues to be strong. Our new store sales and profitability numbers continue to outperform historical averages. Given the addition of the Orscheln stores to our non-comp sales numbers, the new store productivity metric for the organic new Tractor Supply stores is cloudy in our external reporting. By our calculations, TSC new store productivity in 2023 was about 67% of our mature store average. Average sales in year one of a new store have increased more than 40% compared to 2019, in line with the performance of the chain. Our stores continue to be profitable in year one, cash flow positive at about the same point and have a payback in two to three years. Our new store economics unlock sustainable growth and solidify our lead in the channel. Strong new store economics are a hallmark of Tractor Supply. As I reflect back on 2023, I continue to be encouraged by the resiliency of our business and the structural nature of it. Now let's move to our outlook for 2024. Hal shared how we are thinking about the macro backdrop for the coming year. We are anticipating a gradual slowdown with the lingering question of do we have a soft landing or if the risk of a harder recession remains. With this in mind, we have taken a cautious approach to our 2024 financial outlook and have forecasted our comparable sales performance below our long-term algorithm. Navigating economic cycles is in our DNA. We have successfully managed through diverse market conditions, including periods of inflation to disinflation and even deflation. Our deep understanding of these dynamics allows us to proactively adapt to the market conditions. We expect average unit retails to be neutral to a modest headwind for the near term, as we anticipate stickiness to input costs such as labor wage rates and other items to mitigate any further reversion in commodity pricing. For fiscal 2024, we are forecasting net sales of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion. Comparable store sales are anticipated to be in the range of down a modest 1% to an increase of 1.5%. We are cautiously optimistic that big ticket trends will revert to positive for the full year as we are cycling 18 months of declines. We expect gross margin expansion of about 40 to 60 basis points from continued supply chain efficiencies, benefits from effective cost management and a moderation of the mix impact of Q. We anticipate the gross margin expansion to be offset by SG&A deleverage due to a couple of primary factors. First, depreciation and amortization is anticipated to increase in the mid-teens. While this is an improvement from recent underlying growth as our investments in our strategic growth initiatives moderate, we will deleverage as D&A grows faster than sales. Second, we plan to open our tenth distribution center in the second quarter. As a reminder, the operating cost for the new DC are reflected in SG&A, while the supply chain benefits are reflected in gross margin. Our DC network is expected to pressure SG&A by approximately 10 to 15 basis points. The benefit in gross margin will not completely offset this pressure since it takes time for the new facility to fully ramp to maturity and realize the supply chain benefits. As a result, we expect modest pressure on our operating margin from the opening of this new DC. These two primary factors are partially offset by the lapping of some higher-than-normal medical benefits in 2023. We do not expect those to reoccur due to our proactive changes to our benefit programs. In 2024, we will continue our planned strategic sale-leaseback program to sell some of our existing owned stores. We anticipate these sales will occur in the second half of the year on a similar cadence to 2023 and with a similar EPS contribution. We continue to forecast these strategic sale leasebacks to be ongoing for the next 7 to 10 years. For the year, we forecast an operating margin of 9.7% to 10.1%. We are forecasting interest expense of approximately $50 million to $55 million. We plan to maintain a healthy leverage ratio of approximately two times, and we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.7% to 23.0%. Diluted EPS is forecast in a range of $9.85 to $10.50. Net capital expenditures are forecast to be $625 million to $700 million or about 4% to 4.5% of sales. This net amount reflects the anticipated proceeds for the sale of existing and newly developed Tractor Supply stores. Gross capital expenditures are forecast to be in the range of $850 million to $925 million. Our capital plans reflect a ramp in our new store openings to approximately 80 Tractor Supply stores. We anticipate opening 10 to 15 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in 2024. Our new store pipeline continues to be solid, and we expect store opening cadence B in line with 2024. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders through the combination of a growing dividend and share repurchases. For 2024, we anticipate share repurchases in a range of $575 million to $625 million which is estimated to have a benefit of a net reduction in weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 2%. Now I'd like to walk through a few items to consider for the calendarization of our expectations. As always, we believe the best way to look at our business is in halves and not quarters due to the nature of our business. We expect comp sales for each of the quarters to be in a relatively tight range, consistent with our overall 2024 guidance. We are planning for positive comp transactions for the year. As to earnings, we expect our EPS growth to be slightly more favorable in the first half as opposed to the second half. There are a few factors that will impact operating margins in certain quarters. We anticipate the tailwinds of lower transportation costs to benefit our results through the second quarter and begin to flatten year-over-year starting in Q3. As a result, gross margin expansion for the first half of the year is anticipated to be near the high end of our annual guidance range, while the second half may be near the low end of the range. In regards to SG&A, the second and third quarters will be pressured from the start-up costs for the new distribution center, while the supply chain benefits will not begin to be realized in gross margin until late in the third quarter. Please keep in mind, we will be lapping an $0.08 per share benefit from the depreciation change in the third quarter of last year. Considering each of these factors, the third quarter will be our toughest earnings comparison as we anticipate a decline in operating margin and EPS due to the combination of these factors. As a reminder, the Orscheln stores will be added to the comp store calculation beginning in the second quarter with a tiered approach as we cycle the timing of moving these stores to our point-of-sale systems and rebranding of stores to Tractor Supply. Specific to the first quarter, we had a challenging first quarter last year as it was abnormally warm in January and February and relatively cold March. We were also benefiting from retail price inflation in the high single-digits. Given the recent Arctic cold temperatures across most of the regions, we are seeing good momentum as we start the first quarter. Overall, we are anticipating positive comp sales for the first quarter. To wrap up, we have clearly defined strategic priorities and are investing to capture the long-term opportunities in our market. We are committed to driving productivity and making appropriate trade-offs to fuel our investments while we protect our operating profit margins and earnings. We intend to maintain this focused approach through 2024. We are committed to continuously striving for stronger results. With that, I will turn the call back over to Hal. Hey, Zach, this is Kurt. Good morning. In regards to the comp sales performance, I'll point back to some of the things I mentioned on our prepared remarks. For the fourth quarter, the best way to look at it is start with the backdrop that when we look at the seasonal performance, the challenge is about an extremely mild fourth quarter going up against an Arctic storm of last year, there's 400 basis points of pressure. October and November were unseasonably warm as well. So you've got negative low single-digits generally consistent when you normalize for the December storm across all of the months. And all of that principally in the weather-related categories that I pointed out on the call. So as I mentioned, the fourth quarter ran consistently with the trend rates of the third quarter. Our consumable or needs-based business continues to be running solid, especially the year-round non-seasonal-related categories, the strength in all of our feed and food, the confidence that we have comes from examples such as livestock feed, equine feed, poultry feed, wildlife supplies, cat and dog running unit positive comps in the fourth quarter. Some of that up against the last year pantry filling that happens in the last week of the year against that storm. So you could see the traffic that we get from the consumables, the stability of the core of our business running really strong. So we still have that and care that confidence that our customers are shopping us just as consistent as they were before. We have growth in active customers, Neighbor's Club contributing more. All of those are the drivers of the consistency of the business. Yeah. Hey, Kate, this is Kurt. I'll take those. On wage rate growth, we are anticipating wage rate growth, slightly above the historical average is pre-pandemic. It varies across different areas of the business. But I'd center around a 3% to 4% range wage rate growth. We continue to see strong, solid workforce, unemployment continues to be low. Our culture, our teams continue to have all the success with hiring, but it's appropriate to anticipate that you'd be at that level of wage rate growth. In regards to incentive compensation, we're incentivized at all levels of the organization. In 2023, our performance from top and bottom line did underperform our original expectations. And so there was some modest leverage in 2023. So if you look at 2024, what's factored into our guidance into our SG&A is some normalization of incentive comp gives a modest 10 or 15 basis point deleverage, but that's all considered in the guidance that I gave. Yeah, Jason, this is Kurt. I'll answer that question. On my prepared remarks, I was very specific on that on what is really driving our new store productivity. So I want to point everyone back to that. We continue to see the Tractor Supply consistent, strong new store productivity. 2023 ran at 67% new store productivity. The 80 stores that we plan for 2024 are expected to be coming out the gates very consistent in the same way and our new store maturation process of a four to five year 65% to 70% new store productivity is where we target and we expect 2024 with the strong pipeline that we've got, we believe an excited -- just as we have in 2023 about what these new stores will produce. Yes. I'll give you a couple of points, Peter, on that. First, we've considered the micro strategic drivers, the macro favorable or unfavorable pressures for this year. We've given a guidance range, albeit slightly larger on the top and bottom line than we historically have that recognizes we're in a time of uncertainty. And so we believe all of those scenarios, any plausible, reasonable scenarios have been factored into our guidance. So we don't see likelihood outside of the downside of the guidance that we've given. That said, inside the guidance range, even outside of the guidance range, I'd point that the EBIT margin movement within sales range is not linear. And there's a number of factors, certainly with the level of gross margin or what might be a factor that's driving the low end of the range. A deflationary environment, for example, gives us upside on margin rate. So I would not point to any linear and even outside of the range when you start considering incentive comp and other things, it's not linear as well. Yes, sure. Why don't I start with that, Scot, on the comp, and then I'll toss it to set a little bit on the performance of Garden Centers, some of the 2024 drivers, et cetera. Our expectation and how we've modeled in our long-term targets is still the same as our expectations for 2024. As we continue to add Garden Centers roughly 150 to 200 of those a year. And you get from Fusion and Garden Center mid-single-digit to high single-digit on combo lift as those mature in year one and then a lower benefit in like year two, but still a benefit over the chain, that roughly plays into our algorithm, and we would anticipate for this year to play similar to that the Fusion Garden Center initiative is driving -- give or take some roughly one point of comp in our guidance range. And Neighbor's Club is another initiative that's driving consumers to spend up the tiers, more transactions, getting more of their share of wallet is another driver. So just kind of pointing out the two biggest strategic initiative drivers, and then I'll toss it over to Seth, maybe to talk a little bit about what's driving the garden centers. Yes, Chuck, this is Kurt. The Orscheln conversion went very well. All stores converted, as we mentioned, to the Tractor Supply brand. The first six to nine months of -- since the acquisition was a transition, a lot of noise through that. We now have them all branded Tractor Supply. The team is engaged. We've got the Tractor Supply products and services, our Tractor Supply, feed and food brands. And when we begin to cycle that in second quarter where we converted all over we do anticipate to see much like a new store maturation, perhaps we'll learn it in a similar type maturation curve, but we anticipate and have baked into our guidance some new store maturation type comp benefit from those 81 stores as well. And how it compares? We anticipate these markets from our real estate study that there is upside to the historical performance in those stores to be able to run in line with Tractor Supply averages. Albeit we've said it's very much in line with like a Midwest tractor supply average, which is a bit below the overall tractor supply average store level. So there's room to have these grow over time. And we're excited about our ability to capture new customers, bring them into Tractor Supply in these stores. And so overall, for 2024, even into 2025, we believe much like a new store, there's a benefit from the maturation. Yeah. Peter, I'll start with your first part of your question in regards to what our assumption is on a neutral deflation. Roughly neutral deflation for the year overall is what we see, give or take, I mean, give or take in our ranges, plus or minus one impact on retail AURs. As Hal mentioned, I think, in one of the other questions earlier, as we've rolled back off the peaks of 2022 throughout 2023 on a lot of the commodity deflation. A vast majority of that occurred throughout 2023 during these cycles. And these are fast turning SKUs in feed and food. So these -- these prices are already in our retail prices. First half of the year may have some exposure as a year-over-year lap on that. As we had slight net deflation in Q4, there could be and assumed in our guidance, some slight in the first half of the year. The second half of the year could be neutral or actually slightly positive. So we've considered each of those scenarios, but we really don't see a wide range in there. And I demonstrated that in regards to like corn, where it's 35% below the highs of 2022, and that happened throughout 2023. There's 10 or 15 points of difference between the pre-pandemic levels. And so there's really not much movement left in a commodity, and that commodity is a small percent ingredient in a small or a portion of our products that we offer. In comparison to 2015, it's all about what's structural. In 2015, we were coming off of years where oil prices, steel prices, grains were coming off of highs, and they completely flipped. In this case, the commodities hit the early peaks in 2021 and 2022 and all the structural nature, which is a bigger portion, such as wage rates, operating cost, et cetera, are really begin to get embedded in 2022 and 2023. And this structural. So I think it's a very different scenario. And there's limited risk that we see, if anything, it's a small level, and we believe adequately considered in our guidance. Joe, this is Kurt. I'll quickly just affirm what our -- was assumed in our guidance and then let Seth give you the answer about why we're assuming that for 2024. But we do believe that big ticket should be in line with our overall guidance range for the year. That's as you see that, that's relatively flattish at the midpoint to slightly favorable. And we're going up against two consecutive years of negative big ticket comps. So it has a lot to do about the compares. And in 2022, we were coming off of all of the stimulus spending in 2023. There's a bit of a swing off of durable goods into services and some of the weather-related pressures. And in 2024, we're cycling that and we've got some great offers, some new innovations that I know Seth can speak to. Yes. Yes, Michael."

Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal. \nHal Lawton : Thanks Mary Winn and thank you to everyone for taking the time to join us this morning. To start, I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to my fellow 50,000 Tractor Supply and Petsense team members. As always they lived our mission and values, delivered legendary service to our customers, did a great job being nimble in the quarter, and continued to deliver against our strategic initiatives.  At Tractor Supply the underlying health of our business remains strong. We continue to achieve substantial market share gains. Our customer trends and customer engagement are robust and our Life Out Here strategic initiatives remain on track.  Entering the third quarter, we had a sharp focus on the impact of the evolving macro environment and the impact of that environment on our customers retail spending patterns. Despite this view, our quarter was more challenging than we initially expected. The primary drivers of our under performance were less than ideal weather conditions, as well as our customers continuing to be discerning with their spending.  On the weather impact for the quarter, as we shared in our July earnings call, we anticipated that our compares would ease through the quarter as we were lapping one of the worst droughts in a decade. We were not assuming a significant benefit from the weather, but rather that it would not continue to be a drag on our performance.  In fact, it was a drag. We estimate that the unfavorable weather conditions in the third quarter contributed more than one point of comp to our sales shortfall compared to our expectations. While we never like to call out the adverse impacts of the weather on our business, there is no doubt that the challenging conditions continued to weigh on our sales this year as it relates to weather.  In Q3 we had extreme heat and drought in Texa-homa and to a lesser degree the Midwest, and also we had excessive rainfall and the absence of cool weather in other areas like the Northeast. As an example, Texa-homa which makes up a little over 15% of our sales, we saw extreme temperatures and dryness there for most of the quarter.  In fact, in Austin, Texas, as an example, there were 44 consecutive days of temperatures over 100 degrees in the third quarter. And for perspective, this was twice as many as Q3 of last year. Additionally, last year in the third quarter, we benefited from both the emergency response from Hurricane Ian and a shift to cooler fall temperatures in the last few weeks of the quarter in some of our markets.  This year, we did not have these events working in our favor. In the quarter, the emergency response from Hurricane Idalia was much smaller than the prior year. And a wave of summer-like temperatures continued into September, and in fact, even now into late October.  Turning to the macro environment. As we shared last quarter, we believe that due to the cumulative effects of many factors, our customers are showing signs of strain. Examples of these factors include inflation, higher credit card balances, and the resumption of school loan payments.  Additionally, consumers continue to shift their spending from goods to services, reverting back to pre-pandemic levels. In the context of this shift though, we believe that they remain more committed to the out-here lifestyle, and that our business is stickier than more discretionary components of retail. But nonetheless, to some degree, we've been affected by this shift.  Now, turning to the numbers for the third quarter. The team delivered net sales growth of 4.3%, with a modest comparable sales decrease of 0.4%. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $2.33, an increase of 11% over the prior year.  Now, let's shift to some highlights for the quarter. Comp transactions were flat for the prior year, offset by an average ticket decline of 0.3%. The average ticket performance was driven by a decline in units per transaction, with average unit retail remaining relatively strong.  July was our best performing period of the quarter with positive comps. Both August and September comps negated given the seasonal trends I mentioned earlier. Importantly, our active customer counts are stable and growing, low single digits. Also importantly, our reactivated, as well as new customer counts are also both positive and growing.  E-commerce achieved sales growth in the high single digits, with strong conversion performance. Our Buy Online, Deliver from Store Program was up over 80%. And on a rolling 12-month basis, very notably, our digital sales have now surpassed $1 billion.  Our consumable, usable, and edible products represented a meaningful portion of our business in the quarter. And these businesses continue to outperform our overall sales comp results, with continued strength in categories like dry dog food, cat food, poultry feed, lubricants, and shavings, just to name a few.  CUE continues to be one of our structural advantages, and these categories and products represent the strength of our core business, and they are what drive footsteps into our store. The gains in these categories were offset by declines in our late spring-summer seasonal product and big ticket categories, as well as softness in demand for those fall-winter product categories that usually begin to see some growth at the end of the quarter, due to the unseasonally warm weather.  Big ticket performance remained under pressure, down in the mid-single digits, which was a slight improvement from the first half of the year. If I step back, overall though, we continue to gain share across categories online and in-store, and continue, as I said earlier, to see strong customer trends.  On the customer front, our Neighbor's Club membership base represented more than 77% of our sales for the quarter. We're seeing continued favorable trends from our loyalty members. Retention rates have never been higher, and our Neighbor's Club members continue comping at a faster rate than our overall sales performance. And importantly, our high value customers again reached another record count in the quarter.  In just over a year since launching Neighbor\u2019s Club at Petsense, penetration of sales to our members now stands at over 65%, and we continue to benefit from the cross-shopping between the two brands, as we grow our share of wallets with these customers and focus on Pets Out Here in our collaboration between the two brands.  A couple of trends that I mentioned last quarter did continue into this quarter, and those are, one, customers are continually increasing their usage of credit; and two, shoppers continue to seek out value, particularly in lower income customer cohorts.  Importantly, our overall customer satisfaction scores hit another new all-time high as we continue to invest in our team, and they continue to do a fantastic job providing best-in-class customer service, a hallmark of Tractor Supply. Through the third quarter, our customer satisfaction scores have increased and we experienced an improvement every week, year-over-year, since 2021.  We've made significant progress in our Life Out Here Strategy. We now have just over 35% of our chain or 780 stores that are in the Project Fusion Layout, and our Garden Centers transformation is now active in over 420 locations. We continue to be very pleased with the strategic benefits and the financial returns of these store-level investments.  Our Orscheln Farm and Home in the acquisition remains on track, with nearly 50 stores converted to the Tractor Supply brand. And during the quarter, we completed the sale of the Orscheln Store Support Center and the Distribution Center as planned.  Year-to-date we've opened 51 new Tractor Supply stores in 10 Petsense locations. Our team has done an excellent job executing our real estate project this year, and getting us back to a normalized cadence of new store openings, in spite of a tough backdrop in the broader construction market. During the quarter the real-estate team also successfully executed our first sale lease-back transaction, with the sale of 10 stores. In addition, the team has about 35 fee development sites in the works. I anticipate our real estate strategy will continue to be a source of increasing strength for Tractor Supply over the next few years.  Given our performance through the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're updating our sales and earnings guidance for 2023. And Kurt will share some more details on our outlook later in the call.  Before I hand it over to Kurt, if I just step back for a moment, if you told me in January of 2020 that we would nearly double our top line sales and earnings and deliver strong cash return to shareholders, while increasing our capital investment and growth initiative, and investing in team member wages, and investing in brand building, and doing all this through a global pandemic, major disruptions in global supply chains, rapidly changing consumer shifts, also rapidly escalating costs, including the highest consumer inflation in 40 years, it would have been hard to imagine, but that's exactly what this team has delivered.  Over the last four years, we've added $7 billion in incremental sales. We've grown our market share significantly, and we've increased our earnings by 115% and returned over $3.2 billion of cash to shareholders.  Our resilient needs-based business model has a proven history of growing through various economic conditions. Our customers and team members are dedicated to the Out Here lifestyle, and they prioritize it as it is their authentic lifestyle. Our customers over-index as homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners.  We believe that the softness we're seeing is unique to transitory conditions in weather and consumer spending patterns. We continue to have a long-term structural macro trend that are favorable and sustainable. And as the market leader, we have substantial competitive advantages.  And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt. \nKurt Barton : Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. There are three key observations about our business that build on Hal's comments that I'd like to share before diving into the quarterly results.  First, looking at the impact of weather. There are some years weather works to our favor and others where it clearly works against us. We've certainly tried to be transparent over the years as to the impact from the volatility related to weather, both in favorable and unfavorable events. No doubt 2023 will be a year where weather goes down as unfavorable for our business.  From a warm January, a late start to the spring that never materialized over most of our markets, to a hot and dry summer across major markets like Texa-Homa and the Midwest, our seasonal businesses have been under pressure all year.  Second, our execution continues to be strong. Our Life Out Here initiatives are performing well and are positively impacting our results. Neighbor\u2019s Club, Project Fusion and Garden Centers, pet and digital initiatives are all driving top line growth.  Third, we view the softness in our customers' retail spending to be unique to the macro challenges in the current environment. Our customer engagement is strong and our initiatives are driving positive results. We remain committed to investing for long-term growth, but we will be agile as we navigate the current environment. We are committed to continuing our track record of long-term value creation for our shareholders.  Now, turning to our third quarter results. While our sales trends were below our expectations, the team managed the environment well, controlling what we can control. We also remain steadfast in our commitment to being the dependable supplier for Life Out Here.  Our third quarter top-line results were driven by strong and consistent CUE growth, offset by below trend seasonal performance and a weak summer demand and a lack of early fall seasonal sales, and discretionary big ticket sales remained under pressure.  Our comparable store sales growth was solid in regions such as the southeast and the far west. The performance of these geo regions was offset by pressure in Texa-homa and the Midwest, where heat and drought trends added incremental pressure on consumer demand, as well as the warm start to the fall in the northern markets.  Comparable transactions were flat for the quarter, with growth in our core year-round categories being offset by reduced demand for our seasonal categories. We had a modest decline in the average comp ticket. Our average unit retail was up 3% to 4%. The benefit of the growth in our average unit retail was offset by the softness in big ticket and declines in seasonal categories, which run at a higher average ticket. Additionally, but to a lesser extent, we continue to experience softer sales and discretionary and impulse add-on items, putting pressure on the average units per transaction.  Moving down our income statement, our gross profit increased 7.3% to $1.25 billion. Gross margin increased 101 basis points to 36.7% from 35.6% in the prior year's third quarter. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter as we continue to maintain strong product margin from our ongoing execution of everyday low price strategy.  At a time when the overall promotional environment across retail has picked up modestly, our large and robust membership of Neighbors Club offers us a great way to provide value. Our loyalty program allows us, together with our vendors, to strategically target value propositions for our customers.  The gross margin rate increase was primarily attributable to lower transportation costs, driven by improvements in the global supply chain and efficiencies from our new distribution center in Ohio. Product mix pressured gross margin given the strength in CUE. This was somewhat offset by the margin improvement from lower big ticket sales, which carry a lower gross margin rate.  As a percent of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 38 basis points to 26.7%. The increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of our new DC, along with some lost fixed cost leverage due to the decline in comparable store sales.  Additionally, consistent with last quarter, higher medical claims also contributed to the increase in SG&A. We have made adjustments to our benefits program and will continue to do so. We don't anticipate this to be a headwind in 2024.  During the quarter we completed the planned sale lease back of 10 Tractor Supply store locations, benefiting SG&A by approximately 70 basis points, net of transaction and repair costs. Additionally, the increase in SG&A was partially offset by a one-time benefit to depreciation expense of approximately 35 basis points or $11 million pre-tax. This benefit is attributed to a change in the useful lives of assets for certain remodeled stores, due to a reassessment of lease terms to better represent the economic profile of these investments.  As I reflect on the SG&A performance overall, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that our operations team did a great job scaling our core variable costs to our sales performance. Our distribution center teams achieved some of the best cut times, fill rates and overall productivity measures in years. And our store teams did a great job balancing store payroll to scale back, while also maintaining the right level of customer support and driving our best-in-class customer satisfaction scores. Overall, the team had strong execution and scaled our core variable costs well in this environment.  As an example, to further illustrate, nearly 85% of our core SG&A dollar growth year-over-year represents investments in our strategic growth initiatives. My appreciation goes out to the team for controlling what we could control. For the quarter, operating profit margin was 10%, a 62 basis point improvement from the prior year.  Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $2.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, flat to the prior year on a per store basis. We are managing it closely and continue to be very pleased with the quality and position of our inventory. Our in-stock rates are the best they've been in over two years. In addition, our inventory shrink improved year-over-year.  With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2x. Our long-term debt has no nearing maturities and it's fixed at very attractive rates.  Now, let me turn to our updated fiscal 2023 financial outlook. For the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $14.5 billion to $14.6 billion and comp store sales even with last year. Our full year operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.2%, with net income of $1.1 billion to $1.11 billion. Diluted EPS is forecast to be $10 to $10.10. This includes a net after tax benefit of about $0.08 in Q4 for our remaining sale leaseback transactions this year.  We continue to forecast anticipated capital expenditures for the year in the range of $800 million to $850 million or about $725 million to $775 million net of our capital needs for the fixed fee real estate strategy that we shared last quarter. This higher level reflects the move to own development for select new store growth that will be funded through the sale of existing stores. It's important to note that the proceeds from the sale of our own stores are expected to offset the incremental capital outlay under the development program. The combined transactions are expected to be relatively neutral to our cash position.  Implied in our outlook is for fourth quarter comp store sales to be down low to mid-single digits. As Hal mentioned, we anticipate continued discerning consumer spending and unfavorable compares relating to weather as we experience the ongoing El Nino pattern, combined with the cycling of last year's monumental winter storm, which drove 200 basis points of favorable impact on comps.  We anticipate continued strength in our core year-round categories, yet the softness in demand for seasonal and discretionary will continue to limit the top side on our performance. As a reminder, we are also lapping the 53rd week, which included an extra week of sales in the prior year, contributing approximately $225 million to top line sales and $0.16 of diluted earnings per share.  As for retail price increases, our plans reflect a continued moderation of inflation. While still positive, we believe it will be modest. Our guidance reflects ongoing gross margin expansion year-over-year. We anticipate continued benefit from transportation and our new distribution center, along with some pressure from an unfavorable product mix. In the fourth quarter, we expect continued SG&A deleverage given our investments and the expected comparable store sales declines.  As we shared last quarter, for modeling purposes, the Orscheln stores will go into our comp calculation in 2024, based on when the store is converted to our point of sale system. Most stores converted to our point of sale during Q2 and Q3 of this year.  As is customary, we will provide our guidance for 2024 at our fourth quarter earnings call. We're still finalizing our outlook for sales, as there are a number of puts and takes to be considered. Let's start with the fact that we're a needs-based, demand-driven business, with a long history of positive comps.  Additionally, as we see 2024 today, we expect we'll have less benefit from inflation, but we're 18 months into cycling big ticket softness. And the weather, hopefully, cannot be worse than it was this year. But we do anticipate that the operating environment will continue to be challenging with a higher than normal degree of uncertainty and ongoing pressure on consumer confidence and household budgets.  As we've shared over the last couple of years, we've always planned that 2023 would be our peak capital investment level. With that as a backdrop, we plan to prudently invest in our strategic priorities in 2024, with next year's net capital spending in the 600\u2019s, which will relieve some depreciation expense. We remain excited about the progress on our Life Out Here strategy and are very pleased with our initiatives.  Our 10th distribution center will open during the second quarter of 2024. Much like our distribution center opening this year, this new DC benefits gross margin, but will pressure our SG&A as the facility ramps up. The gross margin benefits typically lag the opening by about one quarter.  Similar to 2023, we anticipate executing approximately 15 existing store sale leaseback transaction in 2024 to fund the own development new store program, and we anticipate the opening of 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 to 15 Petsense locations.  Over our history, we have continually adapted to the operating environment around us. The needs-based, demand-driven characteristics of our product offerings support our ability to continue to be a winner in retail. We will remain agile and play offense. We will leverage our core competencies that have served us well, all while strengthening our capabilities and investing in our Life Out Here growth strategy.  Now, I will turn the call over to Hal to wrap us up. \nHal Lawton : Thanks, Kurt. As the calendar shifts to the fall and winter season, our stores and online are ready for the change in typical Tractor Supply fashion. Our merchandising team has been working closely with our vendors on plans for the holiday season, with an emphasis on new products and innovation, and very notably with a focus on value.  As the largest player in our sector, it is our obligation to be the advocate for value for our customers. And we are working hard to roll back the cost absorbed over the past two years. We will continue to be the destination for value and quality across our merchandising lineup.  In key categories like heating and insulated apparel, our merchants have brought newness with compelling value, including exciting programs such as Columbia Performance Hunting Gear and our line of Grand Teton Pellet Stoves. In our CUE categories, we have the right selection at the right price, with a focus on value, and are committed to being in stock as we continue to support our customers' lifestyles.  For example, you will see wood pallet stack outs in the majority of our stores in preparation for the winter season. And right now, our 400-plus garden centers are showcasing pumpkins, mums, and fall harvest decor. And this year we expanded our Halloween and harvest decor program with a great lineup to capitalize on our customers' love for decorating their homes with on-trend seasonal indoor and outdoor decor, including a skeleton cow that was a TikTok viral sensation.  Additionally, and particularly in light of the continued warmer weather, we continue to be the destination for our customers' sporting goods, outdoor recreation, and outdoor wildlife interest, with products like our exclusive Royal Wing Bird Seed, Cannon Gun Safe, exclusive county line log splitters, and the Blackstone Griddle.  Earlier this week, we announced the addition of Yeti products to our lineup in our Fusion stores. We're especially excited to collaborate with a well-regarded brand like Yeti that brings a long-standing reputation for quality and durability and aligns with our customers' interest in camping, fishing, hunting and all outdoor activities.  Our stores and garden centers will soon be filled with Christmas trees, wreaths and poinsettias. In addition to live goods, our customers can look forward to unique and different decor items, including our popular six-foot chicken lawn decorations and farm-themed holiday gingerbread kits. When it comes to gifts, we have compelling values and buys in every section of our store, from tools and grills to even fun, rural unique items like a 12-volt zero-turn ride-on toy lawnmower.  From a calendar perspective, it's a good setup this year, with 31 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And Christmas falls on a Monday, so we anticipate a strong full weekend of sales prior to Christmas. We have a strong holiday season playbook with an exciting day-after-Thanksgiving day plan as well, with compelling offers programmed throughout the season. As we plan for the season though, we acknowledge there is a broader range of estimates for holiday consumer spending than we've seen over the last couple of years.  As we enter the fourth quarter, we're on track to achieve several milestones in our Life Out Here strategy. Notably, we anticipate ending the year with 40% of our store base in the Project Fusion format and nearly 500 garden centers, both significant milestones to initiatives that we began less than three years ago. Our real estate pipeline is robust, with plans for 80 new Tractor Supply stores also in 2024.  We're piloting artificial intelligence in many functions in the business, including marketing, supply chain, and technology development. And one particular application that I'm very excited about is our generative AI knowledge tool that we call \u2018Hey Gura.\u2019 Using a proprietary AI engine that we built, we're able to deliver knowledge directly to our team members through the headsets that each wear to augment their individual experience. Let me give you an example of this.  One of the questions recently asked by a team member is, when do you switch from crumble feed to pellet for baby chicks? When asked, the Hey Gura app responded, \u2018Typically chickens switch from crumble to pellet feed when they reach about 15 to 18 weeks of age, depending on breed and development.\u2019 To-date, the results have been excellent. Our team members are really embracing and excited about the technology, and it's been a great value-add feature for our leading customer service.  We have a long track record of growth and high expectations of performance. We view our current trends to these expectations as transitory and specific to the economic environment. This team is dialed in and understands the challenges. As we're entering one of the busiest periods in retail, my thanks and sincere appreciation goes out to my fellow 50,000 Tractor Supply team members for their dedication to our mission and value.  And with that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is now open. \nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question, Scot Ciccarelli. Given the decline in same-skew inflation and growing concerns, we may see a deflationary environment in pet food and feed. Can you help us understand, at least generally, how you're thinking about the impact of inflation or deflation for \u201824, especially in your CUE categories? \nKurt Barton: Hey Scott. This is Kurt, and good morning. First, let me just start by saying, we still see an environment where there's some net inflation year-over-year while modest. Inflation is clearly slowing, but not turning to deflation at this point. And specific to some of the categories, we are seeing, there's areas this year where there's year-over-year deflation, particularly areas like bird feed, livestock feed, corn based. Yeah, there's some level of deflation.  But there's areas like you mentioned, where we're still seeing some level of inflation still in the system, such as pet food. And then there's most of our areas in our product categories, what I describe as they've hit a plateau. It's stable, and we're running pretty consistent. And as that moves to the pipeline, very much consistent with our outlook for this year and beyond, was that we start to moderate down to a low single digit level of inflation in 2023.  Too early to really say for 2024, but the general call would be that things begin to stabilize. Inflation, deflation is not as much of a factor in the average ticket that it's been over the past few years, and it's more stabilized and neutralish. And we're certainly focused on it. This team works consistently in environments of change and inflation, deflation, have a history performing very well. Know that we're monitoring it. I'll be able to share more information on that in the fourth quarter call when we give our outlook for 2024. \nScot Ciccarelli: That's really helpful. And then just for clarification, if we were to get same skew deflation, should we expect it to result in gross margin expansion? I think that used to be a general rule of thumb for you guys as we go back to pre-pandemic days. Thanks. \nKurt Barton: Yes, in general, our history has been that in a deflationary environment we're able to leverage our scale, manage our retail pricing. It generally produces a benefit on the rate, just like inflation did over the last few years, put a bit of pressure on that rate. And we managed both environments very well, and historically it's been as you described it. \nScot Ciccarelli: Very helpful. Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. \nSteven Forbes: Good morning, Hal, Kurt, Seth. Maybe just a focus on capital spending plans for next year. I think you guys mentioned sort of in the $600 million range. I was curious Kurt, if you can maybe help us explain the year-over-year change, and if there's any part of the strategic investment plan that you're pulling back on for any particular reason. \nHal Lawton: Yeah. Hey, Steven. The biggest change, very much consistent with what we expect when we said peak years of 2022 and 2023, are those big investments in the distribution centers. We will open that second new distribution center next year in 2024, but a majority of that capital is in 2023. So on a net capital spend that we're forecasting in the $725 to $775, if you back off of that into the $600\u2019s, the biggest majority of that is supply chain.  There's other efficiencies in there, such as we continue on our investments in the stores, such as Fusion and Garden Centers to re-engineer and find efficiencies in our investments. Really excited about the two newest formats that we are rolling out in the stores that we've been able to re-engineer and drive costs out of our Garden Center, and that's giving us even lower cost debt.  And then maybe the third thing would be the investments we made in 2023 on integration and remodeling the Orscheln stores. We'll be rolling off of that. I think those three things are the biggest difference, but no shift in our strategic investments.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is now open. \nPeter Benedict: Hey guys, thanks. Kurt, just leveraging off Steve's question there, the prudent investment approach on the CapEx side. Can you walk that over to the SG&A side of the P&L and talk about what it kind of means? You've spoken to 85% of the growth in SG&A coming from some of these investments. How does that kind of \u2013 maybe that growth cadence inflect next year?  And then secondly, your ability to kind of manage the core bucket, I guess the non-investment related bucket in the event that your comps remain challenged, let's say through \u201824. Let's just call it flat for argument's sake. Thank you. \nKurt Barton: Yeah, Peter. On SG&A, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I felt one of the highlights was how the team managed pivoting off of a number of years and quarters with strong top line sales, to scale to the appropriate level of volume for Q3. And it just shows our ability to be agile in that case.  To your point on the 85% was growth, some of the things that really played out to help drive the core SG&A to a really low growth level. First area, supply chain, and I mentioned this in the previous last couple quarters. We had built the supply chain almost through muscle, 3PL, other areas that distribution centers were running at max capacity or above that level and that was inefficient.  We've been able to shut off some of the 3PL higher costs. The team is running at some of the highest level of productivity. So one of our biggest areas of leverage in a flat to slight negative comp sales environment was our distribution supply chain, as they actually leveraged as a percent of sales because of productivity. John and team focusing on scaling down task or non-customer service work to modestly drive hours down, that also reflects some of the SG&A benefits.  In general, in an environment that there is softer demand at Tractor Supply, as we look ahead to even future quarters and next year, we'll plan and scale our core levels of investments and our operating expenses in line with our sales growth.  And then from there, this team will continue to claw back inflationary pressures, even in operating expenses that have embedded over the last few years. And this is a team that's been built with lean management, continuous improvement in our DNA, and we have profit improvement goals. And those are all things as we plan ahead to 2024 that gives us confidence in our ability to manage and still hold to our long-term algorithm and targets on operating margin. \nPeter Benedict: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Baker with DA Davidson. Your line is now open. \nMichael Baker : Excuse me, thanks. Two-part question, I guess. I wanted to ask about your discretionary and seasonal business. You talk about your discretionary business being 15% of sales, but why wouldn't you consider the seasonal business to be discretionary, as well as that seems to be able to ebb and flow based on the seasons?  And I guess the second part of that is, you said the fall/early winter businesses start off slow. Are those loss sales or just delayed? Like, if it does eventually get cold, which presumably it will, how do you think those sales pick back up? \nHal Lawton: Yeah, hey Michael, good morning. Thanks for the question. Appreciate your participation in the call. You know, as it relates to discretionary, just one would acknowledge 15%-ish of our business kind of big ticket discretionary, mid-single digit negative comps, a slight improvement from sequentially from what we saw in the first half of the year, kind of in line with what we expected.  The myth throughout the entirety of this year for us has been our seasonal businesses. Our CUE business continues to perform very strong, with comps well above our reported total company comp performance with significant share gains happening in our CUE business. On our Q2 call or Q1 and Q2 calls, when we talked about seasonal, we acknowledged that there could be an element of the consumer spending discretionary piece that kind of seeps into that seasonal business. I would characterize the fall and winter business, though, more demand driven needs based than even spring, because in the winter, the businesses that are really strong for us and large and robust are things like wood pellets and propane.  In fact, three of our top 10 skews during the winter season are two wood pellet skews and the propane skew. Those are demand driven needs based. When it's cold, people, are burning the pellets in their wood stoves or they are using propane for heating other homes or supplemental heating. And when it's not cold, they are not. And this time last year, actually as we entered Q3, the last week of Q2 and as we entered Q3, it was we had cooler weather and then that continued throughout the balance of Q3.  We didn't, have that at all this year. And then even as we're heading into Q4 here, it's going to be 80 degrees this weekend in Boston. You just don't need wood pellets and you don't need propane during that time. And so you can see it very clearly in our business.  On the flip side, we are seeing strength in outdoor projects, outdoor wildlife, those sorts of categories, whether it's grilling, whether it's deer corn and the deer hunting season. You can certainly see it in the lawn and garden categories, even in riding lawnmowers. Those businesses this time of year though are just not large enough to offset. Even with nice growth in those categories, they are just not large enough to offset those sorts of pieces that are demand driven.  We also do sell a lot of insulated outerwear type categories, whether its coats and a lot, fleece lined pants and those sorts of things, gloves, boots. I think as it gets cold, I would expect those to not be lost sales. But there is an element of like wood pellets and propane that once you don't have that cold weather, you do lose it. I think we are being prudent in our implied guidance for the fourth quarter. Last year, we didn't have \u2013 it was not \u2013 it was a warmish November. So there \u2013 but we know there's an El Nino that's in forecast right now. And so we just thought it'd be prudent to not assume that we'd have any upside as we lapped that in November, as we talked about in our prepared remarks.  And then of course we're hurtling [ph] or we\u2019re comping on top of a robust storm from last year that, as we noted in our Q4 earnings call last year, contributed two points of comp to the quarter. \nMichael Baker : Excuse me. Thanks. That's helpful. So it sounds like those seasonal categories are non-discretionary, but only if the weather cooperates. Is that a fair way to put it? \nHal Lawton: Yeah, I think that's a fair way to \u2013 that's an absolutely fair way to say it. \nMichael Baker : Excellent! I appreciate the time. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open. \nMichael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. One of the debates on the Tractor Supply Story over the long term is the company has a gross margin right now that's 150 basis points. That's higher than it was prior to the pandemic. So what gives you confidence on the long-term outlook, especially as this has become a more profitable business? What's a realistic expectation that you can hold on to this increased profitability? And then I have one quick follow-up. \nKurt Barton: Yeah, Michael, this is Kurt. Gross margin has certainly been not only a high point for this quarter, this year, but to your point, what we've been able to accomplish, leveraging our scale and size in the last years has been a real testament to the team.  I'll give you a few examples of why we believe this is a sustainable gross margin, and most of it is around the structural nature of it. As you think ahead, I'll first acknowledge, as we continue to grow in CUE and take market share, it puts a little bit of pressure from product mix. And we've been cycling and absorbing those gross margin expansions with higher pressure from CUE mix in the past few years, more than we would see going forward.  Supply chain benefits have really been one of the top two areas of gross margin expansion. And we've seen and come off some of the highest supply chain costs. We've absorbed some of the inefficiencies in the robust, fast growth period. So the supply chain costs, declining transportation costs, improvement in the reduced miles from new distribution centers are all structural.  And as you think about transportation costs, you think about it as in this particular time, we are still in an environment where transportation costs, both domestic and import, are higher than the pre-pandemic levels. I'm not saying that we expect to revert back to pre-pandemic norms, but I think the important thing is that we're not coming off of a new extreme low, but yet coming off of some of the highs. And then the second most impactful piece of gross margin is the structural sustained difference of coming off promotionals that were embedded into our normal programs and really leveraging EDLP and Neighbor\u2019s Clubs. So the biggest drivers are structural. We expect to be able to change those. And the benefit that our fast team has driven in our production, not only in sales, but the funding from our vendors is structurally in there as well.  So we anticipate to be able to have continued gross margin expansion. And even next year, as you think about seasonal, it may be able to bounce back and that has higher margins. So we have a lot of expectations on our ability to sustain and even expand gross margin for those reasons. \nMichael Lasser : Got you. My follow-up question is you provided some initial observations on next year. Macro is going to be tough, we'll see what happens with the weather, less inflation benefit. So in light of all those comments, how low can your comp be and you still maintain flat overall EPS next year versus this year? \nKurt Barton: Yeah. I'll take that one. I mean, I'd have to just go to this is still very early in our planning cycle. This business has been resilient in regards to our ability to maintain our comp sales. It's so much of a needs based core business in there that we are planning for some uncertainty.  There are some headwinds on the consumer, but we got strong strategic initiatives. We're lapping some difficult challenges from the seasonal business. And we can be nimble, but I'm just not going to try to predict or go down a path of what level of comps or how low it could be because this business has a track record. In 30 years we've had one year of negative comps and it was ever so slightly. And we're confident in our ability to produce strong sales performance. \nHal Lawton: And the only thing that I would add is. \nMichael Lasser : Thank you very much. \nHal Lawton: Hey Michael, the only thing I would add is, Kurt\u2019s prepared remarks talked about our commitment to our long-term operating margin guidance, inclusive of next year. I'd also add, we see a lot of opportunities for continued operating expense control next year, namely as Kurt mentioned, freight and a number of other levers.  And I think we've demonstrated this year that we have a number of levers that we can pull to continue to support the underlying profitability of the business, and also can control what we can control.  We certainly don't see an outlook next year as you implied, as potential for negative decline in EPS. I mean, if you look at the underlying strength of our business, whether it's in consumer, our number of shoppers in our stores, our customer satisfaction, our market share gains, all those sorts of things, we've never been more confident in the underlying foundation of our business. \nMichael Lasser : Thank you so much. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore. Your line is now open. \nOliver Wintermantel : Yeah, thanks. I was looking for your guidance for the fourth quarter comp, the low single digits to mid-single digit decline. Kurt, how do you expect transactions versus ticket are performing in that kind of environment in regards of last year's, the winter storm? Is it mostly in transactions that are going to decline in the fourth quarter? \nKurt Barton: Oliver, yeah, I'd frame it up as it's going to be a mix of both of those. We had, a slight average ticket decline in Q3. Some of those pressures on average ticket will, we expect to persist into Q4. But transactions are what gets impacted and did get impacted by the monumental winter storm last year.  With our expectations, as we mentioned, this is not framing up to be an ideal fourth quarter weather. That demand would play out in transactions, and in our evaluation, it's going to be a mix of both transactions and ticket. And implied in our guidance would be a negative comp transaction for that reason. \nOliver Wintermantel : Okay. Thanks very much. Good luck. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Your line is now open. \nRyann Mushkin : Good morning. This is Ryan on for Scott. Thanks for taking our question. Our research would suggest that there is an opportunity to have stores get deliveries from the distribution centers more frequently. Do you agree? And if so, what do you think the sales opportunity may be? Thanks.\nHal Lawton: Good morning and thank you for your question. First off, I'd say this is an area that we have been focused on for the last few years. We've gone from roughly five mixing centers to 15 mixing centers over the last three years. That has given us the ability to have more replenishment going into the stores of full pallet quantities of our big moving SKUs.  The second thing is the expansion of our DCs from eight to nine and the next year 10. Also gives us additional outbound capacity to be able to deliver more frequently to our stores. We now have over, I think it's 500 or 600 stores now that receive shipments twice a week from our distribution centers. The remaining stores all receive shipments once a week. So it's not that we have stores receiving it less than that. But yeah, we're constantly looking at ways we can drive in stock.  What I would leave you with is, our in stock rate right now is the best it's been, as Kurt said in his prepared remarks, really since the pandemic began. We feel very good about our in stock rates right now. Our team's done an excellent job, I think, managing inventory. If you look at our inventory growth, it's in control.  If you look at our in stock rates, they are excellent. You look at our shrink numbers below last year and that last year was below two years ago. So I think on all sides of inventory, quality, quantity, in stock rates, we feel very good. But continue to challenge yourself to increase frequency and get smarter and smarter in our tools, like our new RELEX replenishment and allocation system to be able to keep improving our performance on inventory. But, I feel very good about it. As I said, our in stock rates are the best they've been really since the pandemic. \nRyann Mushkin : Thank you so much. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. \nChris Horvers : Thanks very much. So following up on some of the prior questions, you are assuming comps are down roughly 4% in the fourth quarter. And you also said that your business has a long history of positive comp, sort of alluding that \u201824 would be positive. So, I guess what's unique to the fourth quarter? I understand there's two points of weather lap year-over-year. Why wouldn't the business be positive in that quarter if weather is sort of the only variable that's been the unknown? \nHal Lawton: Hey, good morning, Chris. And thanks for your question and participation in the call. I would just reiterate what we said in our prepared remarks, that we continue to see the consumer being discerning in their spend, particularly in discretionary. I mean, I think we've all seen the charts on PCE spend and the shift from goods to services. We've all been looked at how good spending is occurring and how that's shifting across the various retail sectors.  The sector we play in is the most sticky, the least impacted by that. You go look at electronics and appliances. You look at furniture. You look at home improvement. You look at all the other categories. They are all performing well below kind of our normal, our sector. But nonetheless, we are seeing some modest impact from the discerning spend.  We also said weather is not off to a great start for us in Q4. There's a very strong El Nino pattern occurring. That typically is a warmer winter season. It's 80 degrees this weekend in Boston. And then as you said, we're lapping the strong storm from last year, which we recorded two points to.  So we just think you put all that together and it's appropriate to be prudent in our outlook for the fourth quarter in that kind of mid-single digit, low to mid-single digit current negative, and I don't think it's indicative of anything structural in the business.  We see it as very transitory to the current moment. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we had active customer growth in Q3. We had new customer growth in Q3. We had reactivated customer growth in Q3. Our customer satisfaction scores are at all-time highs.  Our market share gains are very strong right now across the board. In PET, this past quarter, our share gains were as strong as they've been since the pandemic. And again, our underlying business is very strong. I'm confident that in the context of retail goods spending, even though the tide is shifting out for all, that we're going to be standing tall amongst that. \nChris Horvers : Got it. And then my follow-up is just on the consumer broadly. It is a needs-based business. How is the consumer changing? Because I think if you look across retail right now, you're not the only one who is seeing weakness, and it seems like it has deteriorated a bit. So are some of the things that you're talking about in terms of units per transaction and the usage of credit, is your view that there has been some degree of deterioration in the consumer over the past six months or so?\nHal Lawton: I'd start by saying what is our value proposition? And our value proposition is to be that dependable supplier for life out here. And again, I'd reiterate, we're seeing the customers in our stores. They are shopping us at record levels.  That said, when they are shopping us, they are spending a little bit less items per basket, right, kind of to the tune of a low single-digit headwind, and they are pulling back a little bit on discretionary. Those are consistent themes that we've had really for the last few quarters.  We haven't really seen any acceleration in that. It's really been more of a consistent theme. But again, for us, the seasonal weather, the seasonal businesses have been a huge departure from what our outlook and expectations have been all year long.  But nonetheless, I think you're going to continue to see for the near term, the consumer spend continuing to shift to services from goods and kind of rebalancing. And I think you're going to see discretionary retail businesses continuing to take the brunt of that as we turn the quarter of this year into next year. \nChris Horvers : Got it. Thanks very much. \nMary Winn Pilkington: As we've hit the top of the hour \u2013 Melissa [ph], as we've hit the top of the hour, I think this wraps up our call. So thank you everyone for joining us and I'm available for follow-up, and we'll look forward to speaking to you on our fourth quarter earnings call. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Thanks Mary Winn and thank you to everyone for taking the time to join us this morning. To start, I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to my fellow 50,000 Tractor Supply and Petsense team members. As always they lived our mission and values, delivered legendary service to our customers, did a great job being nimble in the quarter, and continued to deliver against our strategic initiatives.  At Tractor Supply the underlying health of our business remains strong. We continue to achieve substantial market share gains. Our customer trends and customer engagement are robust and our Life Out Here strategic initiatives remain on track.  Entering the third quarter, we had a sharp focus on the impact of the evolving macro environment and the impact of that environment on our customers retail spending patterns. Despite this view, our quarter was more challenging than we initially expected. The primary drivers of our under performance were less than ideal weather conditions, as well as our customers continuing to be discerning with their spending.  On the weather impact for the quarter, as we shared in our July earnings call, we anticipated that our compares would ease through the quarter as we were lapping one of the worst droughts in a decade. We were not assuming a significant benefit from the weather, but rather that it would not continue to be a drag on our performance.  In fact, it was a drag. We estimate that the unfavorable weather conditions in the third quarter contributed more than one point of comp to our sales shortfall compared to our expectations. While we never like to call out the adverse impacts of the weather on our business, there is no doubt that the challenging conditions continued to weigh on our sales this year as it relates to weather.  In Q3 we had extreme heat and drought in Texa-homa and to a lesser degree the Midwest, and also we had excessive rainfall and the absence of cool weather in other areas like the Northeast. As an example, Texa-homa which makes up a little over 15% of our sales, we saw extreme temperatures and dryness there for most of the quarter.  In fact, in Austin, Texas, as an example, there were 44 consecutive days of temperatures over 100 degrees in the third quarter. And for perspective, this was twice as many as Q3 of last year. Additionally, last year in the third quarter, we benefited from both the emergency response from Hurricane Ian and a shift to cooler fall temperatures in the last few weeks of the quarter in some of our markets.  This year, we did not have these events working in our favor. In the quarter, the emergency response from Hurricane Idalia was much smaller than the prior year. And a wave of summer-like temperatures continued into September, and in fact, even now into late October.  Turning to the macro environment. As we shared last quarter, we believe that due to the cumulative effects of many factors, our customers are showing signs of strain. Examples of these factors include inflation, higher credit card balances, and the resumption of school loan payments.  Additionally, consumers continue to shift their spending from goods to services, reverting back to pre-pandemic levels. In the context of this shift though, we believe that they remain more committed to the out-here lifestyle, and that our business is stickier than more discretionary components of retail. But nonetheless, to some degree, we've been affected by this shift.  Now, turning to the numbers for the third quarter. The team delivered net sales growth of 4.3%, with a modest comparable sales decrease of 0.4%. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $2.33, an increase of 11% over the prior year.  Now, let's shift to some highlights for the quarter. Comp transactions were flat for the prior year, offset by an average ticket decline of 0.3%. The average ticket performance was driven by a decline in units per transaction, with average unit retail remaining relatively strong.  July was our best performing period of the quarter with positive comps. Both August and September comps negated given the seasonal trends I mentioned earlier. Importantly, our active customer counts are stable and growing, low single digits. Also importantly, our reactivated, as well as new customer counts are also both positive and growing.  E-commerce achieved sales growth in the high single digits, with strong conversion performance. Our Buy Online, Deliver from Store Program was up over 80%. And on a rolling 12-month basis, very notably, our digital sales have now surpassed $1 billion.  Our consumable, usable, and edible products represented a meaningful portion of our business in the quarter. And these businesses continue to outperform our overall sales comp results, with continued strength in categories like dry dog food, cat food, poultry feed, lubricants, and shavings, just to name a few.  CUE continues to be one of our structural advantages, and these categories and products represent the strength of our core business, and they are what drive footsteps into our store. The gains in these categories were offset by declines in our late spring-summer seasonal product and big ticket categories, as well as softness in demand for those fall-winter product categories that usually begin to see some growth at the end of the quarter, due to the unseasonally warm weather.  Big ticket performance remained under pressure, down in the mid-single digits, which was a slight improvement from the first half of the year. If I step back, overall though, we continue to gain share across categories online and in-store, and continue, as I said earlier, to see strong customer trends.  On the customer front, our Neighbor's Club membership base represented more than 77% of our sales for the quarter. We're seeing continued favorable trends from our loyalty members. Retention rates have never been higher, and our Neighbor's Club members continue comping at a faster rate than our overall sales performance. And importantly, our high value customers again reached another record count in the quarter.  In just over a year since launching Neighbor's Club at Petsense, penetration of sales to our members now stands at over 65%, and we continue to benefit from the cross-shopping between the two brands, as we grow our share of wallets with these customers and focus on Pets Out Here in our collaboration between the two brands.  A couple of trends that I mentioned last quarter did continue into this quarter, and those are, one, customers are continually increasing their usage of credit; and two, shoppers continue to seek out value, particularly in lower income customer cohorts.  Importantly, our overall customer satisfaction scores hit another new all-time high as we continue to invest in our team, and they continue to do a fantastic job providing best-in-class customer service, a hallmark of Tractor Supply. Through the third quarter, our customer satisfaction scores have increased and we experienced an improvement every week, year-over-year, since 2021.  We've made significant progress in our Life Out Here Strategy. We now have just over 35% of our chain or 780 stores that are in the Project Fusion Layout, and our Garden Centers transformation is now active in over 420 locations. We continue to be very pleased with the strategic benefits and the financial returns of these store-level investments.  Our Orscheln Farm and Home in the acquisition remains on track, with nearly 50 stores converted to the Tractor Supply brand. And during the quarter, we completed the sale of the Orscheln Store Support Center and the Distribution Center as planned.  Year-to-date we've opened 51 new Tractor Supply stores in 10 Petsense locations. Our team has done an excellent job executing our real estate project this year, and getting us back to a normalized cadence of new store openings, in spite of a tough backdrop in the broader construction market. During the quarter the real-estate team also successfully executed our first sale lease-back transaction, with the sale of 10 stores. In addition, the team has about 35 fee development sites in the works. I anticipate our real estate strategy will continue to be a source of increasing strength for Tractor Supply over the next few years.  Given our performance through the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're updating our sales and earnings guidance for 2023. And Kurt will share some more details on our outlook later in the call.  Before I hand it over to Kurt, if I just step back for a moment, if you told me in January of 2020 that we would nearly double our top line sales and earnings and deliver strong cash return to shareholders, while increasing our capital investment and growth initiative, and investing in team member wages, and investing in brand building, and doing all this through a global pandemic, major disruptions in global supply chains, rapidly changing consumer shifts, also rapidly escalating costs, including the highest consumer inflation in 40 years, it would have been hard to imagine, but that's exactly what this team has delivered.  Over the last four years, we've added $7 billion in incremental sales. We've grown our market share significantly, and we've increased our earnings by 115% and returned over $3.2 billion of cash to shareholders.  Our resilient needs-based business model has a proven history of growing through various economic conditions. Our customers and team members are dedicated to the Out Here lifestyle, and they prioritize it as it is their authentic lifestyle. Our customers over-index as homeowners, landowners, pet owners and animal owners.  We believe that the softness we're seeing is unique to transitory conditions in weather and consumer spending patterns. We continue to have a long-term structural macro trend that are favorable and sustainable. And as the market leader, we have substantial competitive advantages.  And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kurt. Thanks, Kurt. As the calendar shifts to the fall and winter season, our stores and online are ready for the change in typical Tractor Supply fashion. Our merchandising team has been working closely with our vendors on plans for the holiday season, with an emphasis on new products and innovation, and very notably with a focus on value.  As the largest player in our sector, it is our obligation to be the advocate for value for our customers. And we are working hard to roll back the cost absorbed over the past two years. We will continue to be the destination for value and quality across our merchandising lineup.  In key categories like heating and insulated apparel, our merchants have brought newness with compelling value, including exciting programs such as Columbia Performance Hunting Gear and our line of Grand Teton Pellet Stoves. In our CUE categories, we have the right selection at the right price, with a focus on value, and are committed to being in stock as we continue to support our customers' lifestyles.  For example, you will see wood pallet stack outs in the majority of our stores in preparation for the winter season. And right now, our 400-plus garden centers are showcasing pumpkins, mums, and fall harvest decor. And this year we expanded our Halloween and harvest decor program with a great lineup to capitalize on our customers' love for decorating their homes with on-trend seasonal indoor and outdoor decor, including a skeleton cow that was a TikTok viral sensation.  Additionally, and particularly in light of the continued warmer weather, we continue to be the destination for our customers' sporting goods, outdoor recreation, and outdoor wildlife interest, with products like our exclusive Royal Wing Bird Seed, Cannon Gun Safe, exclusive county line log splitters, and the Blackstone Griddle.  Earlier this week, we announced the addition of Yeti products to our lineup in our Fusion stores. We're especially excited to collaborate with a well-regarded brand like Yeti that brings a long-standing reputation for quality and durability and aligns with our customers' interest in camping, fishing, hunting and all outdoor activities.  Our stores and garden centers will soon be filled with Christmas trees, wreaths and poinsettias. In addition to live goods, our customers can look forward to unique and different decor items, including our popular six-foot chicken lawn decorations and farm-themed holiday gingerbread kits. When it comes to gifts, we have compelling values and buys in every section of our store, from tools and grills to even fun, rural unique items like a 12-volt zero-turn ride-on toy lawnmower.  From a calendar perspective, it's a good setup this year, with 31 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And Christmas falls on a Monday, so we anticipate a strong full weekend of sales prior to Christmas. We have a strong holiday season playbook with an exciting day-after-Thanksgiving day plan as well, with compelling offers programmed throughout the season. As we plan for the season though, we acknowledge there is a broader range of estimates for holiday consumer spending than we've seen over the last couple of years.  As we enter the fourth quarter, we're on track to achieve several milestones in our Life Out Here strategy. Notably, we anticipate ending the year with 40% of our store base in the Project Fusion format and nearly 500 garden centers, both significant milestones to initiatives that we began less than three years ago. Our real estate pipeline is robust, with plans for 80 new Tractor Supply stores also in 2024.  We're piloting artificial intelligence in many functions in the business, including marketing, supply chain, and technology development. And one particular application that I'm very excited about is our generative AI knowledge tool that we call \u2018Hey Gura.' Using a proprietary AI engine that we built, we're able to deliver knowledge directly to our team members through the headsets that each wear to augment their individual experience. Let me give you an example of this.  One of the questions recently asked by a team member is, when do you switch from crumble feed to pellet for baby chicks? When asked, the Hey Gura app responded, \u2018Typically chickens switch from crumble to pellet feed when they reach about 15 to 18 weeks of age, depending on breed and development.' To-date, the results have been excellent. Our team members are really embracing and excited about the technology, and it's been a great value-add feature for our leading customer service.  We have a long track record of growth and high expectations of performance. We view our current trends to these expectations as transitory and specific to the economic environment. This team is dialed in and understands the challenges. As we're entering one of the busiest periods in retail, my thanks and sincere appreciation goes out to my fellow 50,000 Tractor Supply team members for their dedication to our mission and value.  And with that, operator, we would now like to open the lines for questions. Yeah. Hey, Steven. The biggest change, very much consistent with what we expect when we said peak years of 2022 and 2023, are those big investments in the distribution centers. We will open that second new distribution center next year in 2024, but a majority of that capital is in 2023. So on a net capital spend that we're forecasting in the $725 to $775, if you back off of that into the $600's, the biggest majority of that is supply chain.  There's other efficiencies in there, such as we continue on our investments in the stores, such as Fusion and Garden Centers to re-engineer and find efficiencies in our investments. Really excited about the two newest formats that we are rolling out in the stores that we've been able to re-engineer and drive costs out of our Garden Center, and that's giving us even lower cost debt.  And then maybe the third thing would be the investments we made in 2023 on integration and remodeling the Orscheln stores. We'll be rolling off of that. I think those three things are the biggest difference, but no shift in our strategic investments. Yeah, hey Michael, good morning. Thanks for the question. Appreciate your participation in the call. You know, as it relates to discretionary, just one would acknowledge 15%-ish of our business kind of big ticket discretionary, mid-single digit negative comps, a slight improvement from sequentially from what we saw in the first half of the year, kind of in line with what we expected.  The myth throughout the entirety of this year for us has been our seasonal businesses. Our CUE business continues to perform very strong, with comps well above our reported total company comp performance with significant share gains happening in our CUE business. On our Q2 call or Q1 and Q2 calls, when we talked about seasonal, we acknowledged that there could be an element of the consumer spending discretionary piece that kind of seeps into that seasonal business. I would characterize the fall and winter business, though, more demand driven needs based than even spring, because in the winter, the businesses that are really strong for us and large and robust are things like wood pellets and propane.  In fact, three of our top 10 skews during the winter season are two wood pellet skews and the propane skew. Those are demand driven needs based. When it's cold, people, are burning the pellets in their wood stoves or they are using propane for heating other homes or supplemental heating. And when it's not cold, they are not. And this time last year, actually as we entered Q3, the last week of Q2 and as we entered Q3, it was we had cooler weather and then that continued throughout the balance of Q3.  We didn't, have that at all this year. And then even as we're heading into Q4 here, it's going to be 80 degrees this weekend in Boston. You just don't need wood pellets and you don't need propane during that time. And so you can see it very clearly in our business.  On the flip side, we are seeing strength in outdoor projects, outdoor wildlife, those sorts of categories, whether it's grilling, whether it's deer corn and the deer hunting season. You can certainly see it in the lawn and garden categories, even in riding lawnmowers. Those businesses this time of year though are just not large enough to offset. Even with nice growth in those categories, they are just not large enough to offset those sorts of pieces that are demand driven.  We also do sell a lot of insulated outerwear type categories, whether its coats and a lot, fleece lined pants and those sorts of things, gloves, boots. I think as it gets cold, I would expect those to not be lost sales. But there is an element of like wood pellets and propane that once you don't have that cold weather, you do lose it. I think we are being prudent in our implied guidance for the fourth quarter. Last year, we didn't have \u2013 it was not \u2013 it was a warmish November. So there \u2013 but we know there's an El Nino that's in forecast right now. And so we just thought it'd be prudent to not assume that we'd have any upside as we lapped that in November, as we talked about in our prepared remarks.  And then of course we're hurtling [ph] or we're comping on top of a robust storm from last year that, as we noted in our Q4 earnings call last year, contributed two points of comp to the quarter. Yeah, I think that's a fair way to \u2013 that's an absolutely fair way to say it. And the only thing that I would add is. Hey Michael, the only thing I would add is, Kurt's prepared remarks talked about our commitment to our long-term operating margin guidance, inclusive of next year. I'd also add, we see a lot of opportunities for continued operating expense control next year, namely as Kurt mentioned, freight and a number of other levers.  And I think we've demonstrated this year that we have a number of levers that we can pull to continue to support the underlying profitability of the business, and also can control what we can control.  We certainly don't see an outlook next year as you implied, as potential for negative decline in EPS. I mean, if you look at the underlying strength of our business, whether it's in consumer, our number of shoppers in our stores, our customer satisfaction, our market share gains, all those sorts of things, we've never been more confident in the underlying foundation of our business. Good morning and thank you for your question. First off, I'd say this is an area that we have been focused on for the last few years. We've gone from roughly five mixing centers to 15 mixing centers over the last three years. That has given us the ability to have more replenishment going into the stores of full pallet quantities of our big moving SKUs.  The second thing is the expansion of our DCs from eight to nine and the next year 10. Also gives us additional outbound capacity to be able to deliver more frequently to our stores. We now have over, I think it's 500 or 600 stores now that receive shipments twice a week from our distribution centers. The remaining stores all receive shipments once a week. So it's not that we have stores receiving it less than that. But yeah, we're constantly looking at ways we can drive in stock.  What I would leave you with is, our in stock rate right now is the best it's been, as Kurt said in his prepared remarks, really since the pandemic began. We feel very good about our in stock rates right now. Our team's done an excellent job, I think, managing inventory. If you look at our inventory growth, it's in control.  If you look at our in stock rates, they are excellent. You look at our shrink numbers below last year and that last year was below two years ago. So I think on all sides of inventory, quality, quantity, in stock rates, we feel very good. But continue to challenge yourself to increase frequency and get smarter and smarter in our tools, like our new RELEX replenishment and allocation system to be able to keep improving our performance on inventory. But, I feel very good about it. As I said, our in stock rates are the best they've been really since the pandemic. Hey, good morning, Chris. And thanks for your question and participation in the call. I would just reiterate what we said in our prepared remarks, that we continue to see the consumer being discerning in their spend, particularly in discretionary. I mean, I think we've all seen the charts on PCE spend and the shift from goods to services. We've all been looked at how good spending is occurring and how that's shifting across the various retail sectors.  The sector we play in is the most sticky, the least impacted by that. You go look at electronics and appliances. You look at furniture. You look at home improvement. You look at all the other categories. They are all performing well below kind of our normal, our sector. But nonetheless, we are seeing some modest impact from the discerning spend.  We also said weather is not off to a great start for us in Q4. There's a very strong El Nino pattern occurring. That typically is a warmer winter season. It's 80 degrees this weekend in Boston. And then as you said, we're lapping the strong storm from last year, which we recorded two points to.  So we just think you put all that together and it's appropriate to be prudent in our outlook for the fourth quarter in that kind of mid-single digit, low to mid-single digit current negative, and I don't think it's indicative of anything structural in the business.  We see it as very transitory to the current moment. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we had active customer growth in Q3. We had new customer growth in Q3. We had reactivated customer growth in Q3. Our customer satisfaction scores are at all-time highs.  Our market share gains are very strong right now across the board. In PET, this past quarter, our share gains were as strong as they've been since the pandemic. And again, our underlying business is very strong. I'm confident that in the context of retail goods spending, even though the tide is shifting out for all, that we're going to be standing tall amongst that. I'd start by saying what is our value proposition? And our value proposition is to be that dependable supplier for life out here. And again, I'd reiterate, we're seeing the customers in our stores. They are shopping us at record levels.  That said, when they are shopping us, they are spending a little bit less items per basket, right, kind of to the tune of a low single-digit headwind, and they are pulling back a little bit on discretionary. Those are consistent themes that we've had really for the last few quarters.  We haven't really seen any acceleration in that. It's really been more of a consistent theme. But again, for us, the seasonal weather, the seasonal businesses have been a huge departure from what our outlook and expectations have been all year long.  But nonetheless, I think you're going to continue to see for the near term, the consumer spend continuing to shift to services from goods and kind of rebalancing. And I think you're going to see discretionary retail businesses continuing to take the brunt of that as we turn the quarter of this year into next year."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. There are three key observations about our business that build on Hal's comments that I'd like to share before diving into the quarterly results.  First, looking at the impact of weather. There are some years weather works to our favor and others where it clearly works against us. We've certainly tried to be transparent over the years as to the impact from the volatility related to weather, both in favorable and unfavorable events. No doubt 2023 will be a year where weather goes down as unfavorable for our business.  From a warm January, a late start to the spring that never materialized over most of our markets, to a hot and dry summer across major markets like Texa-Homa and the Midwest, our seasonal businesses have been under pressure all year.  Second, our execution continues to be strong. Our Life Out Here initiatives are performing well and are positively impacting our results. Neighbor's Club, Project Fusion and Garden Centers, pet and digital initiatives are all driving top line growth.  Third, we view the softness in our customers' retail spending to be unique to the macro challenges in the current environment. Our customer engagement is strong and our initiatives are driving positive results. We remain committed to investing for long-term growth, but we will be agile as we navigate the current environment. We are committed to continuing our track record of long-term value creation for our shareholders.  Now, turning to our third quarter results. While our sales trends were below our expectations, the team managed the environment well, controlling what we can control. We also remain steadfast in our commitment to being the dependable supplier for Life Out Here.  Our third quarter top-line results were driven by strong and consistent CUE growth, offset by below trend seasonal performance and a weak summer demand and a lack of early fall seasonal sales, and discretionary big ticket sales remained under pressure.  Our comparable store sales growth was solid in regions such as the southeast and the far west. The performance of these geo regions was offset by pressure in Texa-homa and the Midwest, where heat and drought trends added incremental pressure on consumer demand, as well as the warm start to the fall in the northern markets.  Comparable transactions were flat for the quarter, with growth in our core year-round categories being offset by reduced demand for our seasonal categories. We had a modest decline in the average comp ticket. Our average unit retail was up 3% to 4%. The benefit of the growth in our average unit retail was offset by the softness in big ticket and declines in seasonal categories, which run at a higher average ticket. Additionally, but to a lesser extent, we continue to experience softer sales and discretionary and impulse add-on items, putting pressure on the average units per transaction.  Moving down our income statement, our gross profit increased 7.3% to $1.25 billion. Gross margin increased 101 basis points to 36.7% from 35.6% in the prior year's third quarter. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter as we continue to maintain strong product margin from our ongoing execution of everyday low price strategy.  At a time when the overall promotional environment across retail has picked up modestly, our large and robust membership of Neighbors Club offers us a great way to provide value. Our loyalty program allows us, together with our vendors, to strategically target value propositions for our customers.  The gross margin rate increase was primarily attributable to lower transportation costs, driven by improvements in the global supply chain and efficiencies from our new distribution center in Ohio. Product mix pressured gross margin given the strength in CUE. This was somewhat offset by the margin improvement from lower big ticket sales, which carry a lower gross margin rate.  As a percent of net sales, our selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 38 basis points to 26.7%. The increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of our new DC, along with some lost fixed cost leverage due to the decline in comparable store sales.  Additionally, consistent with last quarter, higher medical claims also contributed to the increase in SG&A. We have made adjustments to our benefits program and will continue to do so. We don't anticipate this to be a headwind in 2024.  During the quarter we completed the planned sale lease back of 10 Tractor Supply store locations, benefiting SG&A by approximately 70 basis points, net of transaction and repair costs. Additionally, the increase in SG&A was partially offset by a one-time benefit to depreciation expense of approximately 35 basis points or $11 million pre-tax. This benefit is attributed to a change in the useful lives of assets for certain remodeled stores, due to a reassessment of lease terms to better represent the economic profile of these investments.  As I reflect on the SG&A performance overall, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that our operations team did a great job scaling our core variable costs to our sales performance. Our distribution center teams achieved some of the best cut times, fill rates and overall productivity measures in years. And our store teams did a great job balancing store payroll to scale back, while also maintaining the right level of customer support and driving our best-in-class customer satisfaction scores. Overall, the team had strong execution and scaled our core variable costs well in this environment.  As an example, to further illustrate, nearly 85% of our core SG&A dollar growth year-over-year represents investments in our strategic growth initiatives. My appreciation goes out to the team for controlling what we could control. For the quarter, operating profit margin was 10%, a 62 basis point improvement from the prior year.  Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $2.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, flat to the prior year on a per store basis. We are managing it closely and continue to be very pleased with the quality and position of our inventory. Our in-stock rates are the best they've been in over two years. In addition, our inventory shrink improved year-over-year.  With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2x. Our long-term debt has no nearing maturities and it's fixed at very attractive rates.  Now, let me turn to our updated fiscal 2023 financial outlook. For the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $14.5 billion to $14.6 billion and comp store sales even with last year. Our full year operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 10.1% to 10.2%, with net income of $1.1 billion to $1.11 billion. Diluted EPS is forecast to be $10 to $10.10. This includes a net after tax benefit of about $0.08 in Q4 for our remaining sale leaseback transactions this year.  We continue to forecast anticipated capital expenditures for the year in the range of $800 million to $850 million or about $725 million to $775 million net of our capital needs for the fixed fee real estate strategy that we shared last quarter. This higher level reflects the move to own development for select new store growth that will be funded through the sale of existing stores. It's important to note that the proceeds from the sale of our own stores are expected to offset the incremental capital outlay under the development program. The combined transactions are expected to be relatively neutral to our cash position.  Implied in our outlook is for fourth quarter comp store sales to be down low to mid-single digits. As Hal mentioned, we anticipate continued discerning consumer spending and unfavorable compares relating to weather as we experience the ongoing El Nino pattern, combined with the cycling of last year's monumental winter storm, which drove 200 basis points of favorable impact on comps.  We anticipate continued strength in our core year-round categories, yet the softness in demand for seasonal and discretionary will continue to limit the top side on our performance. As a reminder, we are also lapping the 53rd week, which included an extra week of sales in the prior year, contributing approximately $225 million to top line sales and $0.16 of diluted earnings per share.  As for retail price increases, our plans reflect a continued moderation of inflation. While still positive, we believe it will be modest. Our guidance reflects ongoing gross margin expansion year-over-year. We anticipate continued benefit from transportation and our new distribution center, along with some pressure from an unfavorable product mix. In the fourth quarter, we expect continued SG&A deleverage given our investments and the expected comparable store sales declines.  As we shared last quarter, for modeling purposes, the Orscheln stores will go into our comp calculation in 2024, based on when the store is converted to our point of sale system. Most stores converted to our point of sale during Q2 and Q3 of this year.  As is customary, we will provide our guidance for 2024 at our fourth quarter earnings call. We're still finalizing our outlook for sales, as there are a number of puts and takes to be considered. Let's start with the fact that we're a needs-based, demand-driven business, with a long history of positive comps.  Additionally, as we see 2024 today, we expect we'll have less benefit from inflation, but we're 18 months into cycling big ticket softness. And the weather, hopefully, cannot be worse than it was this year. But we do anticipate that the operating environment will continue to be challenging with a higher than normal degree of uncertainty and ongoing pressure on consumer confidence and household budgets.  As we've shared over the last couple of years, we've always planned that 2023 would be our peak capital investment level. With that as a backdrop, we plan to prudently invest in our strategic priorities in 2024, with next year's net capital spending in the 600's, which will relieve some depreciation expense. We remain excited about the progress on our Life Out Here strategy and are very pleased with our initiatives.  Our 10th distribution center will open during the second quarter of 2024. Much like our distribution center opening this year, this new DC benefits gross margin, but will pressure our SG&A as the facility ramps up. The gross margin benefits typically lag the opening by about one quarter.  Similar to 2023, we anticipate executing approximately 15 existing store sale leaseback transaction in 2024 to fund the own development new store program, and we anticipate the opening of 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 10 to 15 Petsense locations.  Over our history, we have continually adapted to the operating environment around us. The needs-based, demand-driven characteristics of our product offerings support our ability to continue to be a winner in retail. We will remain agile and play offense. We will leverage our core competencies that have served us well, all while strengthening our capabilities and investing in our Life Out Here growth strategy.  Now, I will turn the call over to Hal to wrap us up. Hey Scott. This is Kurt, and good morning. First, let me just start by saying, we still see an environment where there's some net inflation year-over-year while modest. Inflation is clearly slowing, but not turning to deflation at this point. And specific to some of the categories, we are seeing, there's areas this year where there's year-over-year deflation, particularly areas like bird feed, livestock feed, corn based. Yeah, there's some level of deflation.  But there's areas like you mentioned, where we're still seeing some level of inflation still in the system, such as pet food. And then there's most of our areas in our product categories, what I describe as they've hit a plateau. It's stable, and we're running pretty consistent. And as that moves to the pipeline, very much consistent with our outlook for this year and beyond, was that we start to moderate down to a low single digit level of inflation in 2023.  Too early to really say for 2024, but the general call would be that things begin to stabilize. Inflation, deflation is not as much of a factor in the average ticket that it's been over the past few years, and it's more stabilized and neutralish. And we're certainly focused on it. This team works consistently in environments of change and inflation, deflation, have a history performing very well. Know that we're monitoring it. I'll be able to share more information on that in the fourth quarter call when we give our outlook for 2024. Yes, in general, our history has been that in a deflationary environment we're able to leverage our scale, manage our retail pricing. It generally produces a benefit on the rate, just like inflation did over the last few years, put a bit of pressure on that rate. And we managed both environments very well, and historically it's been as you described it. Yeah, Peter. On SG&A, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I felt one of the highlights was how the team managed pivoting off of a number of years and quarters with strong top line sales, to scale to the appropriate level of volume for Q3. And it just shows our ability to be agile in that case.  To your point on the 85% was growth, some of the things that really played out to help drive the core SG&A to a really low growth level. First area, supply chain, and I mentioned this in the previous last couple quarters. We had built the supply chain almost through muscle, 3PL, other areas that distribution centers were running at max capacity or above that level and that was inefficient.  We've been able to shut off some of the 3PL higher costs. The team is running at some of the highest level of productivity. So one of our biggest areas of leverage in a flat to slight negative comp sales environment was our distribution supply chain, as they actually leveraged as a percent of sales because of productivity. John and team focusing on scaling down task or non-customer service work to modestly drive hours down, that also reflects some of the SG&A benefits.  In general, in an environment that there is softer demand at Tractor Supply, as we look ahead to even future quarters and next year, we'll plan and scale our core levels of investments and our operating expenses in line with our sales growth.  And then from there, this team will continue to claw back inflationary pressures, even in operating expenses that have embedded over the last few years. And this is a team that's been built with lean management, continuous improvement in our DNA, and we have profit improvement goals. And those are all things as we plan ahead to 2024 that gives us confidence in our ability to manage and still hold to our long-term algorithm and targets on operating margin. Yeah, Michael, this is Kurt. Gross margin has certainly been not only a high point for this quarter, this year, but to your point, what we've been able to accomplish, leveraging our scale and size in the last years has been a real testament to the team.  I'll give you a few examples of why we believe this is a sustainable gross margin, and most of it is around the structural nature of it. As you think ahead, I'll first acknowledge, as we continue to grow in CUE and take market share, it puts a little bit of pressure from product mix. And we've been cycling and absorbing those gross margin expansions with higher pressure from CUE mix in the past few years, more than we would see going forward.  Supply chain benefits have really been one of the top two areas of gross margin expansion. And we've seen and come off some of the highest supply chain costs. We've absorbed some of the inefficiencies in the robust, fast growth period. So the supply chain costs, declining transportation costs, improvement in the reduced miles from new distribution centers are all structural.  And as you think about transportation costs, you think about it as in this particular time, we are still in an environment where transportation costs, both domestic and import, are higher than the pre-pandemic levels. I'm not saying that we expect to revert back to pre-pandemic norms, but I think the important thing is that we're not coming off of a new extreme low, but yet coming off of some of the highs. And then the second most impactful piece of gross margin is the structural sustained difference of coming off promotionals that were embedded into our normal programs and really leveraging EDLP and Neighbor's Clubs. So the biggest drivers are structural. We expect to be able to change those. And the benefit that our fast team has driven in our production, not only in sales, but the funding from our vendors is structurally in there as well.  So we anticipate to be able to have continued gross margin expansion. And even next year, as you think about seasonal, it may be able to bounce back and that has higher margins. So we have a lot of expectations on our ability to sustain and even expand gross margin for those reasons. Yeah. I'll take that one. I mean, I'd have to just go to this is still very early in our planning cycle. This business has been resilient in regards to our ability to maintain our comp sales. It's so much of a needs based core business in there that we are planning for some uncertainty.  There are some headwinds on the consumer, but we got strong strategic initiatives. We're lapping some difficult challenges from the seasonal business. And we can be nimble, but I'm just not going to try to predict or go down a path of what level of comps or how low it could be because this business has a track record. In 30 years we've had one year of negative comps and it was ever so slightly. And we're confident in our ability to produce strong sales performance. Oliver, yeah, I'd frame it up as it's going to be a mix of both of those. We had, a slight average ticket decline in Q3. Some of those pressures on average ticket will, we expect to persist into Q4. But transactions are what gets impacted and did get impacted by the monumental winter storm last year.  With our expectations, as we mentioned, this is not framing up to be an ideal fourth quarter weather. That demand would play out in transactions, and in our evaluation, it's going to be a mix of both transactions and ticket. And implied in our guidance would be a negative comp transaction for that reason."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin by thanking the 52,000 Tractor Supply team members for their commitment to each other and our customers and for their dedication to serving life out here. Our team is executing at a high level and did a nice job nimbly adjusting in the second quarter. We're operating in a tougher environment than we expected at the beginning of the quarter, and certainly tougher than what we forecasted as we entered the year. Consumer spending continues to shift in favor of services. Shoppers that are tired of inflation are being judicious on their baskets. Consumers continue to pull back on discretionary purchases. And additionally, our business was further impacted by the abnormal seasonal trends, particularly in the month of June. Despite this environment, we still expect 2023 to be a pretty solid year. Our customer is healthy and we're gaining share outgrowing our market by 2x, and we are significantly outpacing total U.S. retail sales growth. We anticipate that we will have positive sales comps and positive comp transactions for the year, albeit in the low-single-digits range. And importantly, net sales and earnings will grow strong mid-single-digits on top of a 53rd week last year. We have a long track record of growth and high expectations of performance. We view our underperformance to these expectations as specific to the current environment. The team has dialed-in and understands the challenges. For the remainder of the call today, I'll speak to a few highlights of the second quarter and then share an update on our Life Out Here strategy. John Ordus will then provide greater insights on our real estate strategy and our plans to accelerate our store growth. And then Kurt will follow John and share further details on the second quarter and our full-year outlook. So let's dig in. All right. Turning into the second quarter. We grew net sales by 7.2% with comparable store sales up 2.5%, and diluted EPS was $3.83, an increase of nearly 9%. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by transaction growth of 1.8% and ticket growth of 0.6%. We expected and were pleased to see comp transactions turn back positive, and this trend has continued into Q3. We began the quarter with mid-single-digit comp sales growth in both April and May. As we moved through the month of June, we experienced a noticeable slowdown in our seasonal categories with the period coming in modestly positive. In my 25 years in retail, June was one of the most topsy-turvy months that I've seen: smoke, drought, storms, heat, it had a little bit of it all. As mentioned, our customer base is healthy. Our active customer counts are stable and growing. Importantly, our new customer trends have leveled out after a period of lapping tremendous growth in 2020 and 2021. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to break records and improve year-over-year. And customer demographic trends continue to trend younger and more female than pre-pandemic. Our Neighbor's Club reached a record 31 million members in the quarter, an increase of 5 million members in the last year. We're seeing continued favorable trends from our loyalty members. Retention rates remain at all-time highs. Neighbor's Club members continue comping at a faster rate than our overall performance and our high value members reached a record count in the quarter. A few key trends that we're seeing our customers as follows. One, customers are increasing in their usage of credit. Two, shoppers continue to seek out value, particularly in our lower income customers. And three, customers are buying a little more often, but a little less per trip. Now, shifting from our customer to our categories. Our year-round categories were up mid-single-digits indicative of our ongoing market share gains and our demand-driven needs-based business model. Our consumable, usable, and edible categories continue to deliver strong, stable performance and drive trips to Tractor Supply. In this quarter, CUE categories had growth in the low-double-digits. In companion animal, we are gaining substantial share throughout the category. Again this quarter, we have sequential increases in the number of customers shopping us for this category each week. In livestock, our Spring Chick Days event was one of the largest ever for us with the poultry category up strong double-digits. We believe we're on track to exceed last year's record of 11 million birds sold. Not only are we seeing growth from existing customers, we are also experiencing robust growth in new customers to the category, and this is driving both trips and ticket. Our seasonal categories were flat and below expectations. The miss was primarily in June when as mentioned previously, there were a number of choppy environmental conditions across our markets that resulted in the consumer not being as engaged in the categories we expected. This softer seasonal performance in June had a material impact on our second quarter performance and was the main driver of our miss versus our expectations. Our big ticket sales were down in that high-single digits and in line with our expectations. And in fact, our performance in the quarter was a sequential improvement from the first quarter. The most significant pressure in the quarter was in zero turns, generators, and recreational vehicles. On the real estate front, we opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, we've seen the cadence of our new store openings return to a more normalized rate. Our Petsense by Tractor Supply business is performing well and comps in the quarter were greater than overall Tractor Supply. And the integration of Orscheln is right on track. Today, we fully transitioned and re-grand opened 15 locations. We remain very pleased with the customer's response as we convert to the Tractor Supply brand. Although, the operating environment may be different than we anticipated as we enter the year, I'm incredibly proud of how the team has come together to navigate the various circumstances and control what we can control. Now transitional an update on our Life Out Here strategy. We remain very confident in our long-term growth outlook. We participate in a large, fragmented, attractive market. We continue to benefit from numerous structural tailwinds, including rural revitalization, homesteading, self-reliance, and pet ownership. We have numerous substantive competitive advantages and are investing to expand them through our Life Out Here strategy. Since we first embarked on our strategy in the fall of 2020, the team has made remarkable progress on the transformation of Tractor Supply. As a reminder, the five pillars of our strategy include: deliver legendary customer experiences, advance our one tractor capabilities, operate the tractor way, go the country mile for our team, and generate healthy shareholder returns. And the key initiatives that support this strategy include our Project Fusion Store remodels, our Garden Center transformation, our Neighbor's Club loyalty program, and the expansion of our omni-channel capabilities. Our Project Fusion Store layout is now in over 700 stores representing greater than 30% of our store base. This program is enhancing our space productivity with improved layout, signage, skew expansions, and improved adjacencies. And for remodels, it also offers an improved customer shopping experience that is much more contemporary. Complementing Project Fusion is the side lot transformation, which is leveraging and expanding our existing outdoor side lot retail space to drive greater productivity and convenience with the addition of a Garden Center and a drive-through pickup lane to support our omni-channel technology investments. With more than 400 Garden Centers today, we've significantly expanded our assortment of lawn and garden products that are relevant to our customer's lifestyle. Importantly, these two projects are delivering on our return expectations. They're providing material sales lists. We're seeing improvement in customer satisfaction, and we're seeing higher levels of new customer acquisition in these remodeled stores. Also, our execution on the remodels continues to improve as we're in the year three now of the effort and we're reducing project costs and also continuing to shorten construction times. We re-launched our Neighbor's Club program to a points-based structure in April of 2021, and the timing was very fortuitous, as it allowed us to lock in the millions of new customers that found us through the pandemic. In total, since the re-launch, our membership has increased by 12 million members, a 60% increase. Additionally, the design of the program has facilitated upward spend migration, and driven strong retention rates. Lastly, the program provides invaluable insight into our customer behavior and allows us to personalize our offerings tailored to their needs. Look for us to evolve the structure again sometime in the next 12 months to 18 months to further enhance value for our members. Underpinning our strategy, our substantial investments in our distribution network to support the significant sales increase and store growth. Today, our network is achieving record service levels and the strongest productivity we've experienced in the last five years. Our new state-of-the-art distribution center in Navarre, Ohio, and our increased count of mixing centers now up to 15 and the implementation of engineered labor standards are all contributing to this performance. Today, I'm excited to share with you a new strategic focus area that we've been working on for a little over a year. The transformation of our real estate model enabled by a number of new capabilities that is designed to deliver material benefit to both revenue growth and operating margin rate, and reinforced our long-term guidance. First, we're raising our new store growth target. We now believe there's a 3,000 store opportunity domestically for Tractor Supply. This is supported by our total addressable market of more than $180 billion our robust growth and our ongoing market share gains. Our new target represents an increase of 200 stores, and we believe we continue to have significant runway for growth with high return new stores. Second, we're implementing new capabilities to enable owned development of new store builds. This capability is expected to generate significant construction cost savings and allowing for lower rents in these applicable stores once we sell them post-construction. Third, we're also announcing plans to periodically execute sale leaseback transactions of our existing ownership of 117 stores, and we're going to have a step up in our ongoing build of stores back to 90 stores per year starting in 2025. Today's real estate announcement extends our runway for growth and reinforces our long-term financial model. It's a compelling addition to our Life Out Here strategy that will further solidify our growth for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to John who can share some more color on our real estate strategy.\nJohn Ordus: Thank you, Hal. It's an exciting time for the store operations in real estate team. As we embark a new ways to capture growth and market share, while also driving efficiencies in our real estate processes. Over the last year, we've installed new leadership and talent in our real estate team. This has allowed us to reevaluate where we are in the natural progression of our store growth plans and our ability to leverage our real estate capital structure. This new approach will allow us to realize cost savings and be more nimble with our store portfolio. Our strong outlook for new store growth is direct correlation of the millions of new customers we have acquired and our overall sales performance over the last several years. This provides us with nearly a decade of new store growth in the United States. We believe these are low risk, high return, organic growth opportunities. We anticipate accelerating our new store growth from approximately 70 stores this year to 80 in 2024 and 90 new stores in 2025 and beyond. Opening highly productive new stores is a core strength and competency of Tractor Supply. We continue strong new store productivity metrics with performance outpacing our historical investment thesis, and our stores are profitable in year one. As part of our growth plans, let's start with new stores. We have developed a new sales forecasting model to determine new stores mature sales, and pro forma results to develop our total market store growth opportunity of 3,000 stores. This was the first update to our modeling process in four years. We have infused the process with a machine learning model and insights from our 31 million Neighbor's Club members. This gives us tremendous confidence to raise our outlook by 200 stores for a total of 3,000 Tractor Supply stores in the U.S. To capture its growth, the real estate team is ramping up our pipeline to allow us to accelerate our store openings to 90 new stores by 2025. We are on track to open approximately 70 new stores this year with a step up to 80 new stores in 2024. We have a robust pipeline of new stores in our sites over the next 24 months. In fact, our pipeline is at the best level of development since prior to the pandemic. The team is also building new capabilities to optimize our real estate portfolio. For instance, we'll start own development of stores this year through a fixed fee developer model, and over time anticipate self-development in new stores. This year, we anticipate 20 to 30 of our new stores will be in our own development pipeline for 2024 new store openings, many of which will begin development in this year. A benefit of these new programs is our ability to have more control and visibility in this development process. The great news is that we estimate these capabilities will result at a 10% to 20% estimated rent reduction as compared to a developer model build. This rent reduction helps us continue and improve our new store returns. Part of the investment in creation of this development model requires more upfront cash. It is exciting that we are able to fund this through the sale lease back of 10 to 15 stores this year out of the 117 stores that we owned. Going forward, we find to use the sale lease back program on both existing owned stores as well as new store openings. This program will help fund our planned owned store development. It will also capture value in currently owned stores. With nearly 2,200 stores, we are also strategically investing in and optimizing our existing store portfolio as part of the lease renewal cycle. All stores will go through an in-depth review to ensure we have the right real estate strategy in place. We'll then take action to ensure that all stores have the right location, size, facility, rent structure, and format. These factors are critical to the success of our team and stores to deliver legendary customer service. With that, let me now pass it over to Kurt for our financial review.\nKurt Barton: Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone on the call. Turning to our second quarter results. While our sales trends were below our expectations, I commend the team on how they have remained nimble and steadfast in our commitment to be the dependable supplier for Life Out Here. In many ways, our second quarter top-line results were very consistent with our results in the first quarter with strong CUE growth, flattish, seasonal performance, and a decline in big ticket sales. Our comparable store sales growth was the strongest in the Far West, South Atlantic and Texas, Oklahoma. The strength of these regions was offset by pressure in the Northeast and Midwest regions were seasonal trends added incremental pressure on consumer demand. Comp sales in the quarter benefited by about 5 percentage points from retail price inflation. Most of this inflation reflects retail price increases that were put in place in the second half of 2022 that we have not laughed as of yet. Much like the first quarter, the benefit of price inflation to our average ticket growth was offset by the impact of three factors. First, the average ticket was impacted by the softness in big ticket and declines in seasonal categories, which run at a higher average ticket. Second, we also experienced softer sales in discretionary and impulse add-on items. Third, on a positive note, we also saw our customers shopping us more frequently with a slight reduction in the number of items per basket. Overall, our customers are buying more units or pounds from us in total. Moving down our income statement. Our gross profit increased 9.3% to $1.51 billion. Gross margin increased 69 basis points to 36.2% from 35.5% in the prior year's second quarter. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter as we continue to maintain strong product margin from our ongoing execution of an everyday low price strategy. The gross margin rate increase was primarily attributable to lower transportation costs driven by improvements in the global supply chain and efficiencies from our new distribution center in Navarre, Ohio. Product mix pressured gross margin given the strength in CUE. This was somewhat offset by the margin improvement from lower big ticket sales, which carry a lower gross margin rate. As a percent of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses including depreciation amortization increased 77 basis points to 22.8%. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of our new DC. Additionally, higher medical claims also contributed to the increase in SG&A. The growth in medical claims is due to new benefit offerings that had stronger engagement rates than we anticipated, as well as higher program costs overall. We have made some adjustments to the program and will continue to do so. We don't anticipate this to be a headwind in 2024. Approximately 80% of our SG&A growth year-over-year represents investments for growth such as new stores, the impact of Orscheln Farm and Home, the new DC, and the depreciation from our capital investments for items such as Project Fusion remodels and Garden Center transformations. The core SG&A costs leveraged well, even in a low comp sales environment. Overall, the team had strong execution and scaled our core costs to our sales performance. For the quarter operating profit margin was 13.4%, an 8 basis points declined from the prior year. Consistent with our guidance from the year, Orscheln stores had a modest drag on operating income, principally due to factors unique to the transition. In Q2, we attribute approximately 10 basis points of operating margin decline to activities relating to Orscheln. Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $2.7 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing a decrease of 1.7% in average inventory per store. We are pleased with the quality of our inventory as we enter the second half of the year. During the second quarter, we strategically issued $750 million in long-term debt, which brings our weighted average fixed rate to 3.4%. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2x. At Tractor Supply, we are committed to building on our track record of long-term value creation for our shareholders. Our real estate portfolio management is another way that we can continue to facilitate strong returns. Let me shift now to share a few financial highlights as a result of the evolution of our real estate strategy. The sale lease back of 10 to 15 owned stores is anticipated to close during the second half of the year, resulting in a net after-tax benefit of about $0.20 per share. We are under contract on 10 stores and expect to close on those stores in the third quarter. The expected net gain reflects a selective reinvestment of a small portion of the benefit from the sale back into our store infrastructure this year. For modeling purposes, the net gains will be recorded in operating income as an offset to SG&A. Given the migration to our new real estate development strategy, we anticipate that we have about a decade of runway from the sale of existing company-owned stores ahead of us. This increases cash flow over the coming years and is a great way for us to leverage the strength of our balance sheet. The more efficient owned development program is expected to drive lower new store rent. As the program ramps, these savings are anticipated to more than offset the incremental rent expense from the sale leaseback of existing stores. In 2025 and beyond, the acceleration of our new store growth to about 90 stores annually should help us capture market share and bolster the high end of our long-term guidance ranges. We continue to have very robust new store economics providing us the confidence to make this shift. Now let me turn to our updated fiscal 2023 financial outlook. At the halfway point of the year, we are now forecasting low-single-digit comp sales and mid to high-single-digit earnings growth. We continue to believe this will be a year of solid performance for us as we continue to gain market share and advance our strategic initiatives. We are carefully watching many leading macroeconomic indicators, consumer behavior and retail trends, as well as our own insights to assess the health of the consumer. While our customers remained healthy, we are more cautious about their discretionary spending in the second half of the year. At the same time, we are moderating our expectations for the performance of our seasonal categories based on our trends in the first half of the year that have been choppy and below our expectations. We believe it is prudent to recalibrate our expectations for both the discretionary and seasonal categories based on our year-to-date trends. For the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $14.8 billion to $14.9 billion, comp store sales growth of 1.3% to 2.5% growth. Our operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 10.2% to 10.3% with net income of $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion. Diluted EPS is forecast to be $10.20 to $10.40. This includes a net after-tax benefit of about $0.20 per share for the sale leaseback. We anticipate about $0.15 will be recognized in Q3 and $0.05 in Q4. In the light of the updates to our real estate strategy, anticipated capital expenditures for the year are now forecasted to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million compared to our prior range of $700 million to $775 million. This increase reflects the move to own development for select new store growth that will be funded through the sale of existing stores. It is important to note that the proceeds from the sale of our owned stores are expected to offset the incremental capital outlay under the development program. The combined transactions are expected to be relatively neutral to our cash position. As to the calendarization between the third and fourth quarters, we continue to believe that comp sales will be stronger in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. Both quarters are modeled to achieve comp sales growth. Please keep in mind that we are laughing a monumental winter storm in the fourth quarter of 2022 that we estimate contributed 200 basis points to comp sales in the quarter. As for retail price increases, our plans continue to reflect a moderation from the impact of inflation. At the same time, we would anticipate a pickup in our comp transaction growth as we experienced this quarter. Our guidance reflects ongoing gross margin expansion in the second half of the year. We anticipate continued benefit from transportation and the new distribution center, along with some pressure from unfavorable product mix. For the third quarter, our SG&A performance exclusive of the sale leaseback is anticipated to be in line with the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, however, we expect a modest deleverage given the comparisons from the prior year. For modeling purposes the Orscheln stores will go into our comp calculation in 2024 based on when the store is converted to our point of sale system. We will share more details when we provide our 2024 outlook. Looking ahead, we will remain agile and play offense. We will leverage our core competencies that have served us well all while strengthening our capabilities and investing in our Life Out Here growth strategy. For Tractor Supply, we expect to end the year in a strong position for the future. Now, I'll turn the call over to Hal to wrap us up.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Kurt. Stepping back, Tractor Supply has achieved remarkable growth over the past few years and the team has done an excellent job scaling our processes, capabilities, and organization to manage this growth. Key operational areas like inventory and payroll grew materially but at a lesser rate than sales and were always in control. Key philosophies like EDLP were re-embraced and our marketing media mix shifted fully away from print to digital. And the combination of these two enabled our promotional activity to achieve all-time lows and we remain there. In addition to these efforts, we launched our Life Out Here strategy to continue the ongoing transformation of our business. This strategy helped lock-in new customers, substantiate our market share gains, and is a platform for our future growth. The timing could not have been better. At the halfway mark of 2023, it is shaping up to be a solid year for Tractor Supply on top of three extraordinary years. Our market is stable and our customers remain healthy. The team is effectively controlling what we control. As we celebrate our 85th anniversary, Tractor Supply remains a unique highly differentiated retailer. Our needs-based business model has a track record of growing through various economic conditions. As a company, we have a proven ability to manage through dynamic environments whether that is a macroeconomic or seasonal weather trends. Our customers and team members are passionate about the Out Here lifestyle and they prioritize it. Our customers over indexes homeowners, landowners, pet owners, and animal owners. As a market leader, we have substantial advantages that are getting stronger every day. Additionally, investment in our Life Out Here strategy has critical mass. The natural evolution of our real estate strategy is furthering our competitive advantages. We see meaningful growth potential in our markets. I remain extremely confident that we have a tremendous runway growth ahead of us, and with the right team and the right strategy, we're continuing to build a strong foundation for the future. With that, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Karen Short with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nKaren Short: Hi, thanks very much for taking my question. I'm going to just kind of roll two into one, if that's okay. So the first question and tied into the second was that I think you always had the assumption that your kind of comp would be 1% to 2% above GDP and that relationship doesn't seem to be holding right now. So I just want to talk about that. And then excluding the benefit of the sale leaseback, you had also kind of indicated 2023 would be the peak investment period for you, and then we should start see to see operating margin expansion in 2024. Is this still your thinking? And I guess I'm again excluding the sale leaseback development and then benefit. Thanks very much.\nHal Lawton: Hey, Karen, good morning, and thanks for joining the call. On your first part of the question, a bit to my comments earlier, we see this period of time as a bit of an aberration versus our kind of ongoing growth algorithm. As you see in GDP and you see where PCE is going. And then you see the shift from goods to services right now. As you services historically been 68%, 69% of spend cons -- goods kind of 31%, 32%. As you know, goods kind of shifted up to say 35%, 36% during the pandemic. We're kind of halfway back on that March back to 31%. So that as we said in our prepared remarks is a bit of a headwind in our business, but certainly expect that we've got maybe halfway to go on that and then it would level back out in its normal equilibrium and would expect that our growth algorithm would return to that 1% or 2% above GDP growth in the guidance we've given historically, again, we just view this period of time as a bit of an aberration from that long-term algorithm just given the macro dynamics. And then the second thing is, yes, no, no change to the guidance so to speak that we've given on the out year certainly expect 2023 to still be our peak investment year. As you mentioned, the sale leaseback is really just a $0.20 plus or minus that'll be in every single one of our years going forward as an add or two our EPS. But expect that we'll be at our peak investment period this year and that will start to moderate down next year with an opportunity for margin expansion accordingly.\nOperator: Thank you, Karen. Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is now open.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. So I have a question on the real estate changes as well. I mean, it makes sense that you guys can improve your cost structure as you take ownership of the build, but if you would expect your stores to remain productive over a long stretch of time. Is this a better model to actually own the stores outright rather than lease in the first place? How obviously you have some history with that at one of your prior shops. Or does this real estate shift suggest that may -- we may see changes to the existing footprint, whether it's changing locations kind of relocation type scenario or different sizes, et cetera. Thanks.\nKurt Barton: Hey Scot, this is Kurt. Good morning. And the real estate model as you think about the opportunity that we have to drive a strong performance of new stores that we've seen since there's a structural shift in the tailwinds into the rural economy, into our markets, the new stores are performing well. We -- as John mentioned, we built a real estate team that is ready to begin to ramp back up to a 90-ish new store. The sale leaseback of existing stores fits right in with that. We're an asset light model. Do not believe owning stores fits, which is why we have over 95% of our stores under a lease. And over time, 30 plus years, we've accumulated not strategically a number of owned stores. There's a bit of pent-up value in these stores, and it's a great time right now to use those stores to fuel and be able to keep a cash neutral value to execute on a strategy that allows us to even further drive new stores, bring efficiency in the new store model. So I look at those, we look at those very much tied in between as a great way to fund a model that drives greater long runway, greater TSR in the overall long-term algorithm. And I really keep both of those very much tied together as part of a key part of our operations.\nOperator: Thank you, Scot. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So you deemed a 2.5 comp in the second quarter with 500 basis points of like-for-like price inflation. You probably got some demand that was shifted out of 1Q into 2Q. And your guidance implies you're going to do call it a 1 to 2 comp for the back half of the year, even as you lap some of the big price increases from last year. So can you give us a sense for what is going to accelerate or improve in the business to offset the mitigating contribution from inflation? And have you already started to see that quoted again? Thank you.\nHal Lawton: Hey Michael, good morning. Couple things. First off, I wouldn't -- I don't think it's a fair comment to say we had sales from Q1 shift into Q2. I just think given the weather and the seasonality that we had this year, we don't have any data or insights or customer purchase data that would suggest that there is any pull or kind of deferral into Q2 or weather-related kind of shifting into Q2. So I'd say that's not a something that we have to offset as you think about from a sequential perspective. The second thing I'd say is we have seen comp transactions sequentially improve throughout the quarter and continuing into Q3 and expect that that will be the case throughout the year. And on AUR as we've talked about all along, we expect that that will moderate through the year, big ticket lessens as a percent as we get through the year. So that provides a bit of a kind of mix and benefit. And then, lastly, on the UPT, we do think we're at close to the bottom of units per transaction. If you go back and look over the last 15 years at our units per transaction trends, we reached an all-time high during the pandemic as people were stocking up and consolidating their trips. We're now much closer to the -- where we were during the 2008 Great Recession and kind of reached that, that, that bottom. And so we expect that will be a lesser headwind as we move forward. So when you put those things all together that ends up with the guidance that we shared. And I think we try to be as conservative as possible on the low end and realistic as possible on the high end.\nOperator: Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. Your line is now open.\nChuck Grom: Hey thanks. Good morning. Hal, there's some concern out there that has households continued to revert back to pre-COVID behaviors that some of the gains that Tractor's enjoyed over the past three years when sales per store has moved from call it $4 million to $6 million will be given back. I'm curious how you'd address this concern and can you highlight the key drivers that a Tractor can control in the back half and into 2024?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey Chuck, and good morning, and thanks for joining the call. As I think we all know in this call, this has been a question for 18, 24 months. And what I'd say is we continue to see a very healthy customer base. Our active customers were at all-time highs this quarter. We saw positive comp transactions in the quarter. And if you look at the categories that are driving the footsteps and driving our customers, it's things like pet, animal, and those are based on counts of population out there in each of those categories. And so -- and then the last thing I'd point out is our share gain. At least half of the volume that we've cap -- that we've grown over the last handful of years has been share related. And so if I point to share active customers, comp transactions, pet, animal and look at those things, it's just a very different business than many of the other companies that kind of had a pandemic benefit reverted whether it was technology-related companies that had a user base that shifted online and then pivoted back or maybe something that's home related, electronics related. We're just a very different business and don't see any elements of reversion in our customer base or business.\nOperator: Thank you, Chuck. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Imbro: Yes. Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Hal, I wanted to follow-up on who that new customer is. How is the retention trending? I think you mentioned they're younger, so I'm curious, is there a difference in spending power between this most recent vintage of new customers and the historical ones? And are we seeing any change in the neighborhood -- Neighbor's Club adoption? I would think the push towards value makes the loyalty program more valuable, but can you provide any commentary or quantification around how that's trending differently?\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey Daniel, and good morning. Start out by first thing, we're very pleased with the trends we're seeing in new customers. We had record high new customers in 2020 and 2021. As we've talked about on past calls, our Neighbor -- and I mentioned our prepared remarks, the Neighbor's Club program being re-launched in April of 2021 was incredibly well timed as it allowed us to lock those new customers in. We've grown I think it's 15 million members over the last three years in our Neighbor's Club program. And we've had increased retention rates of our Neighbor's Club program each of the last few years too. So we've lost those cohorts in, they're growing with us and they're remaining active. Certainly as we got into 2022 and things balance some, we saw our new customer counts on a year over basis trend down it is that is now leveled out. And we feel really good about our new customer trends as we move forward and sequentially that should be helpful as we look at year-over-year improvements. On the Neighbor's Club program continue to be very pleased with the 31, 32 million members of Neighbor's Club that we have, our top tiers are -- has grown and we reached a record number of customers in our top tier. Retention rates remain at all-time highs and continue to improve. And our Neighbor's Club members continue to out comp our overall base. And again, that's on 75% of our sales. So as I've said several times, our customer base is very healthy, record active customers, positive comp transactions, solid trends and new customers, and feel really good as we're heading into the third quarter on our active customer base and our strength of our customer.\nOperator: Thank you, Daniel. Our next question goes to the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nSeth Sigman: Hey, good morning, everyone. So my question is around the second half guidance, the implied margins, it does seem like you're baking in potentially more margin improvement in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year, despite potentially lower comps. And I know some of that now is the sale leaseback. But I guess two questions. One, can you just remind us and maybe help bridge some of the drivers for the second half margin expansion. And then second, how do you think about potentially reinvesting more of that margin improvement given the sales performance that you're seeing? Thank you.\nKurt Barton: Hey Seth, this is Kurt. I'll take the first part of that question and I'll let Seth answer the second part in regards to the reinvestment of any margin. The performance on an operating margin standpoint for the second half on a gross margin standpoint will be very similar to second quarter. We continue to see, and as we signaled and guided at the beginning of the year, we have strong performance from everyday low pricing. We expect to continue to see transportation being the biggest benefit in fueling of the gross margin expansion. As a reminder, over the two years where transportation costs were pressured, we absorbed most of that and this is anticipating somewhat transitory. We're getting the return on that in 2023. On an SG&A standpoint, what really -- that's really the big difference in say the second half as you're observing, we expect Q3 on an SG&A standpoint, excluding the sale leaseback benefit to perform very similar to Q2 in that 70, 80 basis points deleverage principally from the investments in the business, but Q4 really has the best compares. And so in line with what we expect to go into the year when you look back at the fourth quarter of last year where while we had robust sales, we had increased cost in repairs from the storm, we had Orscheln acquisition transition, we had higher incentive compensation. We are lapping that and we expect in the fourth quarter, excluding the benefit from any sale leaseback to really still only have a modest level of SG&A deleverage principally on the compares. So if you hold the gross margin, you get better performance on SG&A. It's really about how well we're managing to spend. And I also can't ignore that the team has done an excellent job scaling the cost, leveraging investments we made, we are seeing significant efficiencies, even SG&A on the distribution and supply chain side of the business driving lower cost and some efficiencies beyond our expectations. With that, Seth, I'll -- maybe you can address the second part of that question.\nSeth Estep: Yes. Thanks, Kurt. Yes. In relation to should we reinvest and how we think about that? First, I would just say EDLP remains our true north, and that strategy continues to pay off for us. If you look at the success we're having with our accumulated activity, our transactions, and our continued record kind of customer counts that are coming to Tractor Supply, and our plan is to continue to maintain that EDLP focus and not to revert from that. We will reinvest if we decide we need to, but we do not foresee a need for any meaningful type of reinvestment. And lastly, I would just kind of say is that, our inventory position continues to be very strong and very favorable. And as we look ahead to the back half, instead of kind of a reinvestment of margin, we've put ourselves in a position to really partner with our key suppliers to go out there, get special buys, go after key values, and make sure we have meaningful values for our customers to drive the full basket. So I'm very pleased. I think we have an incredible team. We got a great reset activity coming forward that we can manage the top-line or we can drive the top-line and drive market share while at the same time really be able to manage the margin structure as well.\nOperator: Thank you, Seth. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is now open.\nPeter Benedict: Hey, good morning, guys. So I want to maybe Hal speak a little bit more about the historical context here. I mean, you started to mention some things in answering Mike Lasser's question, but obviously we're coming off of an unusual period with COVID. You're starting to see this normalization occur. Your -- the behavior of your consumers changing. Maybe just talk a little bit more about what that means to the credit, the basket trends and then kind of what we think that kind of is indicating here over the next kind of 6 months to 12 months. I know you're assuming this will continue in the back half of this year, but how are you just thinking about it longer-term? Thank you.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey Peter, and good morning. If you look back over 30 years of this company's comp growth, it's been almost equally split 50:50 between average ticket and comp transactions. And if you look really at our body of work over the last 3.5 years during the pandemic, there's definitely been periods of time of inflation, periods of time of UPT increases. But when you look at it collectively, it's about 50:50 comp transactions and average ticket. And that's just the formula that has really just kind of always been there in our historical numbers. And our expectation as that we -- as we navigate the current economy that we're operating in and consumer behaviors that we will migrate back to that historical blend as we kind of exit this year and move into next year. And there's going to be some ins and out, as we said in the second half of this year where we expect UPT, the headwind there to kind of level out as we get towards the end of the years. And we expect AUR to kind of come down. Those will work a little bit in together, big ticket becomes a lesser portion of sales. And so we get that mixed benefit there. And that all works out to an okay average ticket. We're seeing comp transactions increase that kind of balances a little bit right now and ends up delivering on the kind of implied guidance that we have for the second half of the year. And on the comp transactions, as I said, we had all-time record active customers this quarter. Our active customer base grew this past quarter. Their shopping is more frequently. We're seeing them do a little bit of deconsolidation of their trips as Kurt mentioned. But we're also gaining significant share in footsteps. And in categories like pet food where we continue to take substantial share, we're really viewed as kind of a value play, almost a warehouse like model. I mean, our average pet food bag size is 35 pounds, and that's very different than say, pet specialty and others. And if you look at a price per pound basis, I mean, we can be as good as 20%, 25%, 30%, advantage on a price per pound basis. And so we're just that naturally drives footsteps in our store. So the mix will evolve a little bit throughout the balance of this year, but we've certainly bought it all through and expect that over time it'll revert back to its historical performance of kind of a 50:50 blend.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Megan we'll go to the next caller, please.\nOperator: Absolutely. Thank you, Peter. Our next question will come from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nPeter Keith: Hi everyone, hope everyone's good. Good morning. I wanted to just follow-up on the new real estate strategy and just putting in the context of your long-term algorithm. Is it meaningful enough that perhaps some of those targets on an annualized basis could be adjusted? I'm guessing I'm looking specifically at the sales growth target of 6% to 7% and then the EPS growth target of 8% to 11%.\nKurt Barton: Hey Peter, this is Kurt. The new real estate model, one of the many things that we're excited about is not only does it give us the long runway, but to your point, move from 70 to 90 stores a year. It's driving incremental sales. Those new stores have the -- expected to have the consistent tailwind into the comps. We believe this new real estate strategy not only gives us a longer runway, but really strengthens the long-term algorithm, gives us more confidence in that and bolsters the higher end of that. Mid-year through the year, we typically don't and aren't adjusting our long-term guidance we certainly will factor all of that in along with the outlook for 2024 as we report on our Q4 earnings, typically refreshing any adjustments to our long-term targets at this point. But we're excited about what it does for the long-term algorithm and the overall total shareholder return.\nOperator: Thank you, Peter. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So the question I have maybe just dig a little bit deeper into the comps around the trends seasonal sales. So the -- what I would ask there is, you talked a lot about the weakness here. It falls similar to what we saw in Q1, but any geographic differences that, that you noticed? And then as we move down to Q3, recognizing you have trim guidance from a year, but did you see any type of rebound in seasonal sales as maybe some of these weather, some of them not all, some of these weather events have started to abate.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hey, Brian, and good morning. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the seasonal business was kind of on expectations in the months of April and May. We had talked about that in our earnings calls for Q1 and given kind of a quarter-to-date perspective on that. And also just our commentary through the quarter publicly. And then June, as I mentioned, we saw significant underperformance in our seasonal business. And it -- that was really the bulk of our myth for the entire quarter was our seasonal business in the month of June. As I mentioned, it was a topsy-turvy quarter particularly in the month of June with all the various environmental conditions that were out there. But to your point, we did see bright spots at moments in time throughout the quarter as well as certain parts of the geography. As an example, the kind of 10 days leading up to Memorial Day were very good from a seasonal perspective and a total business perspective as the sun shine was kind of out almost across the entirety of the country. And we had a really good 10-day run there. Historically you see something like that for at least a few weeks of the spring, we just only had that kind of short period. But if you look in the Southeast, in the South Atlantic, as Kurt called out, we had excellent performance there. From time to time in the both Texas home and the Far West, when we had good seasonal performance, we had strong -- I mean, we had good weather, we had seasonal performance there. And then as Kurt called out some of our underperforming regions around the Midwest and the Northeast, I mean, the Midwest went straight from winter to drought. And in the month of June, it rained 21 days in the Northeast. And so those were dominant, those were large contributors to the underperformance in the month of June. So anyway, that's just a little bit of more depth and commentary there, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you, Brian. Our next question will come from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good morning. Hal, you had hinted at another iteration of the Neighbor's Club program at some point in 2024. So first of all, can you talk about the lift, the comp lift you saw the last time you updated the program? And is there any info you can share on the types of changes that are on the table that you think could make the program better?\nHal Lawton: Hey, Zach, and good morning, and very perceptive. First off, I'd say on the comp, it's hard to calculate that both given the magnitude of the comps that we had in that period. But what I would -- given the magnitude of the comp, but what I would say is we can absolutely look at the 15 million Neighbor's Club members that we've added over the last few years and when they started to shop with us and how we locked them in using the Neighbor's Club program. And I've spoken to that many times. But we feel great about the cohorts from that first revision of our Neighbor's Club program. As we look ahead, there's a lot of -- we've been getting a lot of feedback from our customers and we can make it even better in the next -- in the next version. Doing some things to uniquely call out certain characteristics of customers if they're say a horse owner or say a military veteran, what can we do to better tailor that when they self-identify? There's also some things we can do on our rewards and maybe bite sizing the rewards up to giving some $5 rewards instead of always $10 rewards. We're also looking at a way to add, say, a fourth perhaps even the fifth tier. We -- as we mentioned, we've got our largest number of highest value customers ever. How do we actually take it up another tier and even give further rewards for those that are in that tier. So looking at a lot of ways to again it's -- that program locks our customers in. It encourages spin and encourage migration. It really encourages purchasing on big ticket and then redemption on the queue businesses. We're just looking for ways to reinforce that more and also make it more personable for our customers. And the team's hard to work on it, and we have more detail on it. We look forward to sharing it.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Megan, we'll take one more question as we're at the top of the hour. Take one more.\nOperator: Absolutely. Our final question will go to the line of Steven Zaccone with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nSteven Zaccone: Great. Good morning. Thank you very much for squeezing me in. So I wanted to just go back to the sales guidance change just to better understand how much of the change in sales guidance is really due to seasonal missing expectations versus the discretionary being a bit weaker. In the -- in one sense, the first half was really choppy with weather throughout the year, as you've discussed. So that'd be helpful. And then when you think about getting back to mid-single-digit comps, which is the original guidance, what's the biggest kind of drivers to get you back to that trend in the business? Thank you.\nKurt Barton: Hey, Steven, this is Kurt. Appreciate the question. The -- as we talked about when Brian asked the question on Q2, I'll go back to the fact that a bit of Q2's performance, you have to acknowledge that as we saw some differentiation between some of the geographies that indicates weather was a contributor, but even in some of the strong geographies and across all that we saw a pullback on some of the discretionary. We are going into the second half acknowledging that, that it's a different seasonal period of time, particularly in the Q4. We plan for base weather. We do not plan for more favorable weather. And at this point on the seasonal categories, unless, we look at it as base and unless there's a strong demand for our product because of a shift in weather seasonal, the consumer on some of the discretionary items is a little bit more prudent on that today. And then also we acknowledge, as I mentioned, some of the impulse in discretionary category. So we anticipate that the consumer behavior is in line with the first half of the year. We're taking a reasonable prudent approach there. And then we're also factoring in the strong winter storm that we had in the fourth quarter that we're lapping up against. But underpinning all of that is a strength in our year-round core business running in the mid-single-digits. Comp transactions still performing strong at this point, and we've got a really good healthy customer. Hal mentioned some of the shifts that we've seen, UPT coming off some of its highs as you revert back to the mid-single-digits, it's really a matter of UPT and the consumer coming off of the cycle as we've seen in the last couple quarters and really having more strength in the size of their basket and the demand for the discretionary. And we could be a couple quarters away from that. And we factor that into our guidance. Our guidance is reasonable. We're not factoring in a favorable shift in the consumer or a strong shift in favorable weather. It's taken all those factors that we've seen year-to-date as well as some of the headwinds in the second half.\nOperator: Thank you, Steven. That will conclude our question-and-answer session. So at this time, I'll pass the conference back over to Mary Winn for closing remarks.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thank you, Megan. This will conclude our call. I am available for any questions or follow-up. So please feel free to reach out and we look forward to speaking to you at our Q3 earnings call in October. So thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. I hope you have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin by thanking the 52,000 Tractor Supply team members for their commitment to each other and our customers and for their dedication to serving life out here. Our team is executing at a high level and did a nice job nimbly adjusting in the second quarter. We're operating in a tougher environment than we expected at the beginning of the quarter, and certainly tougher than what we forecasted as we entered the year. Consumer spending continues to shift in favor of services. Shoppers that are tired of inflation are being judicious on their baskets. Consumers continue to pull back on discretionary purchases. And additionally, our business was further impacted by the abnormal seasonal trends, particularly in the month of June. Despite this environment, we still expect 2023 to be a pretty solid year. Our customer is healthy and we're gaining share outgrowing our market by 2x, and we are significantly outpacing total U.S. retail sales growth. We anticipate that we will have positive sales comps and positive comp transactions for the year, albeit in the low-single-digits range. And importantly, net sales and earnings will grow strong mid-single-digits on top of a 53rd week last year. We have a long track record of growth and high expectations of performance. We view our underperformance to these expectations as specific to the current environment. The team has dialed-in and understands the challenges. For the remainder of the call today, I'll speak to a few highlights of the second quarter and then share an update on our Life Out Here strategy. John Ordus will then provide greater insights on our real estate strategy and our plans to accelerate our store growth. And then Kurt will follow John and share further details on the second quarter and our full-year outlook. So let's dig in. All right. Turning into the second quarter. We grew net sales by 7.2% with comparable store sales up 2.5%, and diluted EPS was $3.83, an increase of nearly 9%. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by transaction growth of 1.8% and ticket growth of 0.6%. We expected and were pleased to see comp transactions turn back positive, and this trend has continued into Q3. We began the quarter with mid-single-digit comp sales growth in both April and May. As we moved through the month of June, we experienced a noticeable slowdown in our seasonal categories with the period coming in modestly positive. In my 25 years in retail, June was one of the most topsy-turvy months that I've seen: smoke, drought, storms, heat, it had a little bit of it all. As mentioned, our customer base is healthy. Our active customer counts are stable and growing. Importantly, our new customer trends have leveled out after a period of lapping tremendous growth in 2020 and 2021. Our customer satisfaction scores continue to break records and improve year-over-year. And customer demographic trends continue to trend younger and more female than pre-pandemic. Our Neighbor's Club reached a record 31 million members in the quarter, an increase of 5 million members in the last year. We're seeing continued favorable trends from our loyalty members. Retention rates remain at all-time highs. Neighbor's Club members continue comping at a faster rate than our overall performance and our high value members reached a record count in the quarter. A few key trends that we're seeing our customers as follows. One, customers are increasing in their usage of credit. Two, shoppers continue to seek out value, particularly in our lower income customers. And three, customers are buying a little more often, but a little less per trip. Now, shifting from our customer to our categories. Our year-round categories were up mid-single-digits indicative of our ongoing market share gains and our demand-driven needs-based business model. Our consumable, usable, and edible categories continue to deliver strong, stable performance and drive trips to Tractor Supply. In this quarter, CUE categories had growth in the low-double-digits. In companion animal, we are gaining substantial share throughout the category. Again this quarter, we have sequential increases in the number of customers shopping us for this category each week. In livestock, our Spring Chick Days event was one of the largest ever for us with the poultry category up strong double-digits. We believe we're on track to exceed last year's record of 11 million birds sold. Not only are we seeing growth from existing customers, we are also experiencing robust growth in new customers to the category, and this is driving both trips and ticket. Our seasonal categories were flat and below expectations. The miss was primarily in June when as mentioned previously, there were a number of choppy environmental conditions across our markets that resulted in the consumer not being as engaged in the categories we expected. This softer seasonal performance in June had a material impact on our second quarter performance and was the main driver of our miss versus our expectations. Our big ticket sales were down in that high-single digits and in line with our expectations. And in fact, our performance in the quarter was a sequential improvement from the first quarter. The most significant pressure in the quarter was in zero turns, generators, and recreational vehicles. On the real estate front, we opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, we've seen the cadence of our new store openings return to a more normalized rate. Our Petsense by Tractor Supply business is performing well and comps in the quarter were greater than overall Tractor Supply. And the integration of Orscheln is right on track. Today, we fully transitioned and re-grand opened 15 locations. We remain very pleased with the customer's response as we convert to the Tractor Supply brand. Although, the operating environment may be different than we anticipated as we enter the year, I'm incredibly proud of how the team has come together to navigate the various circumstances and control what we can control. Now transitional an update on our Life Out Here strategy. We remain very confident in our long-term growth outlook. We participate in a large, fragmented, attractive market. We continue to benefit from numerous structural tailwinds, including rural revitalization, homesteading, self-reliance, and pet ownership. We have numerous substantive competitive advantages and are investing to expand them through our Life Out Here strategy. Since we first embarked on our strategy in the fall of 2020, the team has made remarkable progress on the transformation of Tractor Supply. As a reminder, the five pillars of our strategy include: deliver legendary customer experiences, advance our one tractor capabilities, operate the tractor way, go the country mile for our team, and generate healthy shareholder returns. And the key initiatives that support this strategy include our Project Fusion Store remodels, our Garden Center transformation, our Neighbor's Club loyalty program, and the expansion of our omni-channel capabilities. Our Project Fusion Store layout is now in over 700 stores representing greater than 30% of our store base. This program is enhancing our space productivity with improved layout, signage, skew expansions, and improved adjacencies. And for remodels, it also offers an improved customer shopping experience that is much more contemporary. Complementing Project Fusion is the side lot transformation, which is leveraging and expanding our existing outdoor side lot retail space to drive greater productivity and convenience with the addition of a Garden Center and a drive-through pickup lane to support our omni-channel technology investments. With more than 400 Garden Centers today, we've significantly expanded our assortment of lawn and garden products that are relevant to our customer's lifestyle. Importantly, these two projects are delivering on our return expectations. They're providing material sales lists. We're seeing improvement in customer satisfaction, and we're seeing higher levels of new customer acquisition in these remodeled stores. Also, our execution on the remodels continues to improve as we're in the year three now of the effort and we're reducing project costs and also continuing to shorten construction times. We re-launched our Neighbor's Club program to a points-based structure in April of 2021, and the timing was very fortuitous, as it allowed us to lock in the millions of new customers that found us through the pandemic. In total, since the re-launch, our membership has increased by 12 million members, a 60% increase. Additionally, the design of the program has facilitated upward spend migration, and driven strong retention rates. Lastly, the program provides invaluable insight into our customer behavior and allows us to personalize our offerings tailored to their needs. Look for us to evolve the structure again sometime in the next 12 months to 18 months to further enhance value for our members. Underpinning our strategy, our substantial investments in our distribution network to support the significant sales increase and store growth. Today, our network is achieving record service levels and the strongest productivity we've experienced in the last five years. Our new state-of-the-art distribution center in Navarre, Ohio, and our increased count of mixing centers now up to 15 and the implementation of engineered labor standards are all contributing to this performance. Today, I'm excited to share with you a new strategic focus area that we've been working on for a little over a year. The transformation of our real estate model enabled by a number of new capabilities that is designed to deliver material benefit to both revenue growth and operating margin rate, and reinforced our long-term guidance. First, we're raising our new store growth target. We now believe there's a 3,000 store opportunity domestically for Tractor Supply. This is supported by our total addressable market of more than $180 billion our robust growth and our ongoing market share gains. Our new target represents an increase of 200 stores, and we believe we continue to have significant runway for growth with high return new stores. Second, we're implementing new capabilities to enable owned development of new store builds. This capability is expected to generate significant construction cost savings and allowing for lower rents in these applicable stores once we sell them post-construction. Third, we're also announcing plans to periodically execute sale leaseback transactions of our existing ownership of 117 stores, and we're going to have a step up in our ongoing build of stores back to 90 stores per year starting in 2025. Today's real estate announcement extends our runway for growth and reinforces our long-term financial model. It's a compelling addition to our Life Out Here strategy that will further solidify our growth for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to John who can share some more color on our real estate strategy. Thanks, Kurt. Stepping back, Tractor Supply has achieved remarkable growth over the past few years and the team has done an excellent job scaling our processes, capabilities, and organization to manage this growth. Key operational areas like inventory and payroll grew materially but at a lesser rate than sales and were always in control. Key philosophies like EDLP were re-embraced and our marketing media mix shifted fully away from print to digital. And the combination of these two enabled our promotional activity to achieve all-time lows and we remain there. In addition to these efforts, we launched our Life Out Here strategy to continue the ongoing transformation of our business. This strategy helped lock-in new customers, substantiate our market share gains, and is a platform for our future growth. The timing could not have been better. At the halfway mark of 2023, it is shaping up to be a solid year for Tractor Supply on top of three extraordinary years. Our market is stable and our customers remain healthy. The team is effectively controlling what we control. As we celebrate our 85th anniversary, Tractor Supply remains a unique highly differentiated retailer. Our needs-based business model has a track record of growing through various economic conditions. As a company, we have a proven ability to manage through dynamic environments whether that is a macroeconomic or seasonal weather trends. Our customers and team members are passionate about the Out Here lifestyle and they prioritize it. Our customers over indexes homeowners, landowners, pet owners, and animal owners. As a market leader, we have substantial advantages that are getting stronger every day. Additionally, investment in our Life Out Here strategy has critical mass. The natural evolution of our real estate strategy is furthering our competitive advantages. We see meaningful growth potential in our markets. I remain extremely confident that we have a tremendous runway growth ahead of us, and with the right team and the right strategy, we're continuing to build a strong foundation for the future. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Hey, Karen, good morning, and thanks for joining the call. On your first part of the question, a bit to my comments earlier, we see this period of time as a bit of an aberration versus our kind of ongoing growth algorithm. As you see in GDP and you see where PCE is going. And then you see the shift from goods to services right now. As you services historically been 68%, 69% of spend cons -- goods kind of 31%, 32%. As you know, goods kind of shifted up to say 35%, 36% during the pandemic. We're kind of halfway back on that March back to 31%. So that as we said in our prepared remarks is a bit of a headwind in our business, but certainly expect that we've got maybe halfway to go on that and then it would level back out in its normal equilibrium and would expect that our growth algorithm would return to that 1% or 2% above GDP growth in the guidance we've given historically, again, we just view this period of time as a bit of an aberration from that long-term algorithm just given the macro dynamics. And then the second thing is, yes, no, no change to the guidance so to speak that we've given on the out year certainly expect 2023 to still be our peak investment year. As you mentioned, the sale leaseback is really just a $0.20 plus or minus that'll be in every single one of our years going forward as an add or two our EPS. But expect that we'll be at our peak investment period this year and that will start to moderate down next year with an opportunity for margin expansion accordingly. Hey Michael, good morning. Couple things. First off, I wouldn't -- I don't think it's a fair comment to say we had sales from Q1 shift into Q2. I just think given the weather and the seasonality that we had this year, we don't have any data or insights or customer purchase data that would suggest that there is any pull or kind of deferral into Q2 or weather-related kind of shifting into Q2. So I'd say that's not a something that we have to offset as you think about from a sequential perspective. The second thing I'd say is we have seen comp transactions sequentially improve throughout the quarter and continuing into Q3 and expect that that will be the case throughout the year. And on AUR as we've talked about all along, we expect that that will moderate through the year, big ticket lessens as a percent as we get through the year. So that provides a bit of a kind of mix and benefit. And then, lastly, on the UPT, we do think we're at close to the bottom of units per transaction. If you go back and look over the last 15 years at our units per transaction trends, we reached an all-time high during the pandemic as people were stocking up and consolidating their trips. We're now much closer to the -- where we were during the 2008 Great Recession and kind of reached that, that, that bottom. And so we expect that will be a lesser headwind as we move forward. So when you put those things all together that ends up with the guidance that we shared. And I think we try to be as conservative as possible on the low end and realistic as possible on the high end. Yes. Hey Chuck, and good morning, and thanks for joining the call. As I think we all know in this call, this has been a question for 18, 24 months. And what I'd say is we continue to see a very healthy customer base. Our active customers were at all-time highs this quarter. We saw positive comp transactions in the quarter. And if you look at the categories that are driving the footsteps and driving our customers, it's things like pet, animal, and those are based on counts of population out there in each of those categories. And so -- and then the last thing I'd point out is our share gain. At least half of the volume that we've cap -- that we've grown over the last handful of years has been share related. And so if I point to share active customers, comp transactions, pet, animal and look at those things, it's just a very different business than many of the other companies that kind of had a pandemic benefit reverted whether it was technology-related companies that had a user base that shifted online and then pivoted back or maybe something that's home related, electronics related. We're just a very different business and don't see any elements of reversion in our customer base or business. Yes. Hey Daniel, and good morning. Start out by first thing, we're very pleased with the trends we're seeing in new customers. We had record high new customers in 2020 and 2021. As we've talked about on past calls, our Neighbor -- and I mentioned our prepared remarks, the Neighbor's Club program being re-launched in April of 2021 was incredibly well timed as it allowed us to lock those new customers in. We've grown I think it's 15 million members over the last three years in our Neighbor's Club program. And we've had increased retention rates of our Neighbor's Club program each of the last few years too. So we've lost those cohorts in, they're growing with us and they're remaining active. Certainly as we got into 2022 and things balance some, we saw our new customer counts on a year over basis trend down it is that is now leveled out. And we feel really good about our new customer trends as we move forward and sequentially that should be helpful as we look at year-over-year improvements. On the Neighbor's Club program continue to be very pleased with the 31, 32 million members of Neighbor's Club that we have, our top tiers are -- has grown and we reached a record number of customers in our top tier. Retention rates remain at all-time highs and continue to improve. And our Neighbor's Club members continue to out comp our overall base. And again, that's on 75% of our sales. So as I've said several times, our customer base is very healthy, record active customers, positive comp transactions, solid trends and new customers, and feel really good as we're heading into the third quarter on our active customer base and our strength of our customer. Yes. Hey Peter, and good morning. If you look back over 30 years of this company's comp growth, it's been almost equally split 50:50 between average ticket and comp transactions. And if you look really at our body of work over the last 3.5 years during the pandemic, there's definitely been periods of time of inflation, periods of time of UPT increases. But when you look at it collectively, it's about 50:50 comp transactions and average ticket. And that's just the formula that has really just kind of always been there in our historical numbers. And our expectation as that we -- as we navigate the current economy that we're operating in and consumer behaviors that we will migrate back to that historical blend as we kind of exit this year and move into next year. And there's going to be some ins and out, as we said in the second half of this year where we expect UPT, the headwind there to kind of level out as we get towards the end of the years. And we expect AUR to kind of come down. Those will work a little bit in together, big ticket becomes a lesser portion of sales. And so we get that mixed benefit there. And that all works out to an okay average ticket. We're seeing comp transactions increase that kind of balances a little bit right now and ends up delivering on the kind of implied guidance that we have for the second half of the year. And on the comp transactions, as I said, we had all-time record active customers this quarter. Our active customer base grew this past quarter. Their shopping is more frequently. We're seeing them do a little bit of deconsolidation of their trips as Kurt mentioned. But we're also gaining significant share in footsteps. And in categories like pet food where we continue to take substantial share, we're really viewed as kind of a value play, almost a warehouse like model. I mean, our average pet food bag size is 35 pounds, and that's very different than say, pet specialty and others. And if you look at a price per pound basis, I mean, we can be as good as 20%, 25%, 30%, advantage on a price per pound basis. And so we're just that naturally drives footsteps in our store. So the mix will evolve a little bit throughout the balance of this year, but we've certainly bought it all through and expect that over time it'll revert back to its historical performance of kind of a 50:50 blend. Yes. Hey, Brian, and good morning. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the seasonal business was kind of on expectations in the months of April and May. We had talked about that in our earnings calls for Q1 and given kind of a quarter-to-date perspective on that. And also just our commentary through the quarter publicly. And then June, as I mentioned, we saw significant underperformance in our seasonal business. And it -- that was really the bulk of our myth for the entire quarter was our seasonal business in the month of June. As I mentioned, it was a topsy-turvy quarter particularly in the month of June with all the various environmental conditions that were out there. But to your point, we did see bright spots at moments in time throughout the quarter as well as certain parts of the geography. As an example, the kind of 10 days leading up to Memorial Day were very good from a seasonal perspective and a total business perspective as the sun shine was kind of out almost across the entirety of the country. And we had a really good 10-day run there. Historically you see something like that for at least a few weeks of the spring, we just only had that kind of short period. But if you look in the Southeast, in the South Atlantic, as Kurt called out, we had excellent performance there. From time to time in the both Texas home and the Far West, when we had good seasonal performance, we had strong -- I mean, we had good weather, we had seasonal performance there. And then as Kurt called out some of our underperforming regions around the Midwest and the Northeast, I mean, the Midwest went straight from winter to drought. And in the month of June, it rained 21 days in the Northeast. And so those were dominant, those were large contributors to the underperformance in the month of June. So anyway, that's just a little bit of more depth and commentary there, Brian. Hey, Zach, and good morning, and very perceptive. First off, I'd say on the comp, it's hard to calculate that both given the magnitude of the comps that we had in that period. But what I would -- given the magnitude of the comp, but what I would say is we can absolutely look at the 15 million Neighbor's Club members that we've added over the last few years and when they started to shop with us and how we locked them in using the Neighbor's Club program. And I've spoken to that many times. But we feel great about the cohorts from that first revision of our Neighbor's Club program. As we look ahead, there's a lot of -- we've been getting a lot of feedback from our customers and we can make it even better in the next -- in the next version. Doing some things to uniquely call out certain characteristics of customers if they're say a horse owner or say a military veteran, what can we do to better tailor that when they self-identify? There's also some things we can do on our rewards and maybe bite sizing the rewards up to giving some $5 rewards instead of always $10 rewards. We're also looking at a way to add, say, a fourth perhaps even the fifth tier. We -- as we mentioned, we've got our largest number of highest value customers ever. How do we actually take it up another tier and even give further rewards for those that are in that tier. So looking at a lot of ways to again it's -- that program locks our customers in. It encourages spin and encourage migration. It really encourages purchasing on big ticket and then redemption on the queue businesses. We're just looking for ways to reinforce that more and also make it more personable for our customers. And the team's hard to work on it, and we have more detail on it. We look forward to sharing it."

            "name": "John Ordus",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal. It's an exciting time for the store operations in real estate team. As we embark a new ways to capture growth and market share, while also driving efficiencies in our real estate processes. Over the last year, we've installed new leadership and talent in our real estate team. This has allowed us to reevaluate where we are in the natural progression of our store growth plans and our ability to leverage our real estate capital structure. This new approach will allow us to realize cost savings and be more nimble with our store portfolio. Our strong outlook for new store growth is direct correlation of the millions of new customers we have acquired and our overall sales performance over the last several years. This provides us with nearly a decade of new store growth in the United States. We believe these are low risk, high return, organic growth opportunities. We anticipate accelerating our new store growth from approximately 70 stores this year to 80 in 2024 and 90 new stores in 2025 and beyond. Opening highly productive new stores is a core strength and competency of Tractor Supply. We continue strong new store productivity metrics with performance outpacing our historical investment thesis, and our stores are profitable in year one. As part of our growth plans, let's start with new stores. We have developed a new sales forecasting model to determine new stores mature sales, and pro forma results to develop our total market store growth opportunity of 3,000 stores. This was the first update to our modeling process in four years. We have infused the process with a machine learning model and insights from our 31 million Neighbor's Club members. This gives us tremendous confidence to raise our outlook by 200 stores for a total of 3,000 Tractor Supply stores in the U.S. To capture its growth, the real estate team is ramping up our pipeline to allow us to accelerate our store openings to 90 new stores by 2025. We are on track to open approximately 70 new stores this year with a step up to 80 new stores in 2024. We have a robust pipeline of new stores in our sites over the next 24 months. In fact, our pipeline is at the best level of development since prior to the pandemic. The team is also building new capabilities to optimize our real estate portfolio. For instance, we'll start own development of stores this year through a fixed fee developer model, and over time anticipate self-development in new stores. This year, we anticipate 20 to 30 of our new stores will be in our own development pipeline for 2024 new store openings, many of which will begin development in this year. A benefit of these new programs is our ability to have more control and visibility in this development process. The great news is that we estimate these capabilities will result at a 10% to 20% estimated rent reduction as compared to a developer model build. This rent reduction helps us continue and improve our new store returns. Part of the investment in creation of this development model requires more upfront cash. It is exciting that we are able to fund this through the sale lease back of 10 to 15 stores this year out of the 117 stores that we owned. Going forward, we find to use the sale lease back program on both existing owned stores as well as new store openings. This program will help fund our planned owned store development. It will also capture value in currently owned stores. With nearly 2,200 stores, we are also strategically investing in and optimizing our existing store portfolio as part of the lease renewal cycle. All stores will go through an in-depth review to ensure we have the right real estate strategy in place. We'll then take action to ensure that all stores have the right location, size, facility, rent structure, and format. These factors are critical to the success of our team and stores to deliver legendary customer service. With that, let me now pass it over to Kurt for our financial review."

            "name": "Seth Estep",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Kurt. Yes. In relation to should we reinvest and how we think about that? First, I would just say EDLP remains our true north, and that strategy continues to pay off for us. If you look at the success we're having with our accumulated activity, our transactions, and our continued record kind of customer counts that are coming to Tractor Supply, and our plan is to continue to maintain that EDLP focus and not to revert from that. We will reinvest if we decide we need to, but we do not foresee a need for any meaningful type of reinvestment. And lastly, I would just kind of say is that, our inventory position continues to be very strong and very favorable. And as we look ahead to the back half, instead of kind of a reinvestment of margin, we've put ourselves in a position to really partner with our key suppliers to go out there, get special buys, go after key values, and make sure we have meaningful values for our customers to drive the full basket. So I'm very pleased. I think we have an incredible team. We got a great reset activity coming forward that we can manage the top-line or we can drive the top-line and drive market share while at the same time really be able to manage the margin structure as well."

            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning to everyone on the call. Turning to our second quarter results. While our sales trends were below our expectations, I commend the team on how they have remained nimble and steadfast in our commitment to be the dependable supplier for Life Out Here. In many ways, our second quarter top-line results were very consistent with our results in the first quarter with strong CUE growth, flattish, seasonal performance, and a decline in big ticket sales. Our comparable store sales growth was the strongest in the Far West, South Atlantic and Texas, Oklahoma. The strength of these regions was offset by pressure in the Northeast and Midwest regions were seasonal trends added incremental pressure on consumer demand. Comp sales in the quarter benefited by about 5 percentage points from retail price inflation. Most of this inflation reflects retail price increases that were put in place in the second half of 2022 that we have not laughed as of yet. Much like the first quarter, the benefit of price inflation to our average ticket growth was offset by the impact of three factors. First, the average ticket was impacted by the softness in big ticket and declines in seasonal categories, which run at a higher average ticket. Second, we also experienced softer sales in discretionary and impulse add-on items. Third, on a positive note, we also saw our customers shopping us more frequently with a slight reduction in the number of items per basket. Overall, our customers are buying more units or pounds from us in total. Moving down our income statement. Our gross profit increased 9.3% to $1.51 billion. Gross margin increased 69 basis points to 36.2% from 35.5% in the prior year's second quarter. Gross margin was a highlight for the quarter as we continue to maintain strong product margin from our ongoing execution of an everyday low price strategy. The gross margin rate increase was primarily attributable to lower transportation costs driven by improvements in the global supply chain and efficiencies from our new distribution center in Navarre, Ohio. Product mix pressured gross margin given the strength in CUE. This was somewhat offset by the margin improvement from lower big ticket sales, which carry a lower gross margin rate. As a percent of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses including depreciation amortization increased 77 basis points to 22.8%. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization and the onboarding of our new DC. Additionally, higher medical claims also contributed to the increase in SG&A. The growth in medical claims is due to new benefit offerings that had stronger engagement rates than we anticipated, as well as higher program costs overall. We have made some adjustments to the program and will continue to do so. We don't anticipate this to be a headwind in 2024. Approximately 80% of our SG&A growth year-over-year represents investments for growth such as new stores, the impact of Orscheln Farm and Home, the new DC, and the depreciation from our capital investments for items such as Project Fusion remodels and Garden Center transformations. The core SG&A costs leveraged well, even in a low comp sales environment. Overall, the team had strong execution and scaled our core costs to our sales performance. For the quarter operating profit margin was 13.4%, an 8 basis points declined from the prior year. Consistent with our guidance from the year, Orscheln stores had a modest drag on operating income, principally due to factors unique to the transition. In Q2, we attribute approximately 10 basis points of operating margin decline to activities relating to Orscheln. Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $2.7 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing a decrease of 1.7% in average inventory per store. We are pleased with the quality of our inventory as we enter the second half of the year. During the second quarter, we strategically issued $750 million in long-term debt, which brings our weighted average fixed rate to 3.4%. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2x. At Tractor Supply, we are committed to building on our track record of long-term value creation for our shareholders. Our real estate portfolio management is another way that we can continue to facilitate strong returns. Let me shift now to share a few financial highlights as a result of the evolution of our real estate strategy. The sale lease back of 10 to 15 owned stores is anticipated to close during the second half of the year, resulting in a net after-tax benefit of about $0.20 per share. We are under contract on 10 stores and expect to close on those stores in the third quarter. The expected net gain reflects a selective reinvestment of a small portion of the benefit from the sale back into our store infrastructure this year. For modeling purposes, the net gains will be recorded in operating income as an offset to SG&A. Given the migration to our new real estate development strategy, we anticipate that we have about a decade of runway from the sale of existing company-owned stores ahead of us. This increases cash flow over the coming years and is a great way for us to leverage the strength of our balance sheet. The more efficient owned development program is expected to drive lower new store rent. As the program ramps, these savings are anticipated to more than offset the incremental rent expense from the sale leaseback of existing stores. In 2025 and beyond, the acceleration of our new store growth to about 90 stores annually should help us capture market share and bolster the high end of our long-term guidance ranges. We continue to have very robust new store economics providing us the confidence to make this shift. Now let me turn to our updated fiscal 2023 financial outlook. At the halfway point of the year, we are now forecasting low-single-digit comp sales and mid to high-single-digit earnings growth. We continue to believe this will be a year of solid performance for us as we continue to gain market share and advance our strategic initiatives. We are carefully watching many leading macroeconomic indicators, consumer behavior and retail trends, as well as our own insights to assess the health of the consumer. While our customers remained healthy, we are more cautious about their discretionary spending in the second half of the year. At the same time, we are moderating our expectations for the performance of our seasonal categories based on our trends in the first half of the year that have been choppy and below our expectations. We believe it is prudent to recalibrate our expectations for both the discretionary and seasonal categories based on our year-to-date trends. For the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $14.8 billion to $14.9 billion, comp store sales growth of 1.3% to 2.5% growth. Our operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 10.2% to 10.3% with net income of $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion. Diluted EPS is forecast to be $10.20 to $10.40. This includes a net after-tax benefit of about $0.20 per share for the sale leaseback. We anticipate about $0.15 will be recognized in Q3 and $0.05 in Q4. In the light of the updates to our real estate strategy, anticipated capital expenditures for the year are now forecasted to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million compared to our prior range of $700 million to $775 million. This increase reflects the move to own development for select new store growth that will be funded through the sale of existing stores. It is important to note that the proceeds from the sale of our owned stores are expected to offset the incremental capital outlay under the development program. The combined transactions are expected to be relatively neutral to our cash position. As to the calendarization between the third and fourth quarters, we continue to believe that comp sales will be stronger in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. Both quarters are modeled to achieve comp sales growth. Please keep in mind that we are laughing a monumental winter storm in the fourth quarter of 2022 that we estimate contributed 200 basis points to comp sales in the quarter. As for retail price increases, our plans continue to reflect a moderation from the impact of inflation. At the same time, we would anticipate a pickup in our comp transaction growth as we experienced this quarter. Our guidance reflects ongoing gross margin expansion in the second half of the year. We anticipate continued benefit from transportation and the new distribution center, along with some pressure from unfavorable product mix. For the third quarter, our SG&A performance exclusive of the sale leaseback is anticipated to be in line with the second quarter. In the fourth quarter, however, we expect a modest deleverage given the comparisons from the prior year. For modeling purposes the Orscheln stores will go into our comp calculation in 2024 based on when the store is converted to our point of sale system. We will share more details when we provide our 2024 outlook. Looking ahead, we will remain agile and play offense. We will leverage our core competencies that have served us well all while strengthening our capabilities and investing in our Life Out Here growth strategy. For Tractor Supply, we expect to end the year in a strong position for the future. Now, I'll turn the call over to Hal to wrap us up. Hey Scot, this is Kurt. Good morning. And the real estate model as you think about the opportunity that we have to drive a strong performance of new stores that we've seen since there's a structural shift in the tailwinds into the rural economy, into our markets, the new stores are performing well. We -- as John mentioned, we built a real estate team that is ready to begin to ramp back up to a 90-ish new store. The sale leaseback of existing stores fits right in with that. We're an asset light model. Do not believe owning stores fits, which is why we have over 95% of our stores under a lease. And over time, 30 plus years, we've accumulated not strategically a number of owned stores. There's a bit of pent-up value in these stores, and it's a great time right now to use those stores to fuel and be able to keep a cash neutral value to execute on a strategy that allows us to even further drive new stores, bring efficiency in the new store model. So I look at those, we look at those very much tied in between as a great way to fund a model that drives greater long runway, greater TSR in the overall long-term algorithm. And I really keep both of those very much tied together as part of a key part of our operations. Hey Seth, this is Kurt. I'll take the first part of that question and I'll let Seth answer the second part in regards to the reinvestment of any margin. The performance on an operating margin standpoint for the second half on a gross margin standpoint will be very similar to second quarter. We continue to see, and as we signaled and guided at the beginning of the year, we have strong performance from everyday low pricing. We expect to continue to see transportation being the biggest benefit in fueling of the gross margin expansion. As a reminder, over the two years where transportation costs were pressured, we absorbed most of that and this is anticipating somewhat transitory. We're getting the return on that in 2023. On an SG&A standpoint, what really -- that's really the big difference in say the second half as you're observing, we expect Q3 on an SG&A standpoint, excluding the sale leaseback benefit to perform very similar to Q2 in that 70, 80 basis points deleverage principally from the investments in the business, but Q4 really has the best compares. And so in line with what we expect to go into the year when you look back at the fourth quarter of last year where while we had robust sales, we had increased cost in repairs from the storm, we had Orscheln acquisition transition, we had higher incentive compensation. We are lapping that and we expect in the fourth quarter, excluding the benefit from any sale leaseback to really still only have a modest level of SG&A deleverage principally on the compares. So if you hold the gross margin, you get better performance on SG&A. It's really about how well we're managing to spend. And I also can't ignore that the team has done an excellent job scaling the cost, leveraging investments we made, we are seeing significant efficiencies, even SG&A on the distribution and supply chain side of the business driving lower cost and some efficiencies beyond our expectations. With that, Seth, I'll -- maybe you can address the second part of that question. Hey Peter, this is Kurt. The new real estate model, one of the many things that we're excited about is not only does it give us the long runway, but to your point, move from 70 to 90 stores a year. It's driving incremental sales. Those new stores have the -- expected to have the consistent tailwind into the comps. We believe this new real estate strategy not only gives us a longer runway, but really strengthens the long-term algorithm, gives us more confidence in that and bolsters the higher end of that. Mid-year through the year, we typically don't and aren't adjusting our long-term guidance we certainly will factor all of that in along with the outlook for 2024 as we report on our Q4 earnings, typically refreshing any adjustments to our long-term targets at this point. But we're excited about what it does for the long-term algorithm and the overall total shareholder return. Hey, Steven, this is Kurt. Appreciate the question. The -- as we talked about when Brian asked the question on Q2, I'll go back to the fact that a bit of Q2's performance, you have to acknowledge that as we saw some differentiation between some of the geographies that indicates weather was a contributor, but even in some of the strong geographies and across all that we saw a pullback on some of the discretionary. We are going into the second half acknowledging that, that it's a different seasonal period of time, particularly in the Q4. We plan for base weather. We do not plan for more favorable weather. And at this point on the seasonal categories, unless, we look at it as base and unless there's a strong demand for our product because of a shift in weather seasonal, the consumer on some of the discretionary items is a little bit more prudent on that today. And then also we acknowledge, as I mentioned, some of the impulse in discretionary category. So we anticipate that the consumer behavior is in line with the first half of the year. We're taking a reasonable prudent approach there. And then we're also factoring in the strong winter storm that we had in the fourth quarter that we're lapping up against. But underpinning all of that is a strength in our year-round core business running in the mid-single-digits. Comp transactions still performing strong at this point, and we've got a really good healthy customer. Hal mentioned some of the shifts that we've seen, UPT coming off some of its highs as you revert back to the mid-single-digits, it's really a matter of UPT and the consumer coming off of the cycle as we've seen in the last couple quarters and really having more strength in the size of their basket and the demand for the discretionary. And we could be a couple quarters away from that. And we factor that into our guidance. Our guidance is reasonable. We're not factoring in a favorable shift in the consumer or a strong shift in favorable weather. It's taken all those factors that we've seen year-to-date as well as some of the headwinds in the second half."

For today's call, I will go through some highlights of our first quarter. Seth will then share some merchandising initiatives and updates and Kurt will review the quarter and our outlook in greater detail. Before we get started, I'd like to thank the Tractor Supply team for their ongoing commitment to each other and our customers. No matter the operating environment or how the seasons of the year unfold, this is a team that is always there for our customers and our communities to be the dependable supplier for the Out Here lifestyle. For nearly 85 years, our business has proven to be resilient, stable and very consistent, as we provide needs-based, demand-driven product categories as a lifestyle retailer. Now, let's turn to a review of the business for the first quarter of 2023. We grew net sales by nearly double digits at 9.1%, with comparable stores up 2.1% and diluted earnings per share of $1.65. We had 7 points of non-comp sales growth in the quarter. The two primary drivers were new stores and the Orscheln acquisition. We opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and the Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the quarter. And the Orscheln integration is running ahead of schedule. Our comp sales results were below our expectations. We attribute just over 200 basis points, the majority of our sales miss to a delayed start to the spring and to a lesser extent, a milder January. We continue to closely review customer data for trends and changes in their behavior. While select discretionary categories were below in the chain average, this was offset by stronger demand in our consumable, usable and edible products. We believe our customers remain resilient, but are being judicious with their spending as they seek us out as a destination for value and are buying closer to need. Excluding our seasonal categories, our sales were in line with our expectations, and our core business remains very strong. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by ticket growth of 2.8%, offset by a decline in transactions of 0.7%. Importantly, our comp transaction trends improved each month of the quarter and were positive in February and March, with strong performance in our year-round categories. The strength in our year-round categories was driven by CUE products, which exhibited ongoing impressive demand this quarter. These products are needs-based and demand driven and are what drive trips and transactions to our stores. Across companion animal and livestock, we had strong performance. The strength we've experienced over the last three years in our CUE customer trends remains robust, as we continue to gain material market share. In companion animal, we continue to see substantial share gains throughout the category. And we're seeing sequential increases in the number of customers shopping us for this category each week, each month, each quarter. In livestock, our Chick Days event is shaping up to be the largest ever for us, with the poultry category up strong double digits. Not only are we seeing growth from existing customers, we're also seeing robust growth in new customers to the category, driving both trips and ticket. One exciting aspect of the new customers to the poultry category is that they're gravitating to our unique offering of premium breeds and organic feed products for their chicks. Chick Days is a great gateway for our new customers to explore Tractor Supply and use this as a resource for all things related to homesteading, beyond poultry to categories like gardening. Big ticket declines were driven by seasonal trends and to a lesser degree, ongoing pullback in discretionary categories. The slow start to spring impacted outdoor power equipment, which weighed on our big ticket results and average ticket. The most significant pressure was in zero-turn tractors, generators and trailers. Our customers have a long history of buying these items based on need. Current trends support that we are seeing purchasing consistently closer to the season or moment in need. Overall, our big ticket trends were very similar to what has been reported in the recent March retail sales data. Our mobile app currently represents more than 20% of our digital sales. The app is now ranked in the top 100 shopping apps on the iOS store. This is a major recognition of the progress in our ONETractor strategy to offer our customers a more seamless shopping experience. Our customer scores continue to run at all-time highs. Overall, our customer experience metrics continue to keep momentum into 2023, with strong improvements over the last quarter and year-over-year. Our store teams are doing a tremendous job servicing our customers. Our Neighbor's Club just celebrated last week a significant milestone with over 30 million members. As our points-based program enters its third year, the strength in Neighbor's Club continues to exceed our expectations. Our members are comping at a faster rate than our overall performance, and we continue to see strong growth and retention in our high-value customers. As mentioned previously, the Orscheln Farm and Home integration is going very well. I had the opportunity recently to visit one of our first store conversions to the Tractor Supply brand. There was excitement across both our team members and, importantly, our customers as they recognize that we're committed to providing the region with an elevated product assortment, a meaningful loyalty offering and enhanced digital shopping experience and so much more that Tractor Supply is able to offer. During the quarter, we opened our ninth and largest distribution center in Navarre, Ohio. The ramp of the distribution center is right on schedule. With the opening in the new DC, the integration of 81 Orscheln stores and addition of new TSC stores, we capitalized on the opportunity to realign the store servicing areas across the DC network to balance transportation costs and DC capacity, while improving service levels to our stores. It is great for our DC network to have this new capacity to better position our inventory and better service those stores, and allow us to reduce our freight costs, which you'll hear more about from Kurt. At Tractor Supply, our purpose as a company is to serve Life Out Here. As we celebrate our 85th anniversary this year, we remain steadfast in our commitment to preserve and protect our way of life. Two weeks ago, we issued our fourth annual Stewardship Tear Sheet, highlighting the actions and progress that we've made on our sustainability, DE&I and community commitments. I am proud of our progress towards our ambitious stewardship goals, but know there is more to be done as we work towards achieving our net-zero and other goals heading towards 2040. To wrap up, while our first quarter sales were below our expectations, we have a lot of the year still ahead of us. The American consumer broadly remains challenged, but we believe that our customer remains resilient. Spring continues to be cooler and wetter as we've turned into Q2. That said, we're encouraged by quarter-to-date trends, with comps mid-single digit and comp transactions positive. Based on our experience and the nature of our needs-based demand-driven business, we continue to believe that the best way to look at this business is on the half, as the timing of spring impacts the first half of the year. While we acknowledge that the softer sales in January will not be recouped, we are pleased with our lineup for spring and summer. As a company, we have numerous levers to continue to gain market share and numerous levers to effectively control expenses. We continue to see significant opportunities for growth and earnings growth as well. With the majority of the year remaining, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2023. Before I turn the call over to Seth, I'd like to share some background on Seth and the merchandising team at Tractor Supply. Seth is an 18-year veteran of Tractor Supply, having held roles across marketing, finance, e-commerce and merchandising. He has a passion for this lifestyle and has served as our Chief Merchant since 2020. Given our record sales growth over the last three years, we recently completed a realignment of our merchandising product categories and promoted two Vice Presidents to Senior Vice Presidents to better support the growing needs of our business. Seth will provide a review of our sales by category and our plans to continue to gain market share. Now, I'll turn the call over to Seth to discuss some further insights.\nSeth Estep: Thank you, Hal. I'm excited to share with you some insights into our merchandising categories and market share position. We are committed to driving sales productivity as we deepen our relationships with our customers. I'd like to start by congratulating Nicole Logan, SVP of Animal and Softline divisions; and Randall Dodds, SVP of Seasonal and Hardline divisions on the recent promotions. They each bring significant retail and industry experience that complement their tenure at Tractor Supply. These new roles each have three merchandising divisions reporting to each of them. It is exciting to have this new organizational structure to allow us to operate at greater scale, have deeper category insights and enhanced strategic partnerships. Overall, we're now organized into six merchandising divisions. So let's start with our largest division, companion animal, that represents more than 20% of our 2022 sales. This business includes both the consumables and hard lines across companion animal. Around 75% of the Tractor Supply customers have a pet, and approximately 50% have more than one pet. Also, our customers dog weight on average about 20 pounds more than the US average. With the ongoing humanization of companion animals, these key structural tailwinds support our positive outlook on this category. We are a destination for pet customers, with a comprehensive and differentiated assortment at an everyday low price, and we continue to gain share. For example, our growth in pet food, treats and litter continues to lead the market in both dollar and pound growth, gaining another 33 basis points of share in Q1. Our business model of private brands, strong national and differentiated partners, club pack sizes and legendary customer service sets us up to continue gaining share, perhaps even more if we see the consumer more pressured for value. Moving on to our second largest division, livestock and equine, which represents just under 20% of sells. This is a key category for farm and ranch, and we continue to consistently outperform the market. Of note, this category is almost solely the consumables portion of our lifestyle seed categories. In other words, this business does not include fencing, which, in many ways, can be considered containment for large animals. With strong exclusive brands like DuMOR and Producer's Pride, along with national brands from Purina, Cargill, Triple Crown and more, we continue to innovate across our key categories of poultry, equine and cattle. We are the clear leader in this space, with approximately 20% market share. Broadly, one out of every five bags of animal feed is bought at Tractor Supply, and we continue to take share, consistently outperforming the market by 5 percentage points. Next up in our category lineup at an equal weighting are our seasonal and our truck tool and hardware divisions. We are excited to get our spring seasonal business off and running. This is an area where we think we have substantial share opportunities. We are a leader in core categories like outdoor power as the destination for Zero Turn Mowers and categories like grass feed and fertilizers. Also, our live goods assortment is included in this division. As of today, we have more than 350 garden centers ready for spring, with the vast majority just entering year two of operations. Where spring weather has cooperated, we are very excited about our customers' response to the expanded product offering and layout in our Fusion and Garden Center stores. More broadly, this season, we are offering a differentiated garden assortment of live goods, including vegetables and plants, soils, mulch, and chemicals tailored to Life Out Here. We like our initial reads for seasonal products where the weather has turned and are excited for the spring season. Our fourth division is truck, tool and hardware that includes lifestyle items like trailers, power tools, welders and truck accessories. Historically, in tools, we have serviced as a convenience play in power tools and hardware. As part of our Fusion layout, we have made significant investments in corresponding progress on elevating our power tool selection, and it has resulted in one of the highest sales lift categories in our Fusion stores. The additions of Makita, Bosch and Dremel, coupled with being the exclusive retail destination for Porter-Cable power tools, has allowed us to have consistent share gains over the last three years. Up next is our Ag and Outdoor Recreation division, which includes categories such as fencing and sprayers as well as our outdoor sport categories. We are in the business of helping people maintain their land and contain their animals. We have the largest share in the country and have outgrown the market by mid-single digits. And for outdoor recreation, we are very excited about the growth prospects for this segment as we test an expanded assortment in several Orscheln Farm and Home stores. Our final segment ranked on sales volume is clothing and decor, which has exhibited rapid growth since the pandemic, trending well above the company average. This business includes apparel, footwear and farmhouse decor. As one of the largest retailers of Carhartt, along with other brands like Wrangler and Colombia, our customers are finding our assortment meets their workwear needs and their lifestyle. For years, we've known there was a market opportunity in women's workwear at Tractor Supply. And the team has leaned into this category, and the shopper is responding. While still off a relatively small base, our women's apparel business grew 24% in Q1, led by growth in our exclusive brands of Blue Mountain and Ridgecut. We will continue to look for ways to grow these high-margin categories by growing both leading national and best-in-class exclusive brands. In closing, with our new alignment and additional resources, Tractor Supply is well positioned to continue to be the market leader and operate with speed, agility and efficiency to capture growth and drive sales productivity. We are in the midst of one of the most exciting times at Tractor Supply as we are in the spring season. And I hope you get a chance to get out to our stores and see all the exciting merchandising experiences and product innovation. Now, I'll turn it over to Kurt.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Seth, and hello to everyone on the call. I will add on to Hal's comments about the quarter and our outlook for the year. Let's start with our first quarter results. Regarding the cadence of comp sales for the quarter, we started out with a soft January. Last year's January was strong, so we expect it to start soft, but we did not anticipate that the month would be the second warmest in 30-plus years. February was more normalized and in line with our expectations, but the mild winter continued to pressure results. To put it in perspective, our heating categories were down nearly 50%, insulated outerwear was down over 30% and emergency response categories were also down significantly. As a result, our winter seasonal products were down double digits for the quarter. Our expectation was that as we moved through the quarter, we would see a more normalized spring selling season unfold, where we saw the majority of the shortfall was really in the last three weeks of March, which were abnormally wet and much cooler than normal, as well as winter weather continued in the Midwest and Northeast. To put it in historical context, March was the coldest in four years with below-average temperatures nationally, the wettest in eight years and the snowiest in 30 years. Correspondingly, our spring seasonal products were flat to the prior year, well below our expectations. Sales in the quarter benefited in the high-single digits from retail price inflation. Most of this inflation reflects retail price changes that were put in place in the second half of 2022 that we have not lapped as of yet. The benefit of price inflation to our average ticket growth was offset by three key factors: First, the majority of the pressure on average ticket all revolved around seasonal goods. This includes the softness in big ticket, declines in seasonal, which runs at a higher average ticket and higher winter clearance. Second, faster growth in consumable transactions, in particular companion animal and poultry, which typically have a lower average ticket. And then third, to a lesser extent, a reduction in units per transaction in impulser add-on items like dog treats and candy and snacks. Moving down our income statement. Gross margin was 35.5%, an increase of 52 basis points from 34.9% last year. We were very pleased with these results. We remain committed to being the everyday low-price leader in our markets. Promotional activity was in line with last year with a modest increase in winter clearance, as we looked to exit the season clean. Moderating freight costs for import and domestic shipments provided a net gross margin benefit. Our price management initiatives and lower freight costs more than offset the impact from cost inflation and product mix from the robust growth of our CUE categories. As a percent of sales, SG& A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 119 basis points to 28.1% from 26.9% a year ago. For perspective, about half of this growth was anticipated for our strategic initiatives. As a reminder, our planned investments included higher depreciation and amortization from the step-up in capital spending to support our growth agenda, and the addition of our new distribution center and the impact from the Orscheln acquisition. The remaining increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to deleverage, given the moderate comparable store sales growth. As we've mentioned, the quarter was trending in line with our expectations, leading up to the last three weeks of March, providing limited opportunities to adjust the cost structure. Specifically, we chose to continue to fully fund payroll for the last two weeks of the quarter to support the spring season, utilizing the hours to get ahead on product assembly and other sales driving tasks. For the quarter, operating income was essentially flat with last year, with a modest decline in net income. Diluted EPS was $1.65, also flat with the prior year's first quarter. We opened 17 Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the first quarter. This represents a significant improvement in the cadence of our new store openings. Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $3 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of about 12% in average inventory per store. This increase is primarily attributable to inflation, a better in-stock position from last year and the delay in the spring selling season. We are pleased with how we exited the winter season and the quality of our inventory as of the end of the first quarter. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet, with a leverage ratio of around 2.0 times. Our guidance for 2023 is unchanged. We continue to expect full year sales of $15 billion to $15.3 billion and project comparable store sales to increase 3.5% to 5.5%. As we manage through the first half of the year, we expect to see comp sales towards the top half of our guidance for the second quarter. We anticipate some increased pressure on discretionary categories, but are pleased with the growth in CUE products along with DIY categories like repairs and maintenance. Let me share further insights on the outlook for the remainder of the year. We anticipate Q2 and Q3 to have the strongest comp sales growth potential, while Q4 is expected to be closer to the low end of the guidance range due to the strong compares to the prior year. Operating margin performance is expected to improve as we move through the year with Q4 having the highest potential, principally from the lap of the onetime acquisition-related costs of Orscheln. As a reminder, our Novar, Ohio, distribution center is expected to begin to benefit gross margin in the second quarter with the ramp up in the second half of the year as we capture freight savings. The benefits in gross margin will be offset by approximately 15 basis points of negative drag on SG&A as the cost of the distribution center are reflected in SG&A. We have confidence in our earnings in a variety of sales scenarios. For example, at times, a cooler and wetter start to the spring can provide an extended selling season. We've seen this type of seasonal cadence before such as 2013, and we are cautiously optimistic of the upside it can bring to the third quarter. Regardless of the state of the consumer, we are confident in the resiliency of our business model and our ability to manage the business. In a scenario where we do not make up miss January sales, we see opportunities for further operating leverage. Specifically, we are seeing an easing of our supply chain capacity constraints, which should drive additional efficiencies in the second half. And we now anticipate greater accretion for porcelains in the back half. We are raising our accretion assumption to $0.15 per share compared to our prior expectation of $0.10 per share. To sum it up, for the full year, we continue to guide toward net income of $1.13 billion to $1.17 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $10.30 to $10.60. Over my 23 years with Tractor Supply, it has been proven time after time weather can be transitory. And the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the halves of the year. In this environment, what sets Tractor Supply apart is our ability to effectively manage the top line and bottom line while investing in our Life Out Here strategic growth drivers. And with that, I will turn the call back to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Kurt. Tractor Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over many business cycles. Throughout our 85-year history, we have successfully navigated all types of business environments and have emerged stronger each time. We continue to see positive migration trends to our markets. This marks the third consecutive year of positive population growth in rural America. This reflects an increased desire to seek out more space and take advantage of the affordability that country suburban, exurban and rural markets offer with a lower cost of living and the ability to live Life Out Here. It is our view that the sense of community found in our markets, and perhaps more importantly, the ability to secure a piece of property at a reasonable price, has ensured the rural migration trend is one that's here to stay for the time being. The millennial generation has embraced Life Out Here. Our customers have been resilient thus far in the face of slower macroeconomic growth, elevated inflation and higher interest rates, and they prioritize their lifestyle and passions. With significant growth and market share opportunities, we are excited about the balance of the year and remain confident in our business. My thanks and appreciation go out to the team for their dedication to living our mission values every day. And now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Thank you so much.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citigroup. You may proceed.\nSteven Zaccone: Great. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start just thinking about the context of the year. So given the slightly weaker-than-expected same-store sales in the first quarter, can you just talk about the confidence to recover these spring sales over the balance of the year? It sounds like January can't be made up, but how material is that for the full year? And then just you sounded a bit more cautious on discretionary from what you've seen from your consumers. So just elaborate on how much that could be an impact to the full year. Thanks very much.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Stephen. Good morning, it's Hal, and thanks for your question. Thanks for joining our call. We remain very confident in our sales guidance or in our earnings guidance for the year. As we've stated on the call, about 200 basis points of our -- we were below our sales comp expectations by about 200 basis points due to weather. About 80% of that was due to the spring/fall off in the last three weeks of the quarter with about 20% of that being in January. So January is a much smaller component, particularly when you look at it over the fullness of the year. As Kurt said, there are a number of ways that we see path to recovering not only the Spring sales but potentially the winter sales as the year progress. As we mentioned in the year 2013, and there are several other years that have similar profiles where you've got a cooler weather spring, that has pushed the season into the summer time as yards remain, kind of, remain green and growing, past years remain growing cultivation in farms continue to happen, and our business remains strong into those years into those months. In particular, if you recall last year, in the midst of summer, we had one in 10-year drought. So the lapping of that looks very promising. On the consumer more broadly, we've not seen a sequential change in consumer behavior from Q3 and Q4 last year into Q1 of this year. The same themes that we were sharing last year are the same themes that we would reiterate here on this call. Discretionary, which only represents 15% of our business, continues to perform under average. That -- the pace of that is about the same as it was in Q3 and Q4. Our units per transaction continued to face modest pressure, low single-digits as consumers continue to be judicious in their basket. But that's -- we've been calling that out for the last couple of quarters. But otherwise, we've really not seen any sequential change in consumer spending. There are some categories where we're seeing spend, consumer shift up in their spend in poultry, our organic fee continues to be the strongest kind of, segment in our feed. In dog food, we are seeing economy continue to be strong, but that's actually due to the increased customers that Seth called out. If you look at our core customer base from one year ago and two years ago, they haven't changed at all their food buying behavior. So really not a lot of change in the consumer behavior from last year. Big ticket continues to run about the same. The January falloff was measurable but small. And really, it came down to the last 3 weeks of the quarter, which were cooler, wetter and snowier than we anticipated on top of an underperforming spring last year.\nSteven Zaccone: Great. Thanks for all the detail. I\u2019ll leave the floor.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Thanks, Steven\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. You may proceed.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. It\u2019s Scot Ciccarelli. And how this may be a function of my stating memory. But I don't recall you guys talking about customers buying closer to need before. So if I'm wrong about that, I apologize. But if that's the case, can you give us an idea of how much that has changed over the last, say, six months in terms of buying closer to need? And did you guys expect that behavioral shift when you provided your initial outlook?\nHal Lawton: Hey, Scott, so I'll reference that really just in the context of dominantly a big ticket and the fact that, historically, if you were to take out 2021, when you had the \u2013 the stimulus and you were to take out 2020 when there was a modest stimulus combined with, obviously, COVID, I think if you were to go back over like my 20-plus years history in retail and home improvement and the farm and ranch, Seth and Kurt, I think we'd all say that like things like riding lawn mowers, bigger ticket items like that, customers typically buy them when they need. The vast majority of those categories or purchases are needs based. And that's really what we were trying to signal is we're seeing more of that than we did kind of in 2020 and 2021, really more of reversion to kind of historic purchasing patterns of those sorts of categories, nothing otherwise intended to be implied.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Okay. So just the normalization of what you have historically seen prior to pandemic-related changes?\nHal Lawton: Exactly, exactly. Nothing otherwise intended to be implied. And thanks for the clarification.\nScot Ciccarelli: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nChris Horvers: Thanks and good morning. So my follow-up question on the weather and the April trend is, April was pretty historically bad last year as well. And spring really broke in May and June. So I'm assuming May and June got a lot better for you. So how are you thinking about -- you talked about 2Q being at the high end of the range for the year. How you think about the current trend versus the harder compares? Is it just April still cold and wet, so the mid-single digit is not necessarily reflective of the potential despite the harder compares?\nHal Lawton: Hey, Chris, as we called out quarter-to-date, we're nearly done with April is mid-single-digit comps and low positive single-digit comp transactions. And so given the cool wet weather that's continued into April, we're relatively pleased with that performance. As a recollection from last year, June was not a strong spring selling season. The last year's spring only had a handful of really good weeks, and then it went very hot. And that's what I was referencing earlier about the drought. If you recall, on our Q2 call, we started to talk about the drought in the back half of -- kind of back half of June and into July. And then we reiterated that that we saw that impact us for the first six, eight weeks of Q3 as well. So, we are optimistic that we can have a solid May comp on top of a weaker June and have an extended selling season into July and August this year, particularly in core areas for us, like Florida, Texas, and California. California and Texas, in particular, were under extreme drought conditions by the time we got to mid-June last year and really extended into September. As we know, those areas have had extreme weather the first half -- the first quarter of this year. We're all reading about the flooding in California and such. And we think that will bode well for us as we get into the summertime in those areas of the country.\nChris Horvers: Got it. And then as a follow-up on the margin line, historically, your first quarter gross margin is a decent indication of what the year looks like, but it also sounds like some things are breaking their way on the freight side and inventory is very clean. So, is there just a general bias upward over the year on the gross margin line? And could that lead to some potential operating margin upside as if sales come in line with plan?\nHal Lawton: Yes. And thanks for calling that out, Chris. As Kurt mentioned in his prepared remarks, we see a variety of ways for us to achieve our guidance this year, both on the sales side and on the earnings side. And as it relates to earnings, there's a number of expense opportunities that are starting to show up, if you will, particularly in our supply chain and in the Orscheln integration cost. On the gross margin side, look, this is the benefit of being a scaled player in our market. And when you start to see kind of just a little bit of moderation in pricing, we're able to take advantage of that and drive some upside in our gross margin rate and still remain incredibly price competitive and lead the market there. Additionally, we've seen container costs come down significantly, and that's starting to flow through. And it had some impact in Q1, but it will have more impact in Q2 and Q3. Also domestic freight is starting to trend down as well. There was a couple of, I think -- recently, one of the big freight companies mentioned that we were in a freight recession or depression, and that bodes well for us in terms of being able to leverage our scale to drive down freight costs, in particular because we've got new routes to market coming online with our new DC. And obviously, with the 150 stores we have that we're building plus with Orscheln. So, we feel really good about our gross margin rate performance. Do you feel like there's continued upside as we look towards the year? And that's one of the reasons that gives us strong confidence to be able to reinforce our guidance.\nChris Horvers: Thank you. Have a great finish this spring.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nSimeon Gutman: Hey good morning everyone. A quick follow-up to the last question. Your Q1 gross margin, it looks like it's the highest ever. So, can we just talk about the conceptual drivers, not some of the seasonal movement, but why is it the best ever. And then the 200 basis points of weather, I think Hal called out in the prepared remarks. Is that a spread between certain markets? Was there anything in that regarding the judicious comment you made on the consumer, or is that pure weather?\nKurt Barton: Simeon, this is Kurt. I'll hit both of those. Why don't I start with the second then the first. It's a quick one. The -- the variation between geographies between weeks all reinforce what Hal was just saying. To your question, if you take like the Midwest, Northeast Commonwealth states, you compare that to the rest of the geographies. You did see a disparity because those states had a very mild winter, where it's really strong for them. And then they saw no spring, they basically saw more snowfall in March than they did in January. So we did see a very clear disparity between those low or mid-single-digit negative to mid-single-digit positive in the other geographies, which, again, just gives us the confidence in the trends of the business. On the gross margin question, I'll give the primary drivers, and I'll just give you the order of magnitude on what we're seeing in gross margin. And these are all areas of structural improvements. These are things that we planned for, but as Hal said, we see continued upside in gross margin. First is our price management was the biggest driver of that. That was offset by the second, which would have been a mix impact from CUE and then the third was benefit from freight. Freight is the one that we believe continues to have potential benefit going forward. On price management, just a couple of points on there. When we talk price management, it really includes more than just managing the retail price. It's the retail pricing, it's the management of everyday low pricing, our promos, and then even the cost negotiation and concessions. And Seth the team did an excellent job leveraging our scale, our size in this environment to produce a strong enough price management direct margin to offset -- more than offset the CUE. So between retail price management and pressure from CUE, that was about half the benefit. Transportation was about the other half.\nSimeon Gutman: Thank you. Good luck.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. You may proceed.\nSeth Sigman: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on a couple of the last point. So I think you raised the accretion by $0.05 for Orscheln, which is obviously encouraging. You did keep the full year guidance and probably appropriate just given the Q1 challenges. But can you just help frame what some of the underlying changes may be in that guidance? Because it sounds like the message is that you should be able to recoup a lot of the sales from Q1, maybe not January, but the bulk of the rest and then gross margin seems to be tracking ahead. SG&A, while it was elevated, it does seem to be as planned and maybe just we were all mis-modeling it. So is there anything else that you could sort of point to within that?\nHal Lawton: Yeah. Hey, good morning. And thanks, Seth, for the question. I'll speak just about Orscheln integration for a moment. First off, it's -- the integration is going very well. Most importantly, it's being well received by the Orscheln team members as they are converting to Tractor Supply team members. And it's also being really well received by customers and even more so than I anticipated. Secondly, the team is doing a fantastic job cadencing the stores and transitioning them over to Tractor Supply banners. We have several done already. We've got almost 20 that are converted from a point-of-sale transaction. We're implementing the Fusion remodel on all of them, and we are on -- we are ahead of schedule on those transitions. And then what that allows us to do is to take our back half plan and optimize a bit how the expense structure that we had planned. And so, specifically, there's two elements that are driving that. The first is our IT integration cost. Our team is doing an excellent job integrating from an IT perspective, and we're finding some leverage there and some need to not have to spend what we previously anticipated. And the second is around the sale of the SSC and the DC. We previously planned that to the end of the year. We're now optimistic that we can pull that forward by maybe a month or two or three, and we'll save some dollars there as well from an operating cost perspective. So in general, the Orscheln acquisition is going very, very well. We're very pleased with how it's progressing and wanted to share that outlook today. More broadly, what I'd say is, I think like most companies that are reporting this weekly cycle, everyone is kind of -- you seem to see a lot of people holding guidance in spite of like what you just articulated, some upside for us on gross margin rate, on expense and others just in the spirit of -- because there's a lot of the year left to go.\nSeth Sigman: Okay. Understood. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. You may proceed\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry for beating a dead horse here. But with regard to weather, I just want to make sure, I'm hearing this correctly. I mean so, clearly, there was a weather disruption here in Q1. It sounds like in early Q2, you've seen sales pick up -- comp sales pick up meaningfully. But in markets across the country where there was no weather disruption, are sales there tracking consistent with how you would expect them to track?\nKurt Barton: Hey, Brian, this is Kurt. Yes. On that, I'll give -- I'll just continue to give a few points. In areas where they're not as impacted by weather, you heard me mention to the previous question, the South, the Texas area, Far West, all those areas we saw performance in line with our expectations versus the areas of the North and Midwest where it was below our expectations. I'll also add in what also was so evident to us is that internally, when we look at the variation by categories in merchandising, the categories that we -- that are not impacted by weather variations right in line with expectations. When we look at the weeks within it, you can look at the first few weeks and the last three weeks, and you see which weeks are not like the others. And then when we look at our external measurements, where we've utilized market industry information on that, it also confirms that Tractor Supply outperformed the market. In farm and ranch, we've seen in market industries, it's running negative in those, especially in those areas where there is a lot of farm and ranch competition. So from all the data points that we see for -- I mean, for Q1, the -- any of the softness was seasonal and then as we look throughout the rest of this quarter, it's really a matter of when does spring start. It's not if, but when. And it's a matter of whether it's ideal, typical, poor, but Tractor Supply has been able to pivot and be able to manage each of those quarters. And to house point, it's very much shaping up like one of those years where it gives us the opportunity for a good extended selling season.\nHal Lawton: And Brian, this is Hal. Just to add on to that. I mean, if you go back and look at weeks eight, nine and 10, where we were starting to comp on some tougher weather from last year, and kind of, late spring, early March was actually good weather, kind of, reasonably across the country, we had high single-digit comps those three weeks. And then as you get into the last three weeks, we had negative comps those three weeks, and it was driven by the geographies that Kurt mentioned, kind of, from the State of Virginia all the way up to the Northeast through the Midwest. And they were comping on top of tough weather from last year, and it was worse weather than they had -- than we had this year. You know, if you look at areas like Kurt said, in Florida and Texas and elsewhere, we had good seasonal spring seasonal businesses in those areas. So really, we just point to those three weeks. And then as we said, as we bounce back here in April at the mid single-digit comp rate.\nBrian Nagel: No, that's very, very helpful. And just one quick follow-up. So again, I'm asking you necessarily to be a meteorologist, but as you look at the dynamic here, as we've had this, what seems to be a very wet late winter, early spring, going historically, has that ever not led to an extended spring or in the spring that was actually better for Tractor Supply?\nHal Lawton: We'd love to be a weather predictor and be good at it. As you know, most of the weather forecast you get are either 12 months out and then like three weeks out. But the reason we brought up 2013. 2014, by the way, was a kind of reasonably similar year pattern, where you had a similar -- in fact, we went back and pulled our earnings transcripts from those dates and looked at them. And we almost had a very similar earnings call where we talked about weather in Q1, cold, wetter, could potentially lead to an extended selling season into the summer, and that's sure enough is exactly what happened in both of those years. And that's why we brought it up to say there is very much a precedent for it. And in particular, this year we'll be comping on top of a one and 10-year drought last year. So we're cautiously optimistic that we can have an extended selling season this year, which would be on top of tougher comps -- I mean, easier comps from last year.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nKate McShane: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We wanted to ask about market share. There seems to be a lot of commentary on this. And I wondered if you could remind us what assumption you're making for market share in your guide for this year? Was it something you saw an acceleration of in the first quarter? And with some of the changes you're highlighting with the new leadership and merchandising, in those categories, are you expecting more of a lift in market share than maybe originally planned, or is that more for 2024?\nKurt Barton: Kate, hey, this is Kurt. Our original expectation and guidance, just to reiterate that, we see as we entered this year, GDP growing 1% to 2% was our assumption. And then Tractor Supply has historically been growing outside of that as we're grabbing market share, so another 1% or 2% of growth beyond that. And where Seth talked about -- where we're gaining market share, we are certainly gaining market share in categories like companion animal, in poultry, in other areas. And so that gain is part of what we expect to be able to do. But I'd also say, as we look at this year, where there may be any challenges in regards to the consumer, this is a great opportunity. Just like we saw where some discretionary, saw some softness, offset by a robust gain in market share. And I think that's the resiliency of the business, and that's -- one of the exciting things is that, if there is some softness in some categories, we've got opportunity in live goods, companion animal, others to gain market share. And we see upside to our market share gains compared to our standard model for this year and the next couple of years.\nSeth Estep: Hey, Kate, just to add a couple of points on that. Thanks for your question. This is Seth. Hey, in general, right now, if we look at our business and we think about where we're going to continue to grow market share, again, to Kurt's point, we are very excited to see market share gains, particularly like in our companion animal or our pet and our dog businesses as well as on the cat side. Our entire portfolio, if you call it like in pet food, is growing extremely strong. As Hal mentioned earlier, we're seeing our current customer base, our previous customer base really maintaining those categories in which they were purchasing, they're coming more often. And we're gaining a lot of new shoppers across the portfolio. And we think our merchandising strategy and our portfolio strategy, particularly in things like pet and pet food, is very much a strategic advantage for us to continue to gain market share. Newness and innovation is critical. Our merchants are continuing to drive comprehensive resets across the box and where they're planned. And if you also look at other items that are relative to lifestyle, whether that be like poultry, feed, forage, sporting goods, as we mentioned earlier, we are continuing to lead in those categories. So, for us, we are, by far, leading share in the industry and in farm and ranch, far away leading pet share gains. We don't anticipate that slowing down based on the activity that we're seeing and the customer response we're seeing in our database today.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. You may proceed.\nScott Mushkin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. A little bit focused on the merchandising management team. You're obviously beefing it up. And so I was wondering, what drove that decision? Do you see significant opportunities to expand the total addressable market? And if yes, where do you think those opportunities are?\nSeth Estep: Hey, Scott, yes, Seth, thanks for the question. Absolutely on those questions today. For us, kind of what we said earlier, for us, as we continue to grow rapidly over the course of the last few years, we saw an opportunity to continue to double down and drive at a greater scale, our merchandising activities, really driving towards innovation, really driving towards strategic partnerships, driving into categories, driving into regionalization, localization, so that we can really maximize all the work we're doing with like our Fusion, our Garden Centers, all those type things. So if we look at our portfolio strategy, we see share opportunities across many of the areas of our addressable market. We just mentioned pet. We see that we continue to have opportunities there. We reorganized our feed and our core livestock and equine division to species, where we're really driving a category management approach. We're basically taking the way in which we've managed our pet business over the course of the last few years and applying those same category management principles on new items, shopper insights, adjusting the flow, localization, regionalization to continue to make sure that we are offering the best-in-class shopper experience as we have new shoppers entering today. I mentioned we're going to be piloting some things like in Orscheln Farm and Home, Sporting goods did very well for us in Q1. And we're going to continue to lean in where we have our strengths. A lot of those categories today are just in our center core for six months. We think we have an opportunity to drive those businesses year-round. I can go on and on, but we think that the new structure that we're putting in place today is allowing us to have more agility, continue to move fast, operate at scale and continue to drive deeper partnerships and innovation. So very excited about this, and we're starting to really see some programs come to life under this new structure.\nScott Mushkin: And do you see the data from the frequent shopper card helping you with the vendors and the relationship is getting stronger and more beneficial?\nSeth Estep: Absolutely. Leveraging our 30 million members in our database is such a strategic advantage for us, not only in farm and ranch, but just in broader retail in the categories in which we serve. We are continuing to deep dive into those categories, and we are partnering in a significant way with our vendor base to say, hey, where do we continue to end up where we have opportunities, what are those cohorts that we need to continue to go after? And how do we continue to drive regionalization, localization, and use that into our assortment planning process. So absolutely. It is -- Neighbor's Club is fundamental to everything we're doing not only from a marketing perspective, but it is a core driver of everything we're doing in merchandising because the customer is what we're looking to continue to drive to make sure we know where their needs are today, but where they're going in the future.\nScott Mushkin: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners. You may proceed.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning, Hal, Seth and Kurt. I wanted to revisit the side lot plus Fusion remodels in terms of cost versus sales lift as we approach the core of the spring selling season here. So two-part question. One, can you remind us of the net cost of such projects, and whether you've been able to improve the net spend behind these projects as you scale the initiative? And then, two, how has the spring selling season, albeit early, changed your expectation, right, for the overall sales lift or the ROIC that you expect to generate behind this spend as well?\nHal Lawton: Yeah, hey Steven, thanks so much for the question. I'll hit three things quickly and just in the sake of time. First off, the capital spend for both the garden center projects, kind of side lot transformations and the inside-the-store Fusion transformation continues to reduce. It's a key area of focus and one of our primary metrics that we're evaluating our performance on our strategic initiatives this year. The second thing is the performance of our Fusion and Side Lot remodels are continuing to perform at the same rate as they have in the last couple of years, which we're incredibly pleased with because we're now reaching significant scale on both inside of our company. The third thing is, we are very pleased with the live goods performance. I think it's strategically going to be big for us this year. It's a low-cost way for people to beautify their yards, kind of -- and there's going to be a lot of refreshing coming out of the December and November storms that happened and we are well-positioned for that. And one of the things we always talk about is you can now see live goods sales, \u201cfrom space\u201d in our daily and weekly sales reporting, which is exactly what the plan was at the beginning of the year now with 350 garden centers.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Operator, we have time for more question.\nOperator: Absolutely. The final question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. You may proceed.\nPeter Benedict: Hello, guys. Thanks for squeezing in. So I guess I'll ask one about inflation. Kurt, just curious, I know high single-digit retail price inflation in the first quarter. Your thoughts on 2Q and then in the back half of the year, is that changing at all? And as you hear, you've talked a lot about some costs coming down, supply chain costs coming down. I'm curious if you're at a point where you're -- you're actually seeing some, kind of, all-in product costs coming lower year-over-year in certain areas and how you're dealing with that from a pricing standpoint? Are there areas of the business where you're actually seeing, let's call it, the price deflation at a retail level year-over-year, or is that not something that's gotten to that point yet. That's my question. Thank you.\nKurt Barton: Yes. Peter, I'll hit those. On the inflation, our outlook on the retail price inflation for the year hasn't changed much at all. A vast majority of retail price inflation, as I mentioned in Q1, was what was put in place in the second half of last year. And we're seeing a bit of a steady plateau. Maybe some categories like pet will continue to see some. So our expectation is high single-digit Q1 moving into the mid single-digit Q2 to maybe slightly lower in Q3 and then getting into low single-digit Q4. And we're not seeing significant cost deflation. So at this point, there may be some deflation in certain areas of the business. But overall, there's some disinflation that we have expected in there. The great thing is, this year, we expect to see comp transactions really being a key driver to it. And that's what we're seeing right now, as Hal mentioned. And our expectation, as the year unfolds, it really is a good balance between ticket and transactions. Lastly, I'd say what is exciting, you heard this from both Hal and I is in other parts of the business, in cost, in SG&A, we are taking advantage of our ability to use the scale where there's either excess capacity or there's cost coming down. The operating expenses have efficiencies there and you heard that in some of our messaging. So hopefully, that helps answer the question, a lot of great expectation. Our ability in any sales scenario to really have increased operating margin in 2023.\nPeter Benedict: No. That's helpful. Just to follow up on something you mentioned that you've brought up transactions, and it's encouraging to see them up despite the soft seasonal stuff. I know that would not have been the case several years ago with this business. I'm just curious maybe if you guys can talk a little bit about the role that Neighbor's Club might be playing in this. I mean, just how those members are shopping more frequently, if they are? How you're expanding your wallet with those members and there's a lot of marketing initiatives underway on that front. So just maybe a little bit more on the behavior of your Neighbor's Club members and how that might be something that's helping maintain the traffic during periods of seasonal weakness? Thank you.\nKurt Barton: Yes, absolutely, Peter. Neighbor's Club has been an integral part of driving our business and enabling customer behavior, particularly on our consumables. More and more of our customers are signing up for our private label credit card. We announced last quarter that we reached for the first time $1 billion in sales on that credit card. You get a 5% discount when you use the credit card in your purchases, which drives kind of repeat behavior on food and feed in particular. As Seth talked about, we are outgrowing the feed market by 5 points repeatedly every single quarter. And we have a 20% share far and away the largest share in the market in that category. Same thing on dog food, I mean we are far and away the share leader in dog food. It doesn't matter what metric you look at, pounds, units, dollar growth and even new customer counts. Every single week, our new customer counts for dog food are going up. And those are what we can count on to drive our transactions. And I think one of the things you mentioned is the business has -- is kind of changing to some degree from kind of three, four, five years ago in terms of having the scale we have in pet food now to complement the scale we've always had in Animal Feed and that's driving positive comp transactions for us. As we said, even in March, where we had soft weather on the seasonal side, it still allowed us to have positive comp transactions.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Thank you, Peter. Operator, that will conclude our remarks today. Thank you to everyone for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you on our second quarter call in July. I'm around all day, so please reach out if there's anything that I can do, and I look forward to speaking to you. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's Tractor Supply Company's conference call to discuss first quarter 2023 results. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For today's call, I will go through some highlights of our first quarter. Seth will then share some merchandising initiatives and updates and Kurt will review the quarter and our outlook in greater detail. Before we get started, I'd like to thank the Tractor Supply team for their ongoing commitment to each other and our customers. No matter the operating environment or how the seasons of the year unfold, this is a team that is always there for our customers and our communities to be the dependable supplier for the Out Here lifestyle. For nearly 85 years, our business has proven to be resilient, stable and very consistent, as we provide needs-based, demand-driven product categories as a lifestyle retailer. Now, let's turn to a review of the business for the first quarter of 2023. We grew net sales by nearly double digits at 9.1%, with comparable stores up 2.1% and diluted earnings per share of $1.65. We had 7 points of non-comp sales growth in the quarter. The two primary drivers were new stores and the Orscheln acquisition. We opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and the Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the quarter. And the Orscheln integration is running ahead of schedule. Our comp sales results were below our expectations. We attribute just over 200 basis points, the majority of our sales miss to a delayed start to the spring and to a lesser extent, a milder January. We continue to closely review customer data for trends and changes in their behavior. While select discretionary categories were below in the chain average, this was offset by stronger demand in our consumable, usable and edible products. We believe our customers remain resilient, but are being judicious with their spending as they seek us out as a destination for value and are buying closer to need. Excluding our seasonal categories, our sales were in line with our expectations, and our core business remains very strong. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by ticket growth of 2.8%, offset by a decline in transactions of 0.7%. Importantly, our comp transaction trends improved each month of the quarter and were positive in February and March, with strong performance in our year-round categories. The strength in our year-round categories was driven by CUE products, which exhibited ongoing impressive demand this quarter. These products are needs-based and demand driven and are what drive trips and transactions to our stores. Across companion animal and livestock, we had strong performance. The strength we've experienced over the last three years in our CUE customer trends remains robust, as we continue to gain material market share. In companion animal, we continue to see substantial share gains throughout the category. And we're seeing sequential increases in the number of customers shopping us for this category each week, each month, each quarter. In livestock, our Chick Days event is shaping up to be the largest ever for us, with the poultry category up strong double digits. Not only are we seeing growth from existing customers, we're also seeing robust growth in new customers to the category, driving both trips and ticket. One exciting aspect of the new customers to the poultry category is that they're gravitating to our unique offering of premium breeds and organic feed products for their chicks. Chick Days is a great gateway for our new customers to explore Tractor Supply and use this as a resource for all things related to homesteading, beyond poultry to categories like gardening. Big ticket declines were driven by seasonal trends and to a lesser degree, ongoing pullback in discretionary categories. The slow start to spring impacted outdoor power equipment, which weighed on our big ticket results and average ticket. The most significant pressure was in zero-turn tractors, generators and trailers. Our customers have a long history of buying these items based on need. Current trends support that we are seeing purchasing consistently closer to the season or moment in need. Overall, our big ticket trends were very similar to what has been reported in the recent March retail sales data. Our mobile app currently represents more than 20% of our digital sales. The app is now ranked in the top 100 shopping apps on the iOS store. This is a major recognition of the progress in our ONETractor strategy to offer our customers a more seamless shopping experience. Our customer scores continue to run at all-time highs. Overall, our customer experience metrics continue to keep momentum into 2023, with strong improvements over the last quarter and year-over-year. Our store teams are doing a tremendous job servicing our customers. Our Neighbor's Club just celebrated last week a significant milestone with over 30 million members. As our points-based program enters its third year, the strength in Neighbor's Club continues to exceed our expectations. Our members are comping at a faster rate than our overall performance, and we continue to see strong growth and retention in our high-value customers. As mentioned previously, the Orscheln Farm and Home integration is going very well. I had the opportunity recently to visit one of our first store conversions to the Tractor Supply brand. There was excitement across both our team members and, importantly, our customers as they recognize that we're committed to providing the region with an elevated product assortment, a meaningful loyalty offering and enhanced digital shopping experience and so much more that Tractor Supply is able to offer. During the quarter, we opened our ninth and largest distribution center in Navarre, Ohio. The ramp of the distribution center is right on schedule. With the opening in the new DC, the integration of 81 Orscheln stores and addition of new TSC stores, we capitalized on the opportunity to realign the store servicing areas across the DC network to balance transportation costs and DC capacity, while improving service levels to our stores. It is great for our DC network to have this new capacity to better position our inventory and better service those stores, and allow us to reduce our freight costs, which you'll hear more about from Kurt. At Tractor Supply, our purpose as a company is to serve Life Out Here. As we celebrate our 85th anniversary this year, we remain steadfast in our commitment to preserve and protect our way of life. Two weeks ago, we issued our fourth annual Stewardship Tear Sheet, highlighting the actions and progress that we've made on our sustainability, DE&I and community commitments. I am proud of our progress towards our ambitious stewardship goals, but know there is more to be done as we work towards achieving our net-zero and other goals heading towards 2040. To wrap up, while our first quarter sales were below our expectations, we have a lot of the year still ahead of us. The American consumer broadly remains challenged, but we believe that our customer remains resilient. Spring continues to be cooler and wetter as we've turned into Q2. That said, we're encouraged by quarter-to-date trends, with comps mid-single digit and comp transactions positive. Based on our experience and the nature of our needs-based demand-driven business, we continue to believe that the best way to look at this business is on the half, as the timing of spring impacts the first half of the year. While we acknowledge that the softer sales in January will not be recouped, we are pleased with our lineup for spring and summer. As a company, we have numerous levers to continue to gain market share and numerous levers to effectively control expenses. We continue to see significant opportunities for growth and earnings growth as well. With the majority of the year remaining, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2023. Before I turn the call over to Seth, I'd like to share some background on Seth and the merchandising team at Tractor Supply. Seth is an 18-year veteran of Tractor Supply, having held roles across marketing, finance, e-commerce and merchandising. He has a passion for this lifestyle and has served as our Chief Merchant since 2020. Given our record sales growth over the last three years, we recently completed a realignment of our merchandising product categories and promoted two Vice Presidents to Senior Vice Presidents to better support the growing needs of our business. Seth will provide a review of our sales by category and our plans to continue to gain market share. Now, I'll turn the call over to Seth to discuss some further insights. Thanks, Kurt. Tractor Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over many business cycles. Throughout our 85-year history, we have successfully navigated all types of business environments and have emerged stronger each time. We continue to see positive migration trends to our markets. This marks the third consecutive year of positive population growth in rural America. This reflects an increased desire to seek out more space and take advantage of the affordability that country suburban, exurban and rural markets offer with a lower cost of living and the ability to live Life Out Here. It is our view that the sense of community found in our markets, and perhaps more importantly, the ability to secure a piece of property at a reasonable price, has ensured the rural migration trend is one that's here to stay for the time being. The millennial generation has embraced Life Out Here. Our customers have been resilient thus far in the face of slower macroeconomic growth, elevated inflation and higher interest rates, and they prioritize their lifestyle and passions. With significant growth and market share opportunities, we are excited about the balance of the year and remain confident in our business. My thanks and appreciation go out to the team for their dedication to living our mission values every day. And now, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Thank you so much. Yes. Stephen. Good morning, it's Hal, and thanks for your question. Thanks for joining our call. We remain very confident in our sales guidance or in our earnings guidance for the year. As we've stated on the call, about 200 basis points of our -- we were below our sales comp expectations by about 200 basis points due to weather. About 80% of that was due to the spring/fall off in the last three weeks of the quarter with about 20% of that being in January. So January is a much smaller component, particularly when you look at it over the fullness of the year. As Kurt said, there are a number of ways that we see path to recovering not only the Spring sales but potentially the winter sales as the year progress. As we mentioned in the year 2013, and there are several other years that have similar profiles where you've got a cooler weather spring, that has pushed the season into the summer time as yards remain, kind of, remain green and growing, past years remain growing cultivation in farms continue to happen, and our business remains strong into those years into those months. In particular, if you recall last year, in the midst of summer, we had one in 10-year drought. So the lapping of that looks very promising. On the consumer more broadly, we've not seen a sequential change in consumer behavior from Q3 and Q4 last year into Q1 of this year. The same themes that we were sharing last year are the same themes that we would reiterate here on this call. Discretionary, which only represents 15% of our business, continues to perform under average. That -- the pace of that is about the same as it was in Q3 and Q4. Our units per transaction continued to face modest pressure, low single-digits as consumers continue to be judicious in their basket. But that's -- we've been calling that out for the last couple of quarters. But otherwise, we've really not seen any sequential change in consumer spending. There are some categories where we're seeing spend, consumer shift up in their spend in poultry, our organic fee continues to be the strongest kind of, segment in our feed. In dog food, we are seeing economy continue to be strong, but that's actually due to the increased customers that Seth called out. If you look at our core customer base from one year ago and two years ago, they haven't changed at all their food buying behavior. So really not a lot of change in the consumer behavior from last year. Big ticket continues to run about the same. The January falloff was measurable but small. And really, it came down to the last 3 weeks of the quarter, which were cooler, wetter and snowier than we anticipated on top of an underperforming spring last year. Yes. Thanks, Steven Hey, Scott, so I'll reference that really just in the context of dominantly a big ticket and the fact that, historically, if you were to take out 2021, when you had the \u2013 the stimulus and you were to take out 2020 when there was a modest stimulus combined with, obviously, COVID, I think if you were to go back over like my 20-plus years history in retail and home improvement and the farm and ranch, Seth and Kurt, I think we'd all say that like things like riding lawn mowers, bigger ticket items like that, customers typically buy them when they need. The vast majority of those categories or purchases are needs based. And that's really what we were trying to signal is we're seeing more of that than we did kind of in 2020 and 2021, really more of reversion to kind of historic purchasing patterns of those sorts of categories, nothing otherwise intended to be implied. Exactly, exactly. Nothing otherwise intended to be implied. And thanks for the clarification. Hey, Chris, as we called out quarter-to-date, we're nearly done with April is mid-single-digit comps and low positive single-digit comp transactions. And so given the cool wet weather that's continued into April, we're relatively pleased with that performance. As a recollection from last year, June was not a strong spring selling season. The last year's spring only had a handful of really good weeks, and then it went very hot. And that's what I was referencing earlier about the drought. If you recall, on our Q2 call, we started to talk about the drought in the back half of -- kind of back half of June and into July. And then we reiterated that that we saw that impact us for the first six, eight weeks of Q3 as well. So, we are optimistic that we can have a solid May comp on top of a weaker June and have an extended selling season into July and August this year, particularly in core areas for us, like Florida, Texas, and California. California and Texas, in particular, were under extreme drought conditions by the time we got to mid-June last year and really extended into September. As we know, those areas have had extreme weather the first half -- the first quarter of this year. We're all reading about the flooding in California and such. And we think that will bode well for us as we get into the summertime in those areas of the country. Yes. And thanks for calling that out, Chris. As Kurt mentioned in his prepared remarks, we see a variety of ways for us to achieve our guidance this year, both on the sales side and on the earnings side. And as it relates to earnings, there's a number of expense opportunities that are starting to show up, if you will, particularly in our supply chain and in the Orscheln integration cost. On the gross margin side, look, this is the benefit of being a scaled player in our market. And when you start to see kind of just a little bit of moderation in pricing, we're able to take advantage of that and drive some upside in our gross margin rate and still remain incredibly price competitive and lead the market there. Additionally, we've seen container costs come down significantly, and that's starting to flow through. And it had some impact in Q1, but it will have more impact in Q2 and Q3. Also domestic freight is starting to trend down as well. There was a couple of, I think -- recently, one of the big freight companies mentioned that we were in a freight recession or depression, and that bodes well for us in terms of being able to leverage our scale to drive down freight costs, in particular because we've got new routes to market coming online with our new DC. And obviously, with the 150 stores we have that we're building plus with Orscheln. So, we feel really good about our gross margin rate performance. Do you feel like there's continued upside as we look towards the year? And that's one of the reasons that gives us strong confidence to be able to reinforce our guidance. Yeah. Hey, good morning. And thanks, Seth, for the question. I'll speak just about Orscheln integration for a moment. First off, it's -- the integration is going very well. Most importantly, it's being well received by the Orscheln team members as they are converting to Tractor Supply team members. And it's also being really well received by customers and even more so than I anticipated. Secondly, the team is doing a fantastic job cadencing the stores and transitioning them over to Tractor Supply banners. We have several done already. We've got almost 20 that are converted from a point-of-sale transaction. We're implementing the Fusion remodel on all of them, and we are on -- we are ahead of schedule on those transitions. And then what that allows us to do is to take our back half plan and optimize a bit how the expense structure that we had planned. And so, specifically, there's two elements that are driving that. The first is our IT integration cost. Our team is doing an excellent job integrating from an IT perspective, and we're finding some leverage there and some need to not have to spend what we previously anticipated. And the second is around the sale of the SSC and the DC. We previously planned that to the end of the year. We're now optimistic that we can pull that forward by maybe a month or two or three, and we'll save some dollars there as well from an operating cost perspective. So in general, the Orscheln acquisition is going very, very well. We're very pleased with how it's progressing and wanted to share that outlook today. More broadly, what I'd say is, I think like most companies that are reporting this weekly cycle, everyone is kind of -- you seem to see a lot of people holding guidance in spite of like what you just articulated, some upside for us on gross margin rate, on expense and others just in the spirit of -- because there's a lot of the year left to go. And Brian, this is Hal. Just to add on to that. I mean, if you go back and look at weeks eight, nine and 10, where we were starting to comp on some tougher weather from last year, and kind of, late spring, early March was actually good weather, kind of, reasonably across the country, we had high single-digit comps those three weeks. And then as you get into the last three weeks, we had negative comps those three weeks, and it was driven by the geographies that Kurt mentioned, kind of, from the State of Virginia all the way up to the Northeast through the Midwest. And they were comping on top of tough weather from last year, and it was worse weather than they had -- than we had this year. You know, if you look at areas like Kurt said, in Florida and Texas and elsewhere, we had good seasonal spring seasonal businesses in those areas. So really, we just point to those three weeks. And then as we said, as we bounce back here in April at the mid single-digit comp rate. We'd love to be a weather predictor and be good at it. As you know, most of the weather forecast you get are either 12 months out and then like three weeks out. But the reason we brought up 2013. 2014, by the way, was a kind of reasonably similar year pattern, where you had a similar -- in fact, we went back and pulled our earnings transcripts from those dates and looked at them. And we almost had a very similar earnings call where we talked about weather in Q1, cold, wetter, could potentially lead to an extended selling season into the summer, and that's sure enough is exactly what happened in both of those years. And that's why we brought it up to say there is very much a precedent for it. And in particular, this year we'll be comping on top of a one and 10-year drought last year. So we're cautiously optimistic that we can have an extended selling season this year, which would be on top of tougher comps -- I mean, easier comps from last year. Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yeah, hey Steven, thanks so much for the question. I'll hit three things quickly and just in the sake of time. First off, the capital spend for both the garden center projects, kind of side lot transformations and the inside-the-store Fusion transformation continues to reduce. It's a key area of focus and one of our primary metrics that we're evaluating our performance on our strategic initiatives this year. The second thing is the performance of our Fusion and Side Lot remodels are continuing to perform at the same rate as they have in the last couple of years, which we're incredibly pleased with because we're now reaching significant scale on both inside of our company. The third thing is, we are very pleased with the live goods performance. I think it's strategically going to be big for us this year. It's a low-cost way for people to beautify their yards, kind of -- and there's going to be a lot of refreshing coming out of the December and November storms that happened and we are well-positioned for that. And one of the things we always talk about is you can now see live goods sales, \u201cfrom space\u201d in our daily and weekly sales reporting, which is exactly what the plan was at the beginning of the year now with 350 garden centers."

            "name": "Seth Estep",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal. I'm excited to share with you some insights into our merchandising categories and market share position. We are committed to driving sales productivity as we deepen our relationships with our customers. I'd like to start by congratulating Nicole Logan, SVP of Animal and Softline divisions; and Randall Dodds, SVP of Seasonal and Hardline divisions on the recent promotions. They each bring significant retail and industry experience that complement their tenure at Tractor Supply. These new roles each have three merchandising divisions reporting to each of them. It is exciting to have this new organizational structure to allow us to operate at greater scale, have deeper category insights and enhanced strategic partnerships. Overall, we're now organized into six merchandising divisions. So let's start with our largest division, companion animal, that represents more than 20% of our 2022 sales. This business includes both the consumables and hard lines across companion animal. Around 75% of the Tractor Supply customers have a pet, and approximately 50% have more than one pet. Also, our customers dog weight on average about 20 pounds more than the US average. With the ongoing humanization of companion animals, these key structural tailwinds support our positive outlook on this category. We are a destination for pet customers, with a comprehensive and differentiated assortment at an everyday low price, and we continue to gain share. For example, our growth in pet food, treats and litter continues to lead the market in both dollar and pound growth, gaining another 33 basis points of share in Q1. Our business model of private brands, strong national and differentiated partners, club pack sizes and legendary customer service sets us up to continue gaining share, perhaps even more if we see the consumer more pressured for value. Moving on to our second largest division, livestock and equine, which represents just under 20% of sells. This is a key category for farm and ranch, and we continue to consistently outperform the market. Of note, this category is almost solely the consumables portion of our lifestyle seed categories. In other words, this business does not include fencing, which, in many ways, can be considered containment for large animals. With strong exclusive brands like DuMOR and Producer's Pride, along with national brands from Purina, Cargill, Triple Crown and more, we continue to innovate across our key categories of poultry, equine and cattle. We are the clear leader in this space, with approximately 20% market share. Broadly, one out of every five bags of animal feed is bought at Tractor Supply, and we continue to take share, consistently outperforming the market by 5 percentage points. Next up in our category lineup at an equal weighting are our seasonal and our truck tool and hardware divisions. We are excited to get our spring seasonal business off and running. This is an area where we think we have substantial share opportunities. We are a leader in core categories like outdoor power as the destination for Zero Turn Mowers and categories like grass feed and fertilizers. Also, our live goods assortment is included in this division. As of today, we have more than 350 garden centers ready for spring, with the vast majority just entering year two of operations. Where spring weather has cooperated, we are very excited about our customers' response to the expanded product offering and layout in our Fusion and Garden Center stores. More broadly, this season, we are offering a differentiated garden assortment of live goods, including vegetables and plants, soils, mulch, and chemicals tailored to Life Out Here. We like our initial reads for seasonal products where the weather has turned and are excited for the spring season. Our fourth division is truck, tool and hardware that includes lifestyle items like trailers, power tools, welders and truck accessories. Historically, in tools, we have serviced as a convenience play in power tools and hardware. As part of our Fusion layout, we have made significant investments in corresponding progress on elevating our power tool selection, and it has resulted in one of the highest sales lift categories in our Fusion stores. The additions of Makita, Bosch and Dremel, coupled with being the exclusive retail destination for Porter-Cable power tools, has allowed us to have consistent share gains over the last three years. Up next is our Ag and Outdoor Recreation division, which includes categories such as fencing and sprayers as well as our outdoor sport categories. We are in the business of helping people maintain their land and contain their animals. We have the largest share in the country and have outgrown the market by mid-single digits. And for outdoor recreation, we are very excited about the growth prospects for this segment as we test an expanded assortment in several Orscheln Farm and Home stores. Our final segment ranked on sales volume is clothing and decor, which has exhibited rapid growth since the pandemic, trending well above the company average. This business includes apparel, footwear and farmhouse decor. As one of the largest retailers of Carhartt, along with other brands like Wrangler and Colombia, our customers are finding our assortment meets their workwear needs and their lifestyle. For years, we've known there was a market opportunity in women's workwear at Tractor Supply. And the team has leaned into this category, and the shopper is responding. While still off a relatively small base, our women's apparel business grew 24% in Q1, led by growth in our exclusive brands of Blue Mountain and Ridgecut. We will continue to look for ways to grow these high-margin categories by growing both leading national and best-in-class exclusive brands. In closing, with our new alignment and additional resources, Tractor Supply is well positioned to continue to be the market leader and operate with speed, agility and efficiency to capture growth and drive sales productivity. We are in the midst of one of the most exciting times at Tractor Supply as we are in the spring season. And I hope you get a chance to get out to our stores and see all the exciting merchandising experiences and product innovation. Now, I'll turn it over to Kurt. Hey, Kate, just to add a couple of points on that. Thanks for your question. This is Seth. Hey, in general, right now, if we look at our business and we think about where we're going to continue to grow market share, again, to Kurt's point, we are very excited to see market share gains, particularly like in our companion animal or our pet and our dog businesses as well as on the cat side. Our entire portfolio, if you call it like in pet food, is growing extremely strong. As Hal mentioned earlier, we're seeing our current customer base, our previous customer base really maintaining those categories in which they were purchasing, they're coming more often. And we're gaining a lot of new shoppers across the portfolio. And we think our merchandising strategy and our portfolio strategy, particularly in things like pet and pet food, is very much a strategic advantage for us to continue to gain market share. Newness and innovation is critical. Our merchants are continuing to drive comprehensive resets across the box and where they're planned. And if you also look at other items that are relative to lifestyle, whether that be like poultry, feed, forage, sporting goods, as we mentioned earlier, we are continuing to lead in those categories. So, for us, we are, by far, leading share in the industry and in farm and ranch, far away leading pet share gains. We don't anticipate that slowing down based on the activity that we're seeing and the customer response we're seeing in our database today. Hey, Scott, yes, Seth, thanks for the question. Absolutely on those questions today. For us, kind of what we said earlier, for us, as we continue to grow rapidly over the course of the last few years, we saw an opportunity to continue to double down and drive at a greater scale, our merchandising activities, really driving towards innovation, really driving towards strategic partnerships, driving into categories, driving into regionalization, localization, so that we can really maximize all the work we're doing with like our Fusion, our Garden Centers, all those type things. So if we look at our portfolio strategy, we see share opportunities across many of the areas of our addressable market. We just mentioned pet. We see that we continue to have opportunities there. We reorganized our feed and our core livestock and equine division to species, where we're really driving a category management approach. We're basically taking the way in which we've managed our pet business over the course of the last few years and applying those same category management principles on new items, shopper insights, adjusting the flow, localization, regionalization to continue to make sure that we are offering the best-in-class shopper experience as we have new shoppers entering today. I mentioned we're going to be piloting some things like in Orscheln Farm and Home, Sporting goods did very well for us in Q1. And we're going to continue to lean in where we have our strengths. A lot of those categories today are just in our center core for six months. We think we have an opportunity to drive those businesses year-round. I can go on and on, but we think that the new structure that we're putting in place today is allowing us to have more agility, continue to move fast, operate at scale and continue to drive deeper partnerships and innovation. So very excited about this, and we're starting to really see some programs come to life under this new structure. Absolutely. Leveraging our 30 million members in our database is such a strategic advantage for us, not only in farm and ranch, but just in broader retail in the categories in which we serve. We are continuing to deep dive into those categories, and we are partnering in a significant way with our vendor base to say, hey, where do we continue to end up where we have opportunities, what are those cohorts that we need to continue to go after? And how do we continue to drive regionalization, localization, and use that into our assortment planning process. So absolutely. It is -- Neighbor's Club is fundamental to everything we're doing not only from a marketing perspective, but it is a core driver of everything we're doing in merchandising because the customer is what we're looking to continue to drive to make sure we know where their needs are today, but where they're going in the future."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Seth, and hello to everyone on the call. I will add on to Hal's comments about the quarter and our outlook for the year. Let's start with our first quarter results. Regarding the cadence of comp sales for the quarter, we started out with a soft January. Last year's January was strong, so we expect it to start soft, but we did not anticipate that the month would be the second warmest in 30-plus years. February was more normalized and in line with our expectations, but the mild winter continued to pressure results. To put it in perspective, our heating categories were down nearly 50%, insulated outerwear was down over 30% and emergency response categories were also down significantly. As a result, our winter seasonal products were down double digits for the quarter. Our expectation was that as we moved through the quarter, we would see a more normalized spring selling season unfold, where we saw the majority of the shortfall was really in the last three weeks of March, which were abnormally wet and much cooler than normal, as well as winter weather continued in the Midwest and Northeast. To put it in historical context, March was the coldest in four years with below-average temperatures nationally, the wettest in eight years and the snowiest in 30 years. Correspondingly, our spring seasonal products were flat to the prior year, well below our expectations. Sales in the quarter benefited in the high-single digits from retail price inflation. Most of this inflation reflects retail price changes that were put in place in the second half of 2022 that we have not lapped as of yet. The benefit of price inflation to our average ticket growth was offset by three key factors: First, the majority of the pressure on average ticket all revolved around seasonal goods. This includes the softness in big ticket, declines in seasonal, which runs at a higher average ticket and higher winter clearance. Second, faster growth in consumable transactions, in particular companion animal and poultry, which typically have a lower average ticket. And then third, to a lesser extent, a reduction in units per transaction in impulser add-on items like dog treats and candy and snacks. Moving down our income statement. Gross margin was 35.5%, an increase of 52 basis points from 34.9% last year. We were very pleased with these results. We remain committed to being the everyday low-price leader in our markets. Promotional activity was in line with last year with a modest increase in winter clearance, as we looked to exit the season clean. Moderating freight costs for import and domestic shipments provided a net gross margin benefit. Our price management initiatives and lower freight costs more than offset the impact from cost inflation and product mix from the robust growth of our CUE categories. As a percent of sales, SG& A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased 119 basis points to 28.1% from 26.9% a year ago. For perspective, about half of this growth was anticipated for our strategic initiatives. As a reminder, our planned investments included higher depreciation and amortization from the step-up in capital spending to support our growth agenda, and the addition of our new distribution center and the impact from the Orscheln acquisition. The remaining increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to deleverage, given the moderate comparable store sales growth. As we've mentioned, the quarter was trending in line with our expectations, leading up to the last three weeks of March, providing limited opportunities to adjust the cost structure. Specifically, we chose to continue to fully fund payroll for the last two weeks of the quarter to support the spring season, utilizing the hours to get ahead on product assembly and other sales driving tasks. For the quarter, operating income was essentially flat with last year, with a modest decline in net income. Diluted EPS was $1.65, also flat with the prior year's first quarter. We opened 17 Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the first quarter. This represents a significant improvement in the cadence of our new store openings. Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $3 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing an increase of about 12% in average inventory per store. This increase is primarily attributable to inflation, a better in-stock position from last year and the delay in the spring selling season. We are pleased with how we exited the winter season and the quality of our inventory as of the end of the first quarter. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet, with a leverage ratio of around 2.0 times. Our guidance for 2023 is unchanged. We continue to expect full year sales of $15 billion to $15.3 billion and project comparable store sales to increase 3.5% to 5.5%. As we manage through the first half of the year, we expect to see comp sales towards the top half of our guidance for the second quarter. We anticipate some increased pressure on discretionary categories, but are pleased with the growth in CUE products along with DIY categories like repairs and maintenance. Let me share further insights on the outlook for the remainder of the year. We anticipate Q2 and Q3 to have the strongest comp sales growth potential, while Q4 is expected to be closer to the low end of the guidance range due to the strong compares to the prior year. Operating margin performance is expected to improve as we move through the year with Q4 having the highest potential, principally from the lap of the onetime acquisition-related costs of Orscheln. As a reminder, our Novar, Ohio, distribution center is expected to begin to benefit gross margin in the second quarter with the ramp up in the second half of the year as we capture freight savings. The benefits in gross margin will be offset by approximately 15 basis points of negative drag on SG&A as the cost of the distribution center are reflected in SG&A. We have confidence in our earnings in a variety of sales scenarios. For example, at times, a cooler and wetter start to the spring can provide an extended selling season. We've seen this type of seasonal cadence before such as 2013, and we are cautiously optimistic of the upside it can bring to the third quarter. Regardless of the state of the consumer, we are confident in the resiliency of our business model and our ability to manage the business. In a scenario where we do not make up miss January sales, we see opportunities for further operating leverage. Specifically, we are seeing an easing of our supply chain capacity constraints, which should drive additional efficiencies in the second half. And we now anticipate greater accretion for porcelains in the back half. We are raising our accretion assumption to $0.15 per share compared to our prior expectation of $0.10 per share. To sum it up, for the full year, we continue to guide toward net income of $1.13 billion to $1.17 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $10.30 to $10.60. Over my 23 years with Tractor Supply, it has been proven time after time weather can be transitory. And the best way to look at our business is not by the quarter, but by the halves of the year. In this environment, what sets Tractor Supply apart is our ability to effectively manage the top line and bottom line while investing in our Life Out Here strategic growth drivers. And with that, I will turn the call back to Hal. Simeon, this is Kurt. I'll hit both of those. Why don't I start with the second then the first. It's a quick one. The -- the variation between geographies between weeks all reinforce what Hal was just saying. To your question, if you take like the Midwest, Northeast Commonwealth states, you compare that to the rest of the geographies. You did see a disparity because those states had a very mild winter, where it's really strong for them. And then they saw no spring, they basically saw more snowfall in March than they did in January. So we did see a very clear disparity between those low or mid-single-digit negative to mid-single-digit positive in the other geographies, which, again, just gives us the confidence in the trends of the business. On the gross margin question, I'll give the primary drivers, and I'll just give you the order of magnitude on what we're seeing in gross margin. And these are all areas of structural improvements. These are things that we planned for, but as Hal said, we see continued upside in gross margin. First is our price management was the biggest driver of that. That was offset by the second, which would have been a mix impact from CUE and then the third was benefit from freight. Freight is the one that we believe continues to have potential benefit going forward. On price management, just a couple of points on there. When we talk price management, it really includes more than just managing the retail price. It's the retail pricing, it's the management of everyday low pricing, our promos, and then even the cost negotiation and concessions. And Seth the team did an excellent job leveraging our scale, our size in this environment to produce a strong enough price management direct margin to offset -- more than offset the CUE. So between retail price management and pressure from CUE, that was about half the benefit. Transportation was about the other half. Hey, Brian, this is Kurt. Yes. On that, I'll give -- I'll just continue to give a few points. In areas where they're not as impacted by weather, you heard me mention to the previous question, the South, the Texas area, Far West, all those areas we saw performance in line with our expectations versus the areas of the North and Midwest where it was below our expectations. I'll also add in what also was so evident to us is that internally, when we look at the variation by categories in merchandising, the categories that we -- that are not impacted by weather variations right in line with expectations. When we look at the weeks within it, you can look at the first few weeks and the last three weeks, and you see which weeks are not like the others. And then when we look at our external measurements, where we've utilized market industry information on that, it also confirms that Tractor Supply outperformed the market. In farm and ranch, we've seen in market industries, it's running negative in those, especially in those areas where there is a lot of farm and ranch competition. So from all the data points that we see for -- I mean, for Q1, the -- any of the softness was seasonal and then as we look throughout the rest of this quarter, it's really a matter of when does spring start. It's not if, but when. And it's a matter of whether it's ideal, typical, poor, but Tractor Supply has been able to pivot and be able to manage each of those quarters. And to house point, it's very much shaping up like one of those years where it gives us the opportunity for a good extended selling season. Kate, hey, this is Kurt. Our original expectation and guidance, just to reiterate that, we see as we entered this year, GDP growing 1% to 2% was our assumption. And then Tractor Supply has historically been growing outside of that as we're grabbing market share, so another 1% or 2% of growth beyond that. And where Seth talked about -- where we're gaining market share, we are certainly gaining market share in categories like companion animal, in poultry, in other areas. And so that gain is part of what we expect to be able to do. But I'd also say, as we look at this year, where there may be any challenges in regards to the consumer, this is a great opportunity. Just like we saw where some discretionary, saw some softness, offset by a robust gain in market share. And I think that's the resiliency of the business, and that's -- one of the exciting things is that, if there is some softness in some categories, we've got opportunity in live goods, companion animal, others to gain market share. And we see upside to our market share gains compared to our standard model for this year and the next couple of years. Yes. Peter, I'll hit those. On the inflation, our outlook on the retail price inflation for the year hasn't changed much at all. A vast majority of retail price inflation, as I mentioned in Q1, was what was put in place in the second half of last year. And we're seeing a bit of a steady plateau. Maybe some categories like pet will continue to see some. So our expectation is high single-digit Q1 moving into the mid single-digit Q2 to maybe slightly lower in Q3 and then getting into low single-digit Q4. And we're not seeing significant cost deflation. So at this point, there may be some deflation in certain areas of the business. But overall, there's some disinflation that we have expected in there. The great thing is, this year, we expect to see comp transactions really being a key driver to it. And that's what we're seeing right now, as Hal mentioned. And our expectation, as the year unfolds, it really is a good balance between ticket and transactions. Lastly, I'd say what is exciting, you heard this from both Hal and I is in other parts of the business, in cost, in SG&A, we are taking advantage of our ability to use the scale where there's either excess capacity or there's cost coming down. The operating expenses have efficiencies there and you heard that in some of our messaging. So hopefully, that helps answer the question, a lot of great expectation. Our ability in any sales scenario to really have increased operating margin in 2023. Yes, absolutely, Peter. Neighbor's Club has been an integral part of driving our business and enabling customer behavior, particularly on our consumables. More and more of our customers are signing up for our private label credit card. We announced last quarter that we reached for the first time $1 billion in sales on that credit card. You get a 5% discount when you use the credit card in your purchases, which drives kind of repeat behavior on food and feed in particular. As Seth talked about, we are outgrowing the feed market by 5 points repeatedly every single quarter. And we have a 20% share far and away the largest share in the market in that category. Same thing on dog food, I mean we are far and away the share leader in dog food. It doesn't matter what metric you look at, pounds, units, dollar growth and even new customer counts. Every single week, our new customer counts for dog food are going up. And those are what we can count on to drive our transactions. And I think one of the things you mentioned is the business has -- is kind of changing to some degree from kind of three, four, five years ago in terms of having the scale we have in pet food now to complement the scale we've always had in Animal Feed and that's driving positive comp transactions for us. As we said, even in March, where we had soft weather on the seasonal side, it still allowed us to have positive comp transactions."

Now it's my pleasure to turn it over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My sincere thanks and appreciation go out to my fellow 50,000 Tractor Supply team members. I know we all have been watching the devastation over the last few weeks that's been wrecked by Hurricane Helene and Milton with great concern and heartbreak. Hurricane Helene struck particularly close to the heart for me, given my roots in East Tennessee. Tractor Supply has taken a multitude of actions, big and small to take care of our team members, customers, and communities during this difficult time. I'd like to give a special thank you to all our team members who rallied to help the communities impacted by this storm season. We will continue to be there for our team members, customers from our communities in the days and months ahead for the recovery process. I would also like to thank our many vendor partners who are stepping up in the recovery effort. As it relates to a sales benefit from our response, we had no material benefit in Q3, but have seen an impact in Q4 and additionally have been somewhat encouraged by the recent change of seasons. This morning, we shared some exciting news that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Allivet, a leading online pet pharmacy. This is a company we know very well as they've been excellent partners to us in fulfilling our pet subscription business for the last couple of years. This is a great opportunity for us to bring another benefit to our 37 million Neighbor's Club members. Allivet offers a convenient and cost-effective way to get medications and specialty items for their pets and livestock. The addition of Allivet allows us to expand our total addressable market by about $15 billion. Allivet is a best-in-class platform with an excellent management team and a strong financial profile. This is a great example of a strategic tuck-in acquisition. We anticipate that Allivet will be accretive to earnings in 2025, and we look forward to welcoming the Allivet team to Tractor Supply. We are planning to host an Investment Community Day in New York City on the afternoon of Thursday, December 5th. At that time, we look forward to providing more details on our Life Out Here strategy for the second half of the decade, including our plans to leverage Allivet online and in stores. So now let's shift to the quarter. For the third quarter, the macro retail environment was in line with our expectations and our customer remained resilient. While the overall economy remained strong as evidenced by a 3% Q2 GDP, overall retail sales continued to moderately underperform. The primary driver of this underperformance is the continued shift of consumer spend to services. As a consequence, we estimate that retail sales growth was nearly flat in our third quarter. It is our estimate that the Farm & Ranch channel was modestly negative in the quarter and that we continue to be a share gainer. I would describe the sentiment of our customer as relatively stable as supported by the recent jobs report and the current unemployment rate of 4.1%. Consistent with prior quarters, our consumer continues to be judicious with their spending focused on innovation, newness, and needs-based products. Year-to-date through the third quarter, the macro retail environment is running in line with the subdued expectations that we had as we entered the year. Also, as expected, our team has managed our business exceptionally well. Correspondingly, our sales and profitability to continue to run in the range of our beginning guidance and have allowed us to consistently raise the lower end of our outlook. Let's turn to some highlights of our performance for the quarter. We grew net sales by 1.6% with comparable-store sales down a slight 0.2%. Diluted EPS was $2.24. Our comparable-store sales performance was driven by transaction growth of 0.3%, offset by average ticket decline of 0.5%. Emergency response, as mentioned earlier, had no material impact on Q3 comp sales. As we shared on our last call, we anticipated that the quarter would be in line with our full-year guidance. As we move through the quarter, many of the same trends from the first half of the year continued to play out. Notably, our customer engagement remains strong. The investments we've made in our Neighbor's Club, our world-class loyalty program are a competitive advantage for us as we continue to see solid growth in customer counts and retention. Our Neighbor's Club comp sales continue to outpace our overall sales growth. At the same time, we reached an all-time high on our sales penetration and a record membership of more than 37 million members. Our Neighbor's Club retention rate remains remarkably consistent as our best customers continue to shop us more frequently and remain extremely loyal. Our Hometown Heroes program has gained traction with our customers as our store team members have rallied around this unique benefit as an opportunity to engage with veterans and first responders in their local communities. Additionally, our new customer data platform has gone live for all stores and digital platforms, which will allow for greater data integrity, a 360-degree view of our customer, and deeper personalization. Overall, our Neighbor's Club offerings continue to drive meaningful wins with our members. At Tractor Supply, we continue to invest in customer service as we believe is it a differentiator for us. Our customers come to us for trusted advice. Our commitment to excellence and service and investments in training, tools, and technology are being recognized by our customers. Our scores continue to run at all-time highs with improvements year-over-year every month for 40 consecutive months. Turning to our category performance. Strong positive comps in big-ticket items continued for the third quarter, notably in Zero-turn, and Front Engine Riding lawnmowers as well as recreational vehicles. This year, our team did a tremendous job bringing newness and innovation with attractive pricing to these categories and our customers have responded positively to the new product lineup and our investment in inventory. As we experienced last quarter, we anticipated our consumable, usable, and edible products would run modestly below in the chain average in the third quarter as deflation weighed on our average unit retail. The needs-based demand-driven nature of our product categories continues to drive unit velocity in this segment of our business. Specifically in Pet Food, industry data suggests the category was slightly positive in Q3, consistent with trends through the first part of the year as the category disinflates and pet ownership trends remain soft. Our business in this category, while moderating from historical trends, continues to be a share winner in both households and dollars, although this is a small number math at this point. A couple of data points on share. Tractor supply was 2 times the category growth rate in Q3 and nearly 6 times that of the grocery channel. Again, pointing back that this is small number math relative to the previously higher-growth rates that this category has seen in the last few years. In the quarter, in the Pet business, we invested in in-stock inventory rates, maintain our emphasis on EDLP, leveraged our customer service to drive basket building, and focused our marketing on the newness and innovation we've added to our lineup. In our most recent all-store meeting, we invested in training for our nearly 45,000 store team members on selling techniques for pet food and driving treat attachments. We also had a very successful Pet Appreciation Days where we marketed newly introduced brands like ACANA and Real Mesa and our exclusive brands such as Retriever, 4health, and MuttNation by Miranda Lambert. In Equine, livestock, and poultry feed, we continue to gain market share. While average unit retails are down mid-to-high single-digits in these categories, we had unit or pound growth across all species. And as large animal counts continue to be pressured, we are certainly a shared winner with our strong unit performance. Much like the first half of the year, categories that performed below our comp sales growth were in our discretionary businesses such as clothing, footwear and outdoor living as well as in hardlines products such as ag fencing and pet kennels. Additionally, seasonal businesses such as heating, heating fuel, and insulated outerwear were negative. Our customer continues to respond to newness and innovation. A great example is the strong start to our Halloween Decor, which included a differentiated and expanded assortment such as the six-foot rooster skeleton that went viral. Another great example is in wildlife supplies, we're a destination for deer corn and have expanded this year into trail cameras and feeders. Our digital sales continue to outperform with double-digit growth. The team has made substantial improvements in search and checkout. We continue to accelerate our digital sales with platforms that set the standard for our customers and rival best-in-class retail experiences. We opened 16 new tractor supply stores in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 54. Our new-store productivity continues to perform very well. Our pipeline for '25 and into '26 remains very robust with significant runway for low-risk, value-creating organic growth ahead of us. As we exited the third quarter, we've achieved some significant milestones in our Life Out Here strategy. We now have 45% of our chain in our Project Fusion layout and more than 550 garden centers. These are capital investments that provide a multi-year runway for growth and extend the terminal value of our stores. They help us to be more relevant to both our core and new customers, allowing us to garner a greater share of their spending and be the dependable supplier for their lifestyle. I commend the team on these investments and results given the scope and scale of these initiatives. It is hard to identify another retailer that has made this substantial investment in their store base in such a short period of time. We've also made major investments in our supply chain. Over the last four years, the team has added 2 million square feet to our DC capacity with the seamless opening of two new distribution centers. These new DCs have allowed us to service our existing store base while providing flexibility for future volume and new-store growth. The addition of 10 mixing centers, bringing our total to 16 has improved our service levels to our stores. A new import distribution center has also allowed for greater flexibility to flow our seasonal goods. As a result, we have had a 20% structural improvement in our STEM models and corresponding cost savings. Our DC productivity has also reached strong levels. In conclusion, the team is performing admirably short term and long term. True to truck supply style, we are efficiently managing the elements within our control and advancing our Life Out Here strategy. As we enter the fourth quarter, we are raising the low end of our guidance for the fiscal '24 sales and earnings to reflect our performance year-to-date and our outlook for the fourth quarter of the year. The fourth quarter has started out well as we benefited from emergency response sales for Hurricane Helene and Milton, both of which were fourth quarter events for us. This sales benefit is reflected in our guidance for the year. As we plan for the fourth quarter, we continue to anticipate that our customers remain prudent with their spending as is typical in an election year. We are capitalizing on our strengths and enhancing our competitive edge in the market with the support of our team members, their strong connections with our customers, and our successful strategic initiatives, we continue to outpace our competitors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kurt to provide more color on our performance and outlook.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Hal, and good morning to everyone on the call. As Hal mentioned, our third quarter top-line results were consistent with our expectations and in line with the results in the first half of the year. We saw continued strength in big ticket sales, while our discretionary categories remained pressured. Our seasonal category performance, exclusive of big ticket, was in line with chain average at a modest decline to prior year. Similar to the first half of the year, we saw strong performance in seasonal categories such as live goods, mulches and soils, grilling, and wildlife supplies. This was offset by softness in ag fencing, heating, outdoor living, and lawn and garden tools. As we expected, our C.U.E. performance was slightly below the chain average given the retail price deflation and moderating pet category trends the industry is experiencing. Retail price deflation, which was approximately 1% was in line with our expectations. The vast majority of this deflation came from our C.U.E. categories. As Hal mentioned, we are pleased with our unit movement in C.U.E. as we successfully managed through the impact of deflation this quarter and are now starting to lap the beginning of this deflationary cycle from last year. Our comp sales growth was relatively consistent across all regions of the chain within a range of down 2% to up modestly. The strongest regional performance was in Texhoma due to inventory investments made in big ticket, easier compares, and better overall weather compared to last year. This strength was offset by pressure in the Far West, Midwest, and Commonwealth as the summer heat lingered and a lack of the change of season to fall in these areas. As to the cadence of the quarter, all months were also in a relatively tight band of essentially plus or minus 1%. Weather was generally a net neutral factor in the third quarter comparable sales results. Extreme heat persisted throughout the quarter in certain regions with no shift to cooler weather in the northern regions. Hurricane Helene and other storms in the last two weeks of the quarter did not produce net incremental sales to Q3 as any pre-hurricane demand was more than offset by softer volume in the South as a result of heavy rains and continued intense heat in the Far West and Midwest regions. We do believe this created a timing shift that has benefited early Q4 sales. Moving down to our income statement. Our gross margin increased 56 basis points compared to last year. We continue to be very pleased with these results, which were driven primarily by ongoing lower transportation costs along with disciplined product cost management and the continued execution of an Everyday Low Price strategy. These improvements were partially offset by the mix impact from strong growth in big ticket categories, which have below-chain average margins. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 119 basis points to 27.8%. This increase was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included the onboarding of a new distribution center and higher depreciation and amortization, as well as modest deleverage of our fixed costs given the decline in comparable-store sales. The new DC was approximately a 25 basis point headwind on SG&A for the quarter. We were also lapping a one-time depreciation expense benefit in the prior year of approximately 35 basis points or $11 million. These factors were partially offset by strong productivity and cost control and to a lesser extent, a slight benefit from our ongoing sale-leaseback transactions. For the quarter, operating profit margin was 9.4%. Diluted EPS was $2.24 compared to $2.33 last year, which included a $0.08 benefit from the depreciation change I mentioned earlier. Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $3.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, representing an increase of 4.3% in average inventory per store. Last quarter, we shared that we had strategically invested in inventory as we look to improve our in-stock position in queue and support the strength in our big-ticket sales. We effectively controlled our inventory as we reduced our average inventory growth per store by more than 50% sequentially from the second quarter. Our inventory levels and in-stock rates are in excellent shape as we enter the fourth quarter. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2 times. Our announced acquisition of Allivet fits perfectly with our tuck-in M&A strategy and is highly complementary to our business. Given that we have significant financial flexibility, this acquisition will be financed by our balance sheet. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $760 million of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Looking ahead, we are updating our fiscal 2024 guidance to raise the lower end of the range on both the top line and earnings. We now anticipate net sales to be in the range of $14.85 billion to $15 billion. We expect comparable-store sales to be between flat-to-up 1%. We are forecasting an operating margin rate of 9.8% to 10.1%. Our net income is expected to be between $1.09 billion to $1.12 billion, and we anticipate diluted earnings per share of $10.10 to $10.40 compared to our prior guidance of $10 to $10.40. As I see it today, our outlook for the remainder of the year is appropriately described as right down the middle of the fairway. At this time, we believe that our EPS will more likely be at the midpoint of the range, allowing for a breadth of possibilities that remains quite varied for Q4. As Hal mentioned, the fourth quarter is off to a solid start with the most significant sales weeks of the quarter still ahead of us. We continue to see the quarter having a wider range of potential outcomes on comp sales given the easier compares while acknowledging that we could see more volatility in consumer spending. On the high end of our outlook range, in addition to the easing compares, factors we considered include a more normalized start to winter, lapping net deflation, which began in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the emergency response activity from the recent hurricanes. On the low end of the range, dynamics we contemplated include moderation in big-ticket trends, potential consumer uncertainty due to the federal election, and a shorter holiday selling season with five less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Our outlook on gross margin, SG&A, and operating margin remain consistent with past commentary. In the fourth quarter, we'll be lapping our most difficult gross margin comparison with 129 basis points of expansion in the prior year, where we began to see the benefits from lower transportation costs and our product cost management initiative. As to SG&A, we anticipate better performance than in the third quarter given our comp sales outlook. We continue to forecast the return of capital to our shareholders in the range of $1 billion, reflecting the strength of our cash flow and the confidence we have in the long term. In conclusion, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our financial outlook for the year. At Tractor Supply, our philosophy is to stay on offense and remain proactive. We're enthusiastic about the progress of our Life Out Here strategy, maintaining our industry leadership and expanding our legacy of generating long-term value for our shareholders. Now, I will turn the call-back over to Hal to wrap up.\nHal Lawton: Thank you, Kurt. I continue to believe that the structural backdrop remains very attractive for Tractor Supply. We participate in a large, attractive, fragmented, and growing market. We're a consistent share gainer and have numerous tailwinds, including our Life Out Here strategic initiatives, our market being a beneficiary of continued net rural migration, and high-return new-store growth opportunities. Short-term and long-term, Tractor Supply is extremely well-positioned as the leader in Life Out Here. As we look to close the always important fourth quarter, we have exciting plans in place to drive sales. We're in the midst of launching our first Hometown Heroes Days. Veterans and first responders over-index in our communities and Tractor Supply is uniquely positioned to celebrate those who keep us safe and make Life Out Here possible. The event starts on Saturday with a chain-wide event with our stores hosting their community to interact with fire trucks, K-9 units, and ambulances as well as food trucks and local farmer markets. Over the two weeks, we will be offering special promotions to our hometown heroes, including 10% off on First Responders Day and Veterans Day. Hometown Heroes Days is the perfect way to drive excitement for this program and for Neighbor's Club more broadly. This is a unique event, which will further support and strengthen this important customer segment's shopping affinity with Tractor Supply and is a great way for us to give back to them. We have an exceptional lineup of innovative and new products as well as enticing values and fresh offerings for the fourth quarter. In big-ticket, highlights include Massimo golf carts, Liberty Safes, Tractor Cam cameras, even Ember patio heaters, and Blackstone Grills. In our CUE business, we're expanding our cat food assortment, testing new items such as freeze-dried sacks, adding exclusive SKUs and Nutrena Triumph Equine Feed, and launching exclusive brand extensions such as 4health Shreds. In tools, we're offering notable deals across our tool shop event on brands such as DeWalt Porter Cable and it introduced new tailgating truck boxes just in time for the outdoor season. Our garden centers will be transformed to a winter wonderland with live Christmas trees, set is reeves and tractor eyes seasonal decor. And while the holiday merchandising is fun and brings great retail theater to our stores, what is most important in the fourth quarter to driving our business is the weather. And so to this year, as always, we'll be offering our customers all the things they need to weather the winter, including log splitters, snow throwers, chainsaws, and more. And if and when the winter comes, our customers know they can count on us for these critical supplies to get through the winter as well as products like propane and alternative heating sources. With strong inventory levels, we're committed to being the dependable supplier for Life Out Here. Our stores are well-stocked with the key products our customers depend on for their home and maintenance needs in the winter months. I hope you get a chance to get in our stores this season to see firsthand the great merchandising initiatives we have in place. As I mentioned earlier, please mark your calendar for our investment community today to be held on the afternoon of Thursday, December 5th. The team is excited to share our growth strategy for the back half of the decade. We're confident in our ability to navigate the challenges and seize the significant opportunities we see ahead. And with that, let's open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nZach Fadem: Hi, good morning. So now that about 25% of your stores have lawn and garden centers and roughly half of your stores are converted to Fusion. Curious if that historical mid-single-digit lift for the combination is still holding in this environment, which if it is, it would mean about 150 basis-points to the comp, if that's right. And then how should we think about the outlook for lawn and garden Fusion and any other store initiatives that you have planned for '25?\nHal Lawton: Hi, Zach, it's Hal Lawton and good morning, and thanks for joining us on the call. Yes, great milestone for us that we've reached with over 1,000 stores now in our Fusion format and 500 stores in our Garden Center format, over 500 stores. You think back to where we were in August of -- I mean, October of 2020 when we had zero of each. So come a long ways in a short amount of time. As we look forward, we feel good both about the pace that we're doing on our remodel program, which is between 175 and 225 stores a year. We've been consistently running at that pace the last couple of years. Of course, all new stores are built with the Fusion concept. And then between half and three-quarters of the stores just depending on a variety of factors are receiving the Garden Center a bit more on the new stores because we have a little more control of the setup, but the same on existing store remodels as well. And then, yes, we are continuing to be very pleased with the performance of Fusion. Those stores do continue to outpace the broader chain. Additionally, they continue to have higher customer scores on key areas of things like store environment, clean and uncluttered, those sorts of things. They also tend to have a higher female as well as a younger shopper base as well. So all the both quant and qual metrics that we've shared historically on Fusion continue to occur and we continue to be very pleased with the Garden Center business, while it's been a couple of years now of tougher spring/summer weather, we continue to have strong performance in live goods, as we talked about as well as all the other ancillary products that go around it. And then this year, we'll be using, as I talked about in our prepared remarks, the Fusion setup even to bring even a heightened and more well-done, fall execution as well as Winter Wonderland execution. So all in all, very good progress. And just to wrap it up. In my prepared remarks, I talked about the Farm and Ranch channel being negative in the kind of low to kind of mid-single digits, call it a minus 2%, minus 3%, maybe minus 4%. And you look at our overall growth of 1.6% and would point to many of our competitive advantages and strategic initiatives we have been implement -- that we've been investing in as the reasons for that share gain. And one of the important ones is Fusion as you -- as we just went through the numbers. So I think it's Fusion is doing well. It's a major contributor to our share gain and we're excited to continue the initiatives we turn into the back half of the decade.\nZach Fadem: Appreciate your time, Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Zach.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nChris Horvers: Thanks, and good morning. So I just want to talk about the weather and the storms. So can you talk about what the storms have done for your business so far and sort of what's embedded into the balance of the quarter? It seems like you're targeting about a roughly 2% comp in the fourth quarter. And then on the -- just on the margin front, you start to lap the transportation cost tailwinds as you talked about. Does the emergency response create some headwinds in gross margin that we should think about in the fourth quarter and does that DC headwind go away in SG&A? Thank you.\nKurt Barton: Oh. Hi, Chris, it's Kurt. In regards to I was taking notes on what I think there's about three points in there. There is the question on the storms. There's a question in regards to the margin on DC headwinds and or DC benefit and when does that turn in the emerging response. So let me just try to hit those things. In regards to the weather, I'll just mention Q3 first as I had mentioned some of that in prepared remarks. Leading up till about mid-September, just as an example, the business was running at a slight positive comp sales trend. And in the back two weeks, while we did see benefit like in emergency response from generators and others at the front-end of Hurricane Helene because that's one of those storms that really straddles both quarters. It was offset or more than offset by -- in that particular storm across most of the South and Southeast, just blanketed with storms. And so that dampened a bit of the overall traffic in the last week or two of September. As I mentioned, I see that more as a positive because that just defers some of the demand on the business. So both Helene and Milton have had net for the full year in Q4, a benefit to us. We'll have -- we have so many of the important weeks ahead of us. I won't quantify exactly what we expect from these storms, but generally, hurricanes have a modest level of benefit on each hurricane, and we anticipate that for Q4. Emergency response has a mixture of product, some of the bigger ticket generators lower, but has a mix of higher margins. So we do not anticipate the storm's emergency response really having an impact on margin in the fourth quarter. And yes, the distribution center been a headwind to SG&A in 2024 does start to cycle out as you get about 9 months to 12 months out. It really takes about that much time to be able to even out the inventory and be able to have the other distribution centers have a productivity offset to it. So we'll share more information on 2025 in regards to that in our January call.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nChuck Grom: Hi, good morning. Thanks very much, guys. In the past on your third quarter calls, you've provided some early framework for the out year in terms of store count, margin, puts and takes, et cetera. Is there anything we should be mindful of as we build out our models for next year? And then along those lines, you have a long-term comp algo of 4% to 5%. I'm sure you don't want to underline getting to that next year, but can we think about the puts and takes over the next 12 months to 18 months on the comp front? Thank you.\nHal Lawton: Hi, Chuck. Good morning. I think on the two things I'd say as it relates to looking out into next year and beyond. One, I think we've got a very clear recipe of how we're operating our business right now in terms of, this year we increased from 70 new stores to 80 new stores, and we've talked about how we're moving to 90 new stores next year. And that is the recipe that we're planning on. We have an exciting portfolio of high-return new-store opportunities out there. We've been challenged by many of our investors to go capture that value sooner. And we're kind of moving in that direction. We talked earlier about our consistent remodel approach somewhere between 175 and 220 stores a year. If you think about that it kind of the average of that at 200 with 2,300 stores roughly right now. That means about every 10 years, we're remodeling a store, which is I think, a nice healthy run rate for a retailer. And other than that, there's no real outliers on how we're thinking about the business as we turn into next year as it relates to our long-term comp algorithm. I'd point to the same commentary we had on the last call, which is we look to return to that as quickly as possible and the two major factors impacting our doing so is inflation, deflation, and consumer spending nominally between services and goods. If you look at deflation, inflation, Kurt had some comments on that earlier and we start to lap some of that around now, and we'll continue to lap that over the next 6 months to 9 months and then start to really be through that cycle. And if we all look at the low price for corn was really middle of this year and we would -- but we also had the big dip down that we took last year starting in October. And then on goods to services, the consumer continues to have to shift a number of a good bit of their spend into services right now. If you look at whether it's rent, insurance costs, those sorts of things, I mean, services continues to outpace the spend on goods, somewhere in the range of 6 to 7 points versus, say, 1 to 2 points on goods. And you can see that kind of correspondingly into retail sales. And as I talked about in the call, we think retail sales were slightly positive in the 1%-ish, 1.5% range for Q3, our fiscal Q3 and our sales were right in line, if not slightly above that at the 1.6% range. So that's kind of how we see the macro-environment shaping up right now and what we see as we turn the corner to 2025. Thanks, Chuck.\nChuck Grom: Great. Thanks, Hal.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Karen Short with Melius Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead\nKaren Short: Hi, thanks. Great to talk to you again and look forward to seeing you in December. So my question is, looking at 4Q when you look at the range of outcomes on sales and gross profit dollars and gross margins, it's pretty wide. So wondering if you could address that. And then also looking to -- so and commenting on more specifically puts and takes on 4Q on gross margins and SG&A. But then wanted to address more specifically the longer-term algo and when you think you can return to that? And I assume you'll address that at the Analyst Day, but any preliminary comments would be great.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hi, Karen. On the long-term algo, maybe hit that one first. I very much, as I've said just a moment ago, look-forward to getting back to our long-term algo. We don't see any internal issues in terms of returning to our long-term algo. Our market continues to be incredibly favorable in terms of just the overall optics of our market, the strength of our markets, attractiveness of our markets. Our position and competitive differentiation in the market is as strong as it's ever been. We think the combination of those two absolutely in normal operating kind of circumstances lead to our long-term algo. We're very confident in our ability to return to that long-term algo and the two main things that we're watching in the context of returning to that are, as I mentioned earlier, the goods to services split on overall consumer expenditures. And then two, how inflation, deflation plays out and then that plays into our average ticket. As we've talked about in the past, our recipe is really a 50% growth based on average ticket, 50% growth based on comp transactions. The goods to services shift is much more about a transactions type of headwind. And then the inflation, deflation, obviously being an average ticket headwind. We do see that both the pressure, the headwinds on both of those dissipating into 2025. I think the question is to what degree and over what period of time through '25. And we will share more of that, a little bit of that in our Investor Day. And then certainly, you'll hear our perspective on that in our Q4 earnings call. As it relates to the range of outcomes in sales in Q4, I'll address that and then Kurt can speak to some of the gross margin ins and outs. But on the range of sales, I'd start with in the month of October has played out much like what we expected with the one addition being the hurricanes that Kurt talked about previously, all right. Those will provide a modest benefit to Q4. As Kurt shared in the past, we've seen maybe 20, 30 basis points of benefit for a hurricane of those sizes. And I think something to that effect is what's in our guidance in Q4. The other major things that are going to play into Q4. One is going to be weather and it needs to get cold for our business to really perform well in Q4. We saw a lot of heating pellets. We saw a lot of heating fireplaces. We saw a lot of insulated outerwear and a lot of other products in our business that are cold-weather related. We've had about a week, week-and-a-half of cold-weather this quarter so far. When that hit, it was very good. It's now probably -- if everybody can think about where they're sitting right now, it's very warm right now. And so by consequence, people aren't buying heating and insulated out of ware. So we've had a bit of a mix in October, and that's typically what you can expect in October. As you look forward into the last two months, it really comes down to the continuation of cold weather, do we get it in November? Do we get it in December? Last year, we got cold weather in neither month. The second comes down to holiday shopping. We've got five less days this year. Historically, customers have been able to compress for the most part, but the question will be just how does the calendar play-out this year? And does that occur? Also with Christmas being on a Wednesday, you've got a unique setup where online is able to play much more strongly in on that final Super Weekend than it has in the past. And then, of course, you've got the federal election and we do expect that consumer spending leading up to the federal election will be dampened both just with distraction as well as a little bit of just wait-and-see mode. And so then you've got to see how does that pick back up. But at the end of the day, as I said on my prepared remarks, while the holiday sales are important of our business, the make or break for our business is the -- is how we support our customers with what their needs are, particularly during the cooler weather season. So that's what's most indicated -- will be most indicative of our sales in Q4. And I'll turn it over to Kurt for some comments on margin.\nKurt Barton: Yes, Karen, here's how we look at the gross margin and the SG&A in the fourth quarter. And I'd start by saying the all year, the business has been remarkably consistent. And so I'll refer to Q4 versus some of the highlights of Q3. We had 56 basis-points of benefit in Q3 as it was really the last quarter before we start to lap the significant benefit we started to see last year in fourth quarter on both transportation and our cost-saving and our cost-cutting initiatives. And so we'll have only a modest level of benefit remaining on transportation and cost in fourth quarter, that will for the most part likely be offset by product mix. So gross margin is relatively, give or take a bit more flattish year-over-year in Q4. And then on the SG&A side, the -- a lot of the puts and takes are similar other than in Q3, we were cycling 35 basis points benefit of a one-time depreciation. In Q4, we'll still have roughly 20 basis points, 25 basis points of pressure on the new distribution center. We anticipate a little bit more leverage on the comp sales as we anticipate positive comp sales for the fourth quarter. So you really see yourself moving in that in about a 50, 60, 65 basis points of pressure from SG&A in the fourth quarter as it's a -- it does not have as much of the one times as, say, Q3 does. So net, that does put operating margin in an unfavorable decline from year-over-year, but that's always been in our expectations for fourth quarter as we were lapping the strongest performance year-over-year.\nKaren Short: Thank you. Hopefully, you just bring women's wranglers to your stores.\nKurt Barton: We'll make a note of that.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. My question is how one of the key debates is can Tractor Supply get back to the historic levels of 1% to 2% growth in traffic. It seems like what you're suggesting is the ability to get back to that level of traffic growth on a consistent basis is going to be macro dependent where it will be influenced by the shift from services to goods. Yet, Tractor being a more needs-based retailer that has more consistent trends in areas like consumables CUE have held up relatively well. So what specifically do you see as influencing the assortment or category performance that will improve in a more robust economic environment, more robust retail environment to drive that traffic growth? And as you see a little bit less gross margin expansion because of some of the drivers from this year stayed, would you be willing to sacrifice some gross margin in order to drive the traffic growth? Thank you very much.\nHal Lawton: Hi, Michael, thanks for the question. First-off, I'd -- maybe I'll just step back, if I look at our growth over the last five years post-COVID, which I think is the second-highest in all of retail -- major retailers out there, the key to that has been strength in both average ticket and comp transactions. So it's not -- comp transaction growth has not only been a highlight of Tractor Supply for the last 30 years, 20 years, but also in the last five. And I would say of most retailers out there, we're one of the few that have been -- that have strong positive like double-digit positive comp transaction growth over a multi-five-year period. So I'd put our transaction growth over the last five years up against anyone. Second of all, I think if you look at retail right now, overall transaction growth in retail is either flat to negative in general right now. And so when you look at our modestly positive comp transactions, you combine that with overall transactions given our new-store growth and our comp transactions, I would argue we are in the top-quartile right now of retail in terms of overall transactions. So I look at --- I'm very pleased with how we've grown our transaction last five years, how we've held those transactions and even in the context of this environment that we're in, how we're modestly positive comping transactions and then with our new stores having strong couple of points of transaction growth. Then as I look forward, I think it really does all come down to the goods-to-services shift and then our customers having a little bit more money to spend on items in our stores. And that's going to make its way into that extra half of transaction a year to them and it's also going to make its way a little bit into the units per transaction. But I think what we're seeing on our comp transactions being muted a bit is very comparable to what's happening in all the rest of retail. And I certainly believe as retail moderates back to its normal levels, rising tides will lift all boats. And those of us that continue to have positive comp transactions will continue to see stronger positive comp transactions as that occurs. Anyway, I'll just -- I'll leave it at that. Thanks, Michael.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJulio Marquez: Good morning. This is Julio Marquez on for Steve. Hal, curious if you could expand on how the 37 million Neighbor's Club members informed the decision to acquire Allivet. Any -- I guess, how many Neighbor's Club use an online solution for the pet pharmacy needs? And any other color you can help contextualize the opportunity there would be great. Thank you.\nHal Lawton: Yes, thanks. We are really excited about the acquisition of Allivet. I think it's a great example of kind of a tuck-in acquisition. They've been a partner to us for a few years now as our pet Rx provider. What we've observed over those few years has been best-in-class in terms of both their nationwide prescription licensing capabilities, their distribution centers and their ability to get product shipped out in 24 hours, their ability to get prescriptions approved and partner with the veterinarians, their excellent website, their strong management team and importantly also excellent financial condition. So we feel all-around. It's a great business, one that we're excited and thrilled to welcome into the Tracker Supply family and we look forward to bringing that feature of a low cost affordable, wide array of prescriptions for pets and animals to our customers. As you said, we have 37 million-plus members of our Neighbor's Club program. It's a highly engaged membership program, one that we continue to add value in and our customers continue to further and further become loyal around. And we think the combination of Allivet with our Neighbor's Club is going to just be a great mix and we look forward to over the next few years, getting the deal done, approved, closed, and then starting to bring that to our Neighbor's Club members in the ways that we've brought the additional features and benefits that we have to them. Very excited about it and more to come at our Investment Community Day on that topic on December 5th.\nJulio Marquez: Great. And just a quick follow-up. Kurt, following two years of flattish comps, has there been any change to the building blocks behind that 10.10% to 10.6% long-term EBIT margin guidance, realizing productivity plays a role? But are there any margin factors there that are maybe structurally higher today than where you originally framed it?\nKurt Barton: No, really, there's not anything significant in our algorithm to attend 1 to a 10.6% and recognizing that we're going to continue to invest for the long term. The last two years, the comp sales puts pressure on our ability to leverage the SG&A and it's really been the difference. The team has just done a phenomenal job though, finding ways to offset that. And there are a number of cases on productivity in both our stores and our logistics distribution team that have just done a phenomenal job finding new opportunities for productivity. So the team has done well to be able to maintain that 10-plus operating margin in the last couple of years. So the algorithm is still intact. And Hal has mentioned all the different reasons of our expectations of being able to get back to the long-term algo and that just gives a better opportunity to avoid the pressures of SG&A. So I feel very confident with the long-term algo still at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nPeter Benedict: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Seth. Just around the big ticket strength, it certainly continues to be unique relative to most of retail. You talked about some innovation, I think some sharp pricing on these items. I'm just curious if you could expand on it. Any other factors helping here? I don't know the use of private credit has been playing a role. And how do you guys think about like replacement cycles for some of those bigger ticket categories? Is that potentially starting to tick in here? I'm just kind of curious if you expand on that a little bit. Thank you.\nSeth Estep: Yes. Hi, Peter. Thanks for the question. Just overall with big ticket, as we mentioned, we definitely are very pleased with the performance there as Q3 really was much in line with the strength of the performance as we exited Q2 and we really were able to maintain that. You know, the third quarter, it was our third consecutive quarter of big ticket growth and as you mentioned in some of the categories that we've had, whether it be like Zero-turns, Front Engine Eiders, Rec Vehicles, and a couple of other categories. I would point to a couple of things that have really differentiated us a little bit from the market, I believe. I would start with just the product lineup itself. I think the merchants have done a fantastic job of line structure in these categories where we are offering quality, high-value products across multiple brands, bringing innovation. We are working on differentiation with exclusive features and they're really built and tailored to our customer, right, and their customer needs with kind of the large animal or the large acre ownership across a lot of our customers. The next thing I would say is just some of the strategic inventory investments that Kurt mentioned earlier as well. When we exited Q2, we made sure we saw some of the strength here and we're looking at the weather patterns and we placed inventory in those -- in these categories to make sure that we can continue to maintain that as we went after it. And then the last thing I would just say is private-label credit card. Our private-label credit card momentum has been very strong, with that, our supplier base are partnering with us to continue to drive that. And when you just kind of combine those things together, whether it be the lineup itself, the value quality proposition, designing programs specific to the lifestyle of our customer, and then coupling that with things like our offerings, both with private-label credit cards and leveraging our Neighbors Club, it's really a combination of all those together that's really playing on it. Team is building 2025 right now either I think you'll see they'll continue to expand on those things and really excited about the lineup as we move into next year.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nPeter Keith: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the continued market share gains. I wanted to ask about technology. So Hal, you had referenced some greater data integrity and personalization with Neighbor's Club. I was wondering how you're leveraging technology and AI to provide those solutions and anything that we might think about going into next year that could perhaps provide some type of sales benefit.\nHal Lawton: Yes, good morning, Peter, and thanks for the question. I'd say we are infusing machine learning, data science, AI, really across the business both in our own analytics frameworks, also in leveraging our -- software providers capabilities, whether that's in things like Reflexis on inventory management or whether that's with our new CDP in terms of customer insights and personalization. And then I'm really proud that we're also building solutions internally to drive, as I've shared earlier, kind of better customer service in our stores. And whether that's through things like tractor vision, where we're upgrading our camera software and hardware technologies to be able to leverage our cameras to drive improved customer service through a variety of use cases, whether that's at the register on the apron in our garden centers or whether that's through our Hey GURA tool that we have that all of our team members are able to use to ask to get further knowledge inside of our stores when they're dealing with customers or when they just want to educate themselves. But we have a broad variety of things that we're using all really to drive improved customer service productivity with our team. Also in our distribution centers, we're doing that. We're using vision technology to be able to look at the packing of trucks, to look at left-offs of trucks to watch, to use it to manage the yard. So whether it's operationally in our DCs, whether it's for customer service in our stores or whether it's in our merchants or marketing use it for behind-the-scenes analytics and personalization. We're leveraging data science and machine learning and AI across the board. Thanks, Peter, for the question.\nPeter Keith: Thank you.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Operator, we'll have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you, Mary Winn. Our final question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. First, a quick clarification. I think it might have been on Chuck's question. Are you expecting this year's same-SKU deflation to flip to same-SKU inflation in '25? And then kind of related to that, are you able to quantify to any degree the pressure on your business from the decline in farm income that we've seen because of commodity deflation? Thanks.\nKurt Barton: Hi, Scott, this is Kurt. On deflation, for the first-nine months of the year, it's generally ran in-line with our plan and expectations. We have seen a bit of a additional step-down, modest on some of the commodities. I expect Q4 to have a similar but slightly less deflationary impact than Q3. But it really looks like today, if you're trying to peg when is there a point neutrality that that's been punted out anywhere from three to six months and you will have a much better view in January on what the expectation is on 2025. All indication is we are shifting out of a deflationary environment towards an inflationary one. The timing of when that conversion flips, we first thought it would be late 2024, early 2025, that could be Q1, Q2 of next year. And then in regards to your second question, remind me again that point?\nScot Ciccarelli: Yes, just farm income broadly has been under pressure because of commodity deflation and just trying to figure out, have you guys been able to quantify the impact on your bills? Thanks.\nKurt Barton: Yes. For years, we've looked at the farm income level in strong years and soft years. And it can have either an indirect slight halo or overhang on there and we really don't see much of a correlation to that. And as you know, I'll just point out our majority of our customers are not professional farmers. It's not their number-one source of income. And they if anything, we look sometimes at the overall market area and if there's an indirect benefit to that market area and how the non-farmers may spend. At this point, we're not really seeing anything that points to that in our business today.\nMary Winn Pilkington: All right. Well, that will get us to the top of the hour and wrap-up our Q&A for today. As always, we're available for any follow-up calls. Please be on the lookout for the invitation to our Investment Community Day in December that Hal referenced earlier and please reach-out if you need any further information. We look-forward to the event and thank you for your interest in Tractor Supply.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My sincere thanks and appreciation go out to my fellow 50,000 Tractor Supply team members. I know we all have been watching the devastation over the last few weeks that's been wrecked by Hurricane Helene and Milton with great concern and heartbreak. Hurricane Helene struck particularly close to the heart for me, given my roots in East Tennessee. Tractor Supply has taken a multitude of actions, big and small to take care of our team members, customers, and communities during this difficult time. I'd like to give a special thank you to all our team members who rallied to help the communities impacted by this storm season. We will continue to be there for our team members, customers from our communities in the days and months ahead for the recovery process. I would also like to thank our many vendor partners who are stepping up in the recovery effort. As it relates to a sales benefit from our response, we had no material benefit in Q3, but have seen an impact in Q4 and additionally have been somewhat encouraged by the recent change of seasons. This morning, we shared some exciting news that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Allivet, a leading online pet pharmacy. This is a company we know very well as they've been excellent partners to us in fulfilling our pet subscription business for the last couple of years. This is a great opportunity for us to bring another benefit to our 37 million Neighbor's Club members. Allivet offers a convenient and cost-effective way to get medications and specialty items for their pets and livestock. The addition of Allivet allows us to expand our total addressable market by about $15 billion. Allivet is a best-in-class platform with an excellent management team and a strong financial profile. This is a great example of a strategic tuck-in acquisition. We anticipate that Allivet will be accretive to earnings in 2025, and we look forward to welcoming the Allivet team to Tractor Supply. We are planning to host an Investment Community Day in New York City on the afternoon of Thursday, December 5th. At that time, we look forward to providing more details on our Life Out Here strategy for the second half of the decade, including our plans to leverage Allivet online and in stores. So now let's shift to the quarter. For the third quarter, the macro retail environment was in line with our expectations and our customer remained resilient. While the overall economy remained strong as evidenced by a 3% Q2 GDP, overall retail sales continued to moderately underperform. The primary driver of this underperformance is the continued shift of consumer spend to services. As a consequence, we estimate that retail sales growth was nearly flat in our third quarter. It is our estimate that the Farm & Ranch channel was modestly negative in the quarter and that we continue to be a share gainer. I would describe the sentiment of our customer as relatively stable as supported by the recent jobs report and the current unemployment rate of 4.1%. Consistent with prior quarters, our consumer continues to be judicious with their spending focused on innovation, newness, and needs-based products. Year-to-date through the third quarter, the macro retail environment is running in line with the subdued expectations that we had as we entered the year. Also, as expected, our team has managed our business exceptionally well. Correspondingly, our sales and profitability to continue to run in the range of our beginning guidance and have allowed us to consistently raise the lower end of our outlook. Let's turn to some highlights of our performance for the quarter. We grew net sales by 1.6% with comparable-store sales down a slight 0.2%. Diluted EPS was $2.24. Our comparable-store sales performance was driven by transaction growth of 0.3%, offset by average ticket decline of 0.5%. Emergency response, as mentioned earlier, had no material impact on Q3 comp sales. As we shared on our last call, we anticipated that the quarter would be in line with our full-year guidance. As we move through the quarter, many of the same trends from the first half of the year continued to play out. Notably, our customer engagement remains strong. The investments we've made in our Neighbor's Club, our world-class loyalty program are a competitive advantage for us as we continue to see solid growth in customer counts and retention. Our Neighbor's Club comp sales continue to outpace our overall sales growth. At the same time, we reached an all-time high on our sales penetration and a record membership of more than 37 million members. Our Neighbor's Club retention rate remains remarkably consistent as our best customers continue to shop us more frequently and remain extremely loyal. Our Hometown Heroes program has gained traction with our customers as our store team members have rallied around this unique benefit as an opportunity to engage with veterans and first responders in their local communities. Additionally, our new customer data platform has gone live for all stores and digital platforms, which will allow for greater data integrity, a 360-degree view of our customer, and deeper personalization. Overall, our Neighbor's Club offerings continue to drive meaningful wins with our members. At Tractor Supply, we continue to invest in customer service as we believe is it a differentiator for us. Our customers come to us for trusted advice. Our commitment to excellence and service and investments in training, tools, and technology are being recognized by our customers. Our scores continue to run at all-time highs with improvements year-over-year every month for 40 consecutive months. Turning to our category performance. Strong positive comps in big-ticket items continued for the third quarter, notably in Zero-turn, and Front Engine Riding lawnmowers as well as recreational vehicles. This year, our team did a tremendous job bringing newness and innovation with attractive pricing to these categories and our customers have responded positively to the new product lineup and our investment in inventory. As we experienced last quarter, we anticipated our consumable, usable, and edible products would run modestly below in the chain average in the third quarter as deflation weighed on our average unit retail. The needs-based demand-driven nature of our product categories continues to drive unit velocity in this segment of our business. Specifically in Pet Food, industry data suggests the category was slightly positive in Q3, consistent with trends through the first part of the year as the category disinflates and pet ownership trends remain soft. Our business in this category, while moderating from historical trends, continues to be a share winner in both households and dollars, although this is a small number math at this point. A couple of data points on share. Tractor supply was 2 times the category growth rate in Q3 and nearly 6 times that of the grocery channel. Again, pointing back that this is small number math relative to the previously higher-growth rates that this category has seen in the last few years. In the quarter, in the Pet business, we invested in in-stock inventory rates, maintain our emphasis on EDLP, leveraged our customer service to drive basket building, and focused our marketing on the newness and innovation we've added to our lineup. In our most recent all-store meeting, we invested in training for our nearly 45,000 store team members on selling techniques for pet food and driving treat attachments. We also had a very successful Pet Appreciation Days where we marketed newly introduced brands like ACANA and Real Mesa and our exclusive brands such as Retriever, 4health, and MuttNation by Miranda Lambert. In Equine, livestock, and poultry feed, we continue to gain market share. While average unit retails are down mid-to-high single-digits in these categories, we had unit or pound growth across all species. And as large animal counts continue to be pressured, we are certainly a shared winner with our strong unit performance. Much like the first half of the year, categories that performed below our comp sales growth were in our discretionary businesses such as clothing, footwear and outdoor living as well as in hardlines products such as ag fencing and pet kennels. Additionally, seasonal businesses such as heating, heating fuel, and insulated outerwear were negative. Our customer continues to respond to newness and innovation. A great example is the strong start to our Halloween Decor, which included a differentiated and expanded assortment such as the six-foot rooster skeleton that went viral. Another great example is in wildlife supplies, we're a destination for deer corn and have expanded this year into trail cameras and feeders. Our digital sales continue to outperform with double-digit growth. The team has made substantial improvements in search and checkout. We continue to accelerate our digital sales with platforms that set the standard for our customers and rival best-in-class retail experiences. We opened 16 new tractor supply stores in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to 54. Our new-store productivity continues to perform very well. Our pipeline for '25 and into '26 remains very robust with significant runway for low-risk, value-creating organic growth ahead of us. As we exited the third quarter, we've achieved some significant milestones in our Life Out Here strategy. We now have 45% of our chain in our Project Fusion layout and more than 550 garden centers. These are capital investments that provide a multi-year runway for growth and extend the terminal value of our stores. They help us to be more relevant to both our core and new customers, allowing us to garner a greater share of their spending and be the dependable supplier for their lifestyle. I commend the team on these investments and results given the scope and scale of these initiatives. It is hard to identify another retailer that has made this substantial investment in their store base in such a short period of time. We've also made major investments in our supply chain. Over the last four years, the team has added 2 million square feet to our DC capacity with the seamless opening of two new distribution centers. These new DCs have allowed us to service our existing store base while providing flexibility for future volume and new-store growth. The addition of 10 mixing centers, bringing our total to 16 has improved our service levels to our stores. A new import distribution center has also allowed for greater flexibility to flow our seasonal goods. As a result, we have had a 20% structural improvement in our STEM models and corresponding cost savings. Our DC productivity has also reached strong levels. In conclusion, the team is performing admirably short term and long term. True to truck supply style, we are efficiently managing the elements within our control and advancing our Life Out Here strategy. As we enter the fourth quarter, we are raising the low end of our guidance for the fiscal '24 sales and earnings to reflect our performance year-to-date and our outlook for the fourth quarter of the year. The fourth quarter has started out well as we benefited from emergency response sales for Hurricane Helene and Milton, both of which were fourth quarter events for us. This sales benefit is reflected in our guidance for the year. As we plan for the fourth quarter, we continue to anticipate that our customers remain prudent with their spending as is typical in an election year. We are capitalizing on our strengths and enhancing our competitive edge in the market with the support of our team members, their strong connections with our customers, and our successful strategic initiatives, we continue to outpace our competitors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kurt to provide more color on our performance and outlook. Thank you, Kurt. I continue to believe that the structural backdrop remains very attractive for Tractor Supply. We participate in a large, attractive, fragmented, and growing market. We're a consistent share gainer and have numerous tailwinds, including our Life Out Here strategic initiatives, our market being a beneficiary of continued net rural migration, and high-return new-store growth opportunities. Short-term and long-term, Tractor Supply is extremely well-positioned as the leader in Life Out Here. As we look to close the always important fourth quarter, we have exciting plans in place to drive sales. We're in the midst of launching our first Hometown Heroes Days. Veterans and first responders over-index in our communities and Tractor Supply is uniquely positioned to celebrate those who keep us safe and make Life Out Here possible. The event starts on Saturday with a chain-wide event with our stores hosting their community to interact with fire trucks, K-9 units, and ambulances as well as food trucks and local farmer markets. Over the two weeks, we will be offering special promotions to our hometown heroes, including 10% off on First Responders Day and Veterans Day. Hometown Heroes Days is the perfect way to drive excitement for this program and for Neighbor's Club more broadly. This is a unique event, which will further support and strengthen this important customer segment's shopping affinity with Tractor Supply and is a great way for us to give back to them. We have an exceptional lineup of innovative and new products as well as enticing values and fresh offerings for the fourth quarter. In big-ticket, highlights include Massimo golf carts, Liberty Safes, Tractor Cam cameras, even Ember patio heaters, and Blackstone Grills. In our CUE business, we're expanding our cat food assortment, testing new items such as freeze-dried sacks, adding exclusive SKUs and Nutrena Triumph Equine Feed, and launching exclusive brand extensions such as 4health Shreds. In tools, we're offering notable deals across our tool shop event on brands such as DeWalt Porter Cable and it introduced new tailgating truck boxes just in time for the outdoor season. Our garden centers will be transformed to a winter wonderland with live Christmas trees, set is reeves and tractor eyes seasonal decor. And while the holiday merchandising is fun and brings great retail theater to our stores, what is most important in the fourth quarter to driving our business is the weather. And so to this year, as always, we'll be offering our customers all the things they need to weather the winter, including log splitters, snow throwers, chainsaws, and more. And if and when the winter comes, our customers know they can count on us for these critical supplies to get through the winter as well as products like propane and alternative heating sources. With strong inventory levels, we're committed to being the dependable supplier for Life Out Here. Our stores are well-stocked with the key products our customers depend on for their home and maintenance needs in the winter months. I hope you get a chance to get in our stores this season to see firsthand the great merchandising initiatives we have in place. As I mentioned earlier, please mark your calendar for our investment community today to be held on the afternoon of Thursday, December 5th. The team is excited to share our growth strategy for the back half of the decade. We're confident in our ability to navigate the challenges and seize the significant opportunities we see ahead. And with that, let's open the call for questions. Hi, Zach, it's Hal Lawton and good morning, and thanks for joining us on the call. Yes, great milestone for us that we've reached with over 1,000 stores now in our Fusion format and 500 stores in our Garden Center format, over 500 stores. You think back to where we were in August of -- I mean, October of 2020 when we had zero of each. So come a long ways in a short amount of time. As we look forward, we feel good both about the pace that we're doing on our remodel program, which is between 175 and 225 stores a year. We've been consistently running at that pace the last couple of years. Of course, all new stores are built with the Fusion concept. And then between half and three-quarters of the stores just depending on a variety of factors are receiving the Garden Center a bit more on the new stores because we have a little more control of the setup, but the same on existing store remodels as well. And then, yes, we are continuing to be very pleased with the performance of Fusion. Those stores do continue to outpace the broader chain. Additionally, they continue to have higher customer scores on key areas of things like store environment, clean and uncluttered, those sorts of things. They also tend to have a higher female as well as a younger shopper base as well. So all the both quant and qual metrics that we've shared historically on Fusion continue to occur and we continue to be very pleased with the Garden Center business, while it's been a couple of years now of tougher spring/summer weather, we continue to have strong performance in live goods, as we talked about as well as all the other ancillary products that go around it. And then this year, we'll be using, as I talked about in our prepared remarks, the Fusion setup even to bring even a heightened and more well-done, fall execution as well as Winter Wonderland execution. So all in all, very good progress. And just to wrap it up. In my prepared remarks, I talked about the Farm and Ranch channel being negative in the kind of low to kind of mid-single digits, call it a minus 2%, minus 3%, maybe minus 4%. And you look at our overall growth of 1.6% and would point to many of our competitive advantages and strategic initiatives we have been implement -- that we've been investing in as the reasons for that share gain. And one of the important ones is Fusion as you -- as we just went through the numbers. So I think it's Fusion is doing well. It's a major contributor to our share gain and we're excited to continue the initiatives we turn into the back half of the decade. Thanks, Zach. Hi, Chuck. Good morning. I think on the two things I'd say as it relates to looking out into next year and beyond. One, I think we've got a very clear recipe of how we're operating our business right now in terms of, this year we increased from 70 new stores to 80 new stores, and we've talked about how we're moving to 90 new stores next year. And that is the recipe that we're planning on. We have an exciting portfolio of high-return new-store opportunities out there. We've been challenged by many of our investors to go capture that value sooner. And we're kind of moving in that direction. We talked earlier about our consistent remodel approach somewhere between 175 and 220 stores a year. If you think about that it kind of the average of that at 200 with 2,300 stores roughly right now. That means about every 10 years, we're remodeling a store, which is I think, a nice healthy run rate for a retailer. And other than that, there's no real outliers on how we're thinking about the business as we turn into next year as it relates to our long-term comp algorithm. I'd point to the same commentary we had on the last call, which is we look to return to that as quickly as possible and the two major factors impacting our doing so is inflation, deflation, and consumer spending nominally between services and goods. If you look at deflation, inflation, Kurt had some comments on that earlier and we start to lap some of that around now, and we'll continue to lap that over the next 6 months to 9 months and then start to really be through that cycle. And if we all look at the low price for corn was really middle of this year and we would -- but we also had the big dip down that we took last year starting in October. And then on goods to services, the consumer continues to have to shift a number of a good bit of their spend into services right now. If you look at whether it's rent, insurance costs, those sorts of things, I mean, services continues to outpace the spend on goods, somewhere in the range of 6 to 7 points versus, say, 1 to 2 points on goods. And you can see that kind of correspondingly into retail sales. And as I talked about in the call, we think retail sales were slightly positive in the 1%-ish, 1.5% range for Q3, our fiscal Q3 and our sales were right in line, if not slightly above that at the 1.6% range. So that's kind of how we see the macro-environment shaping up right now and what we see as we turn the corner to 2025. Thanks, Chuck. Yes. Hi, Karen. On the long-term algo, maybe hit that one first. I very much, as I've said just a moment ago, look-forward to getting back to our long-term algo. We don't see any internal issues in terms of returning to our long-term algo. Our market continues to be incredibly favorable in terms of just the overall optics of our market, the strength of our markets, attractiveness of our markets. Our position and competitive differentiation in the market is as strong as it's ever been. We think the combination of those two absolutely in normal operating kind of circumstances lead to our long-term algo. We're very confident in our ability to return to that long-term algo and the two main things that we're watching in the context of returning to that are, as I mentioned earlier, the goods to services split on overall consumer expenditures. And then two, how inflation, deflation plays out and then that plays into our average ticket. As we've talked about in the past, our recipe is really a 50% growth based on average ticket, 50% growth based on comp transactions. The goods to services shift is much more about a transactions type of headwind. And then the inflation, deflation, obviously being an average ticket headwind. We do see that both the pressure, the headwinds on both of those dissipating into 2025. I think the question is to what degree and over what period of time through '25. And we will share more of that, a little bit of that in our Investor Day. And then certainly, you'll hear our perspective on that in our Q4 earnings call. As it relates to the range of outcomes in sales in Q4, I'll address that and then Kurt can speak to some of the gross margin ins and outs. But on the range of sales, I'd start with in the month of October has played out much like what we expected with the one addition being the hurricanes that Kurt talked about previously, all right. Those will provide a modest benefit to Q4. As Kurt shared in the past, we've seen maybe 20, 30 basis points of benefit for a hurricane of those sizes. And I think something to that effect is what's in our guidance in Q4. The other major things that are going to play into Q4. One is going to be weather and it needs to get cold for our business to really perform well in Q4. We saw a lot of heating pellets. We saw a lot of heating fireplaces. We saw a lot of insulated outerwear and a lot of other products in our business that are cold-weather related. We've had about a week, week-and-a-half of cold-weather this quarter so far. When that hit, it was very good. It's now probably -- if everybody can think about where they're sitting right now, it's very warm right now. And so by consequence, people aren't buying heating and insulated out of ware. So we've had a bit of a mix in October, and that's typically what you can expect in October. As you look forward into the last two months, it really comes down to the continuation of cold weather, do we get it in November? Do we get it in December? Last year, we got cold weather in neither month. The second comes down to holiday shopping. We've got five less days this year. Historically, customers have been able to compress for the most part, but the question will be just how does the calendar play-out this year? And does that occur? Also with Christmas being on a Wednesday, you've got a unique setup where online is able to play much more strongly in on that final Super Weekend than it has in the past. And then, of course, you've got the federal election and we do expect that consumer spending leading up to the federal election will be dampened both just with distraction as well as a little bit of just wait-and-see mode. And so then you've got to see how does that pick back up. But at the end of the day, as I said on my prepared remarks, while the holiday sales are important of our business, the make or break for our business is the -- is how we support our customers with what their needs are, particularly during the cooler weather season. So that's what's most indicated -- will be most indicative of our sales in Q4. And I'll turn it over to Kurt for some comments on margin. Hi, Michael, thanks for the question. First-off, I'd -- maybe I'll just step back, if I look at our growth over the last five years post-COVID, which I think is the second-highest in all of retail -- major retailers out there, the key to that has been strength in both average ticket and comp transactions. So it's not -- comp transaction growth has not only been a highlight of Tractor Supply for the last 30 years, 20 years, but also in the last five. And I would say of most retailers out there, we're one of the few that have been -- that have strong positive like double-digit positive comp transaction growth over a multi-five-year period. So I'd put our transaction growth over the last five years up against anyone. Second of all, I think if you look at retail right now, overall transaction growth in retail is either flat to negative in general right now. And so when you look at our modestly positive comp transactions, you combine that with overall transactions given our new-store growth and our comp transactions, I would argue we are in the top-quartile right now of retail in terms of overall transactions. So I look at --- I'm very pleased with how we've grown our transaction last five years, how we've held those transactions and even in the context of this environment that we're in, how we're modestly positive comping transactions and then with our new stores having strong couple of points of transaction growth. Then as I look forward, I think it really does all come down to the goods-to-services shift and then our customers having a little bit more money to spend on items in our stores. And that's going to make its way into that extra half of transaction a year to them and it's also going to make its way a little bit into the units per transaction. But I think what we're seeing on our comp transactions being muted a bit is very comparable to what's happening in all the rest of retail. And I certainly believe as retail moderates back to its normal levels, rising tides will lift all boats. And those of us that continue to have positive comp transactions will continue to see stronger positive comp transactions as that occurs. Anyway, I'll just -- I'll leave it at that. Thanks, Michael. Yes, thanks. We are really excited about the acquisition of Allivet. I think it's a great example of kind of a tuck-in acquisition. They've been a partner to us for a few years now as our pet Rx provider. What we've observed over those few years has been best-in-class in terms of both their nationwide prescription licensing capabilities, their distribution centers and their ability to get product shipped out in 24 hours, their ability to get prescriptions approved and partner with the veterinarians, their excellent website, their strong management team and importantly also excellent financial condition. So we feel all-around. It's a great business, one that we're excited and thrilled to welcome into the Tracker Supply family and we look forward to bringing that feature of a low cost affordable, wide array of prescriptions for pets and animals to our customers. As you said, we have 37 million-plus members of our Neighbor's Club program. It's a highly engaged membership program, one that we continue to add value in and our customers continue to further and further become loyal around. And we think the combination of Allivet with our Neighbor's Club is going to just be a great mix and we look forward to over the next few years, getting the deal done, approved, closed, and then starting to bring that to our Neighbor's Club members in the ways that we've brought the additional features and benefits that we have to them. Very excited about it and more to come at our Investment Community Day on that topic on December 5th. Yes, good morning, Peter, and thanks for the question. I'd say we are infusing machine learning, data science, AI, really across the business both in our own analytics frameworks, also in leveraging our -- software providers capabilities, whether that's in things like Reflexis on inventory management or whether that's with our new CDP in terms of customer insights and personalization. And then I'm really proud that we're also building solutions internally to drive, as I've shared earlier, kind of better customer service in our stores. And whether that's through things like tractor vision, where we're upgrading our camera software and hardware technologies to be able to leverage our cameras to drive improved customer service through a variety of use cases, whether that's at the register on the apron in our garden centers or whether that's through our Hey GURA tool that we have that all of our team members are able to use to ask to get further knowledge inside of our stores when they're dealing with customers or when they just want to educate themselves. But we have a broad variety of things that we're using all really to drive improved customer service productivity with our team. Also in our distribution centers, we're doing that. We're using vision technology to be able to look at the packing of trucks, to look at left-offs of trucks to watch, to use it to manage the yard. So whether it's operationally in our DCs, whether it's for customer service in our stores or whether it's in our merchants or marketing use it for behind-the-scenes analytics and personalization. We're leveraging data science and machine learning and AI across the board. Thanks, Peter, for the question."

            "name": "Seth Estep",
            "content": "Yes. Hi, Peter. Thanks for the question. Just overall with big ticket, as we mentioned, we definitely are very pleased with the performance there as Q3 really was much in line with the strength of the performance as we exited Q2 and we really were able to maintain that. You know, the third quarter, it was our third consecutive quarter of big ticket growth and as you mentioned in some of the categories that we've had, whether it be like Zero-turns, Front Engine Eiders, Rec Vehicles, and a couple of other categories. I would point to a couple of things that have really differentiated us a little bit from the market, I believe. I would start with just the product lineup itself. I think the merchants have done a fantastic job of line structure in these categories where we are offering quality, high-value products across multiple brands, bringing innovation. We are working on differentiation with exclusive features and they're really built and tailored to our customer, right, and their customer needs with kind of the large animal or the large acre ownership across a lot of our customers. The next thing I would say is just some of the strategic inventory investments that Kurt mentioned earlier as well. When we exited Q2, we made sure we saw some of the strength here and we're looking at the weather patterns and we placed inventory in those -- in these categories to make sure that we can continue to maintain that as we went after it. And then the last thing I would just say is private-label credit card. Our private-label credit card momentum has been very strong, with that, our supplier base are partnering with us to continue to drive that. And when you just kind of combine those things together, whether it be the lineup itself, the value quality proposition, designing programs specific to the lifestyle of our customer, and then coupling that with things like our offerings, both with private-label credit cards and leveraging our Neighbors Club, it's really a combination of all those together that's really playing on it. Team is building 2025 right now either I think you'll see they'll continue to expand on those things and really excited about the lineup as we move into next year."

            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal, and good morning to everyone on the call. As Hal mentioned, our third quarter top-line results were consistent with our expectations and in line with the results in the first half of the year. We saw continued strength in big ticket sales, while our discretionary categories remained pressured. Our seasonal category performance, exclusive of big ticket, was in line with chain average at a modest decline to prior year. Similar to the first half of the year, we saw strong performance in seasonal categories such as live goods, mulches and soils, grilling, and wildlife supplies. This was offset by softness in ag fencing, heating, outdoor living, and lawn and garden tools. As we expected, our C.U.E. performance was slightly below the chain average given the retail price deflation and moderating pet category trends the industry is experiencing. Retail price deflation, which was approximately 1% was in line with our expectations. The vast majority of this deflation came from our C.U.E. categories. As Hal mentioned, we are pleased with our unit movement in C.U.E. as we successfully managed through the impact of deflation this quarter and are now starting to lap the beginning of this deflationary cycle from last year. Our comp sales growth was relatively consistent across all regions of the chain within a range of down 2% to up modestly. The strongest regional performance was in Texhoma due to inventory investments made in big ticket, easier compares, and better overall weather compared to last year. This strength was offset by pressure in the Far West, Midwest, and Commonwealth as the summer heat lingered and a lack of the change of season to fall in these areas. As to the cadence of the quarter, all months were also in a relatively tight band of essentially plus or minus 1%. Weather was generally a net neutral factor in the third quarter comparable sales results. Extreme heat persisted throughout the quarter in certain regions with no shift to cooler weather in the northern regions. Hurricane Helene and other storms in the last two weeks of the quarter did not produce net incremental sales to Q3 as any pre-hurricane demand was more than offset by softer volume in the South as a result of heavy rains and continued intense heat in the Far West and Midwest regions. We do believe this created a timing shift that has benefited early Q4 sales. Moving down to our income statement. Our gross margin increased 56 basis points compared to last year. We continue to be very pleased with these results, which were driven primarily by ongoing lower transportation costs along with disciplined product cost management and the continued execution of an Everyday Low Price strategy. These improvements were partially offset by the mix impact from strong growth in big ticket categories, which have below-chain average margins. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 119 basis points to 27.8%. This increase was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included the onboarding of a new distribution center and higher depreciation and amortization, as well as modest deleverage of our fixed costs given the decline in comparable-store sales. The new DC was approximately a 25 basis point headwind on SG&A for the quarter. We were also lapping a one-time depreciation expense benefit in the prior year of approximately 35 basis points or $11 million. These factors were partially offset by strong productivity and cost control and to a lesser extent, a slight benefit from our ongoing sale-leaseback transactions. For the quarter, operating profit margin was 9.4%. Diluted EPS was $2.24 compared to $2.33 last year, which included a $0.08 benefit from the depreciation change I mentioned earlier. Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $3.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, representing an increase of 4.3% in average inventory per store. Last quarter, we shared that we had strategically invested in inventory as we look to improve our in-stock position in queue and support the strength in our big-ticket sales. We effectively controlled our inventory as we reduced our average inventory growth per store by more than 50% sequentially from the second quarter. Our inventory levels and in-stock rates are in excellent shape as we enter the fourth quarter. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2 times. Our announced acquisition of Allivet fits perfectly with our tuck-in M&A strategy and is highly complementary to our business. Given that we have significant financial flexibility, this acquisition will be financed by our balance sheet. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $760 million of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Looking ahead, we are updating our fiscal 2024 guidance to raise the lower end of the range on both the top line and earnings. We now anticipate net sales to be in the range of $14.85 billion to $15 billion. We expect comparable-store sales to be between flat-to-up 1%. We are forecasting an operating margin rate of 9.8% to 10.1%. Our net income is expected to be between $1.09 billion to $1.12 billion, and we anticipate diluted earnings per share of $10.10 to $10.40 compared to our prior guidance of $10 to $10.40. As I see it today, our outlook for the remainder of the year is appropriately described as right down the middle of the fairway. At this time, we believe that our EPS will more likely be at the midpoint of the range, allowing for a breadth of possibilities that remains quite varied for Q4. As Hal mentioned, the fourth quarter is off to a solid start with the most significant sales weeks of the quarter still ahead of us. We continue to see the quarter having a wider range of potential outcomes on comp sales given the easier compares while acknowledging that we could see more volatility in consumer spending. On the high end of our outlook range, in addition to the easing compares, factors we considered include a more normalized start to winter, lapping net deflation, which began in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the emergency response activity from the recent hurricanes. On the low end of the range, dynamics we contemplated include moderation in big-ticket trends, potential consumer uncertainty due to the federal election, and a shorter holiday selling season with five less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Our outlook on gross margin, SG&A, and operating margin remain consistent with past commentary. In the fourth quarter, we'll be lapping our most difficult gross margin comparison with 129 basis points of expansion in the prior year, where we began to see the benefits from lower transportation costs and our product cost management initiative. As to SG&A, we anticipate better performance than in the third quarter given our comp sales outlook. We continue to forecast the return of capital to our shareholders in the range of $1 billion, reflecting the strength of our cash flow and the confidence we have in the long term. In conclusion, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our financial outlook for the year. At Tractor Supply, our philosophy is to stay on offense and remain proactive. We're enthusiastic about the progress of our Life Out Here strategy, maintaining our industry leadership and expanding our legacy of generating long-term value for our shareholders. Now, I will turn the call-back over to Hal to wrap up. Oh. Hi, Chris, it's Kurt. In regards to I was taking notes on what I think there's about three points in there. There is the question on the storms. There's a question in regards to the margin on DC headwinds and or DC benefit and when does that turn in the emerging response. So let me just try to hit those things. In regards to the weather, I'll just mention Q3 first as I had mentioned some of that in prepared remarks. Leading up till about mid-September, just as an example, the business was running at a slight positive comp sales trend. And in the back two weeks, while we did see benefit like in emergency response from generators and others at the front-end of Hurricane Helene because that's one of those storms that really straddles both quarters. It was offset or more than offset by -- in that particular storm across most of the South and Southeast, just blanketed with storms. And so that dampened a bit of the overall traffic in the last week or two of September. As I mentioned, I see that more as a positive because that just defers some of the demand on the business. So both Helene and Milton have had net for the full year in Q4, a benefit to us. We'll have -- we have so many of the important weeks ahead of us. I won't quantify exactly what we expect from these storms, but generally, hurricanes have a modest level of benefit on each hurricane, and we anticipate that for Q4. Emergency response has a mixture of product, some of the bigger ticket generators lower, but has a mix of higher margins. So we do not anticipate the storm's emergency response really having an impact on margin in the fourth quarter. And yes, the distribution center been a headwind to SG&A in 2024 does start to cycle out as you get about 9 months to 12 months out. It really takes about that much time to be able to even out the inventory and be able to have the other distribution centers have a productivity offset to it. So we'll share more information on 2025 in regards to that in our January call. Yes, Karen, here's how we look at the gross margin and the SG&A in the fourth quarter. And I'd start by saying the all year, the business has been remarkably consistent. And so I'll refer to Q4 versus some of the highlights of Q3. We had 56 basis-points of benefit in Q3 as it was really the last quarter before we start to lap the significant benefit we started to see last year in fourth quarter on both transportation and our cost-saving and our cost-cutting initiatives. And so we'll have only a modest level of benefit remaining on transportation and cost in fourth quarter, that will for the most part likely be offset by product mix. So gross margin is relatively, give or take a bit more flattish year-over-year in Q4. And then on the SG&A side, the -- a lot of the puts and takes are similar other than in Q3, we were cycling 35 basis points benefit of a one-time depreciation. In Q4, we'll still have roughly 20 basis points, 25 basis points of pressure on the new distribution center. We anticipate a little bit more leverage on the comp sales as we anticipate positive comp sales for the fourth quarter. So you really see yourself moving in that in about a 50, 60, 65 basis points of pressure from SG&A in the fourth quarter as it's a -- it does not have as much of the one times as, say, Q3 does. So net, that does put operating margin in an unfavorable decline from year-over-year, but that's always been in our expectations for fourth quarter as we were lapping the strongest performance year-over-year. We'll make a note of that. No, really, there's not anything significant in our algorithm to attend 1 to a 10.6% and recognizing that we're going to continue to invest for the long term. The last two years, the comp sales puts pressure on our ability to leverage the SG&A and it's really been the difference. The team has just done a phenomenal job though, finding ways to offset that. And there are a number of cases on productivity in both our stores and our logistics distribution team that have just done a phenomenal job finding new opportunities for productivity. So the team has done well to be able to maintain that 10-plus operating margin in the last couple of years. So the algorithm is still intact. And Hal has mentioned all the different reasons of our expectations of being able to get back to the long-term algo and that just gives a better opportunity to avoid the pressures of SG&A. So I feel very confident with the long-term algo still at this point. Hi, Scott, this is Kurt. On deflation, for the first-nine months of the year, it's generally ran in-line with our plan and expectations. We have seen a bit of a additional step-down, modest on some of the commodities. I expect Q4 to have a similar but slightly less deflationary impact than Q3. But it really looks like today, if you're trying to peg when is there a point neutrality that that's been punted out anywhere from three to six months and you will have a much better view in January on what the expectation is on 2025. All indication is we are shifting out of a deflationary environment towards an inflationary one. The timing of when that conversion flips, we first thought it would be late 2024, early 2025, that could be Q1, Q2 of next year. And then in regards to your second question, remind me again that point? Yes. For years, we've looked at the farm income level in strong years and soft years. And it can have either an indirect slight halo or overhang on there and we really don't see much of a correlation to that. And as you know, I'll just point out our majority of our customers are not professional farmers. It's not their number-one source of income. And they if anything, we look sometimes at the overall market area and if there's an indirect benefit to that market area and how the non-farmers may spend. At this point, we're not really seeing anything that points to that in our business today."

Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Hal.\nHal Lawton: Thank you, Mary Winn and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As always, I'd like to begin by expressing my thanks and appreciation to my fellow 50,000 plus Tractor Supply team members for their commitment to each other and our customers, and for their dedication to serving Life Out Here. And this quarter, I'd like to give a special shout out to our technology team, who did a tremendous job recovering our business from the CrowdStrike outage without a material impact. So let's start with the operating environment for our business before I discuss our second quarter results. Overall, the macroeconomic indicators that we all follow continue to be rather mixed for the consumer in the second quarter. While in-line with our expectations at the beginning of the year, I would characterize the health of the consumer as modestly more cautious than last quarter, but certainly still within the range of our forecast at the beginning of the year. Consumer spending on goods appears to be fatigue across income cohorts. While we've seen improvements in the consumer inflation rate, unemployment has ticked upwards to the highest rate since late 2021. Additionally, consumer sentiment and consumer confidence are both subdued and the consumer spending landscape continues to be rather choppy. Additionally, in the recent personal consumption expenditures report, we saw another soft month for goods. While in-line with our expectations, the ongoing shift in spending from goods to services continues to be a headwind for our business. The mix of goods as a share of PCE is still about 90 basis-points above the pre-COVID average. As it relates to retail sales for the second quarter, U.S. retail was flat to modestly positive with growth in non-durable categories, which was in-line with our performance as a company. And in the farm and ranch channel, we estimate that, that channel experienced mid-single-digit declines, which is indicative of our continued share gains in the channel. With that said, our business for the first half of 2024 has performed right down the middle of our guidance. For instance, half of the months of the year have had positive comp sales and our year-to-date comp sales are up about 0.2%. And overall, our profitability is also right in-line with our expectations and the team has continued to manage our business exceptionally well. As we look at our business in half and reflect back on the spring season, as we always talk about, weather can certainly shift sales between quarters. And given this year, the early Easter and then a couple of weeks of warm weather that we had there in late March, we estimate a potential pull-forward of $15 million to $20 million in sales from the first quarter -- from the second quarter into the first quarter. And so if you think about this kind of balances out our performance across the two quarters. And additionally, we thought we'd have some potential for an elongated spring, particularly in late June, but that did not materialize. On the customer front, of note, we did see our higher income customers moderate just modestly, as spending for vacation travel has surged for this group. And conversely though, our lower income customer cohort moderated up sequentially from the first quarter. And net-net, our overall customer base though continues to grow and be very strong. Now let's shift to some performance highlights for the quarter. We grew net sales by 1.5% with a comparable-store sales decline of 0.5%. Diluted EPS was $3.93. Our comparable-store sales performance was driven by a modest transaction decline of 0.6% with our average ticket coming in at 0.1% positive. As we shared on our last call, we anticipated that the quarter would be in-line with our full year guidance. As we moved through the quarter, many of the same trends from the first quarter continued to play-out. Importantly, we continue to see healthy customer engagement. The investments we've made in Neighbor's Club our world-class loyalty program, are a competitive advantage for us as we continue to see solid growth in both customer counts and customer retention. If you recall, in the first quarter, we significantly enhanced our Neighbor's Club offerings. The changes were implemented with the goal to have members receive rewards faster and lower the spending required for tier qualifications. This quarter, as part of our ongoing and continued improvements in the program, we launched Hometown Heroes, which recognizes military service members, veterans and first responders. And this program brings together under one banner our long standing support for the selfless men and women who serve America. A highlight of the program is that our Hometown Heroes received the highest level status and benefits of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. And while still very early, we're pleased with the enrollment. Of note, about 20% of our Hometown Heroes to-date are new to Neighbor's Club and about 15% are new to Tractor Supply. Once again, our Neighbor's Club comp sales outpaced our overall sales growth. At the same time, we also reached an all-time high on our sales penetration and record membership of more than 36 million members, and that means we've added nearly 5 million members over the last 12 months. And our Neighbor's Club retention rate remains remarkably consistent as our best customers continue to shop us more frequently and remain extremely loyal. At the same time, though, we are seeing a slight disengagement of our non-core customers, is down just modestly. We believe this is attributable to the overall macro headwinds that I mentioned in my opening remarks. And given that this customer is not as highly engaged in the kind of Life Out Here lifestyle, our belief is that this customer cohort is a little sluggish or fatigued given the duration of inflation and higher cost of living since 2022, and just being judicious in their spend. And as we look forward, though, our Neighbor's Club is laser focused on this opportunity as we improve our personalization capabilities, particularly with our customer data platform that we'll be implementing later in the year. Our customer service scores continue to run at all-time highs, with improvements every week for more than 2.5 years. Customer service is a consistent differentiator for Tractor Supply, and our commitment to excellence in customer service and investments we've made in training, tools and technology are really paying off with our customer. And these efforts have also though received national recognition by various third-parties, including USA Today and Forbes. Also, it's worth noting that the team received a CIO 100 Award recently for our groundbreaking work to utilize AI to enhance the customer experience in our stores. Just a great job by everyone around on our customer service. Moving to category performance, a highlight was the strong positive comps in big ticket items in the second quarter, notably in categories like riding lawnmowers, recreational vehicles and sporting goods. And the commonality in these categories is strong innovation in newness and our customers really responded to this. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with our live goods performance, which comps well above the chain average despite the hot weather that impacted many of our other seasonal categories. As we shared last quarter, we anticipated our consumable, usable and edible product would run modestly below the chain average in the second quarter as deflation weighed on our average unit retail. We once again grew units in these categories and we believe we're continuing to gain market share. The needs-based demand-driven nature of our product categories -- these product categories continues to drive unit velocity in this segment of our business. Clicking down into our CUE categories. In pet food, recent industry data suggests that the overall category was flat to negative in Q2. As it relates to our business, we continue to take share, but we have seen growth continue to moderate as the category disinflates and pet ownership trends remain soft. Our customer shopping trip in this category is highly differentiated. We offer a broad assortment from value to super premium across national and exclusive brands in a pet-friendly environment, which now includes more than 900 pet wash locations. Through the second quarter, we've had strong double-digit growth in our pet wash service. Additionally, the value of our mobile pet vet clinics is another great gateway for pet customers to find Tractor Supply. Year-to-date, we also have seen mid double-digit growth rates in visits to our clinics, offered across more than 1,600 stores. The two of these in combination with the rest of our services and product benefits creates a great opportunity to reinforce our value proposition. Additionally, pet ownerships benefit from the one-stop-shop convenience of our lifestyle retail format, in particular from the cross purchasing synergy with animal feeds. As we've mentioned, the vast majority of our customers have both an animal and a pet. In aqua livestock and poultry feed, we continue to gain market share. While our average unit retails were down mid-to-high single-digits in this category in Q2, conversely, we had strong mid-single-digit unit growth across all species. As large animal counts continue to pressure, we are certainly a share winner in the large animal categories with our strong unit growth. And in poultry, our annual Spring Chick Days was another positive highlight in the quarter. The event builds on our reputation as the destination for backyard enthusiasts. From economy to organic feed as well as our assortment of premium breeds, our lineup continues to resonate with our customers. Much like the first quarter, categories that performed below our comp sales were in our discretionary businesses, such as clothing, footwear and decor and also in the hardlines products of the business, such as things like ag, fencing and pet kennels. Our digital sales continued to trend from last quarter of double-digit growth. We've accelerated our digital capabilities and that's fueling engagement of our customers and also improving our conversion rate. Our 10th and largest distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas opened during the second quarter. The startup of the distribution center was right on-schedule and shifting began last month. It's a great job by the team. Once again, we are capitalizing on the opportunity to realign with store servicing areas across the DC network to balance transportation costs and DC capacity, while improving service levels to our store. Our supply chain investments over the last four years have provided us with a structural gross margin benefit from the reduction in spend miles. Our garden centers had strong performance during the important second quarter. We now have more than 500 garden centers across the chain. The merchants did a great job with a differentiated assortment and strong in-stocks on top of the planting season. With more variety and live goods as well as adjacent categories catering to outdoor living, we saw the customer respond positively to this multi-year growth driver. We opened 21 new Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense by Tractor Supply's in the quarter. Our new store productivity continues to perform very well. In the year since announcing our expanded real estate capabilities allowing for own development, we continue to anticipate material benefits to both revenue growth and operating margin rate. Our team has built-out capabilities to allow us to scale this initiative. We now have nearly 50% of our pipeline in own development with our first locations already open. This development allows us to have rent reductions of 15% or more compared to our traditional build-to-suit. And we continue to believe that we have a robust pipeline of low-risk organic growth opportunities ahead of us. To wrap-up, I believe the team is pleased but not satisfied with our first half performance. We set high expectations for ourselves. Customer trends are relatively in-line with our expectations. The team is executing well. In typical Tractor Supply fashion, we are effectively managing the factors that we can control and making progress on our Life Out Here strategy. As we plan for the second half of the year, we anticipate that our customers remain prudent with their spending as-is typical in an election year. At the halfway point of the year, we are narrowing our guidance for fiscal 2024 to reflect our performance year-to-date and our outlook for the second half of the year. We continue to create more separation between us and our competition, thanks to our team members and the meaningful relationships they have with our customers in combination with our strategic initiatives. Our dedication to serving Life Out Here remains unwavering. We will always strive to do the right thing. And now I'll turn the call over to Kurt.\nKurt Barton: Thank you, Hal, and good morning to everyone on the call. In many ways, our second quarter topline results were consistent with our results in the first quarter, with solid seasonal growth and exceptional big ticket sales, while our year around discretionary categories remain pressured. As we expected, CUE performance was slightly below the chain average given the retail price deflation and moderating pet category trends the industry is experiencing. Retail price deflation, which was just over 1% was in line with our expectations. The vast majority of this deflation came from our CUE categories. As Hal mentioned, we are pleased with our unit movement in CUE as we successfully managed through the impact of deflation this quarter. Our comp sales growth was relatively consistent across all regions of the chain within a range of down 2% to up 2%. The strongest regional performance was in the Northeast and Commonwealth due to easier compares and better overall weather compared to last year. This strength was offset by pressure in the Far West and Texas, Oklahoma for the exact opposite reasons, as they had tougher compares and less than ideal weather conditions this quarter. As to the cadence of the quarter, all months were also in a relatively tight band of essentially plus or minus 1%. As Hal mentioned, we believe April was negatively impacted by the pull forward of Easter into the first quarter as well as a slow start to the spring season. Moving down our income statement, our gross margin increased 43 basis points to last year. We continue to be very pleased with these results, which were driven primarily by ongoing lower transportation costs along with disciplined product cost management and the continued execution of an everyday low price strategy. These improvements were partially offset by the mix impact from strong growth in big ticket categories, which have below chain average margins. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 58 basis points to 23.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included the onboarding of a new distribution center and higher depreciation amortization, as well as modest deleverage of our fixed costs given the decline in comparable store sales. These factors were partially offset by productivity improvements and strong cost-control. During the quarter, our ongoing sale leaseback strategy benefited SG&A by approximately $5 million net of transaction and repair costs from the sale of two Tractor Supply locations. This transaction and the related benefit represent timing shift out of the third quarter and into Q2. For the quarter, operating profit margin was 13.2%. We had strong cost control as evidenced by our underlying operating profit margin that was essentially flat with prior year. Diluted EPS was $3.93 compared to $3.83 last year. Turning now to our balance sheet, merchandise inventories were $3.0 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing an increase of 10.2% in average inventory per store as we improved our in-stock position in CUE and invested in big-ticket given its strength. Our in-stocks are up nearly four points to our best level since before the pandemic. We are pleased with the quality of our inventory as we enter the second half of the year. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around two times. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $500 million of capital to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends. Now let me turn to our updated fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Given our performance in the first half of the year and our forecast for the balance of the year, we believe it's now appropriate to narrow our guidance range. For the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $14.8 billion to $15 billion with comp store sales in the range of down 0.5 point to up 1%. Our operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 9.8% to 10.1% with net income of $1.08 billion to $1.12 billion. Diluted EPS is forecast to be $10 to $10.40. As to the calendarization between the third and fourth quarter, let me share with you a bit more of how we are thinking about the various scenarios. We are approaching the back half with balanced optimism. We are forecasting comp sales in the third quarter to be within a tight band of scenarios and generally similar to the first half of the year. The shift of the season doesn't occur until late in the third quarter and we don't begin to lap the deflationary effect of feed until the fourth quarter. The only meaningful swing factor-in Q3 tends to be weather, particularly large storms, which produce emergency response activity. We see the fourth quarter having a wider range of potential outcomes. For our base case, we do anticipate stronger growth in the fourth quarter given the easier compares, while acknowledging that we could see more volatility in consumer spending. On the high end of our outlook range, in addition to the easing compares, factors we considered include a more normalized start to winter, lapping net deflation, which began in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the potential for greater emergency response activity. Now on the low end of the range, dynamics we contemplated include moderation in big ticket trends, potential consumer uncertainty due to the Federal election and a shorter holiday selling season with five less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. As for the retail price, our plans continue to reflect a headwind from deflation in the third quarter with a moderation towards neutral in the fourth quarter as we start to lap the lower cost, which began in late Q3 of last year. Our guidance reflects ongoing gross margin expansion in the second half of the year. The third quarter is expected to have our best gross margin expansion as we anticipate transportation costs will remain favorable. In the fourth quarter, we'll be lapping our most difficult comparison with 129 basis-points of expansion in the prior year, where we began to see the benefits from lower transportation costs and our product cost management initiative. As a result, we are forecasting our fourth quarter gross margin rate consistent with the prior year. I view our gross margin performance as strong in this current environment. Moving on to SG&A, for the second half of the year, there are a couple of items I would highlight for our expectations, especially for the third quarter. First, please keep in mind that we are lapping last year's depreciation benefit of 35 basis points or $0.08 per share in the third quarter. Second, given our comp sales outlook specific to the third quarter, we anticipate modest fixed cost deleverage. And third, we will continue to see pressure from the startup cost of the new distribution center in both the third quarter and fourth quarter. Thus our SG&A performance will be the softest in the third quarter with more modest deleverage in the fourth quarter. In total, we remain on track for the benefits of our sale leasebacks to be relatively consistent with last year's, albeit with a slight variation by quarter due to the timing shift of two stores into the second quarter. We continue to forecast the return of capital to shareholders in the range of $1 billion, reflecting the strength of our cash flow and the confidence we have in the long term. At Tractor Supply, we believe in playing offense. This is a team that will stay on offense and continue to invest for the long term. We are excited about our Life Out Here strategy progress, our leadership position in the industry and our ability to build-on our track record of long term value creation for our shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Hal to wrap up.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Kurt. Despite the temporary softness in our channel, structural elements remain very attractive for Tractor Supply. We have numerous tailwinds, including our Life Out Here strategic initiative, our market being a beneficiary of continued net world migration, high return new store growth opportunities and ongoing share gains. Tractor Supply is extremely well positioned as a leader in a large fragmented market. Before we go into Q&A session, I'd like to wrap-up with three comments. One, as we head into the back half of the year, I am very excited about our robust innovation pipeline, the compelling values we have in our market and our new brand launches. We just set our annual Deer event and Halloween Decor program and both are off to a strong start. In Pet, we have a number of upcoming activities, including our expanded Pet Appreciation Month, a new lineup for MuttNation by Miranda Lambert and an expansion of 4health, our exclusive brand premium dog food. Additionally, we have an exciting new endcap program as well as new center court and dry wall events that are focused on compelling value that are core to our lifestyle. The second comment I'd have is we continue to believe that as and when economic conditions become more neutral for us that we will return to our long term algorithm. As mentioned, there's really two economic conditions that are impacting us the most. The first is the transition from goods to services in the context of PCE spend and the second is deflation. We believe both of these are transitory. We don't need them to improve, but rather just to normalize for us to return to our long term algorithm. And the third comment is that the team is playing offence. And we're not only executing our existing initiative, but working -- we're working on plans for the back-half of the decade and working on our next growth drivers of our Life Out Here strategy. Tractor Supply does not lack for opportunities and we believe we have multiple new opportunities that can expand on our $180 billion total addressable market. I'm very excited to share more details of the next drivers of our strategy in the near future. Our stores and online are ready for the changes of season as we enter the third quarter. Tractor Supply is well prepared to meet the needs and expectations of our customer. We've invested in our store base, in inventory, in our supply chain, in our digital capabilities and customer service to ensure that we can deliver on on-promise of providing the best products and solutions for Life Out Here. We've also enhanced our Neighbor's Club to provide more benefits and rewards to our loyal customers. We're excited about the upcoming events and promotions that will showcase our unique and differentiated seasonal assortment of merchandise, and we expect to see continued improvements across our categories. To conclude, I'm incredibly proud of our team. Throughout our 85-plus year history, no matter what issue we face, our team members have always come together. We have a unique and special culture. It's our special soft and key differentiator, and it's what gives me great confidence in the future of Tractor Supply. And with that, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. Your line is now open.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, guys, Scot Ciccarelli. Historically, when we've had a pretty wet spring, which I think is pretty fair to assume across most of the country, you guys have had a very extended selling season. So do you expect that to be the case for the balance of the year? And then secondly, you mentioned that you're expecting roughly flat, let's call it, comps in the third quarter. Are you currently tracking in line with that or is that just kind of the bogey for the end-of-the quarter? Thanks.\nHal Lawton: Hi, Scot, good morning. To your first question on the wet spring, it was a -- in the normally west spring, particularly in the South -- in the Southwest, Texas, in particular was wet almost the entire quarter. We had hoped that might lead to an elongated spring, particularly in the month of June and into July, it actually be favorable for us given comparison to last year. That's not how it played out. As we all know, the month of June was one of the hottest, if not the hottest month on record ever. And so we went from pretty much a wet -- wet spring to an immediately hot summer. And we did not see, as we called out ag fencing as an example, that's a big category, for us in general and in particularly in Texas. And as an example, we did not see that category recover in June like we had some aspirations for. That said, it's a wet week this week and we are hopeful that, that can pay some dividends as we turn the corner into August and into the fall. And as it relates to Q3, yes, it's basically kind of right down the middle of fairway for us in terms of our guidance range and kind of consistent with the comments Kurt gave at this point. And the one thing I would call out is July is our toughest compares of the three months. It's -- we get sequentially -- sequentially easier and compares to the tune of like a point or two points each of the next two months. So anyway, thanks, Scott, for the question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is now open.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question.\nHal Lawton: Hi, Michael.\nMichael Lasser: Number one - Hi, Hal. Hi, can you walk us through the thought process on just the changes you've made recently. Do you see any customer impact from some of the social media chatter and how did it impact your same store sales? Thank you so much.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Hi, Michael, and thanks for the question. I'd start out by saying, obviously, it was a difficult situation that played out in a public arena, that's unfortunately is becoming increasingly common in business and the divisive sentiment that we have in our country. And we've got over 50,000 team members and 30-plus million customers and we certainly heard a range of feedback. We learned from others who had gone before us on this and moved fast to try to remove the perceived political and social agendas from our policies. And all that said, we have no evidence that it had a measurable impact on our business. And we continue to look to monitor the situation and look at a variety of datasets, but we do have no evidence at this point that it's had a measurable impact on our business and our results. And if I just step-back, we have a very special culture at Tractor Supply. It's firmly grounded in our well-established mission and values. And while we did withdraw our carbon emissions goals and retired our D&I goals, we did not retire our commitment to treating people fairly with respect, to inclusion, to being a good corporate citizen and certainly not to be stewards of -- and certainly did not retire -- are committed to being stewards of Life Out Here. And Tractor Supply, again, credible culture. We never lose sight of our obligations to be great stewards of our business over the long term. Thanks. Thanks, Michael, for the question.\nMichael Lasser: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nSteven Zaccone: Great. Good morning. Thanks, -- great. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the same-store sales trend. And I was curious if we could talk through the guidance adjustment a bit more. I guess, specifically on the second half because you leave open the option that you could still have negative same-store sales in the back half, even though the compares look a little bit easier. So has anything really changed from a ticket perspective, maybe deflation lasting a little bit longer than you expected? And then from a transaction perspective, do you have the view that the pet food landscape is just softening a little bit more than you expected? So maybe that side of the business is also coming a little bit weaker? Thanks very much.\nHal Lawton: Yes, Hi, Steven. Let's start out by saying the first half played out very much in-line kind of right down the middle of our kind of base-case center point of our guidance. I would say most things in the first half were very much in-line with our expectations. I mean, maybe big ticket was a little stronger, and maybe some of the things like ag fencing and dog containment and such were a little bit weaker. But everything else, I would say, animal feed, pet food, our CUE products in general, seasonal. Even the discretionary business, we expected them to be reasonably negative. All those played out very much in line with what we expected. I kind of think about it as a down the middle of fairway based on our expectations first half. As it relates to the second half, we have a similar thesis to the second half right down the middle of fairway. I think Kurt tried to call that out in the prepared remarks. Q3, I think would be much of the continuation of the first half of the year with Q4 being really where there's a higher rate -- a broader range of outcomes. I think Kurt tried to really bring that to life in his prepared remarks to say there's one version of Q4 that could be -- could be strong and start that trend back towards our long term algorithm and there's a some favorable compares there and -- which create a nice setup and we've got a number of activities also going into that -- into the market during that time. On the flip side, there is a kind of a kind of more unfavorable potential outcome in Q4, where if we didn't see some good winter weather and the federal election created a lot of distraction and you've got a shorter holiday season that could lead to a lesser performance in Q4. So really tried to lay out the range of those two, and that's really what drives the Q4 variation, is really what drives the -- really the range of our comp guidance for the balance of the year with a pretty tight range of outcome forecast in Q3. But I would say from the start of the year, the business is really right in the middle of what we expected it could be. And to your kind of kind of question at the end, there's really sitting at this point in time, nothing that we see in the back half that's much different than what we saw at the beginning of the year. It's a pretty, pretty straightforward at this point in terms of our outlook.\nSteven Zaccone: Okay. Thanks for the detail.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is now open.\nPeter Benedict: Yes, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Kurt, I know you addressed inventory briefly during the prepared remarks that you felt comfortable. Can you maybe give us a little more color on the build that you saw in the second quarter and maybe where you would have us expecting inventories to kind of level out over the balance of the year, and why you don't think there's -- you don't have too much? Thank you.\nKurt Barton: Yes, I'll actually let Seth -- Peter give you more of the details on that, and I'll make one reference. We are cycling last year. In Q2, we called out that we were down 1.7% in inventory last year. We knew we needed and wanted more inventory in CUE and even some of the big ticket rec. And so we're very pleased with where we're at. And I think, Seth, why don't you explain further some of where the--\nSeth Estep: Yes.\nKurt Barton: --increase is at and the position on inventory for today and even the back half.\nSeth Estep: Hi, Peter, Seth. Thanks, Kurt. Yes, as Kurt mentioned, we were down last year about 1.7%. When we think about this year's inventory position, we have purposely invested in where we're continuing to see growth. So when you look right now, we're continuing to invest in areas like grills, mini bikes, rec vehicles, even like riders where we're continuing to see some strong momentum in various parts across our store base. But we're also in the best in-stock position we've been since pre-pandemic. We're investing in in-stocks. We're up around 400 basis points in in-stocks when you compare to where we are this year versus last. And when you look at our clearance inventory, while we don't give specific numbers, our clearance and aged inventory is actually down versus last year. And I would say both those in-stock positions and you look at our clearance and aged inventory, are both really good indicators of the quality that we have. And I would just say as we look ahead to the back-half, we're committed to making sure we're investing in the categories that are working. We're investing in being a dependable supplier and making sure that we have our key core CUE products on shelf. And I feel really good about the innovation pipeline we're investing and being in a position to drive sales. So quality of inventory remains strong. We're in a great in-stock position and feel good about the inventory position.\nPeter Benedict: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. Your line is now open.\nChuck Grom: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks a lot. Hope you guys are well. Just get back to the comp discussion, how -- the past few quarters, comps have been running close to flat. You've got a long term guide of about 4% to 5%. Clearly, the macro has not been your friend, but can you help us think about the building blocks to get back to that level and maybe a potential timeline you see to get there as well? Thank you.\nHal Lawton: Yes, hi, Chuck, and thanks for the question. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we still feel very confident in our long term guidance and there's really two main factors that we see as -- that are macro factors that are impacting us right now for performing at that long term guidance rate, namely the shift in consumer spend from goods to services and the second being deflation, inflation. And so now if you hit both of those, if you think about our average ticket for the first half of the year, which is roughly flat, historically, we would have at a minimum kind of a 1.5%-ish maybe average ticket growth, could be 2%, 2.5%. So even if we just had some favorability in average ticket, all of a sudden, that walks you up to nearly a 1.5 or 2 point comp right there. And then if you think about PCE, year-to-date, services are up 6%, 7%, whereas goods are up 1%. If you were to see that normalize, even if goods underperformed services, say, goods are 2.5% or 3% and maybe services are 3%, 3.5%, you get that extra point to 2 points on the goods kind of rising tide, and all of a sudden, you're walking back to a 4%, 4.5% comp right there. And so we really do see it as cleanly as that, is that at some -- kind of in the future, it certainly have confidence that deflation will moderate and we'll get back to a consistent kind of inflation rate in this country and in our business. And then similarly, expect that the good services shift will moderate. I mean, I think that's probably the bigger question. We probably have a better lens as to when the deflation will moderate, because we see that in our business. But on the goods and services, I think that's kind of the open question. It is only 90 basis points away from its pre-COVID levels. So it doesn't have a significantly further to go. But is that six months, is that nine months? Is that three months? I think time will tell there. Thanks, Chuck, for the question.\nChuck Grom: Great. Thanks, Hal.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nKate McShane: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We wanted to talk about the big ticket strength. We know this is something that you saw in the first quarter. Can you remind us how much of sales this represents? And how does big ticket needs change in the second half? What falls into that category for the cooler and winter months versus what you saw in the first half of the year?\nKurt Barton: Yes. Hi, Kate, good morning. This is Kurt. On big-ticket, I'll share a few specifics on that. As we mentioned, we've been continually pleased this year to see the rebound on big ticket after a couple of years of softness in big ticket. First quarter ran positive high-single-digit big ticket and the ever important Q2 ran a low double-digit growth rate in big ticket. So if -- you hear the commentary from us on our investment in that area of the business, how we're driving the sales through innovation. So very pleased with the results on big ticket. Q2 tends to have the largest portion of our sales on big ticket in the low teens. It averages in the high single-digit as a percentage of our sales for the year. So in the second half of the year, it does become a lesser of an impact. But on a year-over-year basis, we really do see that there's opportunity in the back half of the year in areas that we're winning in that, Seth just mentioned, whether it be recreational vehicles or even riders. And then in the back fourth quarter, really some of the winter-related heating, log splitters, those type, snow blowers, we can continue to win in innovation and our ability to drive great value in big ticket. So it's certainly one of the tailwinds for us. The team has done an excellent job bringing new product to our customers and driving value even through areas like deferred financing as a great value for big ticket. So while not as much of a swing factor in the second half, we do believe that's one of the tailwinds on our comps for the second half of the year.\nKate McShane: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nBrian Nagel: Good morning. Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my question, I just want to follow-up a bit on inventory. And I know you discussed this already, but just to be clear, so inventories gets us on face value where you did see coming out of the quarter higher than usual. So is it your expectation then that, over the next, whatever, couple of quarters, your inventory levels will moderate kind of naturally or is there some type of more aggressive action you have to take to get inventories back in line with sales?\nHal Lawton: Hi, Brian. I'll start by saying, we are very comfortable with our inventory levels right now and the quality of our inventory. And we don't see any actions required on the quality of our inventory as we move forward. Just to be very clear on that. There's two main drivers of our inventory increases, really three main drivers of our inventory increases year-over-year. The first I would call out, as Kurt did, which was easier -- the kind of net -- the lapping of comparison last year. We were down, I think, negative 1.7% on inventory last year. The second is our investment in big ticket. Obviously, those are higher average unit retail items. So that's going to disproportionately drive our inventory dollars up. But we saw the strength in riders, in UTVs, in things like grills and other big ticket categories, we invested into that. And we'll continue to do that into Q3 as well. As an example, we typically have about 800 stores that are kind of go long stores and riders that have an extended season. This year, we've increased that to 1,150 stores. We are seeing the strength in big ticket continue into Q3. So that is a -- that investment is -- is paying-off and we expect it to continue to. The third thing I would call out is just a reiteration of what Kurt and Seth said, which is our investment in in-stock rates. We are 4 points higher year-over-year in in-stock rates. It's our highest in-stock rate since the pandemic. And that is really on the shelves inside of our stores. And as you all know, I spent a lot of time in our stores, been in five different markets in the last five weeks. We have never looked healthier and better since my time at the company in areas like dog treats, in areas like leashes, in hardware, in hand tools, in areas like lubricants and batteries. As Seth called out, our clearance levels are lower than last year at this time and in incredibly good shape. As you all know, our clearance levels have been running at historic lows since the pandemic and continue to do so. The team is doing an excellent job navigating inventory. So anyway, to step back, we feel incredibly good about the quality of our inventory, have no concerns about it in the second half and in fact, feel great about the investments we've made, which are driving in-stock rates and kind of a bit of a go longer strategy in big ticket. Thanks, Brian, for the question.\nBrian Nagel: No, thanks, I appreciate all the color.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open.\nSteven Forbes: Good morning. How -- it's probably imperfect, but it looks like it's been about a year now where sales per member trends are down significantly. So curious if there's anything notable in terms of learning from the trends within the customer cohorts as we think about explaining away the spread between comp trends or CUE trends versus member trends? And maybe in that -- in that regard, as you think about potential, like how would you speak to the opportunity ahead given where the member base and the member share sits today?\nHal Lawton: Yes, so maybe I'll talk a little bit about our Neighbor's Club in that -- in that context. First off, I would say we continue to be very pleased, and in fact, it's kind of performing better than what we would expect to gain here in terms of number of members signing-up for Neighbor's Club, as I called out, now at 36 million. The second thing I'd call out is we continue to see retention rates of our Neighbor's Club remain at kind of historic rates. So as you're growing your member base and you're growing retention, I mean, that's a kind of a strong kind of balance there, right, and add -- and multiple -- increasingly added it together. I'd say what we saw was on are higher income cohorts that are our strength, stronger retention, modest moderation by I mostly in kind of the -- as we -- and when we looked at it, a lot of it, we really do core that they are the ones that over indexed on services and on travel and on vacations here in the second quarter. But again, modest moderation there. The group that we continue to focus on, and we called this out last quarter as well is that entry cohort into our Neighbor's Club and we lowered the tier threshold and we increased the type of rewards you could redeem at the last -- in -- in our last quarter and saw nice improvement there. We're continuing to focus on that through the second quarter. As we look towards the back half, we're very excited about the implementation of our customer data platform, how that's going to further accelerate our ability to personalize with customers and our communications and help continue to stimulate all groups, but in particular that kind of entry level group. In addition, we launched this quarter our Hometown Heroes program. It's off to an excellent start in terms of member sign-up. And as we called out, while I don't expect these trends to continue, the early sign-ups have been a significant piece of it is new to Tractor Supply and new to our Neighbor's Club program. So we have -- I think it's one of the best membership programs, loyalty programs -- loyalty programs, excuse me, in the market out there. The team continues to iterate and make it better and better. Our customers continue to give us very favorable marks on it. And we do see Neighbor's Club as instrumental to our success as we move forward.\nSteven Forbes: Thank you.\nHal Lawton: Thanks, Steven.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nOliver Wintermantel: Yes, thanks guys. With the variability of the outcomes in the range for the third quarter and the fourth quarter, maybe it would be helpful if you could walk us through comp ticket and comp traffic expectations for those two quarters. And maybe on the ticket side, maybe you can't break it out in AUR or inflation? Thank you.\nHal Lawton: Hi, Oliver, how are you today? Thanks for the question. I would -- the main driver of the variation for the second half in the range of outcomes for our comp is really what the driver of our range for the first-half was, is transactions. As we've been, I think pretty transparent, we have great insight to average ticket, great insight into our average unit retail. Pending some mix we know exactly what our pricing for our seasonal products are already going to be for the year. We know what our CUE trends are. We obviously have a perspective on how we're going to be pricing CUE into the back half of the year. So we have very good forward-looking view as to our average unit retail. And so I feel like there's probably less variability in ticket and expect that to be reasonably flat throughout the year, although there's some modestly easier compares on average unit retail as you get into the fourth quarter. So a little bit of upside there. But the main driver of our range of outcomes is going to be transactions. And particularly in the fourth quarter and really we think it's all around consumer sentiment and also drivers of need. And if there's some weather events, that will drive need. And depending on the federal election and the shortened holiday season, I think that will drive sentiment. Those two things will come together to drive our transactions. And so anyway, back to your point, I think the variability for the back half of the year is really primarily transactions with maybe a very modest range of outcomes on AUR.\nOliver Wintermantel: Got it. Thanks very much. Good luck.\nHal Lawton: Yes. Thanks, Oliver.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nZachary Fadem: Hi, good morning. Kurt, you mentioned the election as a potential second half headwind. So first, are there performance callouts during prior elections? And then second, is there any evidence to suggest that your business may perform differently based on the outcome of the election?\nKurt Barton: Yes. Hi, Zach. In regards to elections, in my history, as we've -- as we've looked at that and we have been through cycles, there is no real meaningful performance change based on the year of a federal election or the outcome of a federal election. Now we have seen, and I think it's well-understood that this is a very intense environment today with this election. What that does to the consumer sentiment is certainly one that we are being conscious of. And I think the election will take a lot of attention and could impact the consumer spending habits, et cetera. But really, over the years, how we've seen the performance of the consumer has really proven to have no strong indication that we should plan for or change our outlook in any particular way. It's just viewed as one that could be a variable in the ranges of outcome. And so we're conscious of that. But we've been able to pivot in either one of these environments. And the one last thing I would just point to is that for us, which I think is different is that it doesn't tend to have much of a change because it's a needs-based business where regardless of the outcome, the lifestyle and the needs that we serve, don't really change that much. So we watch and we're creating strategies under scenarios, but we don't see a specific outcome that we are planning for.\nZachary Fadem: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Horvers: Thank you. I'm French now. So Mike, my question is on the commodity side. So corn has come down a lot since the start of the year and even where it was at the end of the first quarter. Historically, you've talked about corn being one of the biggest commodities to watch. So I guess to what extent have you thought about that in terms of affecting your sequential reflation expectations? And does that quickly turn into the sort of the feed category? And then on the pet food side, are you seeing price investment from the big pet food brands? And what are the early reads on that being enough to turn those -- the pet food category, enough elasticity to get that growing more quickly?\nKurt Barton: Sure. Hi, Chris, this is Kurt. And I'll take the first part of the question on the commodities and then I'll let Seth address your question on pet food. On commodities, just some key points that I think is helpful to reference. Corn, which is the largest commodity impact item. But additionally, when you think of corn, soybean, cotton, steel, they all are commodities that play into our pricing. They have all been at year-to-date or year-over-year in the low teens deflationary point compared to June of 2023. All of them are generally back to 2019 levels. And they are 30% or nearly 40% off of their '22 -- 2022 year highs. So we've been going through a two year cycle of that. And all indications are we are at the 2019 levels. We're at what we believe is the trough. Most of these costs have already been embedded into it. The only other variability that -- and I indicated to that is, you would look at Q4 and see that to be a neutral or potentially even beginning to see an inflationary turn and the way commodities shift, will I think will really derive whether or not Q4 even the Q1 is a shift into some slight inflation or keeps us at a plateau. The corns and soybeans tend to move within about a 60 to 90 day timeframe through our systems. And so they move pretty quickly and impact the cost of goods sold in a really timely basis. I'll turn it over to Seth on the follow-up question on pet food.\nSeth Estep: Yes, hi, Chris, Seth. Hi, just as the simplest answer, I would just say when you look at the back-half, we're not seeing any signaling that you're going to see like AUR compression when it comes to pet food, when we look out. Right now, AURs continue to be somewhat flat year-over-year and that's kind of what we see going forward. Relative both feed and pet food, I would say, like as you think about the current environment we're in, and if you continue to see commodities stay where they are, you'll start to see things like you've traditionally seen in the industry where more value packs, more bonus packs, things of that nature will continue to hit the market. So at this point, we see pet food pricing remaining basically stable.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks very much.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Victoria we will take one more question quickly, and then we'll wrap the call after that.\nOperator: Of course. Our final question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nPeter Keith: Thank you very much everyone for squeezing me in. So Hal you mentioned in the script that the channel was down negative mid-single. I guess I would agree with that based on our survey work. So it does suggest that Tractor Supply share gains accelerated in Q2 versus prior quarters. And I'm wondering, was there something specific to the quarter or do you think there's more kind of structural benefits based on your initiatives that could keep the share gains elevated in the quarters to come? Thanks.\nHal Lawton: Yes, hi, Peter. Thanks for the question. I'd really point to -- to two things. One, I think structurally, we play a little bit more in big-ticket than a lot of the other farm and ranch competitors on the margins, but I think that helped raise our waterline a little bit on total sales. Also I would say, on the CUE business, in particular on the feed side, well, the CUE business in general, particularly dog food and animal feed, we're gaining share in both. Our share gains in animal Feed, in our view in Q2 were outsized. And I think a lot of that comes down to our scale, our cost position, both with working with our vendors and our partners there, but also our supply chain and whether it's our DCs, our mixing centers, our freight partners and just us having the best cost position in the market, being able to invest that appropriately in price. As you know, we have over 20 price zones. We're able to get really targeted in where we want to price and how we need to price to drive those units. So I think those would be the things I'd speak to. And then the final point would be, of course, our strategic initiatives. And I think as it relates to say like the fusion remodel program, we're approaching half of our store base now being in the fusion remodel program. So I think our store environments relative to the farm and ranch channel are significantly higher-level of a store environment now. Our commitment to customer service, we called that out. So you get, I think a better level of customer service in our stores. And so just all those sorts of things are starting to add up to continue to drive the outsized share gains. Thanks Peter, for the question.\nPeter Keith: Thank you.\nMary Winn Pilkington: Victoria, we'll wrap-up our call today. To everyone on the call, we look forward to speaking to you at the time of our Q3 call in October.\nOperator: That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Hal Lawton",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As always, I'd like to begin by expressing my thanks and appreciation to my fellow 50,000 plus Tractor Supply team members for their commitment to each other and our customers, and for their dedication to serving Life Out Here. And this quarter, I'd like to give a special shout out to our technology team, who did a tremendous job recovering our business from the CrowdStrike outage without a material impact. So let's start with the operating environment for our business before I discuss our second quarter results. Overall, the macroeconomic indicators that we all follow continue to be rather mixed for the consumer in the second quarter. While in-line with our expectations at the beginning of the year, I would characterize the health of the consumer as modestly more cautious than last quarter, but certainly still within the range of our forecast at the beginning of the year. Consumer spending on goods appears to be fatigue across income cohorts. While we've seen improvements in the consumer inflation rate, unemployment has ticked upwards to the highest rate since late 2021. Additionally, consumer sentiment and consumer confidence are both subdued and the consumer spending landscape continues to be rather choppy. Additionally, in the recent personal consumption expenditures report, we saw another soft month for goods. While in-line with our expectations, the ongoing shift in spending from goods to services continues to be a headwind for our business. The mix of goods as a share of PCE is still about 90 basis-points above the pre-COVID average. As it relates to retail sales for the second quarter, U.S. retail was flat to modestly positive with growth in non-durable categories, which was in-line with our performance as a company. And in the farm and ranch channel, we estimate that, that channel experienced mid-single-digit declines, which is indicative of our continued share gains in the channel. With that said, our business for the first half of 2024 has performed right down the middle of our guidance. For instance, half of the months of the year have had positive comp sales and our year-to-date comp sales are up about 0.2%. And overall, our profitability is also right in-line with our expectations and the team has continued to manage our business exceptionally well. As we look at our business in half and reflect back on the spring season, as we always talk about, weather can certainly shift sales between quarters. And given this year, the early Easter and then a couple of weeks of warm weather that we had there in late March, we estimate a potential pull-forward of $15 million to $20 million in sales from the first quarter -- from the second quarter into the first quarter. And so if you think about this kind of balances out our performance across the two quarters. And additionally, we thought we'd have some potential for an elongated spring, particularly in late June, but that did not materialize. On the customer front, of note, we did see our higher income customers moderate just modestly, as spending for vacation travel has surged for this group. And conversely though, our lower income customer cohort moderated up sequentially from the first quarter. And net-net, our overall customer base though continues to grow and be very strong. Now let's shift to some performance highlights for the quarter. We grew net sales by 1.5% with a comparable-store sales decline of 0.5%. Diluted EPS was $3.93. Our comparable-store sales performance was driven by a modest transaction decline of 0.6% with our average ticket coming in at 0.1% positive. As we shared on our last call, we anticipated that the quarter would be in-line with our full year guidance. As we moved through the quarter, many of the same trends from the first quarter continued to play-out. Importantly, we continue to see healthy customer engagement. The investments we've made in Neighbor's Club our world-class loyalty program, are a competitive advantage for us as we continue to see solid growth in both customer counts and customer retention. If you recall, in the first quarter, we significantly enhanced our Neighbor's Club offerings. The changes were implemented with the goal to have members receive rewards faster and lower the spending required for tier qualifications. This quarter, as part of our ongoing and continued improvements in the program, we launched Hometown Heroes, which recognizes military service members, veterans and first responders. And this program brings together under one banner our long standing support for the selfless men and women who serve America. A highlight of the program is that our Hometown Heroes received the highest level status and benefits of our Neighbor's Club loyalty program. And while still very early, we're pleased with the enrollment. Of note, about 20% of our Hometown Heroes to-date are new to Neighbor's Club and about 15% are new to Tractor Supply. Once again, our Neighbor's Club comp sales outpaced our overall sales growth. At the same time, we also reached an all-time high on our sales penetration and record membership of more than 36 million members, and that means we've added nearly 5 million members over the last 12 months. And our Neighbor's Club retention rate remains remarkably consistent as our best customers continue to shop us more frequently and remain extremely loyal. At the same time, though, we are seeing a slight disengagement of our non-core customers, is down just modestly. We believe this is attributable to the overall macro headwinds that I mentioned in my opening remarks. And given that this customer is not as highly engaged in the kind of Life Out Here lifestyle, our belief is that this customer cohort is a little sluggish or fatigued given the duration of inflation and higher cost of living since 2022, and just being judicious in their spend. And as we look forward, though, our Neighbor's Club is laser focused on this opportunity as we improve our personalization capabilities, particularly with our customer data platform that we'll be implementing later in the year. Our customer service scores continue to run at all-time highs, with improvements every week for more than 2.5 years. Customer service is a consistent differentiator for Tractor Supply, and our commitment to excellence in customer service and investments we've made in training, tools and technology are really paying off with our customer. And these efforts have also though received national recognition by various third-parties, including USA Today and Forbes. Also, it's worth noting that the team received a CIO 100 Award recently for our groundbreaking work to utilize AI to enhance the customer experience in our stores. Just a great job by everyone around on our customer service. Moving to category performance, a highlight was the strong positive comps in big ticket items in the second quarter, notably in categories like riding lawnmowers, recreational vehicles and sporting goods. And the commonality in these categories is strong innovation in newness and our customers really responded to this. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with our live goods performance, which comps well above the chain average despite the hot weather that impacted many of our other seasonal categories. As we shared last quarter, we anticipated our consumable, usable and edible product would run modestly below the chain average in the second quarter as deflation weighed on our average unit retail. We once again grew units in these categories and we believe we're continuing to gain market share. The needs-based demand-driven nature of our product categories -- these product categories continues to drive unit velocity in this segment of our business. Clicking down into our CUE categories. In pet food, recent industry data suggests that the overall category was flat to negative in Q2. As it relates to our business, we continue to take share, but we have seen growth continue to moderate as the category disinflates and pet ownership trends remain soft. Our customer shopping trip in this category is highly differentiated. We offer a broad assortment from value to super premium across national and exclusive brands in a pet-friendly environment, which now includes more than 900 pet wash locations. Through the second quarter, we've had strong double-digit growth in our pet wash service. Additionally, the value of our mobile pet vet clinics is another great gateway for pet customers to find Tractor Supply. Year-to-date, we also have seen mid double-digit growth rates in visits to our clinics, offered across more than 1,600 stores. The two of these in combination with the rest of our services and product benefits creates a great opportunity to reinforce our value proposition. Additionally, pet ownerships benefit from the one-stop-shop convenience of our lifestyle retail format, in particular from the cross purchasing synergy with animal feeds. As we've mentioned, the vast majority of our customers have both an animal and a pet. In aqua livestock and poultry feed, we continue to gain market share. While our average unit retails were down mid-to-high single-digits in this category in Q2, conversely, we had strong mid-single-digit unit growth across all species. As large animal counts continue to pressure, we are certainly a share winner in the large animal categories with our strong unit growth. And in poultry, our annual Spring Chick Days was another positive highlight in the quarter. The event builds on our reputation as the destination for backyard enthusiasts. From economy to organic feed as well as our assortment of premium breeds, our lineup continues to resonate with our customers. Much like the first quarter, categories that performed below our comp sales were in our discretionary businesses, such as clothing, footwear and decor and also in the hardlines products of the business, such as things like ag, fencing and pet kennels. Our digital sales continued to trend from last quarter of double-digit growth. We've accelerated our digital capabilities and that's fueling engagement of our customers and also improving our conversion rate. Our 10th and largest distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas opened during the second quarter. The startup of the distribution center was right on-schedule and shifting began last month. It's a great job by the team. Once again, we are capitalizing on the opportunity to realign with store servicing areas across the DC network to balance transportation costs and DC capacity, while improving service levels to our store. Our supply chain investments over the last four years have provided us with a structural gross margin benefit from the reduction in spend miles. Our garden centers had strong performance during the important second quarter. We now have more than 500 garden centers across the chain. The merchants did a great job with a differentiated assortment and strong in-stocks on top of the planting season. With more variety and live goods as well as adjacent categories catering to outdoor living, we saw the customer respond positively to this multi-year growth driver. We opened 21 new Tractor Supply stores and three Petsense by Tractor Supply's in the quarter. Our new store productivity continues to perform very well. In the year since announcing our expanded real estate capabilities allowing for own development, we continue to anticipate material benefits to both revenue growth and operating margin rate. Our team has built-out capabilities to allow us to scale this initiative. We now have nearly 50% of our pipeline in own development with our first locations already open. This development allows us to have rent reductions of 15% or more compared to our traditional build-to-suit. And we continue to believe that we have a robust pipeline of low-risk organic growth opportunities ahead of us. To wrap-up, I believe the team is pleased but not satisfied with our first half performance. We set high expectations for ourselves. Customer trends are relatively in-line with our expectations. The team is executing well. In typical Tractor Supply fashion, we are effectively managing the factors that we can control and making progress on our Life Out Here strategy. As we plan for the second half of the year, we anticipate that our customers remain prudent with their spending as-is typical in an election year. At the halfway point of the year, we are narrowing our guidance for fiscal 2024 to reflect our performance year-to-date and our outlook for the second half of the year. We continue to create more separation between us and our competition, thanks to our team members and the meaningful relationships they have with our customers in combination with our strategic initiatives. Our dedication to serving Life Out Here remains unwavering. We will always strive to do the right thing. And now I'll turn the call over to Kurt. Thanks, Kurt. Despite the temporary softness in our channel, structural elements remain very attractive for Tractor Supply. We have numerous tailwinds, including our Life Out Here strategic initiative, our market being a beneficiary of continued net world migration, high return new store growth opportunities and ongoing share gains. Tractor Supply is extremely well positioned as a leader in a large fragmented market. Before we go into Q&A session, I'd like to wrap-up with three comments. One, as we head into the back half of the year, I am very excited about our robust innovation pipeline, the compelling values we have in our market and our new brand launches. We just set our annual Deer event and Halloween Decor program and both are off to a strong start. In Pet, we have a number of upcoming activities, including our expanded Pet Appreciation Month, a new lineup for MuttNation by Miranda Lambert and an expansion of 4health, our exclusive brand premium dog food. Additionally, we have an exciting new endcap program as well as new center court and dry wall events that are focused on compelling value that are core to our lifestyle. The second comment I'd have is we continue to believe that as and when economic conditions become more neutral for us that we will return to our long term algorithm. As mentioned, there's really two economic conditions that are impacting us the most. The first is the transition from goods to services in the context of PCE spend and the second is deflation. We believe both of these are transitory. We don't need them to improve, but rather just to normalize for us to return to our long term algorithm. And the third comment is that the team is playing offence. And we're not only executing our existing initiative, but working -- we're working on plans for the back-half of the decade and working on our next growth drivers of our Life Out Here strategy. Tractor Supply does not lack for opportunities and we believe we have multiple new opportunities that can expand on our $180 billion total addressable market. I'm very excited to share more details of the next drivers of our strategy in the near future. Our stores and online are ready for the changes of season as we enter the third quarter. Tractor Supply is well prepared to meet the needs and expectations of our customer. We've invested in our store base, in inventory, in our supply chain, in our digital capabilities and customer service to ensure that we can deliver on on-promise of providing the best products and solutions for Life Out Here. We've also enhanced our Neighbor's Club to provide more benefits and rewards to our loyal customers. We're excited about the upcoming events and promotions that will showcase our unique and differentiated seasonal assortment of merchandise, and we expect to see continued improvements across our categories. To conclude, I'm incredibly proud of our team. Throughout our 85-plus year history, no matter what issue we face, our team members have always come together. We have a unique and special culture. It's our special soft and key differentiator, and it's what gives me great confidence in the future of Tractor Supply. And with that, let's open up the call for questions. Hi, Scot, good morning. To your first question on the wet spring, it was a -- in the normally west spring, particularly in the South -- in the Southwest, Texas, in particular was wet almost the entire quarter. We had hoped that might lead to an elongated spring, particularly in the month of June and into July, it actually be favorable for us given comparison to last year. That's not how it played out. As we all know, the month of June was one of the hottest, if not the hottest month on record ever. And so we went from pretty much a wet -- wet spring to an immediately hot summer. And we did not see, as we called out ag fencing as an example, that's a big category, for us in general and in particularly in Texas. And as an example, we did not see that category recover in June like we had some aspirations for. That said, it's a wet week this week and we are hopeful that, that can pay some dividends as we turn the corner into August and into the fall. And as it relates to Q3, yes, it's basically kind of right down the middle of fairway for us in terms of our guidance range and kind of consistent with the comments Kurt gave at this point. And the one thing I would call out is July is our toughest compares of the three months. It's -- we get sequentially -- sequentially easier and compares to the tune of like a point or two points each of the next two months. So anyway, thanks, Scott, for the question. Hi, Michael. Yes. Hi, Michael, and thanks for the question. I'd start out by saying, obviously, it was a difficult situation that played out in a public arena, that's unfortunately is becoming increasingly common in business and the divisive sentiment that we have in our country. And we've got over 50,000 team members and 30-plus million customers and we certainly heard a range of feedback. We learned from others who had gone before us on this and moved fast to try to remove the perceived political and social agendas from our policies. And all that said, we have no evidence that it had a measurable impact on our business. And we continue to look to monitor the situation and look at a variety of datasets, but we do have no evidence at this point that it's had a measurable impact on our business and our results. And if I just step-back, we have a very special culture at Tractor Supply. It's firmly grounded in our well-established mission and values. And while we did withdraw our carbon emissions goals and retired our D&I goals, we did not retire our commitment to treating people fairly with respect, to inclusion, to being a good corporate citizen and certainly not to be stewards of -- and certainly did not retire -- are committed to being stewards of Life Out Here. And Tractor Supply, again, credible culture. We never lose sight of our obligations to be great stewards of our business over the long term. Thanks. Thanks, Michael, for the question. Yes, Hi, Steven. Let's start out by saying the first half played out very much in-line kind of right down the middle of our kind of base-case center point of our guidance. I would say most things in the first half were very much in-line with our expectations. I mean, maybe big ticket was a little stronger, and maybe some of the things like ag fencing and dog containment and such were a little bit weaker. But everything else, I would say, animal feed, pet food, our CUE products in general, seasonal. Even the discretionary business, we expected them to be reasonably negative. All those played out very much in line with what we expected. I kind of think about it as a down the middle of fairway based on our expectations first half. As it relates to the second half, we have a similar thesis to the second half right down the middle of fairway. I think Kurt tried to call that out in the prepared remarks. Q3, I think would be much of the continuation of the first half of the year with Q4 being really where there's a higher rate -- a broader range of outcomes. I think Kurt tried to really bring that to life in his prepared remarks to say there's one version of Q4 that could be -- could be strong and start that trend back towards our long term algorithm and there's a some favorable compares there and -- which create a nice setup and we've got a number of activities also going into that -- into the market during that time. On the flip side, there is a kind of a kind of more unfavorable potential outcome in Q4, where if we didn't see some good winter weather and the federal election created a lot of distraction and you've got a shorter holiday season that could lead to a lesser performance in Q4. So really tried to lay out the range of those two, and that's really what drives the Q4 variation, is really what drives the -- really the range of our comp guidance for the balance of the year with a pretty tight range of outcome forecast in Q3. But I would say from the start of the year, the business is really right in the middle of what we expected it could be. And to your kind of kind of question at the end, there's really sitting at this point in time, nothing that we see in the back half that's much different than what we saw at the beginning of the year. It's a pretty, pretty straightforward at this point in terms of our outlook. Yes, hi, Chuck, and thanks for the question. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we still feel very confident in our long term guidance and there's really two main factors that we see as -- that are macro factors that are impacting us right now for performing at that long term guidance rate, namely the shift in consumer spend from goods to services and the second being deflation, inflation. And so now if you hit both of those, if you think about our average ticket for the first half of the year, which is roughly flat, historically, we would have at a minimum kind of a 1.5%-ish maybe average ticket growth, could be 2%, 2.5%. So even if we just had some favorability in average ticket, all of a sudden, that walks you up to nearly a 1.5 or 2 point comp right there. And then if you think about PCE, year-to-date, services are up 6%, 7%, whereas goods are up 1%. If you were to see that normalize, even if goods underperformed services, say, goods are 2.5% or 3% and maybe services are 3%, 3.5%, you get that extra point to 2 points on the goods kind of rising tide, and all of a sudden, you're walking back to a 4%, 4.5% comp right there. And so we really do see it as cleanly as that, is that at some -- kind of in the future, it certainly have confidence that deflation will moderate and we'll get back to a consistent kind of inflation rate in this country and in our business. And then similarly, expect that the good services shift will moderate. I mean, I think that's probably the bigger question. We probably have a better lens as to when the deflation will moderate, because we see that in our business. But on the goods and services, I think that's kind of the open question. It is only 90 basis points away from its pre-COVID levels. So it doesn't have a significantly further to go. But is that six months, is that nine months? Is that three months? I think time will tell there. Thanks, Chuck, for the question. Hi, Brian. I'll start by saying, we are very comfortable with our inventory levels right now and the quality of our inventory. And we don't see any actions required on the quality of our inventory as we move forward. Just to be very clear on that. There's two main drivers of our inventory increases, really three main drivers of our inventory increases year-over-year. The first I would call out, as Kurt did, which was easier -- the kind of net -- the lapping of comparison last year. We were down, I think, negative 1.7% on inventory last year. The second is our investment in big ticket. Obviously, those are higher average unit retail items. So that's going to disproportionately drive our inventory dollars up. But we saw the strength in riders, in UTVs, in things like grills and other big ticket categories, we invested into that. And we'll continue to do that into Q3 as well. As an example, we typically have about 800 stores that are kind of go long stores and riders that have an extended season. This year, we've increased that to 1,150 stores. We are seeing the strength in big ticket continue into Q3. So that is a -- that investment is -- is paying-off and we expect it to continue to. The third thing I would call out is just a reiteration of what Kurt and Seth said, which is our investment in in-stock rates. We are 4 points higher year-over-year in in-stock rates. It's our highest in-stock rate since the pandemic. And that is really on the shelves inside of our stores. And as you all know, I spent a lot of time in our stores, been in five different markets in the last five weeks. We have never looked healthier and better since my time at the company in areas like dog treats, in areas like leashes, in hardware, in hand tools, in areas like lubricants and batteries. As Seth called out, our clearance levels are lower than last year at this time and in incredibly good shape. As you all know, our clearance levels have been running at historic lows since the pandemic and continue to do so. The team is doing an excellent job navigating inventory. So anyway, to step back, we feel incredibly good about the quality of our inventory, have no concerns about it in the second half and in fact, feel great about the investments we've made, which are driving in-stock rates and kind of a bit of a go longer strategy in big ticket. Thanks, Brian, for the question. Yes, so maybe I'll talk a little bit about our Neighbor's Club in that -- in that context. First off, I would say we continue to be very pleased, and in fact, it's kind of performing better than what we would expect to gain here in terms of number of members signing-up for Neighbor's Club, as I called out, now at 36 million. The second thing I'd call out is we continue to see retention rates of our Neighbor's Club remain at kind of historic rates. So as you're growing your member base and you're growing retention, I mean, that's a kind of a strong kind of balance there, right, and add -- and multiple -- increasingly added it together. I'd say what we saw was on are higher income cohorts that are our strength, stronger retention, modest moderation by I mostly in kind of the -- as we -- and when we looked at it, a lot of it, we really do core that they are the ones that over indexed on services and on travel and on vacations here in the second quarter. But again, modest moderation there. The group that we continue to focus on, and we called this out last quarter as well is that entry cohort into our Neighbor's Club and we lowered the tier threshold and we increased the type of rewards you could redeem at the last -- in -- in our last quarter and saw nice improvement there. We're continuing to focus on that through the second quarter. As we look towards the back half, we're very excited about the implementation of our customer data platform, how that's going to further accelerate our ability to personalize with customers and our communications and help continue to stimulate all groups, but in particular that kind of entry level group. In addition, we launched this quarter our Hometown Heroes program. It's off to an excellent start in terms of member sign-up. And as we called out, while I don't expect these trends to continue, the early sign-ups have been a significant piece of it is new to Tractor Supply and new to our Neighbor's Club program. So we have -- I think it's one of the best membership programs, loyalty programs -- loyalty programs, excuse me, in the market out there. The team continues to iterate and make it better and better. Our customers continue to give us very favorable marks on it. And we do see Neighbor's Club as instrumental to our success as we move forward. Thanks, Steven. Hi, Oliver, how are you today? Thanks for the question. I would -- the main driver of the variation for the second half in the range of outcomes for our comp is really what the driver of our range for the first-half was, is transactions. As we've been, I think pretty transparent, we have great insight to average ticket, great insight into our average unit retail. Pending some mix we know exactly what our pricing for our seasonal products are already going to be for the year. We know what our CUE trends are. We obviously have a perspective on how we're going to be pricing CUE into the back half of the year. So we have very good forward-looking view as to our average unit retail. And so I feel like there's probably less variability in ticket and expect that to be reasonably flat throughout the year, although there's some modestly easier compares on average unit retail as you get into the fourth quarter. So a little bit of upside there. But the main driver of our range of outcomes is going to be transactions. And particularly in the fourth quarter and really we think it's all around consumer sentiment and also drivers of need. And if there's some weather events, that will drive need. And depending on the federal election and the shortened holiday season, I think that will drive sentiment. Those two things will come together to drive our transactions. And so anyway, back to your point, I think the variability for the back half of the year is really primarily transactions with maybe a very modest range of outcomes on AUR. Yes. Thanks, Oliver. Yes, hi, Peter. Thanks for the question. I'd really point to -- to two things. One, I think structurally, we play a little bit more in big-ticket than a lot of the other farm and ranch competitors on the margins, but I think that helped raise our waterline a little bit on total sales. Also I would say, on the CUE business, in particular on the feed side, well, the CUE business in general, particularly dog food and animal feed, we're gaining share in both. Our share gains in animal Feed, in our view in Q2 were outsized. And I think a lot of that comes down to our scale, our cost position, both with working with our vendors and our partners there, but also our supply chain and whether it's our DCs, our mixing centers, our freight partners and just us having the best cost position in the market, being able to invest that appropriately in price. As you know, we have over 20 price zones. We're able to get really targeted in where we want to price and how we need to price to drive those units. So I think those would be the things I'd speak to. And then the final point would be, of course, our strategic initiatives. And I think as it relates to say like the fusion remodel program, we're approaching half of our store base now being in the fusion remodel program. So I think our store environments relative to the farm and ranch channel are significantly higher-level of a store environment now. Our commitment to customer service, we called that out. So you get, I think a better level of customer service in our stores. And so just all those sorts of things are starting to add up to continue to drive the outsized share gains. Thanks Peter, for the question."

            "content": "Yes. Hi, Peter, Seth. Thanks, Kurt. Yes, as Kurt mentioned, we were down last year about 1.7%. When we think about this year's inventory position, we have purposely invested in where we're continuing to see growth. So when you look right now, we're continuing to invest in areas like grills, mini bikes, rec vehicles, even like riders where we're continuing to see some strong momentum in various parts across our store base. But we're also in the best in-stock position we've been since pre-pandemic. We're investing in in-stocks. We're up around 400 basis points in in-stocks when you compare to where we are this year versus last. And when you look at our clearance inventory, while we don't give specific numbers, our clearance and aged inventory is actually down versus last year. And I would say both those in-stock positions and you look at our clearance and aged inventory, are both really good indicators of the quality that we have. And I would just say as we look ahead to the back-half, we're committed to making sure we're investing in the categories that are working. We're investing in being a dependable supplier and making sure that we have our key core CUE products on shelf. And I feel really good about the innovation pipeline we're investing and being in a position to drive sales. So quality of inventory remains strong. We're in a great in-stock position and feel good about the inventory position. Yes, hi, Chris, Seth. Hi, just as the simplest answer, I would just say when you look at the back-half, we're not seeing any signaling that you're going to see like AUR compression when it comes to pet food, when we look out. Right now, AURs continue to be somewhat flat year-over-year and that's kind of what we see going forward. Relative both feed and pet food, I would say, like as you think about the current environment we're in, and if you continue to see commodities stay where they are, you'll start to see things like you've traditionally seen in the industry where more value packs, more bonus packs, things of that nature will continue to hit the market. So at this point, we see pet food pricing remaining basically stable."

            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal, and good morning to everyone on the call. In many ways, our second quarter topline results were consistent with our results in the first quarter, with solid seasonal growth and exceptional big ticket sales, while our year around discretionary categories remain pressured. As we expected, CUE performance was slightly below the chain average given the retail price deflation and moderating pet category trends the industry is experiencing. Retail price deflation, which was just over 1% was in line with our expectations. The vast majority of this deflation came from our CUE categories. As Hal mentioned, we are pleased with our unit movement in CUE as we successfully managed through the impact of deflation this quarter. Our comp sales growth was relatively consistent across all regions of the chain within a range of down 2% to up 2%. The strongest regional performance was in the Northeast and Commonwealth due to easier compares and better overall weather compared to last year. This strength was offset by pressure in the Far West and Texas, Oklahoma for the exact opposite reasons, as they had tougher compares and less than ideal weather conditions this quarter. As to the cadence of the quarter, all months were also in a relatively tight band of essentially plus or minus 1%. As Hal mentioned, we believe April was negatively impacted by the pull forward of Easter into the first quarter as well as a slow start to the spring season. Moving down our income statement, our gross margin increased 43 basis points to last year. We continue to be very pleased with these results, which were driven primarily by ongoing lower transportation costs along with disciplined product cost management and the continued execution of an everyday low price strategy. These improvements were partially offset by the mix impact from strong growth in big ticket categories, which have below chain average margins. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 58 basis points to 23.4%. This increase was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included the onboarding of a new distribution center and higher depreciation amortization, as well as modest deleverage of our fixed costs given the decline in comparable store sales. These factors were partially offset by productivity improvements and strong cost-control. During the quarter, our ongoing sale leaseback strategy benefited SG&A by approximately $5 million net of transaction and repair costs from the sale of two Tractor Supply locations. This transaction and the related benefit represent timing shift out of the third quarter and into Q2. For the quarter, operating profit margin was 13.2%. We had strong cost control as evidenced by our underlying operating profit margin that was essentially flat with prior year. Diluted EPS was $3.93 compared to $3.83 last year. Turning now to our balance sheet, merchandise inventories were $3.0 billion at the end of the second quarter, representing an increase of 10.2% in average inventory per store as we improved our in-stock position in CUE and invested in big-ticket given its strength. Our in-stocks are up nearly four points to our best level since before the pandemic. We are pleased with the quality of our inventory as we enter the second half of the year. With strong annualized cash flows, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around two times. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $500 million of capital to our shareholders through our share repurchases and dividends. Now let me turn to our updated fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Given our performance in the first half of the year and our forecast for the balance of the year, we believe it's now appropriate to narrow our guidance range. For the year, we now anticipate net sales in the range of $14.8 billion to $15 billion with comp store sales in the range of down 0.5 point to up 1%. Our operating margin rate is expected to be in the range of 9.8% to 10.1% with net income of $1.08 billion to $1.12 billion. Diluted EPS is forecast to be $10 to $10.40. As to the calendarization between the third and fourth quarter, let me share with you a bit more of how we are thinking about the various scenarios. We are approaching the back half with balanced optimism. We are forecasting comp sales in the third quarter to be within a tight band of scenarios and generally similar to the first half of the year. The shift of the season doesn't occur until late in the third quarter and we don't begin to lap the deflationary effect of feed until the fourth quarter. The only meaningful swing factor-in Q3 tends to be weather, particularly large storms, which produce emergency response activity. We see the fourth quarter having a wider range of potential outcomes. For our base case, we do anticipate stronger growth in the fourth quarter given the easier compares, while acknowledging that we could see more volatility in consumer spending. On the high end of our outlook range, in addition to the easing compares, factors we considered include a more normalized start to winter, lapping net deflation, which began in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the potential for greater emergency response activity. Now on the low end of the range, dynamics we contemplated include moderation in big ticket trends, potential consumer uncertainty due to the Federal election and a shorter holiday selling season with five less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. As for the retail price, our plans continue to reflect a headwind from deflation in the third quarter with a moderation towards neutral in the fourth quarter as we start to lap the lower cost, which began in late Q3 of last year. Our guidance reflects ongoing gross margin expansion in the second half of the year. The third quarter is expected to have our best gross margin expansion as we anticipate transportation costs will remain favorable. In the fourth quarter, we'll be lapping our most difficult comparison with 129 basis-points of expansion in the prior year, where we began to see the benefits from lower transportation costs and our product cost management initiative. As a result, we are forecasting our fourth quarter gross margin rate consistent with the prior year. I view our gross margin performance as strong in this current environment. Moving on to SG&A, for the second half of the year, there are a couple of items I would highlight for our expectations, especially for the third quarter. First, please keep in mind that we are lapping last year's depreciation benefit of 35 basis points or $0.08 per share in the third quarter. Second, given our comp sales outlook specific to the third quarter, we anticipate modest fixed cost deleverage. And third, we will continue to see pressure from the startup cost of the new distribution center in both the third quarter and fourth quarter. Thus our SG&A performance will be the softest in the third quarter with more modest deleverage in the fourth quarter. In total, we remain on track for the benefits of our sale leasebacks to be relatively consistent with last year's, albeit with a slight variation by quarter due to the timing shift of two stores into the second quarter. We continue to forecast the return of capital to shareholders in the range of $1 billion, reflecting the strength of our cash flow and the confidence we have in the long term. At Tractor Supply, we believe in playing offense. This is a team that will stay on offense and continue to invest for the long term. We are excited about our Life Out Here strategy progress, our leadership position in the industry and our ability to build-on our track record of long term value creation for our shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Hal to wrap up. Yes, I'll actually let Seth -- Peter give you more of the details on that, and I'll make one reference. We are cycling last year. In Q2, we called out that we were down 1.7% in inventory last year. We knew we needed and wanted more inventory in CUE and even some of the big ticket rec. And so we're very pleased with where we're at. And I think, Seth, why don't you explain further some of where the-- --increase is at and the position on inventory for today and even the back half. Yes. Hi, Kate, good morning. This is Kurt. On big-ticket, I'll share a few specifics on that. As we mentioned, we've been continually pleased this year to see the rebound on big ticket after a couple of years of softness in big ticket. First quarter ran positive high-single-digit big ticket and the ever important Q2 ran a low double-digit growth rate in big ticket. So if -- you hear the commentary from us on our investment in that area of the business, how we're driving the sales through innovation. So very pleased with the results on big ticket. Q2 tends to have the largest portion of our sales on big ticket in the low teens. It averages in the high single-digit as a percentage of our sales for the year. So in the second half of the year, it does become a lesser of an impact. But on a year-over-year basis, we really do see that there's opportunity in the back half of the year in areas that we're winning in that, Seth just mentioned, whether it be recreational vehicles or even riders. And then in the back fourth quarter, really some of the winter-related heating, log splitters, those type, snow blowers, we can continue to win in innovation and our ability to drive great value in big ticket. So it's certainly one of the tailwinds for us. The team has done an excellent job bringing new product to our customers and driving value even through areas like deferred financing as a great value for big ticket. So while not as much of a swing factor in the second half, we do believe that's one of the tailwinds on our comps for the second half of the year. Yes. Hi, Zach. In regards to elections, in my history, as we've -- as we've looked at that and we have been through cycles, there is no real meaningful performance change based on the year of a federal election or the outcome of a federal election. Now we have seen, and I think it's well-understood that this is a very intense environment today with this election. What that does to the consumer sentiment is certainly one that we are being conscious of. And I think the election will take a lot of attention and could impact the consumer spending habits, et cetera. But really, over the years, how we've seen the performance of the consumer has really proven to have no strong indication that we should plan for or change our outlook in any particular way. It's just viewed as one that could be a variable in the ranges of outcome. And so we're conscious of that. But we've been able to pivot in either one of these environments. And the one last thing I would just point to is that for us, which I think is different is that it doesn't tend to have much of a change because it's a needs-based business where regardless of the outcome, the lifestyle and the needs that we serve, don't really change that much. So we watch and we're creating strategies under scenarios, but we don't see a specific outcome that we are planning for. Sure. Hi, Chris, this is Kurt. And I'll take the first part of the question on the commodities and then I'll let Seth address your question on pet food. On commodities, just some key points that I think is helpful to reference. Corn, which is the largest commodity impact item. But additionally, when you think of corn, soybean, cotton, steel, they all are commodities that play into our pricing. They have all been at year-to-date or year-over-year in the low teens deflationary point compared to June of 2023. All of them are generally back to 2019 levels. And they are 30% or nearly 40% off of their '22 -- 2022 year highs. So we've been going through a two year cycle of that. And all indications are we are at the 2019 levels. We're at what we believe is the trough. Most of these costs have already been embedded into it. The only other variability that -- and I indicated to that is, you would look at Q4 and see that to be a neutral or potentially even beginning to see an inflationary turn and the way commodities shift, will I think will really derive whether or not Q4 even the Q1 is a shift into some slight inflation or keeps us at a plateau. The corns and soybeans tend to move within about a 60 to 90 day timeframe through our systems. And so they move pretty quickly and impact the cost of goods sold in a really timely basis. I'll turn it over to Seth on the follow-up question on pet food."

In our view, the U.S. economy remains strong. Unemployment continues at a low level, wages are growing at a steady clip. In spite of sticky inflation, consumer spending remains strong, and mobility has slowed as a consequence of a challenging housing market, with that said, we continue to see outsized population growth in rural markets. \n As it relates to consumer spending, the shift of spending from goods to services continues to be a headwind for our business. In the first 2 months of the calendar year, consumer services spending growth was nearly 7%, whereas consumer spending on goods growth was less than 1%. As a result, the mix of goods as a share of PCE are now only 100 basis points above their pre-COVID average. This progressive shift is in line with our expectations as we enter the year. \n Also, as expected, inflation has remained sticky by outsized increases in shelter, food, away from home, energy and insurance. As a consequence, consumers continue to be anxious about inflation, particularly the lower-income consumer. \n In the first quarter, our upper income consumer over-indexed in big ticket categories and recreational purchases compared to our lower income consumer, who is prioritizing their spend on needs. \n In our needs-based, consumable, usable and edible categories, we see very little difference in our performance by income cohort. Once again, our business is proving to be durable, stable and very consistent. \n Broadly speaking, in our economy, goods continue to disinflate and are generally running low single digits with some categories having moderate deflation. With the first quarter behind Tractor Supply, we have now successfully lapped our 2 most challenging compares due to the inflationary benefits that we had over the last 18 months that have substantially benefited our top line. We do not see additional downward deflationary pressures in the current environment. The transition from an inflationary cycle to a disinflationary cycle is playing out as we anticipated. \n In spite of a very challenging housing market, we continue to see positive migration trends to our markets. While rural migration trends have moderated from the recent peaks, rural America again gained population in 2023. This marks the fourth consecutive year of growth in rural population. It is our view that the sense of community found in our markets, and perhaps more importantly, the ability to secure a piece of property at a reasonable price has ensured the rural migration trend is one that's here to stay for the time being. \n So with that, let's now turn to a review of the business for the first quarter. We grew net sales by 2.9%, with comparable store sales up 1.1% and diluted earnings per share up 10.9% to $1.83. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by transaction growth of 1.3% offset by a small decline in average ticket of 0.2%. These results were very much in line with our expectations that we shared with you as we started the quarter and year. \n Overall, our customer base remains healthy and highly engaged. Total customer count grew mid-single digits with growth in active, new and reactivated customers as we invested in our Neighbor's Club program and customer service. \n Neighbor's Club continues to represent the majority of our sales. During the quarter, we significantly enhanced our Neighbor's Club offering. As our points-based program enters its fourth year, it was appropriate for us to refresh our offering based on insights and customer feedback. The changes we made were all implemented with the goal to have customers receive rewards faster and to lower the spending required for tier qualifications. Our Neighbor's Club members have responded positively to these changes. For example, the new rewards redemption at a $2 and $5 level down from $10 is working as we designed and is driving greater customer engagement and trips for this cohort. The initial response from our customers on the collective changes has been very positive, and we're seeing increased spending across the board. \n In addition, we continue to improve relevancy to our members through more personalized offers and tailored incentives and experiences based on their interest and shopping patterns. With more than 34 million members, Neighbor's Club should continue to build our customers' loyalty and affinity for Tractor Supply as we go forward. \n Our customer service scores continue to run at all-time highs. This is an area where we have strategically invested in training, compensation, benefits, tools and technology to help elevate our customer service. This has garnered the attention of our customers, and I believe, helps strengthen our scores. \n The strength of our portfolio products and shopping missions was evident very much so in the first quarter. We had robust growth in our seasonal categories. Our consumable, usable and edible products performed in line with our chain average. Our performance this quarter was on top of the robust growth we've experienced over the last 4 years as our CUE customer trends remain strong as we continue to gain market share. Our customers were certainly in the mindset to prepare for spring as we had strong big ticket growth in the mid-single digits and strength in other early spring preparedness categories. Categories that performed below our comp sales growth were more in our discretionary businesses such as clothing and gifts and truck tool and hardware. \n In our pet food and livestock categories, we continue to grow our market share. In pet food, we've seen growth moderate as the category disinflates and pet ownership moderates. Our customers' shopping trip in this category is highly differentiated, so we offer a broad assortment from value to super premium across private and exclusive brands in a pet-friendly environment, which now includes about 900 Pet Wash locations. Additionally, pet owners benefit from the one-stop shop convenience of our lifestyle retail format, in particular, from the cross purchasing synergy with animal and livestock feed. \n In animal and livestock feed, we offer exclusive brands like DuMORs and Producer's Pride, along with the national brands from Purina, Cargill, Triple Crown and more. We continue to innovate across our key categories of equine, cattle and poultry in trends like organic and snack. And we bring a unique retail experience in these categories with events like our annual spring Chick Days. This year, the event is on track to have strong results. We continue to see growth from existing customers who are building out and adding to their flock. Organic feed and our assortment of premium breeds continue to lead the category and growth. \n Tractor Supply is the destination for backyard poultry. Today, nearly 2/3 of our backyard chicken owners consider them to be pets, and our customers over-index the poultry ownership with nearly one in five customers having chickens. \n Stepping back, we have a market share of about 20% in bagged livestock feed, and we continue to take share, and we are consistently outperforming the market across our 2 categories. After nearly 2 years of pressure on our big ticket comps, we were pleased to see big ticket categories turn positive in the quarter. We experienced broad-based strength across seasonal categories, including zero-turn tractors, recreational vehicles and outdoor power equipment. \n Our digital sales returned to double-digit growth in the quarter with increases in visits and an improved conversion rate. Nearly 80% of our orders were whether picked up in store or fulfilled by a store. Almost 20% of our sales came through our mobile app. The team made excellent feature update such as New Express Checkout feature and the addition of estimated delivery times, and these have helped increase our conversion rate. \n This year, we're opening our tenth and largest distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas. The start-up of the distribution center is right on schedule as shipping will begin during June. Once again, we'll be able to capitalize on the opportunity to realign the store servicing areas across the DC network to balance transportation costs and DC capacity while improving service levels to our stores. It is great for our DC network to have this new capacity to better position our inventory and better service our stores all the while allowing us to reduce our freight cost. \n Our supply chain investments over the last 4 years have provided us with material structural gross margin benefit from the reduction in stem miles. \n We opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and 4 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the quarter. As I shared last quarter, 2024 will be the year of the Garden Center. We're leveraging the change of seasons across the store front as the year shifts to spring. The team has come out of the gate strong to ensure we have a differentiated assortment and availability in time for the planting season. We now have nearly 500 Garden Centers across the chain. Based on our early read of spring, our expectation is that with more variety than ever and a grower network to support our Garden Centers, we should see the customer respond positively this multiyear growth driver. \n At Tractor Supply, we're grounded in our purpose as a company to serve life out here and our deep-rooted commitment to our mission and values. We believe in finding meaningful ways to support our core mission. Earlier this week, we issued our fifth annual stewards of Life Out Here Tear Sheet that highlights our Stewardship priorities and progress. \n For all of us at Tractor Supply, we are highly committed to preserving life out here for future generations. We are proud to share our progress towards our ambitious goals. \n In summary, we're relatively pleased with our start to the year. Customer trends are in line with our expectations. The team is executing very well. We're controlling our controllables and making progress on our Life Out Here strategy. With the majority of the year remaining, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2024. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kurt. \nKurt Barton: Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Let me start by building on to Hal's comments about the quarter. Our first quarter performance was right down the middle when compared to our expectations on both the top line and the bottom line. Regarding the cadence of comp sales for the quarter, we started out with a very strong January as the month features some spans of brutal cold. \n While February was warmer than normal and relatively soft, the best way to view the winter season performance is to look at weather categories across January and February combined. And overall, we were pleased with our cold weather category performance. We comped positive in March in spite of a limited arrival of spring across our markets. Where this season had turned to spring, we were very pleased with how the business performed.\n All geographic regions performed in a tight band for the quarter. Average unit retail was impacted by modest product deflation of about 1% in line with our expectations. We're encouraged by the trends we are seeing in unit growth and the underlying share gains in categories where deflation has had an outsized impact to AUR. Our gross margin rate of 36% increased 50 basis points to last year. We were very pleased with these results, which were driven primarily by ongoing lower transportation costs, disciplined product cost management and the continued execution of our everyday low price strategy. \n We were able to strategically provide great value for our customers while maintaining our gross margin. We remain committed to being the everyday low-price leader in our markets. \n Our first quarter SG&A expense rate, including depreciation and amortization, increased 16 basis points to 28.2%. This increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization as well as the modest deleverage of our fixed cost given the level of comparable store sales growth. The leverage from our distribution center productivity gains did partially offset the loss of fixed cost leverage. Excluding depreciation and amortization, SG&A was essentially flat as a percent of sales. This was better performance than we anticipated entering the year as there were approximately $5 million of expenses that we had planned to occur in the first quarter that we now anticipate incurring in the second quarter. From my perspective, the team did a great job controlling the controllables. \n Altogether, operating income increased 7%, with operating margin expansion of 34 basis points. Net income increased 8.2% and diluted EPS increased 10.9% to $1.83. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $118.8 million, returning $236.2 million of capital to shareholders. We also increased our dividend by 7%, marking our 15th consecutive year of growing our dividend. \n Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $3.0 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing a modest decrease of about 4% in average inventory per store. Lower freight costs was a contributor to the decrease in inventory dollars. Excluding freight in Orscheln, our comp inventory was up modestly in dollar value and units. We are pleased with how we exited the winter season and the quality of our inventory as of the end of the first quarter. In our commitment to be the dependable supplier for our customers' lifestyle, we are at the highest in-stock levels since pre-COVID. With strong annualized cash flows and improved working capital, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2x. \n As Hal mentioned, we are reiterating our guidance for 2024. We anticipate this year to be a continued story of ongoing share gains offset by macro headwinds. We continue to expect full year sales of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion and project comparable store sales to be in the range of down 1% to a positive 1.5%. As we manage through the first half of the year, we expect to see second quarter comp sales in line with our full year outlook. Given the trends in our comp sales, our outlook assumes that strength in big ticket and seasonal will continue. We are planning for a modest AUR pressure on CUE with positive unit trends. \n Our expectation is that select discretionary categories will remain under pressure. For the second quarter, we expect gross margin expansion in line with the first quarter from continued supply chain efficiencies and benefits from effective cost management, partially offset by the mix impact of growth in big ticket, which runs below the chain average. \n We anticipate the gross margin expansion to be offset by SG&A deleverage from our planned investments, including the incremental cost for the opening of our new distribution center. \n As I mentioned earlier, there's approximately $5 million of shifting to the second quarter that we had initially anticipated in the first quarter, including staffing and training costs associated with the opening of the DC. As a result, we expect second quarter operating profit margin to be down slightly compared to prior year. \n As I shared when we initially provided guidance in February, there are a few factors that will impact operating margin in certain quarters. We anticipate the tailwinds of lower transportation costs to continue to benefit our results in the second quarter and begin to flatten year-over-year starting in Q3. \n In regards to SG&A, the second and third quarters will be pressured from the start-up costs for the new distribution center, while the supply chain benefits will not begin to be realized in gross margin until late in the third quarter. \n To sum it up, for the full year, we continue to guide toward net income of $1.06 billion to $1.13 billion and diluted earnings per share of $9.85 to $10.50. With the majority of the year still ahead of us, we believe these expectations are still appropriate. We continue to believe that the best way to look at our business is not by the quarters, but by the halves of the year. \n In this environment, what sets Tractor Supply apart is our ability to effectively manage the top line and bottom line while investing in our Life Out Here strategic growth drivers. And with that, I will turn the call back to Hal for some final remarks. \nHarry Lawton: Thanks, Kurt. Tractor Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over many business cycles. As a company, we have numerous levers to continue to gain market share and numerous levers to effectively control expenses. Our Life Out Here strategic priorities are on track and delivering on our expectations. We continue to see fantastic opportunities for growth ahead. In store and online, we're ready for the spring and summer season. Customers are responding positively to our new product assortments from Weber, Toro, YETI and more. We have several product test and learn initiatives in store and online, like Martha Stewart and Eddie Bauer. \n Across companion animal, we're adding to our assortment with new brands like ACANA, Real Mesa and Native Pet and expanding our offerings across brands like Purina Pro Plan, SPORTMiX and Hill's Science Diet. Our Garden Centers are set to help our customers prepare for their hobbies of gardening, especially with a focus on vegetables and fruit trees and just simply enjoying their property. \n Across the seasons, we have new product offerings specific to the Garden Center. We're currently showcasing our roses, Plant of the Month, and are prepared with hanging baskets for Mother's Day. As we move into the second half of the year, we will shift to Fall Harvest and Halloween and then to Christmas with live goods and decor. Overall, this is a great way for us to track new customers and soften the front of our store. \n Across the store, we have a tremendous amount of newness for our customers' passions and lifestyles. We also continue to invest in customer service at our stores. In addition to our Hey GURA app, to turbocharge service our store team members provide to our customers, we are leveraging AI in our stores and Garden Centers through our Tractor Vision, which uses cameras and computer vision technology to provide data to deploy alerts that help our team members efficiently and effectively staff the store. \n One scenario where this is incredibly beneficial is when customer traffic is building up at our registers, Tractor Vision will alert team members through their ERP that another team member needs to come up to open another register. We're also leveraging Tractor Vision to monitor our front apron of the store for dwell time. This allows for a team member to better serve our customers particularly in categories like outdoor riding lawn mowers. These are the types of investments and capabilities that separate us from our farm and ranch competition and really make us a leader in retail. \n It's an exciting time at Tractor Supply. My thanks and appreciation goes out to the team for their dedication to delivering our mission and values every day. And now we'd like to open up the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. \nSeth Sigman: I wanted to talk about the big ticket improvement. Obviously, that's a nice change from what we've seen. If I recall, when you talk about big ticket, you're looking at transactions over a certain size. Can you try to separate for us the difference between sales from high price point products, so you mentioned riding lawn mowers. Have you actually seen comps in those specific high-ticket categories go positive? Or is it more basket building, you're seeing the benefit from more units per transaction as part of the spring activity? \nHarry Lawton: Seth, thanks for the question. We were very pleased with our big ticket performance in Q1. I'll highlight 2 trends and then provide some examples in the context of each of those. The first one I'll highlight was in January, where we had the nice cold weather come through the country. And as a consequence of that, had some nice big ticket sales that go along with that as we often do, whether that's things like snow throwers or log splitters. And to your point, the cutoff that we use for big ticket is $350 price point. .\n But then the other comment I'll make is in the month of March, particularly the last couple of weeks where we start to see that spring ramp occur, we saw a nice lift in big ticket over those weeks. And we did highlight in the prepared remarks in categories like riding lawn mowers, outdoor power, we saw strong positive comps in those categories in those weeks. As we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we saw an over penetration in those purchases of higher income consumers versus lower income consumers.  As we talked about, just kind of buying a bit more towards need for the lower income consumers. \n The last thing I'll add is that the trend on big ticket that we saw in March for spring sales has continued into Q2. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My question is also on big ticket, and Hal maybe I can put it in this way, if you look at it relative to 2019, and I think we're trying to assess whether there's like a bottoming and a turn that's happening versus seasonal. I think your comments around the March volume sounds like there may be a turn. But if we compare it to 2019 or 2020, granted it's hard to understand what baseline is normal versus not, but looking at it that perspective, and then -- and if there's anything about these big ticket trends that informs you about the cadence of the year. It doesn't sound like it, and it sounds like the cadence has always been pretty static across the quarters, but anything that you think about maybe big ticket strength continuing into the second half that maybe you didn't plan for? \nHarry Lawton: Simeon. I'll reiterate a couple of the comments that I have on the previous question, just to tee up the discussion. So on big ticket, as it relates to spring, we saw nice big ticket ramp in absolute dollars and comps as we exited Q1 and those trends have continued into Q2, and we're very pleased with our big ticket spring sales. As we look at a multiyear history on that, if you recall, last year, we commented that our big ticket categories were back to 2019 levels. So I would articulate the growth that we're seeing now is kind of consistent and growth that would be on top of a normal -- go back to 2019 trend. So we feel like it's a healthy growth, compounding growth and very much in the kind of stable on top of 2019 levels. \n The final thing I'll add is we called out numerous times, the drought conditions and the heat conditions that occurred in a number of our key markets the last 2 years, whether that's the Midwest or Texas, given the cooler weather that we've had and the nice precipitation we've had, grass is green across the country right now. And we all just returned from our executive walks across the whole country last week, and we all came back and kind of talked about the same thing. You've got really green grass, and it's growing well and the temperatures are staying cool. So the conditions are right for big ticket sales as well for us. But we're very pleased with the big ticket activity, strong exit in Q1 and continuing that pace into Q2, healthy on top of 2019 and the conditions are favorable for it as well this year. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. \nSeth Basham: I'm just trying to understand your inflation and deflation outlook a little bit more as we see a rise in oil prices here, do you think that could lead to any material inflation as we move through the year? \nHarry Lawton: Seth, good morning. As it relates to inflation, the -- probably the most important point to take away from us is that we've lapped our 2 most difficult quarters as it relates to comping on top of inflation. As we remarked at the end of our Q4 call, we were lapping 11% inflation from Q3 of 2022. And then we're lapping substantial inflation from last year in Q1 of 2023. So as we look ahead, we have significantly less lapping issues. \n And, in particular, as it relates to things like animal feed, as we get towards the end of Q2, we really start to get back to a more normalized environment. And by the way, by the time we get to mid-Q3, we're in -- we basically lapped it all. So I feel really good as we look forward that we're kind of getting close to hitting the bottom on disinflation and starting to be back as we get towards the end of the year towards a more normal outlook.  \n We're not seeing anything different in our margin expectations, pricing expectations, cost to good expectations that we saw at the beginning of the year. As we've mentioned, we worked closely with our vendor partners middle of last year to pull back on a lot of the cost increases we've seen. That's been successful. You see that in our gross margin rate results. \n At the same time, we're appropriately moderated on prices. Our pricing has never been sharper in the industry. We monitor that very closely, and we've got multi, multiyear trends on that, never been sharper than we had in Q1 and coming into Q2. And we don't see anything on the horizon that would change kind of our retail price, cost of goods outlook. We did just complete all of our container, kind of shipping negotiations. Those are basically coming in kind of flat to last year. So there's not -- we don't see headwind in the future there. \n And I don't think that there's been a significant amount of oil, fuel kind of cost type increases to impact certainly -- first cost type at this point at all. And the freight market, given the status of the freight market and the overcapacity that there is, you had to start to see prices come up to reflect fuel in that area as well. So pretty stable, no real change to our outlook, either on this call or versus our last call. \nKurt Barton: Yes. And Seth, this is Kurt. Just to tie that back to our guidance. As we entered 2024, I have said that we could see and are planning for 2024 from an inflation, deflation, relatively neutral, plus or minus a point. And we expect as we're starting to lap some of those inflation quarters last year, Q2 may have a similar impact as we saw in Q1. But then if you were to play out the current environment today, it would really put us in an expectation for the year sort of that neutral standpoint. And we'll know more on how the back half looks after Q2, but still pretty much playing right in line with our guidance. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: I wanted to expand on the big ticket commentary and focus on what's happening with spring. Can you contrast what you saw in March in markets where spring broke? Where did it break? Where it hasn't yet broken? And how you're thinking about what's April telling you about the business so far in the quarter? \nHarry Lawton: Yes. Chris, we think where the sun has been out and conditions have been right, we've been very pleased with spring. Our big ticket sales are strong, our Live Goods are selling well. Our Garden Centers are performing, categories like grilling, other categories like fertilizer and grass seed, we're seeing real strength across the board when the sun is -- where the sun is out and conditions are right. Interestingly, in the first half -- in the first quarter, conditions were stronger, really more in the Northeast and the Midwest, as there was a decent bit of cloudiness and precipitation through the Southeast and over into Texas throughout the back of the last couple of weeks of the quarter. And that's, interestingly, kind of continue to bid into the second quarter. \n But we feel very optimistic about the southern markets. They always turn in spring. And, you know, it's beautiful in Nashville today. But very pleased with our spring performance as we've headed into Q2 here. And we see Q2 really very similar to Q1, just right down the middle of a fair way. We expect Q2 to be very similar to Q1. And with the one notable call-up that Kurt had around, we think it's the bottom quarter for us on disinflation as it relates to CUE. But otherwise, it's kind of a streak down the middle, very similar quarter to Q1. And as I said, we're very optimistic and pleased with our spring start. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Partners. \nSteven Forbes: I think you noted 34 million members in the program, which is surprised to the upside here a little bit, at least as per our expectations. So I was wondering if you could maybe expand on the changes you made to the program. Is there anything sort of notable in terms of acquisition, maybe converting those non-Neighbor's Club members into members or repeat or retention trends that changed how you're thinking about that program membership evolving over time? And in any way to sort of size up what the true opportunity is for the 20% of sales that are coming from non-members today? \nHarry Lawton: We're very pleased with the continued progress we're making in our Neighbor's Club platform. And clearly, our customers are engaging in it and using it, finding value in it and it's a key retention driver and behavior driver for our business. And it's certainly become an integral part of how we go to market and a key area of competitive advantage for us. \n This quarter, we were pleased with the number of customers that we added to the Neighbor's Club platform. I called out that we had new customer growth in the quarter. And that was, new customers are a key driver to Neighbor's Club program growth. We're very pleased to have a positive new customer counts in the quarter. \n The second thing I'll call out as to your point, we made adjustments to our membership program to allow for a lower dollar increments to be redeemed in terms of points, both $2 and $5. We also modified our tier structure a bit to allow people to earn more dollars sooner. And the entire goal of that was to drive that opening tier and that behavior to get them more engaged as we talked about on these calls over the last 2 or 3 years, the best performance we've seen has been in our Preferred Plus tier. Second best performance had been in our Preferred tier. And our basic Neighbor's Club tier was really where we wanted to regalvanize that group, reenergize that group. And the changes we made, we saw a significant response to, and we're very pleased. And we've got a number of things on the horizon that will continue to help us grow that program. \n As we called out at the beginning of the year, we've got a Heroes program that we'll be rolling out towards the end of the second quarter or beginning of the third quarter, right around July 4 time frame. We'll share more about those details on our next call, but that's a lot -- that's going to allow us to embrace another set of customers that we have, provide them incremental value, and we're excited about that. We've gotten great feedback from the customers that we've tested that with. \n And we're also in the process of implementing a customer data platform that's going to allow us to significantly improve our personalization and that's time for implementation in the back end -- back half of the year. And that's going to allow us to just take our personalization, capabilities and our targeting capabilities to the next level, in which we already do an excellent job. I'd say market-leading job on that, but this just keeps the improvement there. \n So great performance in Neighbor's Club in the quarter, new features being launched already that are going to keep driving that. And then we've got a number of new things on the horizon. And as I said, this is a distinct part of Tractor Supply and an area of competitive advantage for us. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citigroup. \nSteven Zaccone: I wanted to ask on gross margin. So given the guidance for the second quarter that it should be similar in terms of expansion. Can you just talk through the back half of the year because you start to face some tougher comparisons. Just talk through some of the expectations in the back half? \nKurt Barton: Yes, Steven, this is Kurt. The gross margin drivers are very similar throughout the year, but yet, as I mentioned in some of my remarks, it has a bit of a difference in impact by quarter. So our biggest opportunity and biggest growth driver in gross margin will be, throughout the year, our transportation and freight. And in transportation and freight, it's both transitory or rate-related, where we are coming off of those higher costs, particularly in the ocean freight, but also the more sustainable is the structural where the new improvements in the supply chain, the distribution centers are driving down our stem miles. And even as we open up our tenth distribution center, we'll reoptimize the lanes and reduce stem miles, be able to optimize by finding the lowest better rates, and that happened with our Navarre, Ohio DC last year. \n So those -- that will be the biggest driver. We'll start to lap in Q3, and heavily in Q4, some of the rate-related benefits. So it will begin to moderate on that aspect. But then on the other aspect of that is our cost management on our products. And there's really been a very disciplined strategic approach towards that, that began last year, but really, we started to see the benefit modestly in Q4. And our merchants and our vendors really partner together to drive down some of that cost. \n And we're actually even creating some of that AUR deflation so that in our CUE categories, our key drivers, we're able to offer the best value and even better gross margin rate. And that's some of what the pressure that I mentioned on AUR is that we feel very confident that we're bringing the best prices in our categories, regardless of competition, and that's what's helping to really gain the market share. So for the back half of the year, transportation, cost management and lower cost drivers will contribute. \n And then in the second half, the third item that will begin will be the supply chain benefits from the new distribution center. As the transportation costs are the highest one, that's why we've said the second half may be a slightly lower gross margin growth in the first half as we start to cycle it. But it's really been the main 3 things that will benefit throughout the year, but just beginning to less of a benefit on the transportation side in the second half. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Can you give us a sense for how the pet food category has been performing as of late? Have you been surprised that there's been general softness in these trends? And how has Tractor Supply's market share compared this quarter to the last couple of quarters, especially as it seems like the company has been taking more aggressive steps whether it's price investments, kinks to the loyalty program. \n And then finally, there's been a lot of parsing of your words on quarter-to-date trends. Can you give us an explicit indication of what's been happening quarter-to-date, so we can understand if you have to see an acceleration from here in order to get to that down the fairway commentary about the second quarter? \nHarry Lawton: Michael, I'll comment first on pet. First off, I'll just step back on pet and say it's an incredibly attractive market. It's one that outperformed kind of the broader retail market for decades. It's been a long-term source of growth for us. And I think that the slowdown in that industry this year has been well documented, with that slowdown being driven really by 2 macro drivers. The first is moderation in pet ownership. And the second is stagnant pricing, right? That's an industry that's historically been able to claw 2 or 3 points of price increase every year, given the substantial price increases that have occurred in that category over the last 2 years, basically, that category is flat in pricing for the year.\n So you've got some moderation in the category just for this year. We have an incredibly distinct value proposition in that category. Our value proposition includes, I think, importantly, the co-mingling of purchases with animal feed. 88% of our customers have animals and pets. The vast majority has both. So they appreciate being able to shop for both their animal and pet food at the same time. We complement that key kind of portfolio advantage obviously, with customer service, with a pet-friendly environment now having over 900 pet washes, which by the way, we see nearly 50,000 pets a week in our stores, with pet washes, pet clinics, et cetera. And that's true, just animals in our store. \n So we have a very distinct value proposition. We had all -- kind of publicly available brands, the international brands, but we also have 2 very leading private label brands. We cover the range of assortments. So incredible value proposition there, one that's distinct and I think in particular one that really holds up well in this market, given the various competitive dynamics that are going on, and as I said, but I want to reinforce, we are absolutely still taking share in that category, albeit at a lower growth rate because of the moderation in the category, but we are absolutely still taking share in that category, and we're only doing things to reinvest and lean in further to continue to capture that share. And as we look forward, we fully expect that pet will continue to be a long-term growth category for us and a driver of our overall growth. \n As it relates to Q2, as I said, we expect it to be another just straight down the fairway quarter for us. We don't need meaningful acceleration to use your words to deliver that performance for the quarter. One of the things I already highlighted is that the last quarter of real material disinflation, particularly in animal feeds. So it would be great to have that behind us and our outlook takes that into consideration. And if anything, I think there could be some modest upside as we look ahead, if you look at our quarterly comps last year, we had mid-single-digit comps in the month of April and May and then basically dropped off to a flat comp in the month of June. \n We can all recall June last year, it went immediately hot and you had the Canadian forest fires. Our outlook does not count on that performance improvement, but it's an opportunity should we get the right conditions for that month. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. \nScot Ciccarelli: I know it's still a, somewhat, limited data set, but you talked about seeing good results from your Garden Centers where spring has broken. I know you guys have previously provided a framework for what you expect to happen. But can you provide any kind of real-time updates in terms of what you're seeing on actual results? \nHarry Lawton: Two things on that. So we've gotten so much better at sorting our Garden Centers, staffing our Garden Centers, putting technology at play to drive our Garden Centers would encourage everyone on the call, if you hadn't had a chance to go visit one of our Garden Centers in the spring to do so. We've got things this year like our Plant of the Month, as I mentioned on the call, which are Knockout Roses right now. We're deploying our Tractor Vision software into all the Garden Center stores to optimize and improve customer service. Our grower network now that we're in year 3 in many of these stores are now really lined up to produce tailored product for us. And we're seeing those results in our live goods sales broadly across our -- the country [ for us ], even in areas where conditions have been ideal, we're seeing good results there. .\n The team is doing things like, for Easter this year, for the first time, we brought any kind of in and out. We bought over 100,000 bulbs for Easter with a real nice packaging around and blew those things down. It just gives us even more confidence that we can execute in those sorts of ways. And so very pleased with our live goods and our Garden Center performance. \n In addition to the live goods piece, which was about half of the lift that we're looking for. We also, this year, have gotten much better at what goes outside in our, like, Garden Centers versus what goes inside, you'll see all of our pots assortment out there this year. You'll see organic soils closely, cross-merchandise besides our fruit and vegetables this year. You'll see soil and mulches lined up in our side lots to be able to facilitate drive-through and load up there. \n So we really got those things prime this year. And then as we look towards the back half, this year, you'll see us have much more expansive programs and things like harvest, and that's really blowing that out this year with mums pumpkin, a harvest product, Halloween product building a real kind of harvest destination in our Garden Centers. \n And then similarly, you'll see Winter Wonderland really brought to life this year like we've not yet done for Christmas. So really excited about our Garden Center performance in the current spring period, but also as we look forward to the plans that we have, the team is doing an excellent job across all functions, really lining us up like -- as an example, on that Easter program, we shipped that to our DCs. It was the first time we ran plants through our DC. So a lot of learnings and a lot of continued execution there. \nScot Ciccarelli: Is there a way to quantify the comp lift, though, Hal? \nHarry Lawton: Yes. So as we exit Q2, we'll have a much better sense of that, as you all will certainly recall, our -- over the last year, we said our Garden Centers were not performing at our expectations, because of the suboptimal spring conditions that we operated in last year, but that we had high expectations for this year, noted it is the year of the Garden Center, we're performing at those expectations. But again, 6, 7 weeks into spring with another 6, 7, 8 strong weeks to go. So more to come on that. But I think the short answer, I would say is they're performing at our expectations kind of season-to-date. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. \nPeter Benedict: Just curious, I believe the Orscheln stores are earning the comp base in the second quarter. Just curious how we should think about that? Anything that those stores are cycling from a year ago standpoint that we need to think about? And kind of related to that or maybe a little unrelated, I was curious if Seth would talk a little more about some of the merchandising, innovation, newness that's in the store and maybe what he's most excited about as we look out over the balance of the year? \nKurt Barton: Yes, Peter, this is Kurt. I'll start with your first part of your question and then hand it over to Seth to address the back end part of it. Orscheln is running right in line with our expectation. The first quarter, for instance, is still lapping a lot of the liquidation in Orscheln. And then in second quarter, as we transition, you begin to get outside of a lot of that liquidation. So as we converted into our point of sale, it's somewhat in line with the time frame of having all of the Tractor Supply inventory in the Tractor Supply system. So we begin to lap a more normal time frame, particularly in the back half of the year. \n The Orscheln stores are running in line with a lot of our Midwest performance. We're pleased with Orscheln. Again, as we said when we made the acquisition, such a great value proposition opportunity for us, and it's playing out well in that. Some of the things that we've done, we've got 81 stores that were sized very differently. We've been able to rightsize and put many of the stores right in line with the Tractor Supply, 15.5 square foot. We've got some larger ones that allow us to do some test in those. But for the bulk over the period of the last 12 months, we've been [indiscernible] go in rebrand, put the fusion in there and make sure that it fits the best Tractor Supply streamlined, efficient shopping experience there. The team is engaging and learning a lot of the Tractor, the optimized Tractor process. \n So across the board, very pleased with that. And Seth can be able to talk a little bit about some of the other aspects on the merchandising side with Orscheln. \nSeth Estep: Thanks, Peter, for the question. So I would just say, if we look out to the back half, I'd speak a little bit more broadly even outside of Orscheln, and even go back to kind of last quarter's call and how really talked about this being the most innovation that we've seen in our stores since the start of the pandemic with all the reset activity, newness, partnership with our supplier base, how their supply chains are kind of back to normal levels. \n A couple of things that I would highlight that we're really excited about. First, I would just say, we talked about the strength in big ticket right now and Hal talked a minute ago about Tractor and riders. I will tell you that exclusive lineup that we have, like in the Toro, Havoc is performing very well. We see that innovation really responding, again, a product built for our life out here. Some things that we don't speak much about when we think about garden itself. Like we just launched a comprehensive assortment of Groundwork soils and our exclusive brands that have been very strong. We just launched Weber. Very pleased with that start and how that's going. \n And then if you go to the back half, I would just say, we mentioned in the prepared remarks, some of the newness coming in pet, but even things like [ Iconic Classics ] where we'll be the first brick-and-mortar here in the U.S. launching [ Iconic Classics ]. Real Mesa, which has been a strong new digital brand, will be the first brick-and-mortar launching Real Mesa in pet food, but it's really targeted to kind of our consumer in that approach. And then just the Garden Centers themselves and all the new activity that we have going throughout the course of the year and just lean into those activities and then [indiscernible]. We think about Orscheln Farm & Home, like some of the learnings that we're getting out of outdoor [indiscernible], you'll see us launch new programs there midyear, getting really towards that kind of hunting customer, and we believe that those will be some categories that we can take across the Tractor Supply stores from a regional perspective and some localization perspective to really drive some business. \n So again, just reiterate this kind of from 2024, lot of new innovation, a lot of newness and some most newness we've had over the past few years. \nMary Pilkington: We've have maybe one more question just so that we're sure we end at the top of the [ board ] hour. \nOperator: Final question comes from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. \nPeter Keith: Nice results, by the way. So I wanted to kind of just ask around the broader economy. Housing remains quite sluggish. So how do you see the economic backdrop in general for the rural economies where you guys operate versus maybe the broader U.S. economy. We've been housing into that discussion would be helpful as well. I guess is rural outperforming? Or do you think performing more in line with the broader U.S.? \nHarry Lawton: Peter, thanks for the question. To start by the highest level, rural is very -- I think rural America is doing very well right now. We see our highest performance across our store base in rural America right now. If you look at the national statistics, you see net urban migration out -- kind of more migration coming out of cities than in. And you see that migration going to rural America. I think there's a variety of drivers for that, but that trend benefits us. \n Stepping back, as we acknowledged on our earnings call last quarter, we acknowledge 2024 would be a non-algo for us and that we look forward to getting back to our long-term algorithm as kind of economic conditions became more neutral for us. Most importantly, the two economic conditions that were most impacting us with the transition from goods to services in the context of PCE spend and the notion -- and kind of disinflation. Those two trends are playing out as we expected at the beginning of the year. \n As I commented, we're 100 basis points away from goods to services being at its pre-COVID levels. We've already traveled almost 400 basis points on that journey. So unclear where it will obviously stop, but you would say we're the vast majority of the way along on that journey. Disinflation, we've called out that. Q2 will be our bottom on that. And so we feel really good about that as well and that that's near behind us. And so the two major conditions that are affecting our business, you can see light at the end of the tunnel. \n As it relates to housing more broadly, as we called out, last quarter, we really don't see housing as a primary driver of our business. And I know there's been some conversation around [ hire ] for longer [ run rate ], and the impact that might have on the housing market and then any delay in how 2025 results may occur. And obviously, talking about 2025 results right now is very premature for us. But we don't see the [ hire ] for longer kind of notion impacting our business anywhere near to the degree that it impacts those that are very housing sensitive. Thanks, Peter, for the question. \nMary Pilkington: All right, everyone, that will wrap up our call today. I'm around and we're available for calls. And if you need anything, please don't hesitate to reach out, and we look forward to talking to you at the end of our second quarter. So thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Harry Lawton",
            "content": "Thank you, Mary Winn, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2024 is off to a solid start with first quarter results in line with our expectations. I would like to thank the Tractor Supply team for their ongoing commitment to each other and our customers. As evidenced by our continuation of record high customer satisfaction scores, the team is always there for our customers as the dependable supplier [ for ] life out here. \n Before I get into our review of the first quarter's results, I want to take a moment to share what we're seeing in the macroeconomic environment and its impact on our business. In our view, the U.S. economy remains strong. Unemployment continues at a low level, wages are growing at a steady clip. In spite of sticky inflation, consumer spending remains strong, and mobility has slowed as a consequence of a challenging housing market, with that said, we continue to see outsized population growth in rural markets. \n As it relates to consumer spending, the shift of spending from goods to services continues to be a headwind for our business. In the first 2 months of the calendar year, consumer services spending growth was nearly 7%, whereas consumer spending on goods growth was less than 1%. As a result, the mix of goods as a share of PCE are now only 100 basis points above their pre-COVID average. This progressive shift is in line with our expectations as we enter the year. \n Also, as expected, inflation has remained sticky by outsized increases in shelter, food, away from home, energy and insurance. As a consequence, consumers continue to be anxious about inflation, particularly the lower-income consumer. \n In the first quarter, our upper income consumer over-indexed in big ticket categories and recreational purchases compared to our lower income consumer, who is prioritizing their spend on needs. \n In our needs-based, consumable, usable and edible categories, we see very little difference in our performance by income cohort. Once again, our business is proving to be durable, stable and very consistent. \n Broadly speaking, in our economy, goods continue to disinflate and are generally running low single digits with some categories having moderate deflation. With the first quarter behind Tractor Supply, we have now successfully lapped our 2 most challenging compares due to the inflationary benefits that we had over the last 18 months that have substantially benefited our top line. We do not see additional downward deflationary pressures in the current environment. The transition from an inflationary cycle to a disinflationary cycle is playing out as we anticipated. \n In spite of a very challenging housing market, we continue to see positive migration trends to our markets. While rural migration trends have moderated from the recent peaks, rural America again gained population in 2023. This marks the fourth consecutive year of growth in rural population. It is our view that the sense of community found in our markets, and perhaps more importantly, the ability to secure a piece of property at a reasonable price has ensured the rural migration trend is one that's here to stay for the time being. \n So with that, let's now turn to a review of the business for the first quarter. We grew net sales by 2.9%, with comparable store sales up 1.1% and diluted earnings per share up 10.9% to $1.83. Our comparable store sales growth was driven by transaction growth of 1.3% offset by a small decline in average ticket of 0.2%. These results were very much in line with our expectations that we shared with you as we started the quarter and year. \n Overall, our customer base remains healthy and highly engaged. Total customer count grew mid-single digits with growth in active, new and reactivated customers as we invested in our Neighbor's Club program and customer service. \n Neighbor's Club continues to represent the majority of our sales. During the quarter, we significantly enhanced our Neighbor's Club offering. As our points-based program enters its fourth year, it was appropriate for us to refresh our offering based on insights and customer feedback. The changes we made were all implemented with the goal to have customers receive rewards faster and to lower the spending required for tier qualifications. Our Neighbor's Club members have responded positively to these changes. For example, the new rewards redemption at a $2 and $5 level down from $10 is working as we designed and is driving greater customer engagement and trips for this cohort. The initial response from our customers on the collective changes has been very positive, and we're seeing increased spending across the board. \n In addition, we continue to improve relevancy to our members through more personalized offers and tailored incentives and experiences based on their interest and shopping patterns. With more than 34 million members, Neighbor's Club should continue to build our customers' loyalty and affinity for Tractor Supply as we go forward. \n Our customer service scores continue to run at all-time highs. This is an area where we have strategically invested in training, compensation, benefits, tools and technology to help elevate our customer service. This has garnered the attention of our customers, and I believe, helps strengthen our scores. \n The strength of our portfolio products and shopping missions was evident very much so in the first quarter. We had robust growth in our seasonal categories. Our consumable, usable and edible products performed in line with our chain average. Our performance this quarter was on top of the robust growth we've experienced over the last 4 years as our CUE customer trends remain strong as we continue to gain market share. Our customers were certainly in the mindset to prepare for spring as we had strong big ticket growth in the mid-single digits and strength in other early spring preparedness categories. Categories that performed below our comp sales growth were more in our discretionary businesses such as clothing and gifts and truck tool and hardware. \n In our pet food and livestock categories, we continue to grow our market share. In pet food, we've seen growth moderate as the category disinflates and pet ownership moderates. Our customers' shopping trip in this category is highly differentiated, so we offer a broad assortment from value to super premium across private and exclusive brands in a pet-friendly environment, which now includes about 900 Pet Wash locations. Additionally, pet owners benefit from the one-stop shop convenience of our lifestyle retail format, in particular, from the cross purchasing synergy with animal and livestock feed. \n In animal and livestock feed, we offer exclusive brands like DuMORs and Producer's Pride, along with the national brands from Purina, Cargill, Triple Crown and more. We continue to innovate across our key categories of equine, cattle and poultry in trends like organic and snack. And we bring a unique retail experience in these categories with events like our annual spring Chick Days. This year, the event is on track to have strong results. We continue to see growth from existing customers who are building out and adding to their flock. Organic feed and our assortment of premium breeds continue to lead the category and growth. \n Tractor Supply is the destination for backyard poultry. Today, nearly 2/3 of our backyard chicken owners consider them to be pets, and our customers over-index the poultry ownership with nearly one in five customers having chickens. \n Stepping back, we have a market share of about 20% in bagged livestock feed, and we continue to take share, and we are consistently outperforming the market across our 2 categories. After nearly 2 years of pressure on our big ticket comps, we were pleased to see big ticket categories turn positive in the quarter. We experienced broad-based strength across seasonal categories, including zero-turn tractors, recreational vehicles and outdoor power equipment. \n Our digital sales returned to double-digit growth in the quarter with increases in visits and an improved conversion rate. Nearly 80% of our orders were whether picked up in store or fulfilled by a store. Almost 20% of our sales came through our mobile app. The team made excellent feature update such as New Express Checkout feature and the addition of estimated delivery times, and these have helped increase our conversion rate. \n This year, we're opening our tenth and largest distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas. The start-up of the distribution center is right on schedule as shipping will begin during June. Once again, we'll be able to capitalize on the opportunity to realign the store servicing areas across the DC network to balance transportation costs and DC capacity while improving service levels to our stores. It is great for our DC network to have this new capacity to better position our inventory and better service our stores all the while allowing us to reduce our freight cost. \n Our supply chain investments over the last 4 years have provided us with material structural gross margin benefit from the reduction in stem miles. \n We opened 17 new Tractor Supply stores and 4 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in the quarter. As I shared last quarter, 2024 will be the year of the Garden Center. We're leveraging the change of seasons across the store front as the year shifts to spring. The team has come out of the gate strong to ensure we have a differentiated assortment and availability in time for the planting season. We now have nearly 500 Garden Centers across the chain. Based on our early read of spring, our expectation is that with more variety than ever and a grower network to support our Garden Centers, we should see the customer respond positively this multiyear growth driver. \n At Tractor Supply, we're grounded in our purpose as a company to serve life out here and our deep-rooted commitment to our mission and values. We believe in finding meaningful ways to support our core mission. Earlier this week, we issued our fifth annual stewards of Life Out Here Tear Sheet that highlights our Stewardship priorities and progress. \n For all of us at Tractor Supply, we are highly committed to preserving life out here for future generations. We are proud to share our progress towards our ambitious goals. \n In summary, we're relatively pleased with our start to the year. Customer trends are in line with our expectations. The team is executing very well. We're controlling our controllables and making progress on our Life Out Here strategy. With the majority of the year remaining, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal 2024. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kurt. Thanks, Kurt. Tractor Supply has a proven business model that has been resilient over many business cycles. As a company, we have numerous levers to continue to gain market share and numerous levers to effectively control expenses. Our Life Out Here strategic priorities are on track and delivering on our expectations. We continue to see fantastic opportunities for growth ahead. In store and online, we're ready for the spring and summer season. Customers are responding positively to our new product assortments from Weber, Toro, YETI and more. We have several product test and learn initiatives in store and online, like Martha Stewart and Eddie Bauer. \n Across companion animal, we're adding to our assortment with new brands like ACANA, Real Mesa and Native Pet and expanding our offerings across brands like Purina Pro Plan, SPORTMiX and Hill's Science Diet. Our Garden Centers are set to help our customers prepare for their hobbies of gardening, especially with a focus on vegetables and fruit trees and just simply enjoying their property. \n Across the seasons, we have new product offerings specific to the Garden Center. We're currently showcasing our roses, Plant of the Month, and are prepared with hanging baskets for Mother's Day. As we move into the second half of the year, we will shift to Fall Harvest and Halloween and then to Christmas with live goods and decor. Overall, this is a great way for us to track new customers and soften the front of our store. \n Across the store, we have a tremendous amount of newness for our customers' passions and lifestyles. We also continue to invest in customer service at our stores. In addition to our Hey GURA app, to turbocharge service our store team members provide to our customers, we are leveraging AI in our stores and Garden Centers through our Tractor Vision, which uses cameras and computer vision technology to provide data to deploy alerts that help our team members efficiently and effectively staff the store. \n One scenario where this is incredibly beneficial is when customer traffic is building up at our registers, Tractor Vision will alert team members through their ERP that another team member needs to come up to open another register. We're also leveraging Tractor Vision to monitor our front apron of the store for dwell time. This allows for a team member to better serve our customers particularly in categories like outdoor riding lawn mowers. These are the types of investments and capabilities that separate us from our farm and ranch competition and really make us a leader in retail. \n It's an exciting time at Tractor Supply. My thanks and appreciation goes out to the team for their dedication to delivering our mission and values every day. And now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Seth, thanks for the question. We were very pleased with our big ticket performance in Q1. I'll highlight 2 trends and then provide some examples in the context of each of those. The first one I'll highlight was in January, where we had the nice cold weather come through the country. And as a consequence of that, had some nice big ticket sales that go along with that as we often do, whether that's things like snow throwers or log splitters. And to your point, the cutoff that we use for big ticket is $350 price point. .\n But then the other comment I'll make is in the month of March, particularly the last couple of weeks where we start to see that spring ramp occur, we saw a nice lift in big ticket over those weeks. And we did highlight in the prepared remarks in categories like riding lawn mowers, outdoor power, we saw strong positive comps in those categories in those weeks. As we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we saw an over penetration in those purchases of higher income consumers versus lower income consumers.  As we talked about, just kind of buying a bit more towards need for the lower income consumers. \n The last thing I'll add is that the trend on big ticket that we saw in March for spring sales has continued into Q2. Simeon. I'll reiterate a couple of the comments that I have on the previous question, just to tee up the discussion. So on big ticket, as it relates to spring, we saw nice big ticket ramp in absolute dollars and comps as we exited Q1 and those trends have continued into Q2, and we're very pleased with our big ticket spring sales. As we look at a multiyear history on that, if you recall, last year, we commented that our big ticket categories were back to 2019 levels. So I would articulate the growth that we're seeing now is kind of consistent and growth that would be on top of a normal -- go back to 2019 trend. So we feel like it's a healthy growth, compounding growth and very much in the kind of stable on top of 2019 levels. \n The final thing I'll add is we called out numerous times, the drought conditions and the heat conditions that occurred in a number of our key markets the last 2 years, whether that's the Midwest or Texas, given the cooler weather that we've had and the nice precipitation we've had, grass is green across the country right now. And we all just returned from our executive walks across the whole country last week, and we all came back and kind of talked about the same thing. You've got really green grass, and it's growing well and the temperatures are staying cool. So the conditions are right for big ticket sales as well for us. But we're very pleased with the big ticket activity, strong exit in Q1 and continuing that pace into Q2, healthy on top of 2019 and the conditions are favorable for it as well this year. Seth, good morning. As it relates to inflation, the -- probably the most important point to take away from us is that we've lapped our 2 most difficult quarters as it relates to comping on top of inflation. As we remarked at the end of our Q4 call, we were lapping 11% inflation from Q3 of 2022. And then we're lapping substantial inflation from last year in Q1 of 2023. So as we look ahead, we have significantly less lapping issues. \n And, in particular, as it relates to things like animal feed, as we get towards the end of Q2, we really start to get back to a more normalized environment. And by the way, by the time we get to mid-Q3, we're in -- we basically lapped it all. So I feel really good as we look forward that we're kind of getting close to hitting the bottom on disinflation and starting to be back as we get towards the end of the year towards a more normal outlook.  \n We're not seeing anything different in our margin expectations, pricing expectations, cost to good expectations that we saw at the beginning of the year. As we've mentioned, we worked closely with our vendor partners middle of last year to pull back on a lot of the cost increases we've seen. That's been successful. You see that in our gross margin rate results. \n At the same time, we're appropriately moderated on prices. Our pricing has never been sharper in the industry. We monitor that very closely, and we've got multi, multiyear trends on that, never been sharper than we had in Q1 and coming into Q2. And we don't see anything on the horizon that would change kind of our retail price, cost of goods outlook. We did just complete all of our container, kind of shipping negotiations. Those are basically coming in kind of flat to last year. So there's not -- we don't see headwind in the future there. \n And I don't think that there's been a significant amount of oil, fuel kind of cost type increases to impact certainly -- first cost type at this point at all. And the freight market, given the status of the freight market and the overcapacity that there is, you had to start to see prices come up to reflect fuel in that area as well. So pretty stable, no real change to our outlook, either on this call or versus our last call. Yes. Chris, we think where the sun has been out and conditions have been right, we've been very pleased with spring. Our big ticket sales are strong, our Live Goods are selling well. Our Garden Centers are performing, categories like grilling, other categories like fertilizer and grass seed, we're seeing real strength across the board when the sun is -- where the sun is out and conditions are right. Interestingly, in the first half -- in the first quarter, conditions were stronger, really more in the Northeast and the Midwest, as there was a decent bit of cloudiness and precipitation through the Southeast and over into Texas throughout the back of the last couple of weeks of the quarter. And that's, interestingly, kind of continue to bid into the second quarter. \n But we feel very optimistic about the southern markets. They always turn in spring. And, you know, it's beautiful in Nashville today. But very pleased with our spring performance as we've headed into Q2 here. And we see Q2 really very similar to Q1, just right down the middle of a fair way. We expect Q2 to be very similar to Q1. And with the one notable call-up that Kurt had around, we think it's the bottom quarter for us on disinflation as it relates to CUE. But otherwise, it's kind of a streak down the middle, very similar quarter to Q1. And as I said, we're very optimistic and pleased with our spring start. We're very pleased with the continued progress we're making in our Neighbor's Club platform. And clearly, our customers are engaging in it and using it, finding value in it and it's a key retention driver and behavior driver for our business. And it's certainly become an integral part of how we go to market and a key area of competitive advantage for us. \n This quarter, we were pleased with the number of customers that we added to the Neighbor's Club platform. I called out that we had new customer growth in the quarter. And that was, new customers are a key driver to Neighbor's Club program growth. We're very pleased to have a positive new customer counts in the quarter. \n The second thing I'll call out as to your point, we made adjustments to our membership program to allow for a lower dollar increments to be redeemed in terms of points, both $2 and $5. We also modified our tier structure a bit to allow people to earn more dollars sooner. And the entire goal of that was to drive that opening tier and that behavior to get them more engaged as we talked about on these calls over the last 2 or 3 years, the best performance we've seen has been in our Preferred Plus tier. Second best performance had been in our Preferred tier. And our basic Neighbor's Club tier was really where we wanted to regalvanize that group, reenergize that group. And the changes we made, we saw a significant response to, and we're very pleased. And we've got a number of things on the horizon that will continue to help us grow that program. \n As we called out at the beginning of the year, we've got a Heroes program that we'll be rolling out towards the end of the second quarter or beginning of the third quarter, right around July 4 time frame. We'll share more about those details on our next call, but that's a lot -- that's going to allow us to embrace another set of customers that we have, provide them incremental value, and we're excited about that. We've gotten great feedback from the customers that we've tested that with. \n And we're also in the process of implementing a customer data platform that's going to allow us to significantly improve our personalization and that's time for implementation in the back end -- back half of the year. And that's going to allow us to just take our personalization, capabilities and our targeting capabilities to the next level, in which we already do an excellent job. I'd say market-leading job on that, but this just keeps the improvement there. \n So great performance in Neighbor's Club in the quarter, new features being launched already that are going to keep driving that. And then we've got a number of new things on the horizon. And as I said, this is a distinct part of Tractor Supply and an area of competitive advantage for us. Michael, I'll comment first on pet. First off, I'll just step back on pet and say it's an incredibly attractive market. It's one that outperformed kind of the broader retail market for decades. It's been a long-term source of growth for us. And I think that the slowdown in that industry this year has been well documented, with that slowdown being driven really by 2 macro drivers. The first is moderation in pet ownership. And the second is stagnant pricing, right? That's an industry that's historically been able to claw 2 or 3 points of price increase every year, given the substantial price increases that have occurred in that category over the last 2 years, basically, that category is flat in pricing for the year.\n So you've got some moderation in the category just for this year. We have an incredibly distinct value proposition in that category. Our value proposition includes, I think, importantly, the co-mingling of purchases with animal feed. 88% of our customers have animals and pets. The vast majority has both. So they appreciate being able to shop for both their animal and pet food at the same time. We complement that key kind of portfolio advantage obviously, with customer service, with a pet-friendly environment now having over 900 pet washes, which by the way, we see nearly 50,000 pets a week in our stores, with pet washes, pet clinics, et cetera. And that's true, just animals in our store. \n So we have a very distinct value proposition. We had all -- kind of publicly available brands, the international brands, but we also have 2 very leading private label brands. We cover the range of assortments. So incredible value proposition there, one that's distinct and I think in particular one that really holds up well in this market, given the various competitive dynamics that are going on, and as I said, but I want to reinforce, we are absolutely still taking share in that category, albeit at a lower growth rate because of the moderation in the category, but we are absolutely still taking share in that category, and we're only doing things to reinvest and lean in further to continue to capture that share. And as we look forward, we fully expect that pet will continue to be a long-term growth category for us and a driver of our overall growth. \n As it relates to Q2, as I said, we expect it to be another just straight down the fairway quarter for us. We don't need meaningful acceleration to use your words to deliver that performance for the quarter. One of the things I already highlighted is that the last quarter of real material disinflation, particularly in animal feeds. So it would be great to have that behind us and our outlook takes that into consideration. And if anything, I think there could be some modest upside as we look ahead, if you look at our quarterly comps last year, we had mid-single-digit comps in the month of April and May and then basically dropped off to a flat comp in the month of June. \n We can all recall June last year, it went immediately hot and you had the Canadian forest fires. Our outlook does not count on that performance improvement, but it's an opportunity should we get the right conditions for that month. Two things on that. So we've gotten so much better at sorting our Garden Centers, staffing our Garden Centers, putting technology at play to drive our Garden Centers would encourage everyone on the call, if you hadn't had a chance to go visit one of our Garden Centers in the spring to do so. We've got things this year like our Plant of the Month, as I mentioned on the call, which are Knockout Roses right now. We're deploying our Tractor Vision software into all the Garden Center stores to optimize and improve customer service. Our grower network now that we're in year 3 in many of these stores are now really lined up to produce tailored product for us. And we're seeing those results in our live goods sales broadly across our -- the country [ for us ], even in areas where conditions have been ideal, we're seeing good results there. .\n The team is doing things like, for Easter this year, for the first time, we brought any kind of in and out. We bought over 100,000 bulbs for Easter with a real nice packaging around and blew those things down. It just gives us even more confidence that we can execute in those sorts of ways. And so very pleased with our live goods and our Garden Center performance. \n In addition to the live goods piece, which was about half of the lift that we're looking for. We also, this year, have gotten much better at what goes outside in our, like, Garden Centers versus what goes inside, you'll see all of our pots assortment out there this year. You'll see organic soils closely, cross-merchandise besides our fruit and vegetables this year. You'll see soil and mulches lined up in our side lots to be able to facilitate drive-through and load up there. \n So we really got those things prime this year. And then as we look towards the back half, this year, you'll see us have much more expansive programs and things like harvest, and that's really blowing that out this year with mums pumpkin, a harvest product, Halloween product building a real kind of harvest destination in our Garden Centers. \n And then similarly, you'll see Winter Wonderland really brought to life this year like we've not yet done for Christmas. So really excited about our Garden Center performance in the current spring period, but also as we look forward to the plans that we have, the team is doing an excellent job across all functions, really lining us up like -- as an example, on that Easter program, we shipped that to our DCs. It was the first time we ran plants through our DC. So a lot of learnings and a lot of continued execution there. Yes. So as we exit Q2, we'll have a much better sense of that, as you all will certainly recall, our -- over the last year, we said our Garden Centers were not performing at our expectations, because of the suboptimal spring conditions that we operated in last year, but that we had high expectations for this year, noted it is the year of the Garden Center, we're performing at those expectations. But again, 6, 7 weeks into spring with another 6, 7, 8 strong weeks to go. So more to come on that. But I think the short answer, I would say is they're performing at our expectations kind of season-to-date. Peter, thanks for the question. To start by the highest level, rural is very -- I think rural America is doing very well right now. We see our highest performance across our store base in rural America right now. If you look at the national statistics, you see net urban migration out -- kind of more migration coming out of cities than in. And you see that migration going to rural America. I think there's a variety of drivers for that, but that trend benefits us. \n Stepping back, as we acknowledged on our earnings call last quarter, we acknowledge 2024 would be a non-algo for us and that we look forward to getting back to our long-term algorithm as kind of economic conditions became more neutral for us. Most importantly, the two economic conditions that were most impacting us with the transition from goods to services in the context of PCE spend and the notion -- and kind of disinflation. Those two trends are playing out as we expected at the beginning of the year. \n As I commented, we're 100 basis points away from goods to services being at its pre-COVID levels. We've already traveled almost 400 basis points on that journey. So unclear where it will obviously stop, but you would say we're the vast majority of the way along on that journey. Disinflation, we've called out that. Q2 will be our bottom on that. And so we feel really good about that as well and that that's near behind us. And so the two major conditions that are affecting our business, you can see light at the end of the tunnel. \n As it relates to housing more broadly, as we called out, last quarter, we really don't see housing as a primary driver of our business. And I know there's been some conversation around [ hire ] for longer [ run rate ], and the impact that might have on the housing market and then any delay in how 2025 results may occur. And obviously, talking about 2025 results right now is very premature for us. But we don't see the [ hire ] for longer kind of notion impacting our business anywhere near to the degree that it impacts those that are very housing sensitive. Thanks, Peter, for the question."

            "name": "Kurt Barton",
            "content": "Thank you, Hal, and hello to everyone on the call. Let me start by building on to Hal's comments about the quarter. Our first quarter performance was right down the middle when compared to our expectations on both the top line and the bottom line. Regarding the cadence of comp sales for the quarter, we started out with a very strong January as the month features some spans of brutal cold. \n While February was warmer than normal and relatively soft, the best way to view the winter season performance is to look at weather categories across January and February combined. And overall, we were pleased with our cold weather category performance. We comped positive in March in spite of a limited arrival of spring across our markets. Where this season had turned to spring, we were very pleased with how the business performed.\n All geographic regions performed in a tight band for the quarter. Average unit retail was impacted by modest product deflation of about 1% in line with our expectations. We're encouraged by the trends we are seeing in unit growth and the underlying share gains in categories where deflation has had an outsized impact to AUR. Our gross margin rate of 36% increased 50 basis points to last year. We were very pleased with these results, which were driven primarily by ongoing lower transportation costs, disciplined product cost management and the continued execution of our everyday low price strategy. \n We were able to strategically provide great value for our customers while maintaining our gross margin. We remain committed to being the everyday low-price leader in our markets. \n Our first quarter SG&A expense rate, including depreciation and amortization, increased 16 basis points to 28.2%. This increase in SG&A as a percent of net sales was primarily attributable to our planned growth investments, which included higher depreciation and amortization as well as the modest deleverage of our fixed cost given the level of comparable store sales growth. The leverage from our distribution center productivity gains did partially offset the loss of fixed cost leverage. Excluding depreciation and amortization, SG&A was essentially flat as a percent of sales. This was better performance than we anticipated entering the year as there were approximately $5 million of expenses that we had planned to occur in the first quarter that we now anticipate incurring in the second quarter. From my perspective, the team did a great job controlling the controllables. \n Altogether, operating income increased 7%, with operating margin expansion of 34 basis points. Net income increased 8.2% and diluted EPS increased 10.9% to $1.83. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares and paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $118.8 million, returning $236.2 million of capital to shareholders. We also increased our dividend by 7%, marking our 15th consecutive year of growing our dividend. \n Turning now to our balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $3.0 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing a modest decrease of about 4% in average inventory per store. Lower freight costs was a contributor to the decrease in inventory dollars. Excluding freight in Orscheln, our comp inventory was up modestly in dollar value and units. We are pleased with how we exited the winter season and the quality of our inventory as of the end of the first quarter. In our commitment to be the dependable supplier for our customers' lifestyle, we are at the highest in-stock levels since pre-COVID. With strong annualized cash flows and improved working capital, we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet with a leverage ratio of around 2x. \n As Hal mentioned, we are reiterating our guidance for 2024. We anticipate this year to be a continued story of ongoing share gains offset by macro headwinds. We continue to expect full year sales of $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion and project comparable store sales to be in the range of down 1% to a positive 1.5%. As we manage through the first half of the year, we expect to see second quarter comp sales in line with our full year outlook. Given the trends in our comp sales, our outlook assumes that strength in big ticket and seasonal will continue. We are planning for a modest AUR pressure on CUE with positive unit trends. \n Our expectation is that select discretionary categories will remain under pressure. For the second quarter, we expect gross margin expansion in line with the first quarter from continued supply chain efficiencies and benefits from effective cost management, partially offset by the mix impact of growth in big ticket, which runs below the chain average. \n We anticipate the gross margin expansion to be offset by SG&A deleverage from our planned investments, including the incremental cost for the opening of our new distribution center. \n As I mentioned earlier, there's approximately $5 million of shifting to the second quarter that we had initially anticipated in the first quarter, including staffing and training costs associated with the opening of the DC. As a result, we expect second quarter operating profit margin to be down slightly compared to prior year. \n As I shared when we initially provided guidance in February, there are a few factors that will impact operating margin in certain quarters. We anticipate the tailwinds of lower transportation costs to continue to benefit our results in the second quarter and begin to flatten year-over-year starting in Q3. \n In regards to SG&A, the second and third quarters will be pressured from the start-up costs for the new distribution center, while the supply chain benefits will not begin to be realized in gross margin until late in the third quarter. \n To sum it up, for the full year, we continue to guide toward net income of $1.06 billion to $1.13 billion and diluted earnings per share of $9.85 to $10.50. With the majority of the year still ahead of us, we believe these expectations are still appropriate. We continue to believe that the best way to look at our business is not by the quarters, but by the halves of the year. \n In this environment, what sets Tractor Supply apart is our ability to effectively manage the top line and bottom line while investing in our Life Out Here strategic growth drivers. And with that, I will turn the call back to Hal for some final remarks. Yes. And Seth, this is Kurt. Just to tie that back to our guidance. As we entered 2024, I have said that we could see and are planning for 2024 from an inflation, deflation, relatively neutral, plus or minus a point. And we expect as we're starting to lap some of those inflation quarters last year, Q2 may have a similar impact as we saw in Q1. But then if you were to play out the current environment today, it would really put us in an expectation for the year sort of that neutral standpoint. And we'll know more on how the back half looks after Q2, but still pretty much playing right in line with our guidance. Yes, Steven, this is Kurt. The gross margin drivers are very similar throughout the year, but yet, as I mentioned in some of my remarks, it has a bit of a difference in impact by quarter. So our biggest opportunity and biggest growth driver in gross margin will be, throughout the year, our transportation and freight. And in transportation and freight, it's both transitory or rate-related, where we are coming off of those higher costs, particularly in the ocean freight, but also the more sustainable is the structural where the new improvements in the supply chain, the distribution centers are driving down our stem miles. And even as we open up our tenth distribution center, we'll reoptimize the lanes and reduce stem miles, be able to optimize by finding the lowest better rates, and that happened with our Navarre, Ohio DC last year. \n So those -- that will be the biggest driver. We'll start to lap in Q3, and heavily in Q4, some of the rate-related benefits. So it will begin to moderate on that aspect. But then on the other aspect of that is our cost management on our products. And there's really been a very disciplined strategic approach towards that, that began last year, but really, we started to see the benefit modestly in Q4. And our merchants and our vendors really partner together to drive down some of that cost. \n And we're actually even creating some of that AUR deflation so that in our CUE categories, our key drivers, we're able to offer the best value and even better gross margin rate. And that's some of what the pressure that I mentioned on AUR is that we feel very confident that we're bringing the best prices in our categories, regardless of competition, and that's what's helping to really gain the market share. So for the back half of the year, transportation, cost management and lower cost drivers will contribute. \n And then in the second half, the third item that will begin will be the supply chain benefits from the new distribution center. As the transportation costs are the highest one, that's why we've said the second half may be a slightly lower gross margin growth in the first half as we start to cycle it. But it's really been the main 3 things that will benefit throughout the year, but just beginning to less of a benefit on the transportation side in the second half. Yes, Peter, this is Kurt. I'll start with your first part of your question and then hand it over to Seth to address the back end part of it. Orscheln is running right in line with our expectation. The first quarter, for instance, is still lapping a lot of the liquidation in Orscheln. And then in second quarter, as we transition, you begin to get outside of a lot of that liquidation. So as we converted into our point of sale, it's somewhat in line with the time frame of having all of the Tractor Supply inventory in the Tractor Supply system. So we begin to lap a more normal time frame, particularly in the back half of the year. \n The Orscheln stores are running in line with a lot of our Midwest performance. We're pleased with Orscheln. Again, as we said when we made the acquisition, such a great value proposition opportunity for us, and it's playing out well in that. Some of the things that we've done, we've got 81 stores that were sized very differently. We've been able to rightsize and put many of the stores right in line with the Tractor Supply, 15.5 square foot. We've got some larger ones that allow us to do some test in those. But for the bulk over the period of the last 12 months, we've been [indiscernible] go in rebrand, put the fusion in there and make sure that it fits the best Tractor Supply streamlined, efficient shopping experience there. The team is engaging and learning a lot of the Tractor, the optimized Tractor process. \n So across the board, very pleased with that. And Seth can be able to talk a little bit about some of the other aspects on the merchandising side with Orscheln."
